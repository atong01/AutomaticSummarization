'''Andrew Jackson''' (March 15, 1767&nbsp;– June 8, 1845) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|seventh]] [[President of the United States]] (1829–1837). He was born near the end of the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]], somewhere near the then-unmarked border between [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]], into a recently immigrated [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] farming family of relatively modest means. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] Jackson, whose family supported the revolutionary cause, acted as a courier. He was captured, at age 13, and mistreated by his British captors. He later became a lawyer. He was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], and then to the [[U.S. Senate]]. In 1801, Jackson was appointed colonel in the Tennessee militia, which became his political as well as military base. Jackson owned hundreds of slaves who worked on the [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|Hermitage plantation]] which he acquired in 1804. Jackson killed a man in a duel in 1806, over a matter of honor regarding his wife [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel]]. Jackson gained national fame through his role in the [[War of 1812]], most famously where he won a decisive victory over the main British invasion army at the [[Battle of New Orleans]]. Jackson's army was then sent to Florida where he deposed the small Spanish garrison. This led directly to [[Adams–Onís Treaty|the treaty]] which formally transferred Florida from Spain to the United States.

[[Election of 1824|Nominated for president in 1824]], Jackson narrowly lost to [[John Quincy Adams]]. Jackson's supporters then founded what became the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. [[Election of 1828|Nominated again in 1828]], Jackson crusaded against Adams and the "corrupt bargain" between Adams and Henry Clay he said cost him the 1824 election. Building on his base in the West and new support from Virginia and New York, he won by a landslide. The Adams campaigners called him and his wife [[Rachel Jackson]] "bigamists"; she died just after the election and he called the slanderers "murderers," swearing never to forgive them. His struggles with Congress were personified in his personal rivalry with [[Henry Clay]], whom Jackson deeply disliked, and who led the opposition (the emerging [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]). As president, he faced a threat of secession from [[South Carolina]] over the "[[Tariff of Abominations]]" which Congress had enacted under Adams. In contrast to several of his immediate successors, he denied the right of a state to secede from the union, or to nullify federal law. The [[Nullification Crisis]] was defused when the tariff was amended and Jackson [[Force Bill|threatened]] the use of military force if South Carolina (or any other state) attempted to secede.

Congress attempted to reauthorize the [[Second Bank of the United States]] several years before the expiration of its charter, which he opposed. He vetoed the renewal of its charter in 1832, and dismantled it by the time its charter expired in 1836. Jackson's presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the "[[spoils system]]" in American politics. Also, he supported, signed, and enforced the [[Indian Removal Act]], which relocated a number of native tribes to [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]). He faced and defeated Henry Clay in the [[United States presidential election, 1832|1832 Presidential Election]], and opposed Clay generally. Jackson supported his vice president [[Martin Van Buren]], who was elected president in 1836. He worked to bolster the Democratic Party and helped his friend [[James K. Polk]] win the 1844 presidential election.

==Early life and education==
Jackson was born on March 15, 1767. His parents were [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] colonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, [[Presbyterian]]s who had emigrated from [[Ireland]] two years earlier.<ref name="birthplace">{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson |work=Information Services Branch, State Library of North Carolina |url=http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/nc/bio/public/jackson.htm}}</ref><ref name="Carrick">{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson Cottage and US Rangers Centre |work=[[Northern Ireland Tourist Board]] |url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/product.aspx?ProductID=2801}}</ref> Jackson's father was born in [[Carrickfergus]], [[County Antrim]], in current-day [[Northern Ireland]], around 1738.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gullan|first=Harold I. |title=First fathers: the men who inspired our Presidents|publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, N.J. : J|date=2004|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YSt1AAAAMAAJ&q=%22Andrew+Jackson,+Sr.%22+-inpublisher:icon&dq=%22Andrew+Jackson,+Sr.%22+-inpublisher:icon&cd=9|isbn=0-471-46597-6 |oclc=53090968 |pages= xii, 308 p. : ill. ; 25&nbsp;cm | accessdate=January 14, 2010|lccn=2003020625}}</ref> Jackson's parents lived in the village of [[Boneybefore]], also in County Antrim.

When they emigrated to America in 1765, Jackson's parents probably landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They would have traveled overland down through the Appalachian Mountains to the Scots-Irish community in the [[Waxhaws]] region, straddling the border between [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]].<ref>Booraem, Hendrik (2001) ''Young Hickory : The Making of Andrew Jackson'' p.9</ref> They brought two children from Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764).

Jackson's father died in an accident in February 1767, at the age of 29, three weeks before his son Andrew was born in the [[Waxhaws]] area. His exact birth site is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying Jackson's father. The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed.<ref name="Old"/>

In 1824, Jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncle's plantation in [[Lancaster County, South Carolina]]. But he may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the [[Tariff of 1824]], which Jackson opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he may have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.<ref name="Old">{{cite news |work=The Washington Post |date=March 7, 2011 |first=Jeffrey|last=Collings |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/06/AR2011030603406.html?wprss=rss_print/asection |title=Old fight lingers over Old Hickory's roots}}</ref>

Jackson received a sporadic education in the local "old-field" school.<ref>In the antebellum South, rural schools were often built in exhausted cotton or tobacco fields, hence the name.</ref> In 1781, he worked for a time in a saddle-maker's shop.<ref name=Paletta>{{cite book |last=Paletta|first=Lu Ann |author2=Worth, Fred L |title=The World Almanac of Presidential Facts |publisher=World Almanac Books |year=1988 |isbn=0-345-34888-5}}</ref> Later, he taught school and studied law in [[Salisbury, North Carolina]]. In 1787, he was admitted to the bar, and moved to [[Jonesborough, Tennessee|Jonesborough]], in what was then the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Western District]] of North Carolina. This area later became the [[Southwest Territory]] (1790), the precursor to the state of Tennessee.

==Revolutionary War service==
[[File:Andrew-Jackson-disobeys-British-officer-1780.png|thumb|left|''Young Jackson Refusing to Clean Major Coffin's Boots'' (1876 [[lithography|lithograph]]).]] <!-- official title, searching for author -->
During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], Jackson, at age thirteen, informally helped the local militia as a courier.<ref>Remini 1:15–17</ref> His eldest brother, Hugh, died from heat exhaustion during the [[Battle of Stono Ferry]], on June 20, 1779. Jackson and his brother Robert were captured by the British and held as prisoners; they nearly starved to death in captivity. When Jackson refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving Jackson with scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British.<ref name="Remini 1:21">Remini 1:21</ref> While imprisoned, the brothers contracted [[smallpox]].

Robert Jackson died on April 27, 1781, a few days after their mother Elizabeth secured the brothers' release. After being assured Andrew would recover, Elizabeth Jackson volunteered to nurse [[prisoners of war]] on board two ships in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor, where there had been an outbreak of [[cholera]]. She died from the disease in November 1781, and was buried in an unmarked grave. Jackson became an orphan at age 14.<ref name="Remini 1:13">Remini 1:13</ref> Following the deaths of his brothers and mother during the war, Jackson blamed the British for his losses.

==Legal and political career==
Jackson began his legal career in Jonesborough, now northeastern Tennessee. Though his [[legal education]] was scanty, he knew enough to be a [[country lawyer]] on the [[American frontier|frontier]]. Since he was not from a distinguished family, he had to make his career by his own merits; soon he began to prosper in the rough-and-tumble world of frontier law. Most of the actions grew out of disputed land-claims, or from [[assault (tort)|assault]] and [[battery (tort)|battery]]. In 1788, he was appointed Solicitor (prosecutor) of the Western District and held the same position in the government of the [[Territory South of the River Ohio]] after 1791.

Jackson was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] in 1796. When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, Jackson was elected its [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]]. The following year, he was elected [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] as a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]], but he resigned within a year. (His return to the U.S. Senate in 1823, after 24 years, 11 months, 3 days out of office, marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/12/bob_smith_and_the_12-year_itch.php |title=Bob Smith and the 12-Year Itch |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date= December 4, 2013}}</ref> In 1798, he was appointed a judge of the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]], serving until 1804.<ref>{{CongBio|j000005|inline=1|date=October 30, 2011}}</ref>

===Land speculation and founding of Memphis===

In 1794, Jackson formed a business with [[John Overton (judge)|John Overton]] "for the purpose of purchasing lands as well those lands without as within military bounds"—overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the Cherokee and Chickasaw.<ref>Walter T. Durham, ''Before Tennessee: The Southwest Territory''; Piney Flats, TN: Rocky Mount Historical Association, 1990; pp. 218–19. "In the Mero District, two young attorneys, John Overton and Andrew Jackson, entered into a formal partnership on May 12, 1794, 'for the purpose of purchasing lands as well as those lands without as within the military bounds.' Theirs was a frank avowal; they, like many of their contemporaries, would deal with lands within Indian territory. Most of the transactions involved grants made under the 'land grab' act of 1873 that briefly opened to claim by North Carolinians all of the Indian lands in that state's transmontane west. While the act was in force, citizens had staked claims to two or three million acres of Chickasaw and Cherokee land."</ref> Upon his return from [[Seminole Wars|Florida]], Jackson negotiated the sale of the land from the [[Chickasaw Nation]] in 1818 (termed the [[Jackson Purchase (U.S. historical region)|Jackson Purchase]]). He was one of the three original investors who founded [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1819 (see [[History of Memphis, Tennessee]]).<ref>Blythe Semmer, [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=698 "Jackson Purchase"], ''[[Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture]]''</ref>

==Hermitage plantation==
[[File:AndrewJackson-RewardNotice-EscapedSlave-1804.png|thumb|Escaped slave notice placed by Andrew Jackson offering a $50 reward, plus expenses, for the return of an enslaved mulatto man who escaped from Jackson's plantation. In a move unusual for the time, the notice offers "ten dollars extra, for every hundred lashes any person will give him, to the amount of three hundred."<ref>{{Cite book |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-0-8078-3151-9 |last= Cumfer |first= Cynthia |title=Separate peoples, one land: The minds of Cherokees, Blacks, and Whites on the Tennessee frontier |location=Chapel Hill, NC |date=2007 |page=140}}</ref>]]In addition to his legal and political career, Jackson prospered as [[plantation|planter]], slave owner, and merchant. He built a home and the first general store in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]] in 1803. The next year he acquired [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|the Hermitage]], a {{convert|640|acre|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} plantation in [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], near [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. Jackson later added {{convert|360|acre|0|abbr=on}} to the plantation, which eventually grew to {{convert|1050|acres|0|abbr=on}}. The primary crop was [[cotton]], grown by enslaved workers. Starting with nine slaves, Jackson held as many as 44 by 1820, and later held up to 150 slaves, making him among the planter elite. Throughout his lifetime Jackson may have owned as many as 300 slaves.<ref>Remini (2000), p.51 cites 1820 census; mentions later figures up to 150 without noting a source.</ref><ref name=Hermitage_Slavery_2011>{{cite web |title=The Hermitage Slavery |url=http://www.thehermitage.com/mansion-grounds/farm/slavery |publisher=thehermitage.com |date=2011 |accessdate= August 20, 2014}}</ref>

[[African American]] men, women, and children were enslaved by Jackson on three sections of the Hermitage plantation.<ref name=Hermitage_Slavery_2011/> Slaves lived in extended family units between five and ten persons quartered in 20-foot-square cabins made either of brick or logs. The size and quality of Jackson's Hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times. To help slaves acquire food staples, in addition to Jackson's rations, Jackson supplied slaves with guns, knives, and fishing equipment for hunting and fishing.<ref name=Hermitage_Slavery_2011/> At times Jackson paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets. The Hermitage plantation was a profit-making enterprise and Jackson, who demanded slave loyalty, permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves' offenses were severe enough. Jackson at various times posted advertisements for his fugitive slaves. For the standards of his times Jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food, housing, and did not prohibit his female slaves from childbirthing.<ref name=Hermitage_Slavery_2011/>

==Military career==
Jackson was appointed commander of the Tennessee militia in 1801, with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. He was later elected major general of the Tennessee militia in 1802.<ref>Buchanan, John. (2001). ''Jackson's Way: Andrew Jackson and the People of the Western Waters. New York: John Wiley & Son, Inc. p.&nbsp;165–166.</ref>

===War of 1812===
{{Main|Creek War|Battle of New Orleans}}

====Creek campaign and treaty====
[[File:Creek War Treaty 1814.jpg|thumb|Treaty of Fort Jackson, 1814<br />Jackson imposed severe terms on the Creek Indians ''Treaty with the Creeks'' (1847)]]
During the [[War of 1812]], the [[Shawnee]] [[Tribal chief|chief]] [[Tecumseh]] encouraged the "[[Red Stick]]" Creek Indians of northern Alabama and Georgia to attack white settlements. He had unified tribes in the [[Northwest Territory|Northwest]] to rise up against the Americans, trying to repel American settlers from those lands north of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]]. Four hundred settlers were killed in the [[Fort Mims massacre]]—one of the few instances of Native Americans killing a large number of American settlers and their African-American slaves<ref name="Indian massacres: 1500–1830">{{section link |Indian massacre |1500–1830}}</ref>—which brought the United States into the internal [[Creek War|Creek campaign]]. Occurring at the same time as the [[War of 1812]], the Creek campaign saw Jackson command the U.S. forces, which included the Tennessee militia, U.S. [[Regular Army (United States)|regulars]], and [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], and [[Lower Creek]] warriors. [[Sam Houston]] and [[David Crockett]] served under Jackson in this campaign.

Jackson defeated the Red Sticks at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in 1814. US forces and their allies killed 800 Red Stick warriors in this battle, but spared the chief [[William Weatherford|Red Eagle]], a mixed-race man also known as [[William Weatherford]]. After the victory, Madison's Secretary of War Armstrong ordered Major General Thomas Pinckney in April 1814 to make the surrender treaty. {{sfn|DSHeidler_JTHeidler 1997|page=192}} Pinckney made moderate terms of surrender including handing over an unspecified amount of land, the construction of U.S. forts, turning over warriors who instigated hostilities, and agreeing to stop trade with foreign countries. Jackson opposed the unpopular Pinckney treaty, desiring to completely destroy the Creek nation. Jackson was promoted Major General and given charge of the Seventh Military District, replacing Major General Thomas Flournoy. Jackson, now commanding general, immediately threw out Pinckney's treaty and forced severe terms upon both the Upper Creek enemies and the Lower Creek allies, wresting twenty-two million acres in present-day Georgia and Alabama from all the Creek for European-American settlement. {{sfn|DSHeidler_JTHeidler 1997|page=192}}  Jackson also confiscated land from Indians who had sided with the Americans. Jackson stated that the terms must be accepted or the tribe would be forcefully removed to Florida. On August 9, 1814, 35 Indian elder leaders signed Jackson's [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]]. The warrior faction of the Creek nation and the British, however, did not formally recognize the treaty. {{sfn|DSHeidler_JTHeidler 1997|page=192}}

According to author [[Gloria Jahoda]], the Creeks coined their own name for him, ''Jacksa Chula Harjo'' or "Jackson, old and fierce".<ref>Jahoda, Gloria. ''The Trail of Tears: The Story of the American Indian Removals 1813–1855''. Holt, Rinehart and Winston. New York. 1975 ISBN 0-03-014871-5.</ref>

====Battle of New Orleans====
[[File:Battle of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Battle of New Orleans]]''. General Andrew Jackson stands on the parapet of his makeshift defenses as his troops repulse attacking [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Highlanders]], by painter [[Edward Percy Moran]] in 1910.]]
Jackson's service in the [[War of 1812]] against the United Kingdom was conspicuous for bravery and success. When British forces threatened [[New Orleans]], Jackson took command of the defenses, including militia from several western states and territories. He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops. They said he was "tough as old hickory" wood on the battlefield, and he acquired the nickname of "Old Hickory". In the [[Battle of New Orleans]] on January 8, 1815, Jackson's 5,000 soldiers won a decisive victory over 7,500 British. At the end of the battle, the British had 2,037 casualties: 291 dead (including three senior generals), 1,262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing. The Americans had 71 casualties: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing.<ref>Remini, Robert V. (1999). ''The Battle of New Orleans''. New York: Penguin Books. p. 285</ref>

====Enforced martial law New Orleans====
Jackson ordered the arrest of U. S. District Court Judge [[Dominic Augustin Hall|Dominic A. Hall]] in March 1815, after the judge signed a writ of [[habeas corpus]] on behalf of a Louisiana legislator that Jackson had arrested.<ref>Martin, François-Xavier ''The History of Louisiana, from the Earliest Period'', Vol. 2 p.&nbsp;387–495 (New Orleans, 1829).</ref> Louis Louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper, challenging Jackson's refusal to release the militia, after the British ceded the field of battle.<ref>Warshauer, Matthew, Andrew Jackson and the Politics of Martial Law, Univ. of Tenn.

Civilian authorities in New Orleans had reason to fear Jackson. But they fared better than did the six members of the militia whose executions, ordered by Jackson, would surface as the [[Coffin Handbills]] during his 1828 Presidential campaign. Nonetheless, Jackson became a national hero for his actions in this battle and the War of 1812.<ref>{{cite web|title=Some account of some of the bloody deeds of General Jackson|url=http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2008661734/|work=Prints & Photographs Reading Room|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=January 15, 2014|year=1828}}</ref> By a resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson received the [[Thanks of Congress]] as well as a [[Congressional Gold Medal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=JACKSON, Andrew – Biographical Information|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=j000005|work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|publisher=Congress of the United States|accessdate=January 15, 2014}}</ref> [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], "underwhelmed" by Jackson, later commented in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' that Jackson "...&nbsp;was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans."<ref>{{cite book|last=Leeden|first=Michael A.|title=Tocqueville on American Character|year=2001|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-27451-1|pages=32–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNS_obYz2qsC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 15, 2014}}</ref>

===First Seminole War===
{{Main|Seminole Wars}}
[[File:Ambristertrial.jpg|thumb|right|Trial of Robert Ambrister during the Seminole War. Ambrister was one of two British subjects executed by General Jackson. (1848)]]
Jackson served in the military again during the [[First Seminole War]]. He was ordered by President [[James Monroe]] in December 1817 to lead a campaign in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] against the [[Seminole]] and Creek Indians. Jackson was also charged with preventing [[Spanish Florida]] from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves. Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His directions were to "terminate the conflict".<ref>Remini, 118.</ref> Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida. Before going, Jackson wrote to Monroe, "Let it be signified to me through any channel&nbsp;... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished."<ref>Ogg, 66.</ref> Monroe gave Jackson orders that were purposely ambiguous, sufficient for international denials.

The Seminole attacked Jackson's Tennessee volunteers. The Seminole attack left their villages vulnerable, and Jackson burned their houses and the crops. He found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were secretly assisting the Indians. Jackson believed that the United States could not be secure as long as [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] encouraged Indians to fight, and argued that his actions were undertaken in self-defense. Jackson captured [[Pensacola, Florida]], with little more than some warning shots, and deposed the Spanish governor. He captured and then tried and executed two British subjects, [[Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident|Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot]], who had been supplying and advising the Indians. Jackson's actions struck fear into the Seminole tribes as word spread of his ruthlessness in battle (he became known as "Sharp Knife").

The executions, and Jackson's invasion of territory belonging to Spain, a country with which the U.S. was not at war, created an international incident. Many in the Monroe administration called for Jackson to be [[Censure in the United States|censured]]. The [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[John Quincy Adams]], an early believer in [[Manifest Destiny]], defended Jackson. When the Spanish minister demanded a "suitable punishment" for Jackson, Adams wrote back, "Spain must immediately [decide] either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory&nbsp;... or cede to the United States a province, of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession, but which is, in fact&nbsp;... a post of annoyance to them."<ref>{{cite web |title=Jefferson and His Colleagues |url=http://etext.virginia.edu/jefferson/grizzard/johnson/johnson13.html |accessdate=October 11, 2006 |last=Johnson |first=Allen |year=1920}}</ref> Adams used Jackson's conquest, and Spain's own weakness, to get Spain to cede Florida to the United States by the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]]. Jackson was subsequently named Florida's military governor and served from March 10, 1821, to December 31, 1821.

==Election of 1824==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1824}}
[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jackson in 1824, painting by [[Thomas Sully]]]]

The [[Tennessee legislature]] nominated Jackson for President in 1822. It also elected him U.S. Senator again.
By 1824, the Democratic-Republican Party had become the only functioning national party. Its Presidential candidates had been chosen by an informal [[Congressional nominating caucus]], but this had become unpopular. In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus. Those who attended backed Treasury Secretary [[William H. Crawford]] for President and [[Albert Gallatin]] for Vice President. A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for President a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the "voice of the people" and was a "vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rutland |first=Robert Allen |title=The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton |pages=48–49 |year=1995 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=0-8262-1034-1}}</ref> Gallatin criticized Jackson as "an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office".<ref>Adams, Henry. ''The Life of Albert Gallatin'' (1879), 599.</ref>

Besides Jackson and Crawford, the Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and House Speaker [[Henry Clay]] were also candidates. Jackson received the most popular votes (but not a majority, and four states had no popular ballot). The [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] were split four ways, with Jackson having a plurality. Because no candidate received a majority, the election was decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], which chose Adams. Jackson supporters denounced this result as a "[[corrupt bargain]]" because Clay gave his state's support to Adams, who subsequently appointed Clay as [[Secretary of State]]. As none of Kentucky's electors had initially voted for Adams, and Jackson had won the popular vote, some Kentucky politicians criticized Clay for violating the will of the people in return for personal political favors. Jackson's defeat burnished his political credentials, however; many voters believed the "man of the people" had been robbed by the "corrupt aristocrats of the East".{{clear}}

==Election of 1828==

Jackson denounced the "corrupt bargain" that put Adams in the White House and laid plans for a crusade to oust Adams from office.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cheathem|first=Mark R.|title=Andrew Jackson, Southerner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdStAAAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PR12|year=2013|publisher=LSU Press ch 12}}</ref>
After resigning the Senate in October 1825, he continued his quest for the Presidency. The Tennessee legislature again nominated Jackson for President. He attracted Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Martin Van Buren]], and [[Thomas Ritchie]] into his camp (Van Buren and Ritchie were previous supporters of Crawford). Van Buren, with help from his friends in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], revived the old Republican Party, gave it a new name as the Democratic Party, "restored party rivalries", and forged a national organization of durability.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rutland |first=Robert Allen |title=The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton |pages=55–56 |year=1995 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=0-8262-1034-1}}</ref> The Jackson coalition handily defeated Adams in 1828.

During the election, Jackson's opponents referred to him as a "[[Donkey|jackass]]". Jackson liked the name and used the jackass as a symbol for a while, but it died out. However, it later became the symbol for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] popularized it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/questions/week174.htm |last=Nickels|first=Ilona|title=How did Republicans pick the elephant, and Democrats the donkey, to represent their parties? |work=Capitol Questions |publisher=C-SPAN|date=September 5, 2000 |accessdate=September 6, 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20001021094719/http://c-span.org/questions/Week174.htm|archivedate=October 21, 2000}}</ref>

The campaign was very much a personal one. As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized many campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press, which reached a low point when the press accused Jackson's wife Rachel of bigamy. Though the accusation was true, as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign, it was based on events that occurred many years prior (1791 to 1794). Jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him, but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife. Rachel died suddenly on December 22, 1828, before his inauguration, and was buried on Christmas Eve. He blamed the Adams campaigners for her death. "May God Almighty forgive her murderers," he swore at her funeral. "I never can."<ref>{{cite book|last=Paul F. Boller Jr. |first=|title=Presidential Campaigns : From George Washington to George W.

==Presidency 1829–1837==
{{Main|Presidency of Andrew Jackson}}
[[File:Andrew Jackson Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|President Andrew Jackson<br />New York: Ritchie & Co. (1860)]]

Jackson's name has been associated with [[Jacksonian democracy]]  or the spread of democracy in terms of the passing of political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties. "The Age of Jackson" shaped the national agenda and American politics. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=101}}  Jackson's philosophy as President followed much in the same line as [[Thomas Jefferson]], advocating Republican values held by the Revolutionary War generation. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=104}}  Jackson's presidency held a high moralistic tone; having as a planter himself agrarian sympathies, a limited view of states rights and the federal government. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=104}} Jackson feared that monied and business interests would corrupt [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. When South Carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession.

Jackson believed that the president's authority was derived from the people and the presidential office was above party politics. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=104}} Instead of choosing party favorites, Jackson chose "plain, businessmen" whom he intended to control.{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=104}} Jackson chose [[Martin Van Buren]] as Secretary of State, [[John Eaton (politician)|John Eaton]] Secretary of War, [[Samuel Ingham]] Secretary of Treasury, [[John Branch]] Secretary of Navy, [[John MacPherson Berrien|John Berrien]] as Attorney General, and [[William Taylor Barry|William T. Barry]] as postmaster general. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=105}} Jackson's first choice of Cabinet proved to be unsuccessful, full of bitter partisanship and gossip, especially between Eaton, Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]], and Van Buren. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=105}} By the Spring of 1831, only Barry remained, while the rest of Jackson's cabinet had been discharged.{{sfn|Latner 2002|pages=105, 108}} Jackson's following cabinet selections worked better together.{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=105}}

===Inauguration===
{{main|First inauguration of Andrew Jackson}}
On March 4, 1829, Andrew Jackson became the first United States president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.<ref>http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pinotable.html ''Inaugurals of Presidents of the United States: Some Precedents and Notable Events''. Library of Congress.</ref> Jackson was the first President to invite the public to attend the [[White House]] ball honoring his first inauguration. Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes. The crowd became so large that Jackson's guards could not keep them out of the White House, which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were eventually broken. Some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the President. The crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the White House lawn to lure people outside. Jackson's raucous populism earned him the nickname "King Mob".

===Petticoat politics===
[[File:John Eaton.jpg|thumb|right|Secretary of War<br />[[John H. Eaton]]]]
{{Main|Petticoat affair}}
Jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his first years in office responding to what came to be known as the [[Petticoat affair|Eaton affair]]. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=107}} Vicious Washington gossip circulated among Jackson's Cabinet members and their wives including Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]]'s wife [[Floride Calhoun|Floride]] concerning Secretary of War [[John H. Eaton]] and his wife [[Margaret O'Neill Eaton|Peggy]]. Bitter rumors spread that Peggy was loose in her morals while working at her father's tavern when her naval officer husband was away at sea. After Peggy's husband died at sea, both Eaton and Peggy were criticized for their perceived early marriage. Initially Jackson thought that [[Henry Clay]] was behind the gossip, but then he eventually concluded Calhoun was responsible for spreading the rumors. Both Jackson and Van Buren defended Eaton and his wife Peggy, however Calhoun's wife Floride and the wives of Jackson's pro-Calhoun Cabinet members publicly shunned both Eaton and Peggy.{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=107}}<ref>John F. Marszalek, ''The Petticoat Affair: Manners, Mutiny, and Sex in Andrew Jackson's White House'' (LSU Press, 2000)</ref>

Van Buren, Eaton, and Calhoun resigned office over the affair while Jackson dismissed the rest of his pro-Calhoun cabinet members except Postmaster [[William T. Barry]]. Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to England, however, Calhoun's supporters in the Senate blocked the nomination giving Calhoun, who had continued to be Vice President and President of the Senate until December 1832, the deciding vote against Van Buren and blocked the nomination. Calhoun publically castigated and boasted that Van Buren's political career was over, stating the defeated nomination would "...kill him, sir, kill dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick." {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=108}} This rumor however proved to be false as Van Buren, who played a leading role in the Jackson's unofficial [[Kitchen Cabinet]], allied with Jackson and became Jackson's successor and Vice Presidential candidate in 1832. Jackson also acquired the ''Globe'' paper that was sympathetic with him.<ref>Meacham, pp.&nbsp;171–75;</ref> {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=108}}

===Indian removal policy===
{{Further|Indian removal|Indian Removal Act|Trail of Tears|}}
[[File:Trails of Tears en.png|thumb|right|Jackson's Indian Removal Act and subsequent treaties resulted in the transplantation of several [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribes]] and the [[Trail of Tears]]]]

Throughout his eight years in office, Jackson made about 70 treaties with native American tribes both in the [[Old Southwest|South]] and the [[Old Northwest|Northwest]].{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=109}} Jackson's presidency marked a new era in Indian-[[European American|Anglo]] American relations initiating a policy of Indian removal. {{sfn|Latner 2002|p=108}} Jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various Indian tribes, though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates. The southern tribes included the [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee|Creek]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Seminole]] and the [[Cherokee]]. The northwest tribes include the [[Chippewa]], [[Ottawa]], and the [[Potawatomi]]. Though conflict between Indians and American settlers took place in the north and in the south, the problem was worse in the south where the Indian populations were larger. Indian wars broke out repeatedly, often when native tribes, especially the [[Muscogee]] and [[Seminole]] Indians, refused to abide by the treaties for various reasons.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=110}} The [[Second Seminole War]], started in December 1835, lasted over six years finally ending in August 1842 under President [[John Tyler]].{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=110}}

Though relations between Europeans (and later Americans) and Indians were always complicated, they grew increasingly complicated once American settlements began pushing further west in the years after the [[American Revolution]]. Often these relations were peaceful, though they increasingly grew tense and sometimes even violent, both on the part of American settlers and the Indians. From [[George Washington]] to John Quincy Adams, the problem was typically ignored or dealt with lightly; though by Jackson's time the earlier policy had grown unsustainable. The problem was especially acute in the south (in particular the lands near the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]), where Indian populations were larger, denser, and more Americanized than those of the north. As such, there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the problem, and out of this developed a policy to relocate certain Indian populations. Jackson, never one known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=108}} This contrasted from his immediate predecessor, President [[John Quincy Adams|John Q. Adams]], who tended to follow the policy of his own predecessors, that of letting the problem play itself out with minimal intervention.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=108}} Jackson's presidency thus took place in a new era in Indian-[[European American|Anglo]] American relations, in that it marked federal action and a policy of relocation.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=108}} As such, during Jackson's presidency, Indian relations between the Southern tribes and the state governments had reached a critical juncture.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=109}}

In his December 8, 1829, First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson advocated land west of the [[Mississippi River]] be set aside for Indian tribes. Congress had been developing its own Indian relocation bill, and Jackson had many supporters in both the Senate and House who agreed with his goal. On May 26, 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], and Jackson signed it into law. The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west, outside of existing U.S. state borders.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=109}} The passage of the bill was Jackson's first successful legislative triumph and marked the Democratic party's emergence into American political society.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=109}} The passage of the act was especially popular in the [[Southern United States|South]] where population growth and the discovery of gold on [[Cherokee]] land had increased pressure on tribal lands.

The state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees, culminating in the 1832 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision (''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]''). In that decision, [[U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]], in writing for the court, ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands.<ref>Robert V. Remini, ''The Life of Andrew Jackson'' (1988), p. 216</ref><ref>Cave (2003).</ref> Jackson is frequently, though incorrectly, attributed with the following response: "John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it". The quote originated in 1863 from [[Horace Greeley]]. Jackson used the Georgia crisis to broker an agreement whereby the Cherokee leaders agreed to a removal treaty. A group of Cherokees led by [[John Ridge]] negotiated the [[Treaty of New Echota]] with Jackson's representatives. Ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]], and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicaldocuments.com/IndianRemovalAct.htm |title=Historical Documents – The Indian Removal Act of 1830 |publisher=Historicaldocuments.com |accessdate=November 1, 2008}}</ref> A group of Cherokees petitioned in protest of the proposed removal, though this wasn't taken up by the Supreme Court or the U.S. Congress, in part due to delays and timing.<ref name=PBS-JDIR>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2959.html |title=Indian Removal|work=Judgment Day|publisher=PBS|accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref>

The treaty was enforced by Jackson's successor, Van Buren, who sent 7,000 troops to carry out the relocation policy. Due to the infighting between political factions, many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synaptic.bc.ca/ejournal/jackson.htm |title=Andrew Jackson Speaks: Indian Removal |work=The Nomadic Spirit|accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> It was subsequent to this that as many as 4,000 Cherokees died on the "[[Trail of Tears]]". By the 1830s, under constant pressure from settlers, each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands, but sizable self-government groups lived in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. All of these (except the Seminoles) had moved far in the coexistence with whites, and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves. Their methods earned them the title of the "[[Five Civilized Tribes]]".<ref name=PBS-JDIR /> More than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during Jackson's administration, though a few Cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high [[Great Smoky Mountains|Smoky Mountains]] along the [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]] border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cherokee-nc.com/index.php?page=56 |title=Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians – History |publisher=Cherokee-nc.com |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref>

Jackson's initiatives to deal with the conflicts between Indians and American settlers has been a source of controversy<ref>In the 2015 debate on removing Jackson from the $20 bill, Indian removal was often mentioned as a good reason for doing that.</ref><ref>By Abby Ohlheiser, "This group wants to banish Andrew Jackson from the $20 bill," [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/03/03/this-group-wants-to-banish-andrew-jackson-from-the-20-and-replace-him-with-a-woman/ ''Washington Post'' 3 March, 2015].

In an effort to purge the government from corruption of previous administrations, Jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive Cabinet offices and departments. {{sfn|Ellis 1974|pages=65–66}} During Jackson's tenure in office, large amounts of public money were put in the hands of public officials. Jackson, who believed appointees should be hired by merit, withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies. {{sfn|Ellis 1974|pages=65–66}} Jackson asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws, reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions, revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties, and laws to improve government accounting. Jackson's Postmaster Barry resigned after a Congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services, collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts, failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances.

Upon assuming the presidency in 1829 Jackson enforced the [[Tenure of Office Act (1820)|''Tenure of Office Act'']], passed earlier into law by President [[James Monroe]] in 1820, that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates. {{sfn|Ellis 1974|p=61}} Jackson believed that a [[rotation in office]] was actually a democratic reform preventing father-to-son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will. {{sfn|Ellis 1974|p=61}} Jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was "a leading principle in the republican creed".<ref name="firstaddress"/> Jackson noted, "In a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Power of the Presidency: The Spoils System|url=http://www.pbs.org/kcet/andrewjackson/features/the_spoils_system.html|work=Andrew Jackson – The Good, Evil & The Presidency – Special Features – PBS.org|publisher=Red Hill Productions and Community Television of Southern California|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref> Jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. Opposed to this view however, were Jackson's supporters who in order to strengthen party loyalty wanted to give the posts to other party members. In practice, this would have meant the continuation of the patronage system by replacing federal employees with friends or party loyalists.<ref>The [[Spoils system]], as the rotation in office system was called, did not originate with Jackson. It originated with New York governors in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (most notably [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] and [[DeWitt Clinton]]). [[Thomas Jefferson]] brought it to the [[Executive Branch]] when he replaced Federalist office-holders after becoming President. [http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h965.html The Spoils System versus the Merit System.] Retrieved on November 21, 2006.</ref> The number of federal office holders removed by Jackson were exaggerated by his opponents; Jackson only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes. {{sfn|Ellis 1974|pp=61–62}} Jackson, however, did use his image and presidential power to award his loyal Democratic Party followers by granting them federal office appointments. Jackson's democratic approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office. Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership Jackson stated "If he lost his leg fighting for his country, that is ... enough for me." <ref>{{cite book|title=American Government: Continuity and Change|year=2006|publisher=Pearson Longman|location=New York|isbn=978-0-321-31711-7|page=293|author=Sabato, Larry|edition=2006|authorlink=Larry Sabato|author2=[[Karen O'Connor (professor)|O'Connor, Karen]] |type = Print|chapter=8}}</ref>

Jackson's theory regarding rotation of office  generated what would later be called the [[spoils system]], a practice that Jackson, ironically, didn't justify. {{sfn|Ellis 1974|p=61}} The political realities of Washington, however, ultimately forced Jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations.<ref name="howe2007">{{cite book|title=What hath God Wrought, The Transformation of America, 1815–1848|last=Howe|first=Daniel W.|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-19-507894-7|pages=328–34}}</ref> Historians believe Jackson's presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics. {{sfn|Ellis 1974|page=65}} Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington (such as the New York Customs House; the Postal Service; the Departments of Navy and War; and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose budget had enormously increased in the past two decades) proved to be difficult.{{sfn|Ellis 1974|page=65}} Other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices, forced political party campaign participation, and collection of assessments, did not take place until after Jackson's presidency. {{sfn|Ellis 1974|p=62}} During Jackson's presidency, those in opposition to Jackson's purging of office holders, formed the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], calling Jackson "King Andrew I" having feared his military background, and named their party after the English parliamentary Whigs who opposed eighteenth century British monarchy. {{sfn|Ellis 1974|p=62}}

===Nullification crisis===
{{Main|Nullification Crisis}}
Another notable crisis during Jackson's period of office was the "[[Nullification Crisis]]", or "secession crisis", of 1828–1832, which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs. Critics alleged that high tariffs (the "[[Tariff of Abominations]]") on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U.S., raising the prices paid by planters in the South. Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers.

The issue came to a head when Vice President Calhoun, in the [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] of 1828, supported the claim of his home state, [[South Carolina]], that it had the right to "nullify"—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men.

Particularly notable was an incident at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts. [[Robert Hayne]] began by toasting to "The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States". Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!"&nbsp;– a clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun clarified his position by responding "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!"<ref>Ogg, 164.</ref>

At the [[1832 Democratic National Convention|first Democratic National Convention]], which was privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet, Calhoun and Jackson broke from each other politically and Van Buren replaced Calhoun as Jackson's running mate in the [[United States presidential election, 1832|1832 presidential election]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Parton |first=James | author-link=James Parton |title=Life of Andrew Jackson |volume=3 |pages=381–85 |year=2006 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=1-4286-3929-2}} First published in 1860.</ref> In December 1832, Calhoun resigned as Vice President to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.

In response to South Carolina's nullification claim, Jackson vowed to send troops to [[South Carolina]] to enforce the laws. In December 1832, he issued a resounding proclamation against the "nullifiers", stating that he considered "the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed". South Carolina, the President declared, stood on "the brink of insurrection and treason", and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought. Jackson also denied the right of secession: "The Constitution&nbsp;... forms a ''government'' not a league&nbsp;... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation."<ref>Syrett, 36.

Jackson asked Congress to pass a "[[Force Bill]]" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but its passage was delayed until [[protectionism|protectionists]] led by Clay agreed to a reduced [[Tariff of 1833|Compromise Tariff]]. The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833, and Jackson signed both. The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance. The Force Bill became moot because it was no longer needed. On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote, "the tariff was only the pretext, and [[Secession in the United States|disunion]] and [[Confederate States of America|southern confederacy]] the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] question."<ref>[[Jon Meacham]] (2009), [[American Lion (book)|American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House]], New York: Random House, p. 247; ''Correspondence of Andrew Jackson'', Vol. V, p. 72.</ref>

===Foreign affairs===
[[File:WilliamCRives.png|thumb|left|Jackson's Minister to France [[William Cabell Rives|William C. Rives]] successfully negotiated a reparations treaty with France in 1831.]]
When Jackson took office in 1829 spoliation claims, or compensation demands for the capture of American ships and sailors, dating from the Napoleonic era, caused strained relations between the U.S. and [[France|French]] governments. {{sfn|Latner 2002|pages=119–20}} The French Navy had captured and sent American ships to Spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules. According to Secretary of State [[Martin Van Buren]] relations between the U.S. and France were "hopeless".{{sfn|Latner 2002|pages=119–20}}  Jackson's Minister to France [[William Cabell Rives|William C. Rives]], however, through diplomacy was able to convince the French government to sign a reparations treaty on July 4, 1831 that would award the U.S. ₣ 25,000,000  ($5,000,000) in damages.<ref name=Cunningham_1999>{{cite web |last=Cunningham |first=Hugo S. |title= Gold and Silver Standards France |date=1999 |url=http://www.cyberussr.com/hcunn/gold-std.html#france |accessdate=August 28, 2014}}</ref> The French government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties. The French king [[Louis Philippe I]] and his ministers blamed the French Chamber of Deputies. {{sfn|Latner 2002|pages=119–20}}  By 1834 the non-payment of reparations by the French government drew Jackson's ire and he became impatient. In his December 1834 State of the Union address, Jackson sternly reprimanded the French government for non-payment, stating the federal government was "wholly disappointed" by the French, and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals against France. {{sfn|Latner 2002|pages=119–20}}  Feeling insulted by Jackson's words, the French people demanded an apology. In his December 1835 State of the Union Address, Jackson refused to apologize, stating he had a good opinion of the French people and his intentions were peaceful. Jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment. The French government accepted Jackson's statements as sincere and in February 1836, American reparations were finally paid. {{sfn|Latner 2002|pages=119–20}}

In addition to France, the Jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with [[Denmark]], [[Portugal]], and [[Spain]]. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=120}} Jackson's state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[Great Britain]], and [[Siam]]. Under the treaty of Great Britain, American trade was reopened in the West Indies. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=120}}  The trade agreement with Siam was America's first treaty between the United States and an Asiatic country. As a result, American exports increased 75% while imports increased 250%. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=120}}

Jackson, however, was unsuccessful in opening trade with [[China]] and [[Japan]]. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=120}} Jackson was unsuccessful at thwarting Great Britain's presence and power in South America. Jackson's attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=120}} Jackson's agent in Texas, Colonel Anthony Butler, suggested to take Texas over militarily, but Jackson refused. Butler was later replaced toward the end of Jackson's presidency. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=120}}

===Bank veto and Election of 1832===
{{Further|Bank War|Banking in the Jacksonian Era}}
[[File:1832bank1.jpg|thumb|right|1833 Democratic cartoon shows Jackson destroying the [[Second Bank of the United States|devil's Bank]]]]

In 1816 the [[Second Bank of the United States]] was charted by President [[James Madison]] to restore the United States economy devastated by the [[War of 1812]]. {{sfn|Latner 2002|p=111}} In 1823 President [[James Monroe]] appointed [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]], the Bank's third and last executive, to run the bank. In January 1832 Biddle, on advice from his friends, submitted to Congress a renewal of the Bank's charter four years before the original 20-year charter was to end. {{sfn|Latner 2002|p=112}} Biddle's recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3, 1832.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=112}}  Jackson, believing that Bank was fundamentally a corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners, vetoed the bill.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=112}}  Jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values, believing the Bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=112}}  Jackson stated the Bank made "the rich richer and the potent more powerful."{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=112}}  The [[National Republican Party]] immediately made Jackson's veto of the Bank a political issue, attempting to undermine Jackson's popularity.{{sfn|Latner 2002|pp=112–13}}  Jackson's political opponents castigated Jackson's veto as "the very slang of the leveller and demagogue," claiming Jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=112}}

During the [[United States presidential election, 1832|1832 Presidential Election]] the rechartering of the Second National Bank became the primary issue.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=112}}  The election also demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=112}}  The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, in May 1832 nominated Jackson of Tennessee and [[Martin Van Buren]] of New York. {{sfn|Latner 2002|p=112}} The National Republican Party, who had held their first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated [[Henry Clay]], senator from [[Kentucky]] and former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], and [[John Sergeant (politician)|John Sergeant]] of Pennsylvania. {{sfn|Latner 2002|p=112}}  The Anti-Mason party, who had earlier held their convention also in Baltimore in September 1831, nominated [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]] of Maryland and Amos Elmaker of Pennsylvania; both Jackson and Clay were masons.{{sfn|Latner 2002|pp=112–13}}  The two rival parties, however, proved to be no match for Jackson's popularity and the Democratic Party's strong political networks known as ''Hickory Clubs'' in state and local organization. {{sfn|Latner 2002|p=113}}  Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased Jackson's popularity. {{sfn|Latner 2002|p=113}}  Jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington D.C. Jackson won the election decisively by a landslide, receiving 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=113}} Clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=113}}   Wirt received only 8 percent of the popular vote and 7 electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party folded.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=113}}   Jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy. {{sfn|Ellis 1974|p=63}}

===Removal of deposits and censure===
In 1833, Jackson removed federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bogart|first=Ernest Ludlow|title=The Economic History of the United States|year=1907|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|isbn=978-1-176-58679-6|pages=219–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BvUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}</ref> Three years later, Jackson issued the [[Specie Circular]], an [[executive order (United States)|executive order]] that required buyers of government lands to pay in "specie" (gold or silver coins). The result was a great demand for specie, which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes, causing the [[Panic of 1837]], which threw the national economy into a deep [[Depression (economics)|depression]]. It took years for the economy to recover from the damage, however the bulk of the damage was blamed on [[Martin Van Buren]], who took office in 1837.<ref>W. J. Rorabaugh, Donald T.

To end this speculation, Jackson in 1836 had issued a Specie Circular requiring that lands be purchased with hard money—gold or silver. In 1837 the panic began.

The U.S. Senate censured Jackson on March 28, 1834, for his action in removing U.S. funds from the Bank of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Senate Censure President|url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Censures_President.htm|work=U.S. Senate: Art & History – Historical Minutes – 1801–1850|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}</ref> The censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by Jackson-rival Senator [[Henry Clay]], which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and Jackson.<ref name="brands"/> During the proceedings preceding the censure, Jackson called Clay "reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel", and the issue was highly divisive within the Senate, however the censure was approved 26–20 on March 28.<ref name="brands"/> When the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged after years of effort by Jackson supporters, led by [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], who though he had once shot Jackson in a street fight, eventually became an ardent supporter of the president.<ref name="brands">{{cite news|last=Brands|first=H.

===Attack and assassination attempt===
[[File:JacksonAssassinationAttempt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]]'s attempt on Jackson's life, as depicted in an 1835 etching.]]

The first recorded physical attack on a U.S. president was directed at Jackson. Jackson had ordered the dismissal of Robert B. Randolph from the [[United States Navy|navy]] for [[embezzlement]]. On May 6, 1833, Jackson sailed on USS ''Cygnet'' to [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of [[Mary Ball Washington]], [[George Washington]]'s mother. During a stopover near [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], Randolph appeared and struck the President. He fled the scene chased by several members of Jackson's party, including the well-known writer [[Washington Irving]]. Jackson decided not to press charges.<ref name=Paletta/>

On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the [[United States Capitol]]. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of [[South Carolina]] Representative [[Warren R. Davis]], [[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]], an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring.<ref name="AmericanHeritage.com">{{cite web | title=Trying to Assassinate Andrew Jackson | author=Jon Grinspan | url=http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070130-richard-lawrence-andrew-jackson-assassination-warren-r-davis.shtml| accessdate=November 11, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081024234731/http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070130-richard-lawrence-andrew-jackson-assassination-warren-r-davis.shtml| archivedate= October 24, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Lawrence was restrained, and legend says that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane. Others present, including [[Davy Crockett|David Crockett]], restrained and disarmed Lawrence.

Lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting. He blamed Jackson for the loss of his job. He claimed that with the President dead, "money would be more plenty" (a reference to Jackson's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he "could not rise until the President fell". Finally, he told his interrogators that he was a deposed English King—specifically, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], dead since 1485—and that Jackson was his clerk. He was deemed insane and was institutionalized.

Afterwards, due to public curiosity concerning the double misfires, the pistols were tested and retested. Each time they performed perfectly. Many believed that Jackson had been protected by the same [[Divine providence|Providence]] that they believed also protected their young nation. The incident became a part of the Jacksonian mythos.

===Slavery controversies===

====Anti-slavery tracts====
During the summer of 1835, controversy over slavery was rekindled throughout the nation, as had similarly taken place during the divisive 1819–1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] debates.{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=117}} Northern abolitionists were sending anti-slavery tracts through the U.S. Postal system into the South.{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=117}}  Pro slavery Southerners objected believing the tracts were "incendiary literature" and demanded that the postal service unconditionally ban the sending of any anti-slavery tracts into the South. On July 29, a mob of 300 conservatives broke into the Post Office in Charleston, South Carolina and proceeded to seize and destroy abolitionist tracts. The Jackson Administration had Southern sympathies over slavery and was hostile to abolitionism.{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=117}} However, Jackson, who demanded sectional peace, desired to placate Southerners; at the same time resisting antislavery demands without ignoring the interests of Northern Democrats. Jackson's Postmaster General [[Amos Kendall]] gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti-slavery tracts. Jackson angrily denounced Northern abolitionists and suggested that the names of abolitionist authors should be published. Jackson, who wanted the matter quickly resolved, also suggested the tracts be mailed only to subscribers.{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=117}} In February 1836, Senator [[John C. Calhoun]], Jackson's former Vice President, authored a bill that would prohibit the sending of any anti-slavery tracts via the federal mail service. The bill however failed to gain enough votes to pass in the House. Many Southern postmasters, however, disregarded matters of federal law and simply refused to send the anti-slavery tracts.{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=117}}

====Anti-slavery Congressional petitions====
In the same year another controversy took place, when abolitionists sent the U.S. House of Representatives petitions to end the slave trade and slavery in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=118}} This infuriated pro-slavery Southerners, who attempted to prevent acknowledgement or discussion of the petitions. On December 18, 1835 South Carolina congressman [[James Henry Hammond|James H. Hammond]] strongly denounced abolitionists as "ignorant fanatics". Northern Whigs objected that anti-slavery petitions were constitutional and should not be forbidden. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=118}} Jackson wanted the issue of these petitions resolved quickly. South Carolina Representative [[Henry L. Pinckney]] drafted and introduced a resolution that denounced the petitions as "sickly sentimentality", declared that Congress had no right to interfere with slavery, and tabled (''[[gag rule]]'') all further anti-slavery petitions. Jackson leaders in Congress supported the measure, which was passed quickly and without any debate; temporarily suppressing pro-abolitionist activities in Congress.{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=118}}

====Recognition of Republic of Texas====
In 1835, pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government; by May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military for the time being, establishing an independent [[Republic of Texas]]. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=120}} The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States. However, Jackson was hesitant with recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=120}} The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, while Democratic candidate Van Buren was elected President. Jackson formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating a [[chargé d'affaires]] on the last day of his Presidency, March 3, 1837. {{sfn|Latner 2002|page=120}}

===U.S. Exploring Expedition===
[[File:USS Porpoise (1836).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Porpoise|1836|6}}, a [[brig]] ship laid down in 1835 and launched in May 1836 by Secretary of Navy Dickerson; used in the U.S. Exploring Expedition.]]

Jackson initially opposed any federal exploration scientific expeditions during his first term in office. {{sfn|Mills 2003|page=705}} The last scientific federally funded exploration expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823 led by [[Stephen Harriman Long|Stephen H. Harriman]] on the [[Red River of the North]]. Jackson's predecessor [[John Quincy Adams|John Q. Adams]] attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration expedition in 1828, but Congress was unwilling to fund the effort. When Jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed Adam's expedition plans. However, wanting to establish his presidential legacy, similar to [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], Jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second  term.{{sfn|Mills 2003|page=705}}   On May 18, 1836 Jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic [[United States Exploring Expedition]]. Jackson put Secretary of Navy [[Mahlon Dickerson]] in charge, to assemble suitable ships, officers, and scientific staff for the expedition; with a planned launch before Jackson's term of office expired. Dickerson however proved unfit for the task, preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838, under the next President, [[Martin Van Buren]]. {{sfn|Mills 2003|page=705}} One [[brig]] ship, {{USS|Porpoise|1836|6}}, later used in the expedition; having been laid down, built, and commissioned by Secretary Dickerson in May 1836, circumnavigated the world, explored and mapped the [[Southern Ocean]], confirming the existence of the [[Antarctica]] continent.<ref name=USSPO>{{cite web |title=USS Porpoise (1836-1854) |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-p/porpois2.htm |publisher=U.S. Navy |date=2014 |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref>

[[File:The times panic 1837.jpg|thumb|220px |right |A New York newspaper blamed the Panic of 1837 on Andrew Jackson who is depicted in spectacles and top hat]]
The national economy during the 1830s was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills. In January 1835, Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/04/15/135423586/when-the-u-s-paid-off-the-entire-national-debt-and-why-it-didnt-last?

Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836  contributed to the Panic of 1837, the [[Specie Circular]], that mandated Western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, that transferred federal monies from Eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks.{{sfn|Olson 2002|page=190}} Jackson's ''Specie Circular'', although designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, led many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver. {{sfn|Olson 2002|page=190}}  The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States.

==Later life and death==
[[File:78yo Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|right|Photographic copy of an 1845 [[daguerreotype]]]]
After serving two terms as president, Jackson retired to his [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|Hermitage plantation]] in 1837.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=121}} He immediately began putting the Hermitage in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son, Andrew Jr. Although he suffered ill health, Jackson remained influential in both national and state politics.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=121}} He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession, insisting, "I will die with the Union."<ref>James C. Curtis, ''Andrew Jackson and the search for vindication'' (1976) p 145</ref> Blamed for causing the [[Panic of 1837]], he was unpopular in his early retirement.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=121}} Jackson continued to denounce the "perfidy and treachery" of banks and urged his successor, [[Martin Van Buren]] to repudiate the ''Specie Circular''.{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=121}}

Jackson died at his plantation on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, of chronic [[tuberculosis]], [[dropsy]], and [[heart failure]]. According to a newspaper account from the ''Boon Lick Times'' read, "[he] fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed ... but he subsequently revived ... Gen. Jackson died at the Hermitage at 6&nbsp;o'clock P.M. on Sunday the 8th instant. When the messenger finally came, the old soldier, patriot and Christian was looking out for his approach. He is gone, but his memory lives, and will continue to live."<ref>{{cite news|title=Death of Gen.

In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr., except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members.<ref>{{cite book|last=Remini|first=Robert V.|title=Andrew Jackson: The Course of American Democracy, 1833–1845 (Volume 3)|year=2013|publisher=JHU Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-1-4214-1330-3|page=518|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra8-AAAAQBAJ&pg=PT518#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 15, 2014}}</ref>

==Family and personal life==

Shortly after Jackson first arrived in Nashville in 1788, he lived as a boarder with Rachel Stockley Donelson, the widow of [[John Donelson]]. Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter, [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel Donelson Robards]]. At the time, Rachel was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards; he was subject to fits of jealous rage.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kathleen Kennedy|author2=Sharon Rena Ullman|title=Sexual Borderlands: Constructing an American Sexual Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sWFu3IchEMC&pg=PA99|year=2003|publisher=Ohio State University Press|pages=99–101|isbn=978-0-8142-0927-1}}</ref> The two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. However, the divorce had never been completed, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson bigamous and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794.<ref>Remini, 17–25</ref> To complicate matters further, evidence shows that Rachel had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made.<ref>{{cite book

</ref> It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.

The controversy surrounding their marriage remained a sore point for Jackson, who deeply resented attacks on his wife's honor. By May 1806, [[Charles Dickinson (historical figure)|Charles Dickinson]] had published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper, and it resulted in a written challenge from Jackson to a [[duel]]. Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot, Jackson determined it would be best to let Dickinson turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness; Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson. Dickinson did fire first, hitting Jackson in the chest. The bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it was never safely removed. Under the rules of dueling, Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed him. Jackson's behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded killing and saddled Jackson with a reputation as a violent, vengeful man. As a result, he became a social outcast.<ref>H.W. Brands, ''Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times'' (2005) pp.&nbsp;139–43</ref>

Rachel died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828, two weeks after her husband's victory in the election and two months before Jackson took office as President. Jackson described her symptoms as "excruciating pain in the left shoulder, arm, and breast."<ref name="Brands">{{cite book |title=''Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times'' |last=Brands |first=H. W. |year=2005 |publisher=Anchor Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4000-3072-9}}</ref> After struggling for three days, Rachel finally died; a distraught Jackson had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body.<ref name="Brands" /> She had been under extreme stress during the election, and she never did well when Jackson was away at war or work. Jackson blamed [[John Quincy Adams]] for Rachel's death because the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] campaign of 1828 had repeatedly attacked the circumstances for Jackson's wedding to Rachel. He felt that this had hastened her death and never forgave Adams.<ref>Robert Remini, ''John Quincy Adams'' (2002) p. 119</ref>

Jackson had three adopted sons: Theodore, an Indian about whom little is known,<ref name="Theodore">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U5_y_jPH-QMC&pg=PA198&dq=Andrew+Jackson+indian+theodore#v=onepage&q=Andrew%20Jackson%20indian%20theodore&f=false|title=Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times|author=Brands, H.W.|page=198|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2005|isbn=1-4000-3072-2}}</ref> Andrew Jackson Jr., the son of Rachel's brother Severn Donelson, and Lyncoya, a Creek Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the Creek War. Lyncoya died of tuberculosis in 1828, at the age of sixteen.<ref>Remini 1:194</ref>

The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children. John Samuel Donelson, [[Daniel Smith Donelson]] and [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]] were the sons of Rachel's brother Samuel Donelson, who died in 1804. Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel's orphaned grand nephew. Caroline Butler, Eliza Butler, Edward Butler, and Anthony Butler were the orphaned children of Edward Butler, a family friend. They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father.<ref>''The Papers of Andrew Jackson: 1821–1824'' ed. Sam B. Smith, (1996) p 71</ref>

The widower Jackson invited Rachel's niece [[Emily Donelson]] to serve as hostess at the White House. Emily was married to [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]], who acted as Jackson's private secretary and in 1856 would run for Vice President on the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] ticket. The relationship between the President and Emily became strained during the [[Petticoat affair]], and the two became estranged for over a year. They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House hostess. [[Sarah Yorke Jackson]], the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr., became co-hostess of the White House in 1834. It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady. Sarah took over all hostess duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in 1836. Jackson used [[Rip Raps]] as a retreat, visiting between August 19, 1829 through August 16, 1835.<ref>Meacham, page 109; 315</ref>

===Temperament===

Jackson's quick temper was notorious. Brands says, "His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him and defamed even his wife, Rachel. He dueled in her defense and his own, suffering grievous wounds that left him with bullet fragments lodged about his body."<ref name="Brands" /> However, Remini is of the opinion that Jackson was often in control of his rage, and used it (and his fearsome reputation) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Remini|first=Robert|title=Andrew Jackson|year=1969|publisher=Harpercollins|isbn=978-0-06-080132-8}}</ref>

Brands also notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper:
:Observers likened him to a volcano, and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt.... His close associates all had stories of his blood-curling oaths, his summoning of the Almighty to loose His wrath upon some miscreant, typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition. Given his record – in duels, brawls, mutiny trials, and summary hearings – listeners had to take his vows seriously.<ref>Brands, p 297</ref>

On the last day of the presidency, Jackson admitted that he had but two regrets, that he "had been unable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C. Calhoun."<ref>Borneman, Walter R. ''Polk: The Man Who Transformed the Presidency and America''. New York: Random House, 2008 ISBN 978-1-4000-6560-8, p. 36.</ref>

===Physical appearance===
[[File:Tennessee Gentleman portrait of Andrew Jackson by Ralph E. W. Earl.jpg|thumb|right|''Tennessee Gentleman'', portrait of Jackson, c. 1831, from the collection of [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]].]]
Jackson was a lean figure, standing at 6 feet, 1 inch (1.85&nbsp;m) tall, and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds (64&nbsp;kg) on average. Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61. He had penetrating deep blue eyes. Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough, caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake.

===Religious faith===

About a year after retiring the presidency,<ref>{{cite book |title=Andrew Jackson |first=Sean |last= Wilentz |publisher=Macmillan |year= 2005 |page=160}}</ref> Jackson became a member of the [[Downtown Presbyterian Church, Nashville|First Presbyterian Church]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].

Jackson was a Freemason, having been initiated at Harmony Lodge No. 1 in Tennessee; he also participated in chartering several other lodges in Tennessee. He was the only U.S. president to have served as Grand Master of a state's Grand Lodge until [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1945. His Masonic apron is on display in the [[Tennessee State Museum]]. An obelisk and bronze Masonic plaque decorate his tomb at The Hermitage.<ref name="Tennessee State History">{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Andrew|title=Tennessee History|url=http://www.tennesseehistory.com/class/Jackson.htm|work=Masonic Research|publisher=tennesseehistory.com|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref><ref name=GLBC&Y>{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/textfiles/famous.html |title= Grand Lodge of British Columbia & Yukon's "A few famous freemasons" page |author=Trevor W.

==Legacy and memory==
Jackson remains one of the most studied and most controversial Americans  of the 19th century.<ref>Mark R. Cheathem, "'The Shape of Democracy': Historical Interpretations of Jacksonian Democracy", in ''The Age of Andrew Jackson,'' ed. Brian D. McKnight and James S. Humphreys (2011).</ref><ref>Sean Patrick Adams, ed., ''A Companion to the Era of Andrew Jackson'' (2013)</ref> Historian Charles Sellers says "Andrew Jackson's masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage."<ref>Charles Grier Sellers, Jr., "Andrew Jackson versus the Historians," ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1958) 44#4, pp. 615-634 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1886599 in JSTOR]</ref> His most controversial presidential actions included removal of the Indians from the southeast, the dismantling of the Bank of the United States, and his threat to use military force against the state of South Carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws. Not at all controversial was his great victory over the British at [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] in the last battle of the War of 1812. He was the main founder of the modern Democratic Party and remains its iconic hero; he was always a fierce partisan, with many friends and many enemies.<ref>Glyndon G. Van Deusen, ''The rise and decline of Jacksonian democracy'' (1970)</ref>

===Jackson on U.S. postage===
Andrew Jackson is one of the few American presidents ever to appear on U.S. Postage more than the usual two or three times. He died in 1845, but the U.S. Post Office did not release a [[U.S. Presidents on U.S. postage stamps|postage stamp]] in his honor until 18 years after his death, with the [[U.S. Presidents on U.S. Postage stamps#First appearances|issue of 1863]], a 2-cent black issue, commonly referred to by collectors as the '[[Black Jack (stamp)|Black Jack]]'. In contrast, the first [[Warren G. Harding]] stamp was released only one month after his death, Lincoln, one year exactly. As Jackson was a controversial figure in his day there is speculation that officials in Washington chose to wait a period of time before issuing a stamp with his portrait. In all, Jackson has appeared on [[U.S. presidents on U.S. postage stamps#Andrew Jackson|thirteen different U.S. postage stamps]], more than that of most U.S. presidents; only Washington, Lincoln, and Franklin (who was not a president) have appeared more often.<ref>Scotts US Stamp Catalogue</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Alexander&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Haimann,&nbsp;National Postal Museum |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&cmd=1&img=&mode=1&pg=1&tid=2027716 |title=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |publisher=Arago.si.edu |date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}</ref> During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued two [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States|Confederate postage stamps]] bearing Jackson's portrait, one a [[:File:Red Jack-2c.jpg|2-cent red stamp]] and the other a [[:File:Csa jackson 1862-2c.jpg|2-cent green stamp]], both issued in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|author=Patricia Kaufmann |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&cmd=1&mode=1&tid=2027898 |title=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |publisher=Arago.si.edu |date=May 9, 2006 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}</ref>
