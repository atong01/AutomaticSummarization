He was born near the end of the<space/><link><target>Colonial history of the United States</target><part>colonial era</part></link>, somewhere near the then-unmarked border between<space/><link><target>North Carolina</target><part>North</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>South Carolina</target></link>, into a recently immigrated<space/><link><target>Scotch-Irish American</target><part>Scots-Irish</part></link><space/>farming family of relatively modest means. During the<space/><link><target>American Revolutionary War</target></link><space/>Jackson, whose family supported the revolutionary cause, acted as a courier. He was captured, at age 13, and mistreated by his British captors. He later became a lawyer. He was elected to the<space/><link><target>U.S. House of Representatives</target></link>, and then to the<space/><link><target>U.S. Senate</target></link>. In 1801, Jackson was appointed colonel in the Tennessee militia, which became his political as well as military base. Jackson owned hundreds of slaves who worked on the<space/><link><target>The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)</target><part>Hermitage plantation</part></link><space/>which he acquired in 1804. Jackson killed a man in a duel in 1806, over a matter of honor regarding his wife<space/><link><target>Rachel Jackson</target><part>Rachel</part></link>. Jackson gained national fame through his role in the<space/><link><target>War of 1812</target></link>, most famously where he won a decisive victory over the main British invasion army at the<space/><link><target>Battle of New Orleans</target></link>. Jackson's army was then sent to Florida where he deposed the small Spanish garrison. This led directly to<space/><link><target>AdamsOns Treaty</target><part>the treaty</part></link><space/>which formally transferred Florida from Spain to the United States.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Election of 1824</target><part>Nominated for president in 1824</part></link>, Jackson narrowly lost to<space/><link><target>John Quincy Adams</target></link>. Jackson's supporters then founded what became the<space/><link><target>History of the Democratic Party (United States)</target><part>Democratic Party</part></link>.<space/><link><target>Election of 1828</target><part>Nominated again in 1828</part></link>, Jackson crusaded against Adams and the &quot;corrupt bargain&quot; between Adams and Henry Clay he said cost him the 1824 election. Building on his base in the West and new support from Virginia and New York, he won by a landslide. The Adams campaigners called him and his wife<space/><link><target>Rachel Jackson</target></link><space/>&quot;bigamists&quot;; she died just after the election and he called the slanderers &quot;murderers,&quot; swearing never to forgive them. His struggles with Congress were personified in his personal rivalry with<space/><link><target>Henry Clay</target></link>, whom Jackson deeply disliked, and who led the opposition (the emerging<space/><link><target>Whig Party (United States)</target><part>Whig Party</part></link>). As president, he faced a threat of secession from<space/><link><target>South Carolina</target></link><space/>over the &quot;<link><target>Tariff of Abominations</target></link>&quot; which Congress had enacted under Adams. In contrast to several of his immediate successors, he denied the right of a state to secede from the union, or to nullify federal law. The<space/><link><target>Nullification Crisis</target></link><space/>was defused when the tariff was amended and Jackson<space/><link><target>Force Bill</target><part>threatened</part></link><space/>the use of military force if South Carolina (or any other state) attempted to secede.</paragraph><paragraph>Congress attempted to reauthorize the<space/><link><target>Second Bank of the United States</target></link><space/>several years before the expiration of its charter, which he opposed. He vetoed the renewal of its charter in 1832, and dismantled it by the time its charter expired in 1836. Jackson's presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the &quot;<link><target>spoils system</target></link>&quot; in American politics. Also, he supported, signed, and enforced the<space/><link><target>Indian Removal Act</target></link>, which relocated a number of native tribes to<space/><link><target>Indian Territory</target></link><space/>(now<space/><link><target>Oklahoma</target></link>). He faced and defeated Henry Clay in the<space/><link><target>United States presidential election, 1832</target><part>1832 Presidential Election</part></link>, and opposed Clay generally. Jackson supported his vice president<space/><link><target>Martin Van Buren</target></link>, who was elected president in 1836. He worked to bolster the Democratic Party and helped his friend<space/><link><target>James K. Polk</target></link><space/>win the 1844 presidential election.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Early life and education</heading><paragraph>Jackson was born on March 15, 1767.

Jackson opposed the unpopular Pinckney treaty, desiring to completely destroy the Creek nation. Jackson was promoted Major General and given charge of the Seventh Military District, replacing Major General Thomas Flournoy. Jackson, now commanding general, immediately threw out Pinckney's treaty and forced severe terms upon both the Upper Creek enemies and the Lower Creek allies, wresting twenty-two million acres in present-day Georgia and Alabama from all the Creek for European-American settlement.<space/><template><target>sfn</target><arg>DSHeidler_JTHeidler 1997</arg><arg name="page">192</arg></template><space/>Jackson also confiscated land from Indians who had sided with the Americans.

Though the accusation was true, as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign, it was based on events that occurred many years prior (1791 to 1794). Jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him, but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife.

As such, there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the problem, and out of this developed a policy to relocate certain Indian populations.
