The '''Brittonic''', '''Brythonic''' or '''British Celtic''' languages ({{lang-cy|ieithoedd Brythonaidd/Prydeinig}}, {{lang-kw|yethow brythonek/predennek}}, {{lang-br|yezhoù predenek}}) form one of the two branches of the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] language family; the other is [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-k8QAAAAYAAJ |title=History of English: A Sketch of the Origin and Development of the English Language |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref> The name ''Brythonic'' was derived by [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Celtic studies|Celticist]] [[John Rhys]] from the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''Brython'', meaning an indigenous [[Britons (Celtic people)|Briton]] as opposed to an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] or [[Gaels|Gael]]. The name ''Brittonic'' derives ultimately from the name ''Prettanike'', recorded  by Greek authors for the [[British Isles]]. Some authors reserve the term ''Brittonic'' for the modified later Brittonic languages after about AD 600.

The Brittonic languages derive from the [[Common Brittonic]] language, spoken throughout [[Great Britain]] south of the [[Firth of Forth]] during the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Roman period]]. North of the Forth, the [[Pictish language]] is considered to be related; it is possible it was a Brittonic language, but it may have been a sister language. In the 5th and 6th centuries emigrating Britons also took Brittonic speech to the continent, most significantly in [[Brittany]]. During the next few centuries the language began to split into several dialects, eventually evolving into [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Breton language|Breton]], and [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]. Welsh and Breton continue to be spoken as native languages, while a revival in Cornish has led to an increase in speakers of that language. Cumbric is extinct, having been replaced by [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] and [[English language|English]] speech.  The [[Isle of Man]] may also have originally spoken a Brittonic language, later replaced with a Goidelic one.  Due to emigration, there are also communities of Brittonic language speakers in [[England]], [[France]], and [[Y Wladfa]] (the Welsh settlement in [[Patagonia]]).

==Name==
The names "Brittonic" and "Brythonic" are scholarly conventions referring to the [[Celtic languages]] of Britain and to the ancestral language they originated from, designated [[Common Brittonic]], in contrast to the [[Goidelic languages]] originating in Ireland. Both were created in the 19th century to avoid the ambiguity of earlier terms such as "British" and "Cymric".<ref name=OEDBrythonic>{{cite encyclopedia |year= |title = Brythonic, adj. and n. |encyclopedia= [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher= Oxford University Press |date= June 2013 |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/272106?redirectedFrom=Brythonic& |accessdate= July 17, 2013 | id= }}</ref> "Brythonic" was coined in 1879 by the Celticist [[John Rhys]] from the Welsh word ''Brython''.<ref name=OEDBrythonic/><ref name=Jackson>Jackson, p. 3.</ref> "Brittonic", derived from "[[Britons (Celtic people)|Briton]]" and also earlier spelled "Britonic" and "Britonnic", emerged later in the 19th century.<ref name=OEDBrittonic>{{cite encyclopedia |year= |title = Brittonic, adj. and n. |encyclopedia= [[OED Online]] |publisher= Oxford University Press |date= June 2013 |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/23485? |accessdate= July 17, 2013 | id= }}</ref> It became more prominent through the 20th century, and was used in [[Kenneth H. Jackson]]'s highly influential 1953 work on the topic, ''Language and History in Early Britain''. Jackson noted that by that time "Brythonic" had become a dated term, and that "of late there has been an increasing tendency to use Brittonic instead."<ref name=Jackson/> Today, "Brittonic" often replaces "Brythonic" in the literature.<ref name=OEDBrittonic/> [[Rudolf Thurneysen]] used "Britannic" in his influential ''A Grammar of Old Irish'', though this never became popular among subsequent scholars.<ref name=Koch305>{{cite book |last= Koch |first= John T. |authorlink= John T.

Comparable historical terms include the [[Medieval Latin]] ''lingua Britannica'' and ''sermo Britannicus''<ref>{{cite book |last= Koch |first= John T. |authorlink= John T.

Jackson, and later [[John T. Koch]], use "British" only for the early phase of the Common Brittonic language.<ref name=Koch305/>

Prior to Jackson's work, "Brittonic" (and "Brythonic") were often used for all the [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|P-Celtic languages]], including not just the varieties in Britain but those [[Continental Celtic languages]] that similarly experienced the evolution of the [[Proto-Celtic language]] element /kʷ/ to /p/. However, subsequent writers have tended to follow Jackson's scheme, rendering this use obsolete.<ref name=Koch305/>

==Evidence==
Knowledge of the Brittonic languages comes from a variety of sources. For the early languages information is obtained from coins, inscriptions and comments by classical writers as well as place names and personal names recorded by them. For later languages there is information from medieval writers and modern native speakers, together with place names. The names recorded in the Roman period are given in Rivet and Smith.

==Characteristics==
{{split section|Proto-Brythonic language|date=April 2015}}
The Brittonic branch is also referred to as '''P-Celtic''' because [[linguistic reconstruction]] of the Brittonic reflex of the Proto-Indo-European phoneme *''k<sup>w</sup>'' is ''p'' as opposed to Goidelic ''c''. Such nomenclature usually implies an acceptance of the P-Celtic and Q-Celtic hypothesis rather than the Insular Celtic hypothesis because the term includes certain Continental Celtic languages as well. (for a discussion, see [[Celtic languages]]).

Other major characteristics include:
* The treatment of -''m'', -''n'' as -''am'', -''an''.
* Celtic /w/ (written ''u'' in Latin texts and ''ou'' in Greek) became ''gw-'' in initial position, ''-w-'' internally, where in Gaelic it is ''f-'' in initial position and disappears internally:
** Proto-Celtic ''*windos'' "white" became Welsh ''gwyn'', Cornish ''gwynn'', Breton ''gwenn''. Contrast Irish ''fionn'' "fair".
** Proto-Celtic ''*wassos'' "servant, young man" became Welsh, Cornish and Breton ''gwas''
Initial ''s-'':
* Initial ''s-'' followed by a vowel was changed to ''h-'':
** Welsh ''hen'' "old", ''hir'' "long", ''hafal'' "similar"
** Breton ''hen'' "ancient", ''hir'' "long", ''hañval'' "similar"
** Cornish ''hen'' "ancient", ''hir'' "long", ''haval'' "similar"
** Contrast Irish ''sean'' "old", ''síor'' "long", ''samhail'' "similarity"
* Initial ''s-'' was lost before /l/, /m/ and /n/:
** ''*slemon'' became Welsh ''llyfn'', Cornish ''leven'' and Breton ''levn'' "smooth". Contrast Irish ''sleamhain'' "smooth, slimely"
** ''*smeru'' became Welsh ''mêr'' "marrow". Contrast Irish ''sméar''
* The initial clusters ''sp-, sr-, sw-'' became ''f-, fr-, chw-'':
** *''sɸera'' became Welsh ''ffer''
** *''srogna'' "nostril" became Welsh ''ffroen'', Cornish ''frig'' and Breton ''froen''. Contrast Irish ''srón''
** *''swero'' "toy, game" became Welsh ''chwarae'' and Breton ''c'hoari'' (but Cornish ''gwari'')
Lenition:
* Voiceless stops become voiced stops in intervocalic position:
* Voiced plosives /b/, /d/, /g/(later /j/, then lost), and /m/ became soft spirants in an intervocalic position and before liquids:
** Welsh ''dd''[ð], ''th''[θ], ''f'' [v]
** Cornish ''dh'' [ð], ''th'' [θ], ''v'' [v]
** Breton ''z'', ''zh'', ''v''
Voiceless spirants:
* Geminated voiceless plosives transformed into spirants; /pː/(pp), /kː/(cc), /tː/(tt) became /ɸ/(later /f/), /x/(ch/c'h), /θ/(th/z) before a vowel or liquid:
** ''*cippus'' > Breton ''kef'', Cornish ''kyf'', Welsh ''cyff'', "tree trunk"
** ''*cattos'' > Breton ''kazh'', Cornish ''kath'', Welsh ''cath'', "cat" vs. Irish ''cat''
** ''*bucca'' > Breton ''boc'h'', Cornish ''bogh'', Welsh ''boch'', "cheek"
* Voiceless stops become spirants after liquids:
** ''*artos'' "bear" became Welsh ''arth''
Nasal assimilation:
* Voiced stops were assimilated to a preceding nasal:
* Brittonic retains original nasals before -t, whereas Goidelic alters ''-nt'' to ''-d'':
** Breton ''kant'' "hundred" vs. Irish ''céad''

Brittonic languages in use today are [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]]. Welsh and Breton have been spoken continuously since they formed. For all practical purposes Cornish died out during the 18th or 19th centuries, but a revival movement has more recently created small numbers of new speakers. Also notable are the extinct language [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], and possibly the extinct [[Pictish language|Pictish]] although this may be best considered to be a sister of the Brittonic languages. The late [[Kenneth H. Jackson]] argued during the 1950s, from some of the few remaining examples of stone inscriptions, that the Picts may have also used a non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language, but some modern scholars of Pictish do not agree.

==History and origins==
[[File:Map Gaels Brythons Picts.png|thumb|right|250px|Britain & Ireland in the early–mid 1st millennium, before the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|founding of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]].

The modern Brittonic languages are generally considered to all derive from a common ancestral language termed ''Brittonic'', ''British'', ''Common Brittonic'', ''Old Brittonic'' or ''Proto-Brittonic'', which is thought to have developed from Proto-Celtic or early Insular Celtic by the 6th century BC.<ref>{{cite book| title=An Atlas for Celtic Studies| first=John T.| last=Koch| publisher=Oxbow Books| location=Oxford| year=2007| isbn=978-1-84217-309-1}}</ref>

Brittonic languages were probably spoken prior to the Roman invasion at least in the majority of [[Great Britain]] south of the rivers [[River Forth|Forth]] and [[River Clyde|Clyde]], though the [[Isle of Man]] later had a Goidelic language, [[Manx language|Manx]]. Northern Scotland mainly spoke [[Common Brittonic#Pritenic|Pritennic]], which became the [[Pictish language]], which may have been a Brittonic language like that of its neighbors. The theory has been advanced (notably by [[O'Rahilly's historical model|T. F. O'Rahilly]]) that part of [[Ireland]] spoke a Brittonic language, usually termed ''Ivernic'', before it was displaced by [[Primitive Irish]], although the authors Dillon and Chadwick reject this theory as being implausible.

During the period of the Roman occupation of [[England and Wales]] (AD 43 to c. 410), Common Brittonic borrowed a large stock of [[Latin]] words, both for concepts unfamiliar in the pre-urban society of Celtic Britain such as urbanisation and new tactics of warfare as well as for rather more mundane words which displaced native terms (most notably, the word for "fish" in all the Brittonic languages derives from the Latin ''piscis'' rather than the native *''ēskos'' - which may survive, however, in the Welsh name of the [[River Usk]], {{lang|cy|''Wysg''}}). Approximately 800 of these Latin loan-words have survived in the three modern Brittonic languages.

It is probable that at the start of the Post-Roman period ''Common Brittonic'' was differentiated into at least two major dialect groups – Southwestern and Western (in addition we may posit additional dialects, such as Eastern Brittonic, spoken in what is now the [[East of England]], which have left little or no evidence). Between the end of the Roman occupation and the mid 6th century the two dialects began to diverge into recognisably separate languages, the Western into Cumbric and Welsh and the Southwestern into Cornish and its closely related sister language Breton, which was carried to continental [[Armorica]]. Jackson showed that a few of the dialect distinctions between West and Southwest Brittonic go back a long way. New divergencies began around AD 500 but other changes which were shared occurred in the 6th century.  Other common changes occurred in the 7th century onward and are possibly due to inherent tendencies. Thus the concept of a common Brittonic language ends by AD 600. Substantial numbers of Britons certainly remained in the expanding area controlled by [[Anglo-Saxons]], but over the fifth and sixth centuries they mostly adopted the [[English language]].<ref>R. Fleming, ''Britain After Rome'' (2011), p. 45-119.</ref><ref>H. Tristram, "Why Don't the English Speak Welsh?", in Higham (ed.), ''Britons in Anglo-Saxon England'' (2007), p. 192-214.</ref><ref>D. White, "On the Areal Pattern of ‘Brittonicity’ in
English and Its Implications" (Austin, Texas, 2010).</ref>

The Brittonic languages spoken in what is now [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]] and what is now [[England]] began to be displaced in the 5th century through the settlement of Irish-speaking [[Gaels]] and [[Germanic peoples]]. The displacement of the languages of Brittonic descent was probably complete in all of Britain except [[Cornwall]] and [[Wales]] and the English counties bordering these areas such as [[Devon]] by the 11th century.

The regular [[consonant]]al [[sound change]]s from Proto-Celtic to Welsh, Cornish and Breton are summarised in the following table. Where the graphemes have a different value from the corresponding IPA symbols, the IPA equivalent is indicated between slashes. V represents a vowel; C represents a consonant.

==Remnants in England, Scotland and Ireland==

===Place names and river names===
{{further|Celtic toponymy|Toponymy in the United Kingdom and Ireland}}
The principal legacy left behind in those territories from which the Brittonic languages were displaced is that of [[toponymy|toponyms]] (place names) and [[hydronym]]s (river names). There are many Brittonic place names in lowland Scotland and in the parts of England where it is agreed that substantial Brittonic speakers remained (Brittonic names, apart from those of the former Romano-British towns, are scarce over most of England). Names derived (sometimes indirectly) from Brittonic include [[London]], [[Penicuik]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Aberdeen]], [[York]], [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], [[Dover]] and [[Colchester]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Brittonic elements found in England include ''bre-'' and ''bal-'' for hills, while some such as combe or [[cwm (landform)|coomb(e)]] for a small deep valley and [[tor (rock formation)|tor]] for a hill are examples of Brittonic words that were borrowed into English. Others reflect the presence of Britons such as [[Dumbarton]] – from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''Dùn Breatainn'' meaning "Fort of the Britons", or Walton meaning a ''tun'' or settlement where the ''[[walhaz|Wealh]]'' "Britons" still lived.

The number of Celtic river names in England generally increases from east to west, a map showing these being given by Jackson. These names include ones such as Avon, Chew, Frome, Axe, Brue and Exe, but also river names containing the elements "der-/dar-/dur-" and "-went" e.g. "Derwent, Darwen, Deer, Adur, Dour, Darent, Went". In fact these names exhibit multiple different Celtic roots. One is *dubri- "water" [Bret. "dour", C. "dowr", W. "dŵr"], also found in the place-name "Dover" (attested in the Roman period as "Dubrīs"); this is the original source of rivers named "Dour". Another is *deru̯o- "oak" or "true" [Bret. "derv", C. "derow", W. "derw"), coupled with two agent suffixes, *-ent- and *-iū; this is the origin of "Derwent", " Darent" and "Darwen" (attested in the Roman period as "Deru̯entiō"). The final root to be examined is "went". In Roman Britain there were three tribal capitals named "U̯entā" (modern Winchester, Caerwent and Caistor St Edmunds), whose meaning was 'place, town'.<ref>Matasović, Ranko (2009). ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'', p. 413. Brill, Leiden-Boston. ISBN 978-90-04-17336-1</ref>

===Brittonicisms in English===
{{main|Brittonicisms in English}}
{{further|List of English words of Brittonic origin}}
Some have argued that Celtic has acted as a substrate to English for both the lexicon and syntax. It is generally accepted that linguistic effects on English were lexically rather poor aside from toponyms, consisting of a few domestic words, which '''may''' include hubbub, dad,  [[peat]], [[bucket]], crock, crumpet (cf. Br. ''krampouz''), noggin, gob (cf. Gaelic ''gob''), nook; and the dialectal term for a [[badger]], i.e. ''brock'' (cf. Welsh ''broch'', C. ''brogh'' and Gaelic ''broc''). Another legacy may be the sheep-counting system [[Yan tan tethera|Yan Tan Tethera]] in the west, in the traditionally Celtic areas of England such as [[Cumbria]]. Several Cornish mining words are still in use in English language mining terminology, such as [[costean]], [[gunnies]], and [[vug]].<ref>''Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms'' by American Geological Institute and U S Bureau of Mines (pages 128, 249, and 613)</ref>

Those who argue against the theory of a Brittonic substratum and heavy influence point out that many toponyms have no semantic continuation from the Brittonic language. A notable example is "Avon" which comes from the Celtic term for river ''abona''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Avon&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref> or the Welsh term for river "afon" but was used by the English as a personal name. Likewise the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire]] contains the word ''usa'' which merely means water<ref>A. Room (ed.) 1992: ''Brewer's Dictionary of Names'', Oxford: Helicon, p. 396-7.</ref> and the name of the river Trent simply comes from the Welsh word for a trepasser (''an over-flowing river'')<ref name=ecec>{{cite book 
  | last = Hickey
  | first = Raymond
  | title = 'Early Contact And Parallels Between English and Celtic.' in 'Vienna English Working Papers'}}
</ref>
It has been argued that the use of [[periphrastic]] constructions (using [[auxiliary verb]]s like ''do'' and ''be'' in the continuous/progressive) in the English [[verb]], which is more widespread than in the other [[Germanic languages]], is traceable to Brittonic influence. Some however find this very unlikely and claim a native English development rather than Celtic influence, though Roberts postulates Northern Germanic influence, despite such constructions not existing in Norse.<ref name=roberts>{{cite book 
  | last = Roberts
  | first = Ian G.
  | title = 'Verbs and diachronic syntax: a comparative history of English and French
Volume 28 of Studies in natural language and linguistic theory
Volume 28 of NATO Asi Series. Series C, Mathematical and Physical Science'}}
</ref> Literary Welsh has the simple present ''Caraf'' = ''I love'' and the present stative (al. continuous/progressive)  ''Yr wyf yn caru'' = ''I am loving'', where the Brittonic syntax is partly mirrored in English (Note that ''I am loving'' comes from older ''I am a-loving'', from still older ''ich am on luvende'' "I am in the process of loving"). In the Germanic sister languages of English there is only have one form, for example ''Ich liebe'' in German, though in ''colloquial'' German, a progressive aspect form has evolved which is formally similar to those found in Celtic languages, and somewhat less similar to the Modern English form, e.g. ''Ich bin am Arbeiten'' "I am working", literally: "I am on the working". A similar structure is also found in modern Dutch (''Ik zit te werken'', lit "I sit to work"). These parallel developments suggest that the English progressive is not necessarily due to Celtic influence; moreover, the native Englsh development of the structure can be traced over the over 1000 years of English literature.

Some researchers (Filppula ''et al.'', 2001)  argue that English syntax reflects more extensive Brittonic influences.<ref name="ecec"/><ref name=Gelderen>{{cite book 
  | last = van Gelderen
  | first = Elly
  | title = 'A History of the English Language'}}
</ref> For instance, in English [[tag question]]s, the form of the tag depends on the verb form in the main statement (''aren't I?'', ''isn't he?'', ''won't we?'' etc.). The German ''nicht wahr?'' and the French ''n'est-ce pas?'', by contrast, are fixed forms which can be used with almost any main statement. It has been claimed that the English system has been borrowed from Brittonic, since Welsh tag questions vary in almost exactly the same way.<ref name="ecec"/><ref name="Gelderen"/> However, as these are fairly late developments in English and even later in Welsh and Gaelic, it is more probable that the Celtic languages borrowed the structure from English.

===Brittonic effect on the Goidelic languages===
Far more notable, but less well known, are Brittonic influences on [[Scottish Gaelic]], though Scottish and Irish Gaelic, with their wider range of preposition-based periphastic constructions, suggest that such constructions descend from their common Celtic heritage. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but as there is a far greater overlap in terms of Celtic vocabulary, than with English, it is not always possible to disentangle P- and Q-Celtic words. However some common words such as ''monadh'' = Welsh ''mynydd'' Cumbric ''*monidh'' are particularly evident.

Often the Brittonic influence on Scots Gaelic is indicated by considering [[Irish language]] usage, which is not likely to have been influenced so much by Brittonic. In particular, the word ''srath'' ([[Anglicisation|Anglicise]]d as "Strath") is a native Goidelic word, but its usage appears to have been modified by the Brittonic cognate ''ystrad'' whose meaning is slightly different. The effect on Irish has been the loan from British of many Latin-derived words. This has been associated with the Christianisation of Ireland from Britain.
