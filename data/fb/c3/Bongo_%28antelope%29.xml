Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally, they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner and rarely serious fights take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their necks, roll their eyes, and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly pacing back and forth in front of the other male. They seek out females only during mating time.<extension extension_name='ref'>Estes, Richard D.

The programme estimate as few as 140 animals left in the wild spread across four isolated populations. Whilst captive breeding programmes can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe and North America, the situation in the wild has been less promising. Evidence exists of bongo surviving in Kenya. However, these populations are believed to be small, fragmented, and vulnerable to extinction.</paragraph><paragraph>Animal populations with impoverished genetic diversity are inherently less able to adapt to changes in their environments (such as climate change, disease outbreaks, habitat change, etc.). The isolation of the four remaining small bongo populations, which themselves would appear to be in decline, means a substantial amount of genetic material is lost each generation. Whilst the population remains small, the impact of transfers will be greater, so the establishment of a &quot;metapopulation management plan&quot; occurs concurrently with conservation initiatives to enhance<space/><italics>in situ</italics><space/>population growth, and this initiative is both urgent and fundamental to the future survival of mountain bongo in the wild.</paragraph><paragraph>The western/lowland bongo faces an ongoing population decline as habitat destruction and hunting pressures increase with the relentless expansion of human settlement. Its long-term survival will only be assured in areas which receive active protection and management. At present, such areas comprise about 30,000&amp;nbsp;km<xhtml:sup>2</xhtml:sup>, and several are in countries where political stability is fragile. So, a realistic possibility exists whereby its status could decline to Threatened in the near future.</paragraph><paragraph>As the largest and most spectacular forest antelope, the western/lowland bongo is both an important flagship species for protected areas such as national parks, and a major trophy species which has been taken in increasing numbers in Central Africa by sport hunters during the 1990s.<extension extension_name='ref' name="j1"><template><target>Cite journal</target><arg name="doi"><space/>10.1046/j.1365-3008.1999.00079.x

The situation is exacerbated because these animals are spread across four isolated populations. Whilst the bongo endangered species program can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe, it has not yet become actively involved in the conservation of this species in the wild in a coordinated fashion. The plan is to engage in conservation activities in Kenya to assist in reversing the decline of the eastern bongo populations and genetic diversity in Africa, and in particular, applying population management expertise to help ensure the persistence of genetic diversity in the free ranging wild populations.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Baby Bongo 002.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>A baby eastern bongo at<space/><link><target>Louisville Zoo</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Kentucky</target></link></part></link>To illustrate significance of genetic diversity loss, assume the average metapopulation size is 35 animals based on 140 animals spread across four populations (140/4=35). Assuming stable populations, these populations will lose 8% of their genetic diversity every decade. By managing all four populations as one, through strategic transfers, gene loss is reduced from 8% to 2% per decade, without any increase in bongo numbers in Kenya. By managing the European and African populations as one by strategic exports from Europe combined with<space/><italics>in situ</italics><space/>transfers, gene loss is reduced to 0.72% every 100 years, with both populations remaining stable. If populations in Kenya are allowed to grow through the implementation of effective conservation, including strategic transfers, gene loss can be effectively halted in this species and its future secured in the wild.</paragraph><paragraph>The initial aims of the project are:<space/></paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>Through faecal<space/><link><target>DNA</target></link><space/>analysis, estimate the genetic diversity of the remaining wild bongos and calculate the relatedness of the isolated wild populations.</listitem><listitem>More accurately estimate the total population of wild bongos through faecal DNA analysis, camera trapping, and transect surveying.</listitem><listitem>Through direct sampling, estimate the genetic diversity of the captive bongo population and calculate its relatedness with the remaining isolated wild populations.</listitem><listitem>Collect DNA samples from western bongos to calculate the relatedness of the two subspecies.</listitem><listitem>Fund rangers to collect the above data in Kenya, enhance the degree of protection afforded to and level of understanding of the eastern bongos' ecological needs.</listitem><listitem>To realise such a metapopulation management plan, work with local communities is essential to reverse the decline and allow for the implementation of a transfer strategy.
