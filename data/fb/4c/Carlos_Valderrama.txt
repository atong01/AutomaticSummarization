{{spanish name 2|Valderrama|Palacio}}
'''Carlos Alberto Valderrama Palacio''' ({{IPA-es|ˈkarlos alˈberto βaldeˈrama paˈlasjo}};<ref>[[Colombian Spanish]] pronunciation.</ref> born September 2, 1961 in [[Santa Marta]], [[Colombia]]), also known as ''El Pibe'' ("The Kid") is a Colombian former [[association football|football player]]. His distinctive blond hair, coupled with his flamboyant technique on the ball, made him one of Colombia's most recognizable [[Association football|footballers]], and arguably, one of the most recognizable footballers around the globe historically.

Valderrama was a member of the [[Colombia national football team]] in the 1990s. Between 1985 and 1998 he represented [[Colombia]] in 111 full internationals and scored 11 times, making him the most capped [[Association footballer|player]] in the country's history. Valderrama was known for the accuracy of his passing and assisting, his vision and tactical brain, which allowed him to have a strong presence without the necessity of running as much as it would be expected, his precise technique on the ball, and his clean assists.<ref>http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1451394.html</ref><ref>[http://www.fifa.com/newscentre/features/news/newsid=1619243/index.html?intcmp=newsreader_news_box_4 Boots and a bouffant - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-06-15/features/9406150766_1_baggio-great-soccer-players-goals-in-world|title=Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness|publisher=The Orlando Sentinel|author1=Mike Zizzo|date=15 June 1994|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref> Valderrama played a huge role during the golden era of Colombian football during the 1990s. In 2004, Valderrama was included in the [[FIFA 100]], a list of "greatest living footballers" chosen by [[Pelé]] to celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[FIFA]].

At the end of his career Valderrama played in [[Major League Soccer]] joining the league in its first season. The most recognisable player in the league at the time, he helped popularise the league during the 1990s and attract other foreign footballers to ply their trade in the league. To this day, he is an icon as one of the most decorated [[playmaker]]s to ever play in MLS.<ref>http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1614638.html</ref><ref name="mlssoccer1">[http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/03/08/colombians-mls-stability-status-influence-recent-shift Colombians in MLS: Stability, status influence recent shift | MLSsoccer.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/19/mls-colombia-colombians-portland-timbers-diego-chara Why are so many Colombians keen to play in MLS? | Football | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2010/10/19/2172421/colombia-makes-an-impact-on-major-league-soccer Colombia Makes An Impact On Major League Soccer - Goal.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Career==
Valderrama began his career at [[Unión Magdalena]] of the Colombian First Division in 1981. He also played for [[Millonarios]] and [[Deportivo Cali]] before joining the [[Montpellier Hérault SC|Montpellier]] of the [[Ligue 1|French First Division]] in 1988. He then went on to play for [[Independiente Medellín]] and then [[Atlético Junior]], for whom he won the Colombian championship in 1993 and 1995. In 1996, he went to the US to play for the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] (1996–97, 2000–01), [[Miami Fusion]] (1998–99), and [[Colorado Rapids]] (2001–02). While a member of the Mutiny, the team would sell Carlos Valderrama wigs at [[Tampa Stadium]]. In [[Major League Soccer]], Valderrama scored relatively few goals (16) for a midfielder, but is the league's second all-time leader in assists (114) after [[Steve Ralston]] (121), a former teammate. In 2005, he was named to the [[MLS All-Time Best XI]]. He was also named one of the top players of the 20th century by [[Pelé]] in 1999.<ref>[[FIFA 100]]</ref>
he was one of the best player in history

== MLS career ==
Valderrama began his [[Major League Soccer]] career with the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] in the league's inaugural year of 1996, and won its first [[Major League Soccer MVP Award|Most Valuable Player award]]. In 2000 Valderrama recorded the only 20+ assist season in MLS history—ending the season with 26—a record that remains intact today, and which MLS itself suggested was an "unbreakable" record in a 2012 article.<ref>[http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2012/06/22/power-5-unbreakable-records-valderramas-26-assists-2000 Power 5 Unbreakable Records - Valderrama's 26 assists in 2000 | MLSsoccer.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Valderrama remained in the league until 2002, playing for the Mutiny, [[Miami Fusion]], and the [[Colorado Rapids]] in his eight-year American soccer career.<ref>[http://www.mlssoccer.com/players/carlos-valderrama Carlos Valderrama | MLSsoccer.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Retirement as player==
In February 2004, Valderrama ended his 22-year career in a tribute match at the Metropolitan stadium of [[Barranquilla]], with some of the most important football players of South America, such as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Enzo Francescoli]] and [[José Luis Chilavert]].

Valderrama has since become assistant manager of [[Atlético Junior]]. On November 1, 2007, Valderrama accused a referee of corruption by waving cash in the face of Oscar Julian Ruiz when the official awarded a penalty to [[América de Cali]]. Junior lost the match 4–1, which ended the club's hopes of playoff qualification.<ref>[[Associated Press|AP]] (2007), [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2007-11-01-3659438715_x.htm Valderrama expelled from match for taunting referee with cash], [[USA Today]], 1 November 2007, usatoday.com. Retrieved 10 July 2008.</ref>

==Playing style==

Although Valderrama was known for being a "classic number ten" player, as was typical of South American sides of that era, in reality, Valderrama was tactically speaking a deep lying playmaker, which is a fundamentally different role than that of the traditional classic number ten player.<ref>[http://chihasbagliatopagliuca.blogspot.com/2012/08/how-maturana-changed-football.html Chi ha sbagliato Pagliuca?: How Maturana changed football<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Valderrama's instantly striking features where, of course, his hair, but perhaps more importantly, his very quick and electric feet; his footwork was similar to that of much smaller and shorter players, which for a player of Valderrama's build and height is not a common physical feature. Although his passing ability was considered to be no lesser than the best European players of the time, it was his ability for shielding the ball that differentiated him from most of his peers; his ball retention ability was always the subject of praise, not only effective from a practical stand point, but also unique from an aesthetic stand point, which marked out Valderrama as an interesting player to watch.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=87394/index.html Valderrama: an artist’s short spell in Montpellier - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In that respect, Laurent Blanc who played with Valderrama in Montpellier, described Valderrama perhaps more accurately than anyone else, when he said “In the fast and furious European game he wasn’t always at his ease. He was a natural exponent of ‘toque’, keeping the ball moving. But he was so gifted that we could give him the ball when we didn’t know what else to do with it knowing he wouldn’t lose it… and often he would do things that most of us only dream about!”.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Most people tend to remember Valderrama mostly for his hair and then for his passing ability, but in reality his strongest attributes were his ball retention ability and his aesthetic value as an artistic entertainer, which Laurent Blanc described so concisely and yet so accurately.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Valderrama's passing was highly accurate to the point where he held a consistent rate of assists and getting involved in plays that often related to goals. This also involved free kicks, whether supporting his teammates, or attempt on goal. His creativity made him very influential, to the point where he became a known legend throughout South America, and eventually throughout the world of football.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/145/139/4/index.html Valderrama: Colombia aren’t creative enough - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/news/newsid=2167928/index.html The day Colombia rocked the Monumental - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="autogenerated2"/>

Aside from his passing talents, Valderrama held very precise ball-control and dribbling abilities that was supported by quick reactions, and his disciplined mindset. This allowed him to perform impressive plays that have been highlighted throughout his career.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCpLicqLvOA 1996 Valderrama vs West MLS All star - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="youtube1">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp7vf5So3_k MLS LEGENDS | Carlos "El Pibe" Valderrama - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="youtube1"/> Overall, Valderrama had proven to be an extremely selfless player for both club, and nation.<ref name="mlssoccer1"/><ref name="youtube2">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7A5smuVFs8 Carlos VALDERRAMA keep and pass compilation - christinayan - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="youtube2"/>

One of his most impressive moments, was during the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] last group stage match against [[German national football team|Germany]]. In a game where Colombia needed at least a draw to survive into the next round, [[Pierre Littbarski]] scored what appeared to be the winning goal in the 88th minute. However, within the last seconds of extra time, Valderrama made a crucial pass to [[Freddy Rincon]] who equalized immediately and saved Colombia into the next round.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ami5tGXM0VU Italia 90 Mundial World Cup 1990 Germany v Colombia - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Personal life==
Valderrama is married and has three children.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Valderrama was the only Colombian to feature in FIFA's [[FIFA 100|125 Top Living Football Players list]] in March 2004. He is currently a coach for a football academy called Clearwater Galactics <ref>https://www.facebook.com/galacticsfc</ref> in [[Clearwater, Florida]].
