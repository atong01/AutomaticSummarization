There were several tribes in the country who fought against each other frequently. The<space/><link><target>Eburones</target></link><space/>were ruled by Ambiorix and<space/><link><target>Catuvolcus</target></link>. In 54 BC Caesar's troops urgently needed more food, and so the local tribes were forced to give up part of their<space/><link><target>harvest</target></link>, which had not been good that year. Understandably the<space/><link><target>starving</target></link><space/>Eburones were reluctant to do so and Caesar ordered that<space/><link><target>Military camp</target><part>camps</part></link><space/>be built near the Eburones' villages.

Roman troops led by Q. Titurius Sabinus and L. Aurunculeius Cotta were wintering among the Eburones when they were attacked by them, led by Ambiorix and Cativolcus. Ambiorix deceived the Romans, telling them the attack was made without his consent, and further advised them to flee as a large Germanic force was preparing to cross the Rhine. Trusting Ambiorix, Sabinus and Cotta's troops left the next morning. A short distance from their camp, the Roman troops were ambushed by the Eburones and massacred.</paragraph><paragraph>Elsewhere, another Roman force under<space/><link><target>Quintus Tullius Cicero</target><part>Q. Tullius Cicero</part></link>, brother of the orator<space/><link><target>Marcus Tullius Cicero</target><part>Marcus</part></link>, were wintering amongst the Nervii. Leading a coalition of rebellious Belgic tribes, Ambiorix surrounded Cicero's camp. After a long while, a Roman messenger was finally able to slip through the Belgic lines and get word of the uprising to Caesar. Mobilizing his legions, Caesar immediately marched to Cicero's aid. As they approached the besieged Roman camp, the Belgae moved to engage Caesar's troops. Vastly outnumbered, Caesar ordered his troops to appear confused and frightened, and they successfully lured the Belgae to attack them on ground favourable to the Romans. Caesar's forces launched a fierce counterattack, and soon put the Belgae to flight. Later, Caesar's troops entered Cicero's camp to find most of the men wounded.</paragraph><paragraph>Meanwhile, Indutiomarus, a leader of the Treveri, began to harass the camp of Labienus on a daily basis, eventually provoking Labienus to send out his cavalry with specific orders to kill Indutiomarus. They did so, and routed the remnants of the late Indutiomarus's army. Caesar personally remained in Gaul for the remainder of winter due to the renewed Gallic threat.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Caesar's revenge</heading><paragraph>When the<space/><link><target>Roman senate</target></link><space/>heard what had happened, Caesar swore to put down all the Belgic tribes.

A Belgic attack on Q. Tullius Cicero, then stationed with a legion in the territory of the<space/><link><target>Nervii</target></link>, failed due to the timely appearance of Caesar. The Roman campaigns against the Belgae took a few years, but eventually the tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned. The Eburones disappeared from history after this genocidal event. According to the writer<space/><link><target>Florus</target></link>, Ambiorix and his men succeeded in crossing the<space/><link><target>Rhine</target></link><space/>and disappeared without a trace.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>Florus</target></link>, iii. 10. 8</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Legacy</heading><paragraph>Caesar wrote about Ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the Gauls,<space/><italics><link><target>De Bello Gallico</target></link></italics>.
