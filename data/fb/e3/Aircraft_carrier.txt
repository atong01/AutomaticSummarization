An '''aircraft carrier''' is a [[warship]] that serves as a seagoing [[airbase]], equipped with a full-length [[flight deck]] and facilities for [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Dictionary|publisher=Reference|contribution-url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aircraft%20carrier|contribution=Aircraft carrier}}</ref> Typically, it is the [[capital ship]] of a fleet, as it allows a [[navy|naval force]] to [[power projection|project]] [[air power]] worldwide without depending on [[staging area|local bases for staging aircraft operations]]. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Aircraft carriers have evolved from converted cruisers to [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered warships]] that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft.

There is no single definition of an "aircraft carrier",<ref name="gscarrier">{{Citation|title=Military|publisher=Global Security|url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/carriers.htm|contribution=World Wide Aircraft Carriers}}</ref> and modern navies use several variants of the type. These variants are sometimes categorized as sub-types of aircraft carriers,<ref>{{Citation|title=Encyclopaedia|publisher=Britannica| contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/10957/aircraft-carrier | contribution = Aircraft Carrier|quote=Subsequent design modifications produced such variations as the light carrier, equipped with large amounts of electronic gear for the detection of submarines, and the helicopter carrier, intended for conducting amphibious assault.&nbsp;... Carriers with combined capabilities are classified as multipurpose carriers.}}</ref> and sometimes as distinct types of [[naval aviation]]-capable ships.<ref name="gscarrier"/><ref>[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=4200&tid=400&ct=4 United States Navy fact file: Amphibious Assault Ships – LHA/LHD/LHA(R)]</ref> Aircraft carriers may be classified according to the type of aircraft they carry and their operational assignments. [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] Sir [[Mark Stanhope]], former [[First Sea Lord|head]] of the [[Royal Navy]], has said that "To put it simply, countries that aspire to strategic international influence have aircraft carriers".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18706505 "Aircraft carriers crucial, Royal Navy chief warns."] ''BBC'', 4 July 2012.</ref>

Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy [[balloon]]s to [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] warships that carry dozens of aircraft, including fighter jets and helicopters. As of {{date}}, there are thirty-seven active aircraft carriers in the world within twelve navies. The [[United States Navy]] has 10 large nuclear-powered carriers (known as [[supercarrier]]s, carrying up to 90 aircraft each), the largest carriers in the world; the total deckspace is over twice that of all other nations' combined.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-carrier-gap-could-see-naval-air-power-dip-in-gulf-414440/ US “carrier gap” could see naval air power dip in Gulf region] ([http://web.archive.org/web/20150802135522/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-carrier-gap-could-see-naval-air-power-dip-in-gulf-414440/ archive)]</ref> As well as the supercarrier fleet, the US Navy has nine [[amphibious assault ship]]s used primarily for helicopters (sometimes called helicopter carriers); these can also carry up to 25 fighter jets, and in some cases, are as large as some other nations' fixed-wing carriers.

[[File:HMS Ocean MOD 45151277.jpg|thumb|right|[[HMS Ocean (L12)|HMS ''Ocean'']] of the [[Royal Navy]], an [[amphibious assault ship]]/[[helicopter carrier]] ]]

===Basic types===
* [[Amphibious assault ship]]
* [[Anti-submarine warfare carrier]]
* [[Balloon carrier]] and [[balloon tenders]]
* [[Escort carrier]]
* [[Fleet carrier]]
* [[Flight deck cruiser]]
* [[Helicopter carrier]]
* [[Light aircraft carrier]]
* [[Sea Control Ship]]
* [[Seaplane tender]] and seaplane carriers
* [[Supercarrier]]
<small>''(note: some of the types listed here are not strictly defined as aircraft carriers by some sources)''</small>

===By role===
A ''[[fleet carrier]]'' is intended to operate with the main fleet and usually provides an offensive capability. These are the largest carriers capable of fast speeds. By comparison, ''[[escort carrier]]s'' were developed to provide defense for convoys of ships. They were smaller and slower with lower numbers of aircraft carried. Most were built from mercantile hulls or, in the case of [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s, were bulk cargo ships with a flight deck added on top. ''[[Light aircraft carrier]]s'' were carriers that were fast enough to operate with the fleet but of smaller size with reduced aircraft capacity. Soviet aircraft carriers now in use by Russia are actually called ''heavy aviation cruisers'', these ships while sized in the range of large fleet carriers were designed to deploy alone or with escorts and provide both strong defensive weaponry and heavy offensive missiles equivalent to a guided missile cruiser in addition to supporting fighters and helicopters.

===By configuration===
[[File:INS Vikramaditya (R33) close shot.jpg |thumb|{{INS|Vikramaditya}} of the [[Indian Navy]] has the [[STOBAR]] configuration.]]

There are four main configurations of aircraft carrier in service in the world's navies, divided by the way that aircraft take off and land:
* ''Catapult-assisted take-off but arrested-recovery'' (''[[CATOBAR]]''): these carriers generally carry the largest, heaviest, and most heavily armed aircraft, although smaller CATOBAR carriers may have other limitations (weight capacity of aircraft elevator, etc.). Three nations currently operate carriers of this type: ten by the United States, and one each by France and Brazil for a total of twelve in service.
* ''Short take-off but arrested-recovery'' (''[[STOBAR]]''): these carriers are generally limited to carrying lighter fixed-wing aircraft with more limited payloads. STOBAR carrier air wings, such as the [[Sukhoi Su-33]] and future [[Mikoyan MiG-29K]] wings of the [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|''Admiral Kuznetsov'']] are often geared primarily towards air superiority and fleet defense roles rather than strike/power projection tasks,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} which require heavier payloads (bombs and air-to-ground missiles). Currently, Russia, China, and India possess commissioned carriers of this type.
* ''Short take-off vertical-landing'' (''[[STOVL]]''): limited to carrying STOVL aircraft. STOVL aircraft, such as the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] family and [[Yakovlev Yak-38]] generally have very limited payloads, lower performance, and high fuel consumption when compared with conventional fixed-wing aircraft; however, a new generation of STOVL aircraft, currently consisting of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]]B has much improved performance. This type of aircraft carrier is in service with one for India and two for Italy, Spain also operates one amphibious assault ship as a STOVL aircraft carrier for four ships total in active carrier service; Thailand has one active STOVL carrier but it no longer has any operational STOVL aircraft in inventory. Some also count the nine US amphibious assault ships in their secondary light carrier role boosting the overall total to fourteen.
* ''Helicopter Carrier'': Helicopter carriers have a similar appearance to other aircraft carriers and may have regular fixed wing operations. Some are designed for addition of, or may include, a ski jump ramp allowing for STOVL operations or may have an unused ski jump installed before retirement of STOVL aircraft and re-purposing, in the past conventional carriers were converted and called commando carriers. Some helicopter carriers with a resistant flight surface can operate VTOL jets. Currently the majority of helicopter carriers, but not all, are classified as [[amphibious assault ships]], tasked with landing and supporting ground forces on enemy territory. The US has nine of this type, France three, the [[Japan|JMSDF]] two, the UK one, the Republic of Korea one and Spain one. The US and Spain's amphibious assault ships operate STOVL jets in normal deployment.

===By size===
* [[Supercarrier]]
* [[Fleet carrier]]
* [[Light aircraft carrier]]
* [[Escort carrier]]

===Hull type identification symbols===
Several systems of identification symbol for aircraft carriers and related types of ship have been used. These include the [[pennant number]]s used by the British [[Royal Navy]] and some [[Commonwealth of nations|Commonwealth]] countries, the US [[hull classification symbol]]s also used by [[NATO]] and some other countries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/media-room/publications/semaphore-september-2010-0 |title=Semaphore: September 2010 "AWD, Hobart, MFU or DDGH – What's in a Name?" |publisher=Navy.gov.au |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> and the Canadian [[Hull classification symbol (Canada)|hull classification symbols]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the aircraft carrier|Timeline for aircraft carrier service}}

===Origins===
[[File:Wakamiya.jpg|thumb|right|The Japanese seaplane carrier [[Japanese seaplane carrier Wakamiya|''Wakamiya'']] conducted the world's first naval-launched air raids in 1914.]]

The [[Wright brothers|1903 advent]] of heavier-than-air fixed-wing aircraft was closely followed in 1910 by the first experimental take-off of an airplane, made from the deck of a [[United States Navy]] vessel (cruiser {{USS|Birmingham|CL-2|6}}), and the first experimental landings were conducted in 1911. On 9 May 1912 the first airplane take-off from a ship underway was made from the deck of the British Royal Navy's {{HMS|Hibernia|1905|6}}.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%200442.html The Naval Review and the Aviators][[Flight International|''Flight'']] 18 May 1912</ref><ref>{{cite journal |date=10 May 1912 |title=Flight From the Hibernia |journal=The Times |issue= 39895|page=8 (3) |location=London |url=}}</ref> [[Seaplane tender]] support ships came next, with the French [[French seaplane carrier Foudre|''Foudre'']] of 1911. In September 1914 the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[Japanese seaplane carrier Wakamiya|''Wakamiya'']] conducted the world's first successful ship-launched air raid:<ref>Wakamiya is "credited with conducting the first successful carrier air raid in history"[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/index.html ].

[[File:Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō Tokyo Bay.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō|''Hōshō'']] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] as completed in December 1922.]]
The development of flattop vessels produced the first large fleet ships. In 1918, {{HMS|Argus|I49|6}} became the world's first carrier capable of launching and recovering naval aircraft.<ref>Geoffrey Till, "Adopting the Aircraft Carrier: The British, Japanese, and American Case Studies" in {{cite book |title= Military Innovation in the Interwar Period|edition=|editor1-first= Williamson|editor1-last= Murray|editor2-first= Allan R|editor2-last= Millet |year= 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= New York|isbn= 0-521-63760-0|page= 194}}</ref> As a result of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922, which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships, most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battle cruisers, or battleships. These conversions gave rise to {{sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier|2}}s (1927), [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] and [[Courageous-class aircraft carrier|''Courageous''-class]]. Specialist carrier evolution was well underway, with several navies ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s, resulting in the commissioning of ships such as [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō|''Hōshō'']] (1922), {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} (1924), and [[French aircraft carrier Béarn|''Béarn'']] (1927). During [[World War II]], these ships would become the backbone of the carrier forces of the United States, British, and Japanese navies, known as [[fleet carrier]]s.

===World War II===
[[File:Attack on carrier USS Franklin 19 March 1945.jpg|thumb|Attack on carrier {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|6}}, 19 March 1945. The casualties included 724 killed.]] [[File:USS Enterprise (CV-6) in Puget Sound, September 1945.jpg|thumb|[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)]], the [[Most decorated US ships of World War II|most decorated US ship of World War II]].]]

The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in [[World War II]], because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} launched a long-range [[Battle of Taranto|strike on the Italian fleet]] at their base in [[Taranto]], signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of [[HMS Glorious|HMS ''Glorious'']] by German battle cruisers during the [[Norwegian Campaign|Norwegian campaign in 1940]].

This new-found importance of naval aviation forced nations to create a number of carriers, in efforts to provide air superiority cover for every major fleet in order to ward off enemy aircraft. This extensive usage required the construction of several new 'light' carriers. [[Escort aircraft carrier]]s, such as {{USS|Bogue|CVE-9|6}}, were sometimes purpose-built, but most were converted from merchant ships as a stop-gap measure to provide anti-submarine air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. Following this concept, [[Light aircraft carrier]]s built by the US, such as {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|6}}, represented a larger, more "militarized" version of the escort carrier. Although with similar complement to Escort carriers, they had the advantage of speed from their converted cruiser hulls. The UK [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier]] was designed for building quickly by civilian shipyards and with an expected service life of about 3 years.<ref>Robbins, Guy ''The Aircraft Carrier Story: 1908–1945''. 2001 London: Cassel p91</ref> They served the Royal Navy during the war and was the hull design chosen for nearly all aircraft carrier equipped navies after the war until the 1980s. Emergencies also spurred the creation or conversion of highly unconventional aircraft carriers. [[CAM ship]]s, were cargo-carrying merchant ships that could launch (but not retrieve) a single fighter aircraft from a catapult to defend the convoy from long range German aircraft.

===Postwar era===
[[File:USS Tripoli LPH10 a.jpg|thumb|USS ''Tripoli'', a US Navy ''Iwo Jima''-class helicopter carrier]]
[[File:USS Enterprise (CVN-65).jpg|thumb|[[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)]], the world's first nuclear-powered carrier commissioned in 1961.]]

Before World War II, international naval treaties of [[Washington Naval Treaty|1922]], [[London Naval Treaty|1930]] and [[Second London Naval Treaty|1936]] limited the size of capital ships including carriers.

Since World War II, aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate a steady increase in aircraft size. The large, modern {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|4}} of US carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II–era {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same—a consequence of the steadily increasing size and weight of military aircraft over the years. Today's aircraft carriers are so expensive that nations which operate them risk significant political, economic, and military impact if a carrier is lost, or even used in conflict.

Modern navies that operate such aircraft carriers treat them as the [[capital ship]] of the fleet, a role previously held by the [[battleship]]. This change took place during World War II in response to air power becoming a significant factor in warfare, driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. Following the war, carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance. [[Supercarrier]]s, displacing 75,000&nbsp;tonnes or greater, have become the pinnacle of carrier development. Some are powered by [[nuclear reactor]]s and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home. Amphibious assault ships, such as {{USS|Tarawa|LHA-1|6}} and {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, serve the purpose of carrying and landing Marines, and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. Also known as "commando carriers"<ref>A number of British conversions of light fleet carriers to helicopter operations were known as commando carriers, though they did not operate landing craft</ref> or "helicopter carriers", many have the capability to operate [[VSTOL]] aircraft.

Lacking the firepower of other warships, carriers by themselves are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines, or missiles. Therefore, an aircraft carrier is generally accompanied by a number of other ships to provide protection for the relatively unwieldy carrier, to carry supplies and perform other support services, and to provide additional offensive capabilities. The resulting group of ships is often termed a battle group, carrier group, or [[carrier battle group]].

There is a view that modern anti-ship weapons systems, such as torpedoes and missiles, have made aircraft carriers obsolete as too vulnerable for modern combat.<ref>http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2011-05/twilight-uperfluous-carrier</ref>  On the other hand, the threatening role of aircraft carriers has a place in modern [[asymmetric warfare]], like the [[gunboat diplomacy]] of the past.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Furthermore, aircraft carriers facilitate quick and precise projections of overwhelming military power into such local and regional conflicts.<ref>Lekic, Slobodan, Associated Press.

{{See also|List of aircraft carriers in service}}

Most navies operate only one or two aircraft carriers, if any. The USA is a notable exception, with 10 super carriers and 9 amphibious assault ships in service.

A total of 20 fleet carriers are in active service with ten navies. Additionally, the navies of [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[France]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Thailand]] and the [[United States]] also operate ships capable of carrying and operating multiple helicopters and STOVL aircraft.

*CATOBAR types are operated by Brazil, France and especially the USA, which has ten in service.
*STOBAR type are operated by China, India and Russia.
*STOVL types are operated by India, Italy, Spain and the USA.

Among helicopter-only types:
*ASW ships are operated by Japan.
*An offshore helicopter support ship is operated by Thailand.
*Amphibious assault ships are operated by France, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom and especially the USA, which has nine in service.

===Future of aircraft carriers===
A good many aircraft carriers and related types are planned, under construction or undergoing commissioning activity.

The [[Royal Australian Navy]] is in the process of procuring two [[Canberra-class landing helicopter dock|Canberra-class]] LHD's expected to enter service in 2014 and 2016 respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/blogs/in-your-defence/future-hmas-canberra-is-on-the-way-20120820-24h8e.html|title = Future HMAS Canberra is on the way|date = 20 August 2012|accessdate = 27 October 2014|website = canberratimes.com.au|publisher = Fairfax Media Network|last = |first = }}</ref> The ships will be the largest in Australian naval history.

In August 2013, a launching ceremony for Japan's largest military ship since World War II was held in Yokohama. The 820-foot-long, 19,500-ton flattop [[Izumo-class helicopter destroyer|destroyer Izumo]] will be deployed in March 2015.<ref>http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23594519</ref> The ship will be able to carry up to 14 helicopters; however, only 7 ASW helicopters and 2 SAR helicopters are planned for the initial aircraft complement. For other operations, 400 troops and 50 3.5t trucks (or equivalent equipment) can also be carried. The flight deck has 5 helicopter landing spots that allow simultaneous landings or take-offs. The ship is equipped with 2 [[Phalanx CIWS]] and 2 [[SeaRAM]] for its defense.

==Description==

===Structure===
[[File:USS Roosevelt CV-42 Med 1976-77.jpg|thumb|right|STOVL Harriers preparing to takeoff from CATOBAR carrier, {{USS|Franklin D. Roosevelt|CV-42}}]]

Carriers are large and long ships, although there is a high degree of variation depending on their intended role and [[air wing|aircraft complement]]. The size of the carrier has varied over history and among [[navy|navies]], to cater to the various roles that global climates have demanded from [[naval aviation]].

Regardless of size, the ship itself must house their complement of aircraft, with space for launching, storing, and maintaining them. Space is also required for the large crew, supplies (food, munitions, fuel, engineering parts), and propulsion. US supercarriers are notable for having [[nuclear reactor]]s powering their systems and propulsion. This makes the carrier reasonably tall.

The top of the carrier is the flight deck, where aircraft are launched and recovered. On the starboard side of this is the island, where air-traffic control and the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] are located.

The constraints of constructing a flight deck affect the role of a given carrier strongly, as they influence the weight, type, and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched. For example, assisted launch mechanisms are used primarily for heavy aircraft, especially those loaded with air-to-ground weapons. CATOBAR is most commonly used on USN [[supercarrier]]s as it allows the deployment of heavy jets with full loadouts, especially on ground-attack missions. STOVL is used by other navies because it is cheaper to operate and still provides good deployment capability for [[fighter aircraft]].

[[File:DeHavilland Vampire HMS Ocean Dec1945 NAN1 47.jpg|thumb|The first carrier landing and take-off of a jet aircraft: [[Eric "Winkle" Brown]] landing on {{HMS|Ocean|R68}} in 1945.]]
Due to the busy nature of the flight deck, only 20 or so aircraft may be on it at any one time. A hangar storage several decks below the flight deck is where most aircraft are kept, and aircraft are taken from the lower storage decks to the flight deck through the use of an elevator. The hangar is usually quite large and can take up several decks of vertical space.<ref>How Aircraft Carriers Work, ''How Stuff Works'', by Tom Harris – http://science.howstuffworks.com/aircraft-carrier6.htm Accessed 5 October 2013</ref>

Munitions are commonly stored on the lower decks because they are highly explosive should the compartment they are in be breached. Usually this is below the water line so that the area can be flooded in case of emergency.

===Flight deck===
{{Main|Flight deck}}

[[File:An F-35B Lightning II aircraft lands aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1).jpg|thumb|An [[F-35B Lightning II]] aircraft lands aboard the amphibious assault ship [[USS Wasp (LHD 1)]]]]

As "runways at sea", aircraft carriers have a flat-top [[flight deck]], which [[Takeoff|launches]] and [[landing|recovers]] aircraft. Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier – for example, the fact that it is a ship means that a full-length runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects take-off procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft [[accelerate]] more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced take-off load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck. The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself.

There are two main philosophies in order to keep the deck short: add thrust to the aircraft, such as using a Catapult Assisted Take-Off (CATO-); and changing the direction of the airplanes' thrust, as in Vertical and/or Short Take-Off (V/STO-). Each method has advantages and disadvantages of its own:
*[[CATOBAR|Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery]] (CATOBAR): A steam-powered [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] is connected to the aircraft, and is used to accelerate conventional aircraft to a safe flying speed. By the end of the catapult stroke, the aircraft is airborne and further propulsion is provided by its own engines. This is the most expensive method as it requires complex machinery to be installed under the flight deck, but allows for even heavily-loaded aircraft to take off.
*[[STOBAR|Short take-off but arrested recovery]] (STOBAR) depends on increasing the net lift on the aircraft. Aircraft do not require catapult assistance for take off; instead on nearly all ships of this type an upwards vector is provided by a ski-jump at the forward end of the flight deck, often combined with thrust vectoring by the aircraft. Alternatively, by reducing the fuel and weapon load, an aircraft is able to reach faster speeds and generate more upwards lift and launch without a ski-jump or catapult.
*[[STOVL|Short take-off vertical-landing]] (STOVL): On aircraft carriers, non-catapult-assisted, fixed-wing short takeoffs are accomplished with the use of [[thrust vectoring]], which may also be used in conjunction with a runway "ski-jump". Use of STOVL tends to allow aircraft to carry a larger payload as compared to during VTOL use, while still only requiring a short runway. The most famous examples are the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] and the [[Sea Harrier]]. Although technically VTOL aircraft, they are operationally STOVL aircraft due to the extra weight carried at take-off for fuel and armaments. The same is true of the [[F-35B Lightning II]], which demonstrated VTOL capability in test flights but is operationally STOVL.
*[[VTOL|Vertical take-off and landing]] (VTOL): Aircraft are specifically designed for the purpose of using very high degrees of thrust vectoring (e.g. if the thrust to weight-force ratio is greater than 1, it can take off vertically), but are usually slower than conventionally-propelled aircraft.

On the recovery side of the flight deck, the adaptation to the aircraft loadout is mirrored. Non-VTOL or conventional aircraft cannot decelerate on their own, and almost all carriers using them must have arrested-recovery systems (-BAR, e.g. CATO''BAR'' or STO''BAR'') to recover their aircraft. Aircraft that are landing extend a [[tailhook]] that catches on [[arrestor wires]] stretched across the deck to bring themselves to a stop in a short distance. Post-WWII Royal Navy research on safer CATOBAR recovery eventually lead to universal adoption of a landing area angled off axis to allow aircraft who missed the arresting wires to "bolt" and safely return to flight for another landing attempt rather than crashing into aircraft on the forward deck.

If the aircraft are VTOL-capable or helicopters, they do not need to decelerate and hence there is no such need. The arrested-recovery system has used an angled deck since the 1950s because, in case the aircraft does not catch the arresting wire, the short deck allows easier take off by reducing the number of objects between the aircraft and the end of the runway. It also has the advantage of separating the recovery operation area from the launch area. [[Helicopter]]s and aircraft capable of vertical or short take-off and landing ([[V/STOL]]) usually recover by coming abreast the carrier on the port side and then using their hover capability to move over the flight deck and land vertically without the need for arresting gear.

====Staff and Deck Operations====
[[File:F-18 - A 3-wire landing.ogv|thumb|F/A-18 landing video]]

Carriers steam at speed, up to {{nowrap|35 [[knot (unit)|knots]]}} ({{nowrap|65&nbsp;km/h}}) into the wind during flight deck operations to increase wind speed over the deck to a safe minimum. This increase in effective wind speed provides a higher launch airspeed for aircraft at the end of the catapult stroke or ski-jump, as well as making recovery safer by reducing the difference between the relative speeds of the aircraft and ship.

Since the early 1950s on conventional carriers it has been the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship. The primary function of this angled deck is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires, referred to as a [[Bolter (aviation)|bolter]], to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward. The angled deck allows the installation of one or two "waist" catapults in addition to the two bow cats. An angled deck also improves [[launch and recovery cycle]] flexibility with the option of simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.

Conventional ("tailhook") aircraft rely upon a [[landing signal officer]] (LSO, radio call sign ''paddles'') to monitor the aircraft's approach, visually gauge glideslope, attitude, and airspeed, and transmit that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot (hence the nickname). From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as [[Optical Landing System]] have provided information on proper [[glide slope]], but LSOs still transmit voice calls to approaching pilots by radio.

Key personnel involved in the flight deck include the shooters, the handler, and the air boss. Shooters are [[naval aviator]]s or [[Naval Flight Officer]]s and are responsible for launching aircraft. The handler works just inside the island from the flight deck and is responsible for the movement of aircraft before launching and after recovery. The "air boss" (usually a [[commander]]) occupies the top bridge (Primary Flight Control, also called ''primary'' or ''the tower'') and has the overall responsibility for controlling launch, recovery and "those aircraft in the air near the ship, and the movement of planes on the flight deck, which itself resembles a well-choreographed ballet."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp |title= The US Navy Aircraft Carriers |publisher=Navy.mil |accessdate=30 January 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221142917/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp |archivedate= 21 February 2009  |deadurl= no}}</ref> The captain of the ship spends most of his time one level below primary on the Navigation Bridge. Below this is the Flag Bridge, designated for the embarked admiral and his staff.

To facilitate working on the flight deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier, the sailors wear colored shirts that designate their responsibilities. There are at least seven different colors worn by flight deck personnel for [[modern United States Navy carrier air operations]]. Carrier operations of other nations use similar color schemes.

====Deck structures====
[[File:US Navy 100512-N-8446A-004 An F-A-18F Super Hornet assigned to the Fighting Checkmates of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 211 lands aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN 65).jpg|thumb|Island control structure of the {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65}}]]

The superstructure of a carrier (such as the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], flight [[control tower]]) are concentrated in a relatively small area called an ''island'', a feature pioneered on the {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} in 1923. While the island is usually built on the [[starboard]] side of the fight deck, the Japanese aircraft carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|''Hiryū'']] had their islands built on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side. Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island. The ''flush deck'' configuration proved to have significant drawbacks, primary of which was management of the exhaust from the power plant. Fumes coming across the deck were a major issue in the {{USS|Langley|CV-1}}.  In addition, lack of an island meant difficulties managing the flight deck, performing air traffic control, a lack of radar housing placements and problems with navigating and controlling the ship itself.{{sfn|Friedman|1983|pp=241-243}}

Another deck structure that can be seen is a [[ski-jump ramp]] at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch [[STOVL]] aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either [[Stall (flight)|stalling out]] or crashing directly into the sea.

[[File:FRS.1 ski-jump take-off HMS Invincible.JPEG|thumb|left|Ski-jump on Royal Navy carrier {{HMS|Invincible|R05}}]]
Although STOVL aircraft are capable of taking off vertically from a spot on the deck, using the ramp and a running start is far more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight. As catapults are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for complex steam or electromagnetic launching equipment, vertical landing aircraft also remove the need for arresting cables and related hardware. Russian, Chinese, and future Indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier arresting cables and a tailhook on their aircraft.

The disadvantage of the ski-jump is the penalty it exacts on aircraft size, payload, and fuel load (and thus range); heavily laden aircraft can not launch using a ski-jump because their high loaded weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck, or assistance from a catapult or JATO rocket. For example, the Russian Su-33 is only able to launch from the carrier ''Kuznetsov'' with a minimal armament and fuel load. Another disadvantage is on mixed flight deck operations where helicopters are also present such as a US [[Landing Helicopter Dock]] or [[Landing Helicopter Assault]] amphibious assault ship a ski jump is not included as this would eliminate one or more helicopter landing areas, this flat deck limits the loading of Harriers but is somewhat mitigated by the longer rolling start provided by a long flight deck compared to many STOVL carriers.

====Current====
Ten CATOBAR carriers: {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|4}}: 10 101,000 ton nuclear-powered supercarriers, the first of which was commissioned in 1975. A ''Nimitz''-class carrier is powered by two [[nuclear reactor]]s and four [[steam turbine]]s and is {{convert|1,092|ft|m}} long.  The supercarrier [[USS Enterprise CVN-65]] will be decommissioned in 2016.

Nine Amphibious assault ships:
* {{sclass-|America|amphibious assault ship|4}} a class of 45,000 ton amphibious assault ships, although the lead ship in this class does not have a well deck. One ship in service out of a planned 12 ships. Ships of this class can have a secondary mission as a light carrier with 20 [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II|AV-8B Harrier II]], and in the future the [[F-35B Lightning II]] aircraft after unloading their Marine expeditionary unit.
* {{sclass-|Wasp|amphibious assault ship|4}} a class of eight 41,000 ton amphibious assault ships, members of this class have been used in wartime in their secondary mission as light carriers with 20 to 25 AV-8Bs after unloading their Marine expeditionary unit.

====Future====
The current US fleet of [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class]] carriers will be followed into service (and in some cases replaced) by the [[Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier|''Gerald R. Ford'' class]]. It is expected that the ships will be more automated in an effort to reduce the amount of funding required to maintain and operate the vessels. The main new features are implementation of [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System]] (EMALS) (which replace the old steam catapults) and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s.<ref name="Aircraft Carriers - CVN"/>

With the deactivation of the {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} in December 2012, the U.S. fleet comprises 10 supercarriers. The [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces|House Armed Services Seapower subcommittee]] on 24 July 2007, recommended seven or maybe eight new carriers (one every four years). However, the debate has deepened over budgeting for the $12–14.5&nbsp;billion (plus $12&nbsp;billion for development and research) for the 100,000 ton ''Gerald R. Ford''-class carrier (estimated service 2016) compared to the smaller $2&nbsp;billion 45,000 ton [[America-class amphibious assault ship|''America''-class amphibious assault ship]]s able to deploy squadrons of F-35Bs, of which two are already under construction and 12 are planned.<ref name="AFAmag" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/2014-05-08/business/dp-nws-huntingon-ingalls-earnings-20140508_1_sequestration-level-budget-cuts-return-rcoh-huntington-ingalls-industries |title=Huntington Ingalls, Newport News shipyard upbeat despite budget clouds |publisher=Daily Press |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}</ref>
