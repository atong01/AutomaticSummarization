The '''Church of the Holy Sepulchre'''<ref>In [[American English]] also spelled ''Sepulcher''. Also called the '''Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre'''.</ref> ({{lang-la|ecclesia Sancti Sepulchri}}; {{lang-he|כנסיית הקבר הקדוש}}, ''Knesiyyat HaKeber HaKadosh''), also called the '''Church of the Resurrection''' by [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox Christian]]s ({{lang-ar|كنيسة القيامة}}, ''kanīssat al Qi'yāma''; {{lang-hy|Սուրբ Յարութեան տաճար}}, ''Surb Harut’ian tačar''; {{lang-el|Ναός της Αναστάσεως}}, ''Naós tēs Anastáseōs''), is a church within the [[Christian Quarter]] of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]]. It is a few steps away from the [[Muristan]].

The site is venerated as [[Calvary]] (Golgotha),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-church-of-holy-sepulchre.htm |title=Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem |location=Jerusalem, Israel |publisher=Sacred-destinations.com |date=21 February 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref> where [[Jesus of Nazareth]] was [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]],<ref>{{CathEncy| wstitle=Holy Sepulchre| title =Holy Sepulchre| first =Arthur .L.| last = McMahon| authorlink = | accessdate =2 February 2009}}</ref> and also contains the place where [[Burial of Jesus|Jesus is said to have been buried and resurrected]]. Within the church are the last four (or, by some definitions, five) [[Stations of the Cross]] along the [[Via Dolorosa]], representing the final episodes of [[Passion (Christianity)|Jesus' Passion]]. The church has been an important [[Christian pilgrimage]] destination since at least the [[Christianity in the 4th century|fourth century]] as the traditional site of the [[resurrection of Christ]].

Today it also serves as the headquarters of the Eastern Orthodox [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], while control of the building is [[Simultaneum|shared between several Christian churches]] and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for centuries. As such, the church is also home to branches of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], as well as to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Meanwhile, [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Protestant]]s have no permanent presence in the Church and some have regarded the [[Garden Tomb]], elsewhere in Jerusalem, as the true place of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.

Constantine's church was built as two connected churches over the two different holy sites, including a great [[basilica]] (the ''Martyrium'' visited by [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] in the 380s), an enclosed [[colonnade]]d [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] (the ''Triportico'') with the traditional site of ''Golgotha'' in one corner, and a [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], called the ''Anastasis'' ("Resurrection" in [[greek language|Greek]]), which contained the remains of a [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut room]] that [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]] and [[Macarius of Jerusalem|Macarius]] identified as the burial site of Jesus.

According to tradition, Constantine arranged for the rockface to be removed from around the tomb, without harming it, in order to isolate the tomb; in the centre of the rotunda is a small building called (in Greek) the ''Kouvouklion''<ref>Kουβούκλιον; Modern Greek for small compartment</ref> or (in Latin) the ''[[Aedicule]]'',<ref>Americans spell this as ''Edicule'' from Latin: ''aediculum'', small building</ref> which encloses this tomb. The remains are completely enveloped by a marble sheath placed some 500 years before to protect the ledge from Ottoman attacks. However, there are several thick window wells extending through the marble sheath, from the interior to the exterior that are not marble clad. They appear to reveal an underlying limestone rock, which may be part of the original [[Rock-cut architecture|living rock]] of the tomb.

Each year, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates the anniversary of the [[consecration]] of the Church of the Resurrection (Holy Sepulchre) on 13 September.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commemoration of the Founding of the Church of the Resurrection (Holy Sepulchre) at Jerusalem|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&ID=1&FSID=102593|publisher=[[Orthodox Church in America]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref><!-- (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian calendar]], 13 September currently falls on 26 September of the modern [[Gregorian calendar]]).{{cn|date = October 2013}} -->

===Damage and destruction===
This building was damaged by fire in May of 614 when the [[Sassanid Empire]], under [[Khosrau II]], invaded Jerusalem and captured the [[True Cross]] which was restored in 630 by the Emperor [[Heraclius]] when he recaptured and rebuilt the church. After Jerusalem was captured by the Arabs, it remained a Christian church, with the early Muslim rulers protecting the city's Christian sites. A story reports that the [[Umar|Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab]] visited the church and stopped to pray on the balcony; but at the time of prayer, he turned away from the church and prayed outside. He feared that future generations would misinterpret this gesture, taking it as a pretext to turn the church into a mosque. Eutychius added that Umar wrote a decree prohibiting Muslims from praying at this location. The building suffered severe damage due to an earthquake in 746.

Early in the ninth century, another earthquake damaged the dome of the Anastasis. Damage was restored in 810 by [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch Thomas]]. In the year 841, the church suffered a fire. In 935, the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] prevented the construction of a Muslim mosque adjacent the Church. In 938, a new fire damaged the inside of the basilica and came close to the roundabout. In 966, due to a defeat of Muslim armies in the region of Syria, a riot broke out and was followed by reprisals. The basilica was burned again. The doors and roof were burnt, and the Patriarch [[John VII of Jerusalem|John VII]] was murdered.

On 18 October 1009, [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] ordered the complete destruction of the church as part of a more general campaign against Christian places of worship in Palestine and Egypt.<ref>[[Adémar de Chabannes]] recorded that the church of Saint George at [[Lod|Lydda]] 'with many other churches of the saints' had been attacked, and the 'basilica of the Lord's Sepulchre destroyed down to the ground'. ...The Christian writer Yahya ibn Sa'id reported that everything was razed 'except those parts which were impossible to destroy or would have been too difficult to carry away'." {{Harvnb|Morris|2005}}</ref> The damage was extensive, with few parts of the early church remaining.<ref name="Morris 2005">{{Harvnb|Morris|2005}}</ref> Christian Europe reacted with shock and expulsions of Jews (for example, [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[monk]] [[Rodulfus Glaber]] blamed the [[Jews]], with the result that Jews were expelled from [[Limoges]] and other French towns{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}) and an impetus to later [[Crusades]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Concise History of the Catholic Church |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DISK1e7JXA8C&q=crusades#v=snippet&q=crusades&f=false |last=Bokenkotter |first=Thomas |year=2004 |publisher=Doubleday |page= 155| isbn=0-385-50584-1}}</ref>

===Reconstruction===
[[File:Holy Sepulchre IMG 0451.jpg|thumb|View of Holy Sepulchre courtyard]]
In wide ranging negotiations between the Fatimids and the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1027–8 an agreement was reached whereby the new Caliph [[Ali az-Zahir]] (Al-Hakim's son) agreed to allow the rebuilding and redecoration of the Church.<ref name="Lev 1991">{{cite book| last=Lev| first=Yaacov| title=State and Society in Fatimid Egypt| publisher=E.J.

Foakes-Jackson| year=1921| publisher=Macmillan| location=London| url=http://www.archive.org/details/introductiontohi00foak}}</ref> As a concession, the mosque in [[Constantinople]] was re-opened and sermons were to be pronounced in az-Zahir's name. Muslim sources say a by-product of the agreement was the recanting of Islam by many Christians who had been forced to convert under Al-Hakim's persecutions. In addition, the Byzantines, while releasing 5,000 Muslim prisoners, made demands for the restoration of other churches destroyed by Al-Hakim and the re-establishment of a [[Patriarch]] in Jerusalem. Contemporary sources credit the emperor with spending vast sums in an effort to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after this agreement was made.<ref name="Lev 1991"/> Despite the Byzantines spending vast sums on the project, "a total replacement was far beyond available resources. The new construction was concentrated on the rotunda and its surrounding buildings: the great basilica remained in ruins."<ref name="Morris 2005"/> The rebuilt church site consisted of "a court open to the sky, with five small chapels attached to it."<ref name=Fergusson>{{cite book| title=A History of Architecture in All Countries| first=James| last=Fergusson| authorlink=James Fergusson (architect)| year=1865| publisher=J. Murray| location=London| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dysDAAAAQAAJ}}</ref> The chapels were to the east of the court of resurrection, where the wall of the great church had been. They commemorated scenes from the passion, such as the location of the prison of Christ and of his flagellation, and presumably were so placed because of the difficulties of free movement among shrines in the streets of the city. The dedication of these chapels indicates the importance of the pilgrims' devotion to the suffering of Christ. They have been described as 'a sort of [[Via Dolorosa]] in miniature'...&nbsp;since little or no rebuilding took place on the site of the great basilica. Western pilgrims to Jerusalem during the eleventh century found much of the sacred site in ruins."<ref name="Morris 2005"/> Control of Jerusalem, and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, continued to change hands several times between the Fatimids and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] (loyal to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliph]] in [[Baghdad]]) until the arrival of the Crusaders in 1099.<ref>{{cite book| last=Gold| first=Dore| authorlink=Dore Gold| title=The Fight for Jerusalem: Radical Islam, the West, and the Future of the Holy City| url=http://www.amazon.com/The-Fight-Jerusalem-Radical-Future/dp/159698029X#reader_159698029X| publisher=Regnery Publishing| location=Washington, D.C.| date=29 January 2007| isbn=1-59698-029-X}}</ref>

===Crusader period===
[[File:GA Ordre du Saint-Sépulcre.svg|left|thumb|Arms of the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]]]]

Many historians maintain that the main concern of [[Pope Urban II]], when calling for the [[First Crusade]], was the threat to Constantinople from the Turkish invasion of [[Asia Minor]] in response to the appeal of Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famoushistoricalevents.net/council-clermont/ |title=Council of Claremont |publisher=Famoushistoricalevents.net |date= |accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref> Historians agree that the fate of Jerusalem and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was of concern if not the immediate goal of papal policy in 1095. The idea of taking Jerusalem gained more focus as the Crusade was underway. The rebuilt church site was taken from the Fatimids (who had recently taken it from the Abassids) by the [[knight]]s of the [[First Crusade]] on 15 July 1099.<ref name="Morris 2005"/>

The First Crusade was envisioned as an armed pilgrimage, and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre. Crusader Prince [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who became the first [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|crusader monarch of Jerusalem]], decided not to use [[List of kings of Jerusalem|the title "king"]] during his lifetime, and declared himself "Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri" ("Protector [or Defender] of the Holy Sepulchre"). By the crusader period, a [[cistern]] under the former basilica was rumoured to have been the location where Helena had found the True Cross, and began to be venerated as such; although the cistern later became the "Chapel of the Invention of the Cross," there is no evidence for the rumour prior to the 11th century, and modern archaeological investigation has now dated the cistern to 11th century repairs by Monomachos.

[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|Crusader [[graffiti]] in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]

According to the German clergyman and orient pilgrim Ludolf von Sudheim, the keys of the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre were in hands of the "ancient [[Georgians]]" and the food, alms, candles and oil for lamps were given them by the pilgrims in the south door of the church.<ref>Venetian Adventurer: The Life and Times of Marco Polo, p88</ref>

[[William of Tyre]], chronicler of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], reports on the renovation of the Church in the mid-12th century. The crusaders investigated the eastern ruins on the site, occasionally excavating through the rubble, and while attempting to reach the cistern, they discovered part of the original ground level of Hadrian's temple enclosure; they decided to transform this space into a chapel dedicated to Helena (the [[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem|Chapel of Saint Helena]]), widening their original excavation tunnel into a proper staircase. The crusaders began to refurnish the church in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style and added a bell tower.<ref name="Savage37">''Pilgrimages and Pilgrim shrines in Palestine and Syria after 1095'', Henry L. Savage, ''''A History of the Crusades: The Art and Architecture of the Crusader States'', Volume IV, ed. Kenneth M. Setton and Harry W. Hazard, (University of Wisconsin Press, 1977), 37.</ref> These renovations unified the small chapels on the site and were completed during the reign of [[Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]] in 1149, placing all the Holy places under one roof for the first time. The church became the seat of the first [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Latin Patriarchs]], and was also the site of the kingdom's [[scriptorium]]. The church was lost to [[Saladin]],<ref name="Savage37" /> along with the rest of the city, in 1187, although the treaty established after the [[Third Crusade]] allowed for Christian pilgrims to visit the site. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century, while he himself was under a ban of excommunication, leading to the curious result of the holiest church in Christianity being laid under [[interdict]]. Both city and church were captured by the [[Khwarezm]]ians in 1244.<ref name="Savage37" />

===Later periods===
[[File:ChurchOfTheHolySepulcher1885.png|thumb|Church of the Holy Sepulchre (1885). Other than some restoration work, its appearance has essentially not changed since 1854. The [[Immovable Ladder]], the small ladder below the top-right window, is also visible in recent photographs; this has remained in the same position since 1854 over a disagreement to move it.]]
The [[Franciscan]] friars renovated it further in 1555, as it had been neglected despite increased numbers of pilgrims. The Franciscans rebuilt the Aedicule, extending the structure to create an ante-chamber.<ref name="Murphy56"/> After the renovation of 1555, control of the church oscillated between the Franciscans and the Orthodox, depending on which community could obtain a favorable "[[firman (decree)|firman]]" from the "[[Sublime Porte]]" at a particular time, often through outright bribery, and violent clashes were not uncommon. There was no agreement about this question, although it was discussed at the negotiations to the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.<ref name=Mailáth>{{cite book| title=Geschichte der europäischen Staaten, Geschichte des östreichischen Kaiserstaates| url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_0MJAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR1&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=2#v=onepage&q&f=false| first=János Nepomuk Jozsef| last=Mailáth| volume=4| page=262| publisher=F. Perthes| location=Hamburg| year=1848| trans_title=History of the European states, history of Austrian Imperial State}}</ref> In 1767, weary of the squabbling, the "Porte" issued a "firman" that divided the church among the claimants.

A fire severely damaged the structure again in 1808, causing the dome of the Rotunda to collapse and smashing the Edicule's exterior decoration. The Rotunda and the Edicule's exterior were rebuilt in 1809–1810 by architect [[Nikolaos Ch. Komnenos]] of [[Mytilene]] in the then current [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Baroque]] style. The fire did not reach the interior of the Aedicule, and the marble decoration of the Tomb dates mainly to the 1555 restoration, although the interior of the ante-chamber, now known as the "Chapel of the Angel," was partly rebuilt to a square ground-plan, in place of the previously semi-circular western end. Another [[firman (decree)|decree]] in 1853 from the sultan solidified the existing territorial division among the communities and set a "status quo" for arrangements to "remain forever," causing differences of opinion about upkeep and even minor changes,<ref name=cohen>{{cite journal| url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/sepulchre.shtml |title=The Church of the Holy Sepulchre: A Work in Progress |work=The Bible and Interpretation |date=May 2009 |first=Raymond |last=Cohen |accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref> including disagreement on the removal of the "[[Immovable Ladder]]," an exterior ladder under one of the windows; this ladder has remained in the same position since then.

[[File:Floorplan of the CotHS.JPG|thumb|right|The church after its 1808 restoration]]
The cladding of red marble applied to the Aedicule by Komnenos has deteriorated badly and is detaching from the underlying structure; since 1947 it has been held in place with an exterior scaffolding of iron girders installed by the [[British Mandate for Palestine|British Mandate]]. No plans have been agreed upon for its renovation.

The current dome dates from 1870, although it was restored between 1994–1997, as part of extensive modern renovations to the church which have been ongoing since 1959. During the 1970–1978 restoration works and excavations inside the building, and under the nearby Muristan, it was found that the area was originally a quarry, from which white ''[[meleke]]'' [[limestone]] was struck.<ref name="Hesemann170">{{cite book| first=Michael| last=Hesemann| title=Die Jesus-Tafel| publisher=Freiburg| year=1999| page=170| isbn=3-451-27092-7| language=German}}</ref> To the east of the ''Chapel of Saint Helena'', the excavators discovered a void containing a 2nd-century drawing of a Roman ship, two low walls which supported the platform of Hadrian's 2nd-century temple, and a higher 4th-century wall built to support Constantine's basilica.<ref name="Murphy56">{{cite book| authorlink=Jerome Murphy-O'Connor| first=Jerome| last=Murphy-O'Connor| title=The Holy Land| url=http://libro.eb20.net/Reader/rdr.aspx?b=415896| date=February 1998| pages=56, 59| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0191528675| subscription=yes}}</ref><ref name="lancaster">{{cite web |last=Lancaster |first=James E. |title=Finding the Keys to the Chapel of St. Vartan |url=http://coastdaylight.com/stvartan.html|work=Jim Lancaster's Web Space| accessdate=2 March 2012| year=1998| quote=the height difference can be easily seen; the yellowish wall on the left is the 4th century wall, the pinkish wall on the right is the 2nd century wall.}}</ref> After the excavations of the early 1970s, the Armenian authorities converted this archaeological space into the [[Chapel of Saint Vartan]], and created an artificial walkway over the quarry on the north of the chapel, so that the new Chapel could be accessed (by permission) from the ''Chapel of Saint Helena''.<ref name="lancaster"/>

There was some controversy in 2010 when Israel threatened to cut off water to the site, demanding payment for all water use since the occupation began in 1967.<ref>{{cite news| last=Cohen| first=Arieh| title=Israel threatens to cut off water supply to Church of the Holy Sepulchre| url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Israel-threatens-to-cut-off-water-supply-to-Church-of-the-Holy-Sepulchre-19074.html| accessdate=3 March 2012| newspaper=[[AsiaNews]]|date=30 July 2010}}</ref>

== Entrance and parvis ==

{{see also|Immovable Ladder}}

The entrance to the church, a single door in the south [[transept]]—through the crusader [[façade]]—is found past a group of streets winding through the outer [[Via Dolorosa]], by way of a local [[souq]] in the [[Muristan]]. This narrow way of access to such a large structure has proven to be hazardous at times. For example, when a fire broke out in 1840, dozens of pilgrims were trampled to death.<ref name=sun>{{cite news| title=Trouble in a holy place| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-06-28/news/9906280038_1_holy-sepulcher-control-the-church-church-representatives| last=LoLordo| first=Ann| work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]| date=28 June 1999| accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref>

Historically, two large, arched doors allowed access to the church. However, only the left-hand entrance is currently accessible, as the right door has long since been bricked up. These entrances are located in the [[parvis]] of a larger courtyard, or plaza.

Also located along the parvis are a few smaller structures and openings:

* '''Chapel of the Franks''', a blue-domed, [[Roman Catholic]] crusader chapel dedicated to [[Our Lady of Sorrows]], which once provided exclusive access to Calvary. The chapel marks the 10th Station of the Cross (the stripping of Jesus' garments).
* A [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] and chapel, just beneath the Chapel of the Franks, dedicated to St. [[Mary of Egypt]].
* Various entrances to [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]], Greek Orthodox, and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] chapels.
* A small Greek Orthodox monastery, known as Gethsemane Metoxion, located to the side of the church.

Broken columns—once forming part of an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]—flank the church's front, covered in crusader graffiti mostly consisting of [[Christian cross|crosses]]. In the 13th century, the tops of the columns were removed and sent to Mecca by the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmids]].

The church's [[bell tower]] is located to the left of the façade. It is currently almost half its original size.<ref name=custodia>http://www.sepulchre.custodia.org/default.asp?id=4100</ref>

The historic [[Immovable Ladder]] stands beneath a window on the façade.

== Calvary (Golgotha) ==

{{main|Calvary}}

[[File:Golgotha Stone Chapel of Adam.jpg|thumb|The Rock of Calvary as seen in the Chapel of Adam.|right]]
[[File:Altar of the Crucifixion l.jpg|The Altar of the Crucifixion.|thumb]]
[[File:Altar of the Crucifixion in The Church of The Holy Sepulchre.ogv|The Altar of the Crucifixion.|thumb]]

On the south side of the altar, via the [[ambulatory]], is a stairway climbing to '''[[Calvary]]''' ('''Golgotha'''), traditionally regarded as the site of Jesus' crucifixion and the most lavishly decorated part of the church. The main altar there belongs to the Greek Orthodox, which contains the '''Rock of Calvary''' (12th Station of the Cross). The rock can be seen under glass on both sides of the altar, and beneath the altar there is a hole said to be the place where the cross was raised. Due to the significance of this, it is the most visited site in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The Roman Catholics ([[Franciscan]]s) have an altar to the side, the '''Chapel of the Nailing of the Cross''' (11th Station of the Cross). On the left of the altar, towards the Eastern Orthodox chapel, there is a statue of Mary, believed by some to be miraculous (the 13th Station of the Cross, where Jesus' body was removed from the cross and given to his family).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Beneath the Calvary and the two chapels there, on the main floor, there is '''The Chapel of Adam'''. According to tradition, Jesus was crucified over the place where Adam's skull was buried. According to some, at the crucifixion, the blood of Christ ran down the cross and through the rocks to fill the skull of Adam.<ref>William R. Cook of State University of New York, lecture series</ref> The Rock of Calvary appears cracked through a window on the altar wall, with the crack traditionally claimed to be caused by the earthquake that occurred when Jesus died on the cross, while some scholars claim it to be the result of quarrying against a natural flaw in the rock.<ref name=Patriarchate>{{cite web| title=The Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulcher| accessdate=2014-09-19 |url=http://monastery.org/sephist.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524035048/http://monastery.org/sephist.html| archivedate=24 May 2008| publisher=Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem}}</ref>

== Stone of Anointing ==

Just inside the entrance to the church is the '''Stone of Anointing''' (also '''Stone of the Anointing''' or '''Stone of Unction'''), which tradition believes to be the spot where Jesus' body was prepared for burial by [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. However, this tradition is only attested since the crusader era (notably by the Italian [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] pilgrim [[Riccoldo da Monte di Croce]] in 1288), and the present stone was only added in the 1810 reconstruction.<ref name="Murphy56"/>

The wall behind the stone is defined by its striking blue balconies and [[tau cross]]-bearing red banners (depicting the insignia of the [[Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre]]), and is decorated with lamps. The modern mosaic along the wall depicts the anointing of Jesus' body.

The wall was a temporary addition to support the arch above it, which had been weakened after the damage in the 1808 fire; it blocks the view of the rotunda, separates the entrance from the Catholicon, sits on top of the now-empty and desecrated graves of four 12th-century crusader kings—including [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]]—and is no longer structurally necessary. There is a difference of opinion as to whether it is [[Stations of the Cross|the 13th Station of the Cross]], which others identify as the lowering of Jesus from the cross and locate between the 11th and 12th stations up on Calvary.

The lamps that hang over the Stone of Unction, adorned with cross-bearing chain links, are contributed by Armenians, [[Copts]], Greeks and [[Western Christianity|Latins]].

Immediately to the left of the entrance is a bench that has traditionally been used by the church's Muslim doorkeepers, along with some Christian clergy, as well as electrical wiring. To the right of the entrance is a wall along the ambulatory containing, to the very right, the staircase leading to Golgatha. Further along the same wall is the entrance to the Chapel of Adam.

==Rotunda and Aedicule==
[[File:Aedicule which supposedly encloses the tomb of Jesus-LR1.jpg|The Aedicule|thumb|right|The Aedicule]]
The [[Rotunda (architecture)|Rotunda]] is located in the centre of the Anastasis, beneath the larger of the church's two domes. In the center of the Rotunda is the chapel called the '''Aedicule''', which contains the Holy Sepulchre itself. The Aedicule has two rooms, the first holding the '''Angel's Stone''', which is believed to be a fragment of the large stone that sealed the tomb; the second is the tomb itself. Due to the fact that pilgrims lay their hands on the tomb, a marble plaque was placed in the fourteenth century on the tomb to prevent further damage to the tomb.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

Under the ''status quo'', the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] Churches all have rights to the interior of the tomb, and all three communities celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] or [[Mass (liturgy)|Holy Mass]] there daily. It is also used for other ceremonies on special occasions, such as the [[Holy Saturday]] ceremony of the [[Holy Fire]] led by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch (with the participation of the Coptic and Armenian patriarchs).<ref name=holyfire>{{cite web| title=Miracle of Holy Fire which happens every year| url=http://www.holyfire.org/eng/index.htm| work=Holyfire.org| accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> To its rear, within a chapel constructed of iron [[latticework]] upon a stone base semicircular in plan, lies the altar used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]].{{citation needed|date = October 2013}} Historically, the [[Georgians]] also retained the key to the Aedicule.<ref name=Janin>{{cite book| last=Janin| first=Raymond| year=1913| page=35| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mu4MAAAAIAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=35| title=Échos d'Orient| volume=16| publisher=Institut français d'études byzantines| trans_title=Echos of the Orient}}</ref><ref name=Desandoli>{{cite book| last=DeSandoli| first=Sabino| title=The Church of Holy Sepulchre: Keys, Doors, Doorkeepers| year=1986| publisher=Franciscian Press| page=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=A Brief Description of the Holy Sepulchre Jerusalem and Other Christian Churches in the Holy City: With Some Account of the Medieval Copies of the Holy Sepulchre Surviving in Europe| url=http://www.amazon.com/description-Sepulchre-Jerusalem-Christian-mediaeval-ebook/dp/B00KVNHI6A| first=George| last=Jeffery| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1919| page=69| accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref>

Beyond that to the rear of the Rotunda is a rough-hewn chapel containing an opening to a chamber cut from the rock, from which several ''[[kokhim|kokh]]''-tombs radiate. Although this space was discovered recently,{{when|date=July 2012}} and contains no identifying marks, many Christians believe{{vague|date=July 2012}} it to be the tomb of [[Joseph of Arimathea]], and it is where the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] celebrate their Liturgy on Sundays. To the right of the Sepulchre on the southeastern edge of the Rotunda is the Chapel of the Apparition, which is reserved for Roman Catholic use.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Catholicon and Ambulatory==
[[File:Jerusalem Holy Sepulchre BW 15.JPG|thumb|left|The "[[Christ Pantocrator]]" mosaic in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]
[[File:Golgotha Crucifix.jpg|thumb|Cross of Golgotha]]
[[File:5289-20080123-jerusalem-holy-sepulchre-omphalos.jpg|thumb|right|The [[omphalos]] and the north wall of the [[Katholikon|Catholicon]]]]
* '''The Catholicon''' – On the east side opposite the Rotunda is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today ''the Greek Orthodox [[Katholikon|catholicon]]''. The second, smaller dome sits directly over the centre of the [[crossing (architecture)|transept crossing]] of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] where the ''compas'', an '''[[omphalos]]''' once thought to be the center of the world (associated to the site of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection), is situated. Since 1996 this dome is topped by the monumental Golgotha Crucifix which the Greek Patriarch Diodoros I of Jerusalem consecrated. It was at the initiative of Prof. Gustav Kühnel to erect a new crucifix at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem that would not only be worthy of the singularity of the site, but that would also become a symbol of the efforts of unity in the community of Christian faith.<ref name=hammers>{{cite web| title=The Cross of Golgotha| url=http://www.michaelhammers.com/en/projects/golgotha-cross-holy-sepulcher-jerusalem| publisher=Michael Hammers| date=24 June 2014| accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref>
East of this is a large [[iconostasis]] demarcating the Orthodox sanctuary before which is set the throne of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]] on the south side facing the throne of the Greek Orthodox [[Patriarch of Antioch]] on the north side.

[[File:Church of the Holy Sepulchre-08-Prison of Christ.jpg|thumb|The "Holy Prison", or Prison of Christ]]
* Prison of Christ – In the north-east side of the complex there is ''The Prison of Christ'', alleged by the Franciscans to be where Jesus was held. The Greek Orthodox allege that the real place that Jesus was held was the similarly named ''Prison of Christ'', within their ''Monastery of the Praetorium'', located near the [[Ecce Homo (church)|Church of Ecce Homo]], at the ''first station'' on the [[Via Dolorosa]]. The Armenians regard a recess in the ''Monastery of the Flagellation'', a building near the ''second station'' on the Via Dolorosa, as the ''Prison of Christ''. A cistern among the ruins near the [[Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu]] is also alleged to have been the ''Prison of Christ''.

Further to the east in the ambulatory are three chapels (from south to north):
* Greek Chapel of St. Longinus – The Orthodox Greek chapel is dedicated to St. Longinus, a Roman soldier who according the [[New Testament]] pierced Jesus with a spear.
* Armenian Chapel of Division of Robes
* Greek Chapel of the Derision – the southernmost chapel in the ambulatory.

==Armenian compound==
[[File:Church of the Holy Sepulchre-07-St Helen Chapel.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem]], the chapel called by the Armenian St. Gregory]]
* [[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem|Chapel of Saint Helena]]- between the first two chapels are stairs descending to Chapel of Saint Helena.
* Chapel of [[Vardan Mamikonian|Saint Vartan]] – on the north side of the Chapel of Saint Helena is an ornate [[wrought iron]] door, beyond which a raised artificial platform affords views of the [[Quarry]], and which leads to the ''Chapel of [[St. Vartan|Saint Vartan]]''. The latter Chapel contains archaeological remains from Hadrian's temple and Constantine's basilica. These areas are usually closed.
* Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross – another set of 22 stairs from the Chapel of Saint Helena leads down to the Roman Catholic ''Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross'' believed to be the place where the [[True Cross]] was found.

===North of the Aedicule===
* '''The Franciscan Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene''' – The chapel indicates the place where [[Mary Magdalene]] met Jesus after his resurrection.<ref name="fran">{{cite web|title=The Franciscans at the Holy Sepulchre|url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/jhs/TSspfran.html|publisher=The Franciscans of the Holy Land|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>
* '''The Franciscan Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament''' (or Chapel of the Apparition) – in memory of Jesus' meeting with his mother after the Resurrection.<ref name="fran"/>

===South of the Aedicule===
The three Greek Orthodox chapels of [[St. James the Just]], [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]], south of the rotunda and on the west side of the front courtyard originally formed the [[baptistery]] complex of the Constantinean church, the southern most chapel being the vestibule, the middle chapel being the actual [[baptistery]] and the north chapel being the chamber in which the patriarch [[chrism]]ated the newly baptized before leading them into the rotunda north of this complex.

==Status quo==
[[File:Immovable Ladder CotHS.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Immovable Ladder]]. Detail from photograph of main entrance above the façade.]]

The primary custodians are the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Churches, with the [[Greek Orthodox]] Church having the lion's share. In the 19th century, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] acquired lesser responsibilities, which include shrines and other structures within and around the building. Times and places of worship for each community are strictly regulated in common areas.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

Establishment of the 1853 status quo did not halt the violence, which continues to break out every so often even in modern times. On a hot summer day in 2002, a [[Coptic monasticism|Coptic monk]] moved his chair from its agreed spot into the shade. This was interpreted as a hostile move by the Ethiopians, and eleven were hospitalized after the resulting fracas.<ref>{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Chris|title=Christian History Corner: Divvying up the Most Sacred Place|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/julyweb-only/7-29-52.0.html|accessdate=2 March 2012|newspaper=[[Christianity Today]]|date=1 July 2002}}</ref>

In another incident in 2004, during Orthodox celebrations of the [[Feast of the Cross|Exaltation of the Holy Cross]], a door to the Franciscan chapel was left open. This was taken as a sign of disrespect by the Orthodox and a fistfight broke out. Some people were arrested, but no one was seriously injured.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,1314466,00.html | work=[[The Guardian]]| location=London| title=Punch-up at tomb of Jesus| date=28 September 2004| accessdate=2014-09-19| first=Allyn| last=Fisher-Ilan}}</ref>

[[File:Catholic monks in Jerusalem 2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[Franciscan]]s during the procession on The Calvary, 2006]]
On [[Palm Sunday]], in April 2008, a brawl broke out when a Greek [[monk]] was ejected from the building by a rival faction. Police were called to the scene but were also attacked by the enraged brawlers.<ref name=chronicle>{{cite news| title=Christians brawl at Jesus' tomb| url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Christians-brawl-at-Jesus-tomb-3218579.php| first=Sarah| last=El Deeb| agency=Associated Press| work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=21 April 2008 |accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref> On Sunday, 9 November 2008, a clash erupted between Armenian and Greek monks during celebrations for the [[Feast of the Cross]].<ref name=times>{{cite news| title=Riot police called as monks clash in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre| work=[[The Times]]| subscription=yes| date=10 November 2008| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article2099808.ece| accessdate=2014-09-19 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=olaughlin>{{cite news| url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/11/middleeast| date=10 November 2008| title=The monks who keep coming to blows in Jerusalem| work=The Guardian| last=O'Laughlin| first=Toni| accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref>

Under the ''status quo'', no part of what is designated as common territory may be so much as rearranged without consent from all communities. This often leads to the neglect of badly needed repairs when the communities cannot come to an agreement among themselves about the final shape of a project. Just such a disagreement has delayed the renovation of the ''[[edicule]]'', where the need is now dire, but also where any change in the structure might result in a change to the ''status quo'', disagreeable to one or more of the communities.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

A less grave sign of this state of affairs is located on a window ledge over the church's entrance. A wooden ladder was placed there at some time before 1852, when the ''status quo'' defined both the doors and the window ledges as common ground. This ladder, the "[[Immovable Ladder]]", remains to this day, in almost exactly the same position it occupied in century-old photographs and engravings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coastdaylight.com/ladder.html |title=Holy Sepulchre Ladder |publisher=Coastdaylight.com |accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=herman>{{cite web| quote=An unusual and rare location of the ladder was documented by an Israeli tour guide in February 2009| url=http://www.dannythedigger.com/newsletter/who-moved-thy-ladder| title=Who moved thy ladder?| publisher=Danny the Digger| accessdate=2014-09-19| year=2010}}</ref> An engraving by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] in 1839 also shows the same ladder in the same position.<ref name=loc>{{cite web| url=http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002717452/ |title=Entrance to the holy sepulchre; title page, vol. 1 |date=1842 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref>

No one controls the main entrance. In 1192, Saladin (Salah ad-Din Yusuf al-Ayyubi) assigned door keeping responsibilities to the Muslim [[Nusaybah clan|Nuseibeh]] family. The wooden doors that compose the main entrance are the original, highly carved doors.<ref>William R. Cook of University of New York, lecture series</ref> The [[Joudeh Al-Goudia family]] were entrusted as custodian to the keys of the Holy Sepulchre by Saladin in 1187.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} This arrangement has persisted into modern times.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Connection to Temple of Aphrodite==
[[File:Roman Jerusalem.PNG|thumb|right|Jerusalem after being rebuilt by Hadrian. Two main east-west roads were built rather than the typical one, due to the awkward location of the Temple Mount, blocking the central east-west route.]]
The site of the Church had been a temple of Aphrodite prior to Constantine's edifice being built. Hadrian's temple had actually been located there because it was the junction of the [[Cardo|main north-south road]] with one of the two [[Decumanus Maximus|main east-west roads]] and directly adjacent to the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] (which is now the location of the (smaller) [[Muristan]]); the forum itself had been placed, as is traditional in Roman towns, at the junction of the main north-south road with the (other) main east-west road (which is now El-Bazar/David Street). The temple and forum together took up the entire space between the two main east-west roads (a few above-ground remains of the east end of the temple precinct still survive in the Alexander Nevsky Church complex of the ''Russian Mission in Exile'').

From the archaeological excavations in the 1970s, it is clear that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the ''Triportico'' and ''Rotunda'' roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least as far back as the Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further. [[Virgilio Canio Corbo]], a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall, of the temple itself, would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any ''tomb'' would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.<ref name="Corbo">{{cite book| first=Virgilio| last=Corbo| trans_title=The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem| year=1981| title=Il Santo Sepolcro di Gerusalemme| publisher=Franciscan Press| url=http://books.google.it/books/about/Il_Santo_Sepolcro_di_Gerusalemme.html?hl=it&id=wYFtAAAAMAAJ| language=Italian}}</ref>

Other archaeologists have criticized Corbo's reconstructions.. [[Dan Bahat]], the former city archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, as there is no known Temple of Aphrodite matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the Temple Building was on a platform raised high enough to avoid including anything sited where the Aedicule is now; indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda wasn't based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.<ref name="BahatBAR">{{cite journal| first=Dan| last=Bahat| title=Does the Holy Sepulchre Church Mark the Burial of Jesus?| url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&Volume=12&Issue=3&ArticleID=1| work=[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]| date=May–June 1986| subscription=yes| accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref>

==Location==
[[File:JerusalemBonfils.jpg|thumb|upright|Tourists and pilgrims at a side entrance to the Holy Sepulchre, photo by [[Bonfils]], 1870s]] 
The Bible describes Jesus' tomb as being outside the city wall,<ref>for example, {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|13:12|}}</ref> as was normal for burials across the ancient world, which were regarded as unclean.<ref>Toynbee, Jocelyn M. C. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=rHd1MDlV-eUC&pg=PA14&dq=Funerary+art&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=mfHeS-XqKYniywT0nb3_CA&cd=21#v=onepage&q=Funerary%20art&f=false Death and Burial in the Roman World]'', pp. 48–49, JHU Press. 1996. ISBN 0-8018-5507-1. An exception in the Classical World were the [[Lycia]]ns of [[Anatolia]]. There are also the Egyptian mortuary-temples, where the object of worship was the deified royal person entombed, but Egyptian temples to the major gods contained no burials.</ref> Today, the site of the Church is within the current walls of the old city of Jerusalem. It has been well documented by Archaeologists that in the time of Jesus, the walled city was smaller and the wall then was to the East of the current site of the Church{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. In other words, the city had been much narrower in Jesus' time, with the site then having been outside the walls; since [[Herod Agrippa]] (41–44) is recorded by history as extending the city to the north (beyond the present northern walls), the required repositioning of the western wall is traditionally attributed to him as well. The church is a part of the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]].

The area immediately to the south and east of the sepulchre was a quarry and outside the city during the early 1st century as excavations under the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer across the street demonstrated.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Influence==
[[File:S. Stefano (Bologna) - planimetria.svg|thumb|upright|Plan of [[Santo Stefano (Bologna)|Santo Stefano]] in [[Bologna]]. (4) is inspired by the rotunda of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.]]

From the 9th century, the construction of churches inspired in the Anastasis was extended across Europe.<ref name="SantoStefano">[http://www.abbaziasantostefano.it/storia.htm Monastero di Santo Stefano: Basilica Santuario Santo Stefano: Storia], Bologna.</ref>
One example is [[Santo Stefano (Bologna)|Santo Stefano]] in [[Bologna]], Italy, an agglomeration of seven churches recreating shrines of Jerusalem.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

Several churches and monasteries in Europe, for instance, in Germany and Russia, and at least one church in the United States have been modeled on the Church of the Resurrection, some even reproducing other [[holy places]] for the benefit of pilgrims who could not travel to the Holy Land. They include the [[:de:Heiliges Grab (Görlitz)|Heiliges Grab]] of [[Görlitz]], constructed between 1481 and 1504,the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] in [[Moscow Oblast]], constructed by [[Patriarch Nikon]] between 1656 to 1666, and [[Mount St. Sepulchre Franciscan Monastery]] built by the [[Franciscans]] in Washington, DC in 1898.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}
