An important one is the solar day, defined as the time it takes for the Sun to return to its culmination point (its highest point in the sky). Because the Earth orbits the Sun elliptically as the Earth spins on an inclined axis, this period can be up to 7.9 seconds more than (or less than) 24 hours. On average over the year this day is equivalent to 24 hours (86 400 seconds).</paragraph><paragraph>A day, in the sense of daytime that is distinguished from night-time, is commonly defined as the period during which<space/><link><target>sunlight</target></link><space/>directly reaches the ground, assuming that there are no local obstacles. The length of daytime averages slightly more than half of the 24-hour day. Two effects make daytime on average longer than nights. The Sun is not a point, but has an apparent size of about 32<space/><link><target>minute of arc</target><part>minutes of arc</part></link>. Additionally, the<space/><link><target>Earth's atmosphere</target><part>atmosphere</part></link><space/><link><target>refraction</target><part>refracts</part></link><space/>sunlight in such a way that some of it reaches the ground even when the Sun is below the horizon by about 34 minutes of arc. So the first light reaches the ground when the centre of the Sun is still below the horizon by about 50 minutes of arc. The difference in time depends on the angle at which the Sun rises and sets (itself a function of<space/><link><target>latitude</target></link>), but can amount to around seven minutes.</paragraph><paragraph>Ancient custom has a new day start at either the rising or setting of the Sun on the local horizon (Italian reckoning, for example<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">October 2015</arg></template>). The exact moment of, and the interval between, two sunrises or sunsets depends on the geographical position (<link><target>longitude</target></link><space/>as well as latitude), and the time of<space/><link><target>year</target></link><space/>(as indicated by ancient hemispherical<space/><link><target>sundial</target><trail>s</trail></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>A more constant day can be defined by the Sun passing through the local<space/><link><target>meridian (geography)</target><part>meridian</part></link>, which happens at local<space/><link><target>noon</target></link><space/>(upper<space/><link><target>culmination</target></link>) or<space/><link><target>midnight</target></link><space/>(lower culmination). The exact moment is dependent on the geographical longitude, and to a lesser extent on the time of the year. The length of such a day is nearly constant (24 hours 30 seconds). This is the time as indicated by modern sundials.</paragraph><paragraph>A further improvement defines a fictitious mean Sun that moves with constant speed along the<space/><link><target>celestial equator</target></link>; the speed is the same as the average speed of the real Sun, but this removes the variation over a year as the Earth moves along its orbit around the Sun (due to both its velocity and its axial tilt).</paragraph><paragraph>The Earth's day has increased in length over time.

Common convention in modern times is for the civil day to begin at midnight, i.e. 00:00, and last a full 24 hours until 24:00 (i.e. 00:00 of the next day). Prior to 1926,<space/><link><target>Turkey</target></link><space/>had two time systems: Turkish (counting the hours from sunset) and French (counting the hours from midnight).</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>ancient Egypt</target></link>, the day was reckoned from sunrise to sunrise.<space/><link><target>Muslim</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>fast from sunrise to sunset each day during the month of<space/><link><target>Ramadan (calendar month)</target><part>Ramadan</part></link>.

For example,&quot;Friday night&quot; usually means the entire night between Friday and Saturday. This difference from the civil day often leads to confusion. Events starting at midnight are often announced as occurring the day before. TV-guides tend to list nightly programs at the previous day, although programming a<space/><link><target>Videocassette recorder</target><part>VCR</part></link><space/>requires the strict logic of starting the new day at 00:00 (to further confuse the issue, VCRs set to the 12-hour clock notation will label this &quot;12:00 AM&quot;). Expressions like &quot;today&quot;, &quot;yesterday&quot; and &quot;tomorrow&quot; become ambiguous during the night. Because Jews and Muslims begin their days at nightfall, &quot;Saturday&quot; (Arabic word) night, for example, is what most people would call Friday night.</paragraph><paragraph>Validity of<space/><link><target>Ticket (admission)</target><part>ticket</part><trail>s</trail></link>, passes, etc., for a day or a number of days may end at midnight, or closing time, when that is earlier. However, if a service (e.g.,<space/><link><target>public transport</target></link>) operates from for example, 6:00 to 1:00 the next day (which may be noted as 25:00), the last hour may well count as being part of the previous day (also for the arrangement of the<space/><link><target>Public transport timetable</target><part>timetable</part></link>). For services depending on the day (&quot;closed on Sundays&quot;, &quot;does not run on Fridays&quot;, and so on) there is a risk of ambiguity. As an example, for the<space/><link><target>Nederlandse Spoorwegen</target></link><space/>(Dutch Railways), a day ticket is valid 28 hours, from 0:00 to 28:00 (that is, 4:00 the next day).
