==Early life==
Delroy Lindo was born in 1952 in [[Eltham]], south-east [[London]], the son of [[Jamaica]]n [[British Jamaican|parents]] who had migrated to England. He was brought up in nearby [[Lewisham]] and got interested in acting as a child in a [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] play. His mother was a [[nurse]] and his father worked in various jobs.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_10_57/ai_97997635 Are these the 5 best actors in America? - under rated - Entertainment - Don Cheadle, Delroy Lindo, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Ving Rhames And Jeffrey Wright | Ebony | Find Articles at BNET.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As a [[teenager]], he and his mother moved to [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. When he was sixteen, they moved to [[San Francisco]].<ref name="cricket"/> At the age of 24, Lindo started acting studies at the [[American Conservatory Theater]], graduating in 1979.<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/delroy-lindo/bio/146992 "Delroy Lindo"], TV Guide</ref>

==Career==
Lindo's movie debut came in 1976 with the British comedy ''[[Find the Lady (1976 film)|Find The Lady]]'', followed by two other roles in films, including an Army [[Sergeant]] in ''[[More American Graffiti]]'' (1979). 

He quit film for 10 years to concentrate on theatre acting. In 1982 he debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[["Master Harold"...and the Boys]],'' directed by the play's [[South Africa]]n author [[Athol Fugard]]. By 1988 Lindo had earned a [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination for his portrayal of Herald Loomis in [[August Wilson]]'s ''[[Joe Turner's Come and Gone]]''.

Lindo returned to film in the 1990s, acting alongside [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Joan Chen]] in the cult science fiction movie ''[[The Blood of Heroes|Salute of the Jugger]]'' (1990), which has become a cult classic. Although he had turned down [[Spike Lee]] for a role in his debut ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', Lee cast him as Woody Carmichael in the drama ''[[Crooklyn]]'' (1994), which brought him notice. Together with his other roles with Lee - as the West Indian Archie, a psychotic gangster, in ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'', and a starring role as a neighbourhood drug dealer in ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]'' - he became established in his film career. 

Other films in which he has starring roles are [[Barry Sonnenfeld]]'s ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'' (1995), Ron Howard's ''[[Ransom (1996 film)|Ransom]]'' (1996), and ''[[Soul of the Game]]'' (1996), as the baseball player [[Satchel Paige]]. As a character actor, Lindo has readily taken on roles as treacherous bad guys as well as those of trustworthy professionals. 

In 1998 Lindo co-starred as African-American explorer [[Matthew Henson]], in the TV movie ''Glory & Honor'', directed by [[Kevin Hooks]]. It portrayed his nearly 20-year partnership with Commander [[Robert Peary]] in Arctic exploration and their effort to find the [[Geographic North Pole]] in 1909. He received a Satellite Award as best actor. Lindo continues to work in television and was most recently seen on the short-lived NBC drama ''[[Kidnapped (2006 TV series)|Kidnapped]]''.

Lindo played an angel in the comedy film ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]'' (1997), in which [[Dan Hedaya]] played the [[angel]] [[Gabriel]], and Lindo's boss. He guest-starred on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the episode "[[Brawl in the Family (The Simpsons)|Brawl in the Family]]", playing a similar character named Gabriel. 

Lindo had a small role in the 1995 science fiction/action film ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]],'' playing the [[corruption|corrupt]] [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Wanta. Lindo was not credited for the role, but one of his lines in the film, ''"Stop eating my sesame cake!"'', has become an [[internet meme]].

In the British film, ''[[Wondrous Oblivion]]'' (2003), directed by Paul Morrison, he starred as Dennis Samuels, the father of a Jamaican immigrant family in London in the 1950s; he coaches his children and the son of a neighbour Jewish family in [[cricket]], earning their admiration in a time of strained social relations. Lindo said he made the film in honor of his parents, who had similarly moved to London in those years.<ref name="cricket">[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/26/1085461828735.html "It's not just cricket"], ''The Age,'' 30 May 2004, accessed 27 September 2014.</ref>

In 2007, Lindo began an association with [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]] in [[Berkeley, California]], when he directed [[Tanya Barfield]]'s play ''The Blue Door''. In the fall of 2008, Lindo revisited [[August Wilson]]'s play, ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone'', directing a production at the Berkeley Rep. In 2010, he played the role of elderly seer Bynum in [[David Lan]]'s production of ''Joe Turner'' at the [[Young Vic Theatre]] in London.
