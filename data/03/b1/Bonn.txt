'''Bonn''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbɔn|-|De-Bonn.ogg}}), officially the '''Federal City of Bonn''', is a city on the banks of the [[Rhine]] and northwest of the
[[Siebengebirge]] (Seven Mountains) in the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], with a population of 311,287 within its administrative limits. Bonn serves alongside the capital [[Berlin]] as the [[seat of government]] of Germany. The city is the second official seat and second official residence of the [[President of Germany]], the [[Chancellor of Germany]], the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], and the first official seat and first official residence of [[Cabinet of Germany|six German federal ministries]]. Bonn is located in the southernmost part of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] region, the largest metropolitan area of Germany, with over 11 million inhabitants.

Founded in the first century BC as a Roman settlement, Bonn is one of Germany's oldest cities. From 1597 to 1794, Bonn was the capital of the [[Electorate of Cologne]] and residence of the Archbishops and Prince-electors of Cologne. In 1949, the [[Parlamentarischer Rat|Parliamentary Council]] drafted and adopted the German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] in Bonn. Though [[Berlin]] was symbolically named the ''de jure'' capital, from 1949 to 1990 Bonn was the seat of government and [[Capital of Germany|''de facto'' capital]] of [[West Germany]]. In recognition of its former status as German capital, it holds the name of [[Federal City]] (''Bundesstadt'').

The two [[DAX|DAX-listed]] corporations [[Deutsche Post DHL]] and [[Deutsche Telekom]] have headquarters in Bonn. The city is also the location of 19 [[United Nations]] institutions and the [[University of Bonn]]. Bonn is the birthplace of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (born 1770).

==Climate==

Bonn has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''). Located in the south of the Cologne lowland in the Rhine valley, Bonn is in one of Germany's warmest regions.

[[File:Altes Rathaus Bonn.jpg|thumb|View of the Old City Hall from the Market Square]]

The history of the city dates back to Roman times. In about 11 BC, the [[Roman army]] appears to have stationed a small unit in what is presently the historical centre of the city. Even earlier, the army had resettled members of a Germanic tribal group allied with Rome, the [[Ubii]], in Bonn. The Latin name for that settlement, "Bonna", may stem from the original population of this and many other settlements in the area, the [[Eburones|Eburoni]]. The Eburoni were members of a large tribal coalition effectively wiped out during the final phase of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars|War in Gaul]]. After several decades, the army gave up the small camp linked to the Ubii-settlement. During the 1st century AD, the army then chose a site to the north of the emerging town in what is now the section of Bonn-Castell to build a large military installation dubbed [[Castra]] Bonnensis, i.e., literally, "Fort Bonn". Initially built from wood, the fort was eventually rebuilt in stone. With additions, changes and new construction, the fort remained in use by the army into the waning days of the [[Western Roman Empire]], possibly the mid-5th century. The structures themselves remained standing well into the [[Middle Ages]], when they were called the Bonnburg. They were used by [[List of Frankish kings|Frankish kings]] until they fell into disuse. Eventually, much of the building materials seem to have been re-used in the construction of Bonn's 13th-century [[Defensive wall|city wall]]. The Sterntor (''star gate'') in the city center is a reconstruction using the last remnants of the medieval city wall.

To date, Bonn's Roman fort remains the largest fort of its type known from the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], i.e. a fort built to accommodate a full-strength [[Roman legion|Imperial Legion]] and its auxiliaries. The fort covered an area of approximately {{convert|250000|m2|acre}}. Between its walls it contained a dense grid of streets and a multitude of buildings, ranging from spacious headquarters and large officers' quarters to [[barracks]], [[stable]]s and a [[Military prison|military jail]]. Among the legions stationed in Bonn, the "1st", i.e. the [[Legio I Minervia|Prima Legio Minervia]], seems to have served here the longest. Units of the Bonn legion were deployed to theatres of war ranging from modern-day [[Algeria]] to what is now the Russian republic of [[Chechnya]].

The chief [[Roman roads|Roman road]] linking the provincial capitals of [[Cologne]] and [[Mainz]] cut right through the fort where it joined the fort's main road (now, Römerstraße). Once past the South Gate, the Cologne–Mainz road continued along what are now streets named Belderberg, Adenauerallee et al. On both sides of the road, the local settlement, ''Bonna'', grew into a sizeable Roman town.

In [[late antiquity]], much of the town seems to have been destroyed by marauding invaders. The remaining civilian population then took refuge inside the fort along with the remnants of the troops stationed here. During the final decades of Imperial rule, the troops were supplied by [[Franks|Franci]] chieftains employed by the Roman administration. When the end came, these troops simply shifted their allegiances to the new barbarian rulers, the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. From the fort, the Bonnburg, as well as from a new medieval settlement to the South centered around what later became the [[Bonn Minster|minster]], grew the medieval city of Bonn. Local legends arose from this period that the name of the village came from [[Saint Boniface]] via [[Vulgar Latin]] ''*Bonnifatia'', but this proved to be a myth.

Between the 11th and 13th centuries, the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style Bonn Minster was built, and in 1597 Bonn became the seat of the [[Diocese|Archdiocese]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|Cologne]]. The city gained more influence and grew considerably. The city was subject to a major bombardment during the [[Siege of Bonn (1689)|Siege of Bonn]] in 1689. The [[Electorate of Cologne|elector]] [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]] (ruled 1723–1761) ordered the construction of a series of [[Baroque]] buildings which still give the city its character. Another memorable ruler was [[Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria|Max Franz]] (ruled 1784–1794), who founded the university and the spa quarter of [[Bad Godesberg]]. In addition he was a patron of the young [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who was born in Bonn in 1770; the elector financed the composer's first journey to [[Vienna]].

In 1794, the city was seized by [[France|French]] troops, becoming a part of the [[First French Empire]]. In 1815 following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Bonn became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Administered within the Prussian [[Rhine Province]], the city became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the Prussian-led [[unification of Germany]]. Bonn was of little relevance in these years.

===History since 1945===
During [[World War II]], Bonn acquired military significance because of its strategic location on the Rhine River, which formed a natural barrier to easy penetration into the German heartland from the west. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Bonn on 7 March 1945, and the US [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] captured the city during the battle of 8–9 March 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 76.</ref>

Following World War II, Bonn was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] zone of occupation, and in 1949 became the ''de facto'' capital of the newly formed Federal Republic of Germany (the ''de jure'' capital of the Federal Republic throughout the years of the Cold War division of Germany was always Berlin). Such "provisional" capital cities have been common in history; for example, the "official" capital of the [[Republic of China]] is still [[Nanjing]] on mainland China, with [[Taipei]] considered the provisional capital.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/12/05/2003578356|accessdate=Dec 5, 2013|agency=Taipei Times}}</ref> The choice of Bonn was made mainly due to the advocacy of West Germany's first chancellor, [[Konrad Adenauer]], a former [[Cologne]] Mayor and a native of that area. This was despite the fact that [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] already had most of the required facilities and using Bonn was estimated to be 95 million DM more expensive than using Frankfurt. However, Adenauer and other prominent politicians intended to make Berlin the capital of the reunified Germany, and felt that locating the capital in a major city like Frankfurt or [[Hamburg]] would imply a permanent capital and weaken support in West Germany for reunification.

Because of its relatively small size for a capital city, Bonn was sometimes referred to, jokingly, as the '''''B'''undeshauptstadt '''o'''hne '''n'''ennenswertes '''N'''achtleben'' (Federal capital without noteworthy nightlife) or the '''''Bundesdorf''''' (Federal Village).<ref name="time">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940432,00.html |title=C'est Si Bonn |work=TIME |date=May 29, 1964 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> At one point in the post-WWII/[[Cold War]] era, the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Diplomatic mission|Embassy]] in Bonn was America's largest, "comparable, with its thousands of staff, to the [U.S.] [[Baghdad]] embassy today".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/opinion/26cohen.html "Remembering Germany"] by [[Roger Cohen]], ''The New York Times'', "Published 25 January 2009". Retrieved 1-26-09.</ref>

[[German reunification]] in 1990 made Berlin the nominal capital of Germany again. This decision did not mandate that the republic's political institutions would also move. While some argued for the seat of government to move to Berlin, others advocated leaving it in Bonn—a situation roughly analogous to that of the [[Netherlands]], where [[Amsterdam]] is the capital but [[The Hague]] is the seat of government. Berlin's previous history as united Germany's capital was strongly connected with [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]], the [[Weimar Republic]] and more ominously with [[Nazi Germany]]. It was felt that a new peacefully united Germany should not be governed from a city connected to such overtones of war. Additionally, Bonn was closer to [[Brussels]], headquarters of the EU.

The heated debate that resulted was settled by the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Germany's parliament) only on 20 June 1991. By a vote of 338–320,<ref>[http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20110615-35655.html "Bonn to Berlin move still controversial"], ''The Local'', "Published 11 June 2011". Retrieved 01-02-12.</ref> the Bundestag voted to move the seat of government to Berlin.  The vote broke largely along regional lines, with legislators from the south and west favouring Bonn and legislators from the north and east voting for Berlin.<ref>"Nationalatlas aktuell", [http://aktuell.nationalatlas.de/Hauptstadtbeschluss.6_06-2011.0.html "Hauptstadtbeschluss"] by Sebastian Lentz, "Published 17 Juni 2011". Retrieved 9-20-12.</ref><ref>Laux, Hans-Dieter, "Berlin oder Bonn? Geographische Aspekte eine Parlamentsentscheidung", "Geographische Rundschau", 43:12, 740–743, 1991.</ref>  It also broke along generational lines as well; older legislators with memories of Berlin's past glory favoured Berlin, while younger legislators favoured Bonn.  Ultimately, the votes of the ''[[New states of Germany#Culture|Ossi]]'' legislators tipped the balance in favour of Berlin.<ref>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008|last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |ISBN=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>

While the government and parliament moved to Berlin, as a compromise, some of the ministries (such as Defence and Agriculture) largely remained in Bonn, with only the top officials based in Berlin. There was no plan to move these departments, and so Bonn remained a second, unofficial capital with the new title "Federal City" (Bundesstadt). Because of the necessary construction work, the move took until 1999 to complete. Over 8,000 of the 18,000 federal officials remain in Bonn.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/world/europe/24berlin.html |title=In Germany’s Capitals, Cold War Memories and Imperial Ghosts | deadurl= no | work=The New York Times |first=Alan |last=Cowell |date=2011-06-23}}</ref>

At present, the private sector plays a major role in Bonn's economy. With five stock listed companies, Bonn has the 4th highest market capitalisation among German cities. With headquarters of DHL, T-Mobile and other renowned companies, managers have replaced the public sector.

Beethoven's birthplace is located in Bonngasse near the market place. Next to the market place is the Old City Hall, built in 1737 in [[Rococo]] style, under the rule of [[Clemens August of Bavaria]]. It is used for receptions of guests of the city, and as an office for the mayor. Nearby is the ''[[Electoral Palace, Bonn|Kurfürstliches Schloss]]'', built as a residence for the prince-elector and now the main building of the [[University of Bonn]].

The ''Poppelsdorfer Allee'' is an avenue flanked by [[Chestnut|chestnut trees]] which had the first [[horsecar]] of the city. It connects the ''Kurfürstliches Schloss'' with the ''[[Poppelsdorfer Schloss]]'', a palace that was built as a resort for the prince-electors in the first half of the 18th century, and whose grounds are now a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Bonn]]). This axis is interrupted by a railway line and [[Bonn Hauptbahnhof]], a building erected in 1883/84.

The [[Beethoven Monument, Bonn|Beethoven Monument]] stands on the Münsterplatz, which is flanked by the [[Bonn Minster]], one of Germany's oldest churches.

The three highest buildings in the city are the [[Radio masts and towers|radio mast]] of [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] in Bonn-Venusberg (180&nbsp;m), the headquarters of the [[Deutsche Post]] called ''[[Post Tower]]'' (162.5&nbsp;m) and the former building for the German members of parliament ''[[Langer Eugen]]'' (114.7&nbsp;m) now the new location of the [[United Nations|UN]] Campus.

==Districts==

In 1969, the independent towns of [[Bad Godesberg]] and [[Beuel]] as well as several villages were incorporated into Bonn, resulting in a city more than twice as large as before. Bad Godesberg and Beuel became districts (''Stadtbezirke'') of Bonn with some independence and populations of about 70,000 each.

Each district has its own quarters:
* '''[[Bad Godesberg]]''': Alt-Godesberg, [[Friesdorf (Bonn)|Friesdorf]], Godesberg-Nord, Godesberg-Villenviertel, Heiderhof, Hochkreuz, Lannesdorf, Mehlem, Muffendorf, Pennenfeld, Plittersdorf, Rüngsdorf, Schweinheim

==Transport==
[[File:Bonn from the ISS.jpeg|thumb|Winter in Bonn, seen from the [[International Space Station]]]]
Bonn is connected to three [[autobahn]]s (federal motorways) and the [[Deutsche Bahn|German rail]] network. Some [[Intercity-Express|InterCityExpress]] and most [[InterCity]] trains call at [[Bonn Hauptbahnhof]] whilst the [[Siegburg/Bonn railway station]] is situated on the [[Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line]] outside of Bonn and serviced by InterCityExpress trains. Local transport is provided by the [[Bonn Stadtbahn]], which also features two lines to [[Cologne]].

Bonn's international airport is [[Cologne Bonn Airport]].

==Demographics==
As of 2011, Bonn had a population of 327,913.  About 70% of the population was entirely of German origin, while about 100,000 people, equating to roughly 30%, were at least partly of non-German origin.

==International relations==
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}
Since 1983, the City of Bonn has established friendship relations with the City of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], and since 1988 Bonn, in former times the residence of the Princes Electors of Cologne, and [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]], the formerly most important residential city of the Prussian rulers, have established a city-to-city partnership.

Central Bonn is surrounded by a number of traditional towns and villages which were independent up to several decades ago. As many of those communities had already established their own contacts and partnerships before the regional and local reorganisation in 1969, the Federal City of Bonn now has a dense network of city district partnerships with European partner towns.

The city district of Bonn is a partner of the English university city of [[Oxford]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] (since 1947), of [[Budafok]], District XXII of [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (since 1991) and of [[Opole]], [[Poland]] (officially since 1997; contacts were established 1954).

The district of Bad Godesberg has established partnerships with [[Saint-Cloud]] in [[France]], [[Frascati]] in [[Italy]], [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead|Windsor and Maidenhead]] in [[England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Kortrijk]] in [[Belgium]]; a friendship agreement has been signed with the town of [[Yalova]], [[Turkey]].

The district of Beuel on the right bank of the Rhine and the city district of Hardtberg foster partnerships with towns in [[France]]: [[Mirecourt]] and [[Villemomble]].

Moreover, the city of Bonn has developed a concept of international co-operation and maintains sustainability oriented project partnerships in addition to traditional city twinning, among others with [[Minsk]] in [[Belarus]], [[Ulaanbaatar]] in [[Mongolia]], [[Bukhara]] in [[Uzbekistan]], [[Chengdu]] in [[China]] and [[La Paz]] in [[Bolivia]].
