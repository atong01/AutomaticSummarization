'''Cecil Louis Troughton Smith''' (27 August 1899 – 2 April 1966), known by his pen name '''Cecil Scott "C. S." Forester''', was an English novelist known for writing tales of [[naval warfare]] such as the 12-book [[Horatio Hornblower]] series, depicting a [[Royal Navy]] officer during the [[Napoleonic wars]]> His other works include ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' (1935; filmed in 1951 by [[John Huston]]), as well as ''[[A Ship of the Line]]'' and ''[[Flying Colours (novel)|Flying Colours]]'', which were jointly awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction in 1938.

== Early years ==
Forester was born in [[Cairo]] and, after a family breakup at an early age, moved with his mother to London, where he was educated at [[Alleyn's School]] and [[Dulwich College]], south London. At Alleyn's he was a contemporary of E.S. Hornblower, who died on active service with the Canadian Infantry in 1917.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} He began to study medicine at [[Guy's Hospital]], London, but left without completing his degree. Forester had always worn glasses and been thin. Tying to enlist in the army, he failed his physical and was told there was not a chance that he would be accepted, even though he was of good height and somewhat athletic. Around 1921, after leaving Guy's, he began writing seriously using his pen name.

==World War II==
During World War II, Forester moved to the United States where he worked for the British Information Service and wrote propaganda to encourage the US to join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. He eventually settled in [[Berkeley, California]]. While living in [[Washington, D.C.]], he met a young British intelligence officer named [[Roald Dahl]] in early 1942, whose experiences in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] he had heard about, and encouraged him to write about them.<ref name=Dahl>Sturrock, Donald (2010). ''Storyteller: The Life of Roald Dahl''. p.168. [[Harper Collins]]. Retrieved 28 October 2012</ref> According to Dahl's autobiographical ''Lucky Break'', Forester asked Dahl about his experiences as a fighter pilot. This prompted Dahl to write his first story, "A Piece of Cake".<ref name=Dahl />

==Literary career==
Forester wrote many novels. He is best known for the 12-book [[Horatio Hornblower]] series, depicting a [[Royal Navy]] officer during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. He began the series with Hornblower fairly high in rank in the first novel, published in 1937. The last completed novel was published in 1962. With demand for more stories, Forester filled in Hornblower's back story, in effect. Hornblower's fictional feats were based on real events, but Forester wrote the body of the works carefully to avoid entanglements with real world history, so Hornblower is always off on another mission when a great naval victory occurs during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. This is a contrast to the writer [[Patrick O'Brian]], who began a series in the same historic era in 1969, who put his Royal Navy captain [[Jack Aubrey]] in the midst of some real victories, or watching others as a prisoner of war.

Forester's Other novels include ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' (1935) and ''[[The General (C. S. Forester novel)|The General]]'' (1936); [[Peninsular War]] novels in ''[[Death to the French]]'' (published in the United States as ''Rifleman Dodd'') and ''[[The Gun (novel)|The Gun]]'' (filmed as ''[[The Pride and the Passion]]'' in 1957); and seafaring stories that did not involve Hornblower, such as ''[[Brown on Resolution]]'' (1929); ''[[The Captain from Connecticut]]'' (1941); ''[[The Ship (novel)|The Ship]]'' (1943) and ''[[The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck|Hunting the Bismarck]]'' (1959), which was used as the basis of the screenplay for the film ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' (1960). Several of his works were filmed, including ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), directed by [[John Huston]]. Forester is also credited as story writer for several movies not based on his published fiction, including ''[[Commandos Strike at Dawn]]'' (1942).

He wrote several volumes of short stories set during the [[Second World War]]. Those in ''The Nightmare'' (1954) were based on events in [[Nazi Germany]], ending at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].  Stories in ''The Man in the Yellow Raft'' (1969) followed the career of the destroyer USS ''Boon'', while many of those in ''Gold from Crete'' (1971) followed the destroyer HMS ''Apache''. The last of the stories in the latter book - "If Hitler had invaded England" - offers an imagined sequence of events starting with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s attempt to implement [[Operation Sea Lion]], and culminating in the early military defeat of Nazi Germany in the summer of 1941. His non-fiction seafaring works include ''The Age of Fighting Sail'' (1956), an account of the sea battles between Great Britain and the United States in the [[War of 1812]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In addition to his novels of seafaring life, Forester also published two crime novels, ''[[Payment Deferred]]'' (1926), and ''Plain Murder'' (1930), and two children's books. One, ''Poo-Poo and the Dragons'' (1942), was created as a series of stories told to his younger son George to encourage him to finish his meals. George had mild food allergies that kept him feeling unwell, and he needed encouragement to eat.<ref>''Poo-Poo and the Dragons'': Preface</ref> The second, ''The [[Barbary Pirates]]'' (1953), is a children's history of those early 19th-century pirates.

C. S. Forester appeared as a contestant on the TV quiz program ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', hosted by [[Groucho Marx]], in an episode telecast on 1 November 1956.<ref>{{cite av media|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBitTTGr78&list=PLHaioNpr_GDbvsTj_taM-jO6C1658N1PC&index=41|title=You Bet Your Life #56-06 C.S.

A "lost" novel of Forester's, ''The Pursued'', was discovered in 2003 and bought at an auction and was published by [[Penguin Classics]] on 3 November 2011.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15327043 Lost CS Forester book ''The Pursued'' to be published]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0141198079|title=The Pursued: Amazon.co.uk: C.S.

== Marriage ==
He married Kathleen Belcher in 1926, having two sons (John and George Forester), but the couple divorced in 1945. His elder son, [[John Forester (cyclist)|John Forester]], wrote a two-volume biography of his father.<ref name=CSForester1e>{{cite book|last1=Forester|first1=John|title=Novelist & Storyteller: The Life of C.
