A careful examination of the papers of Leibniz and Newton shows that they arrived at their results independently, with Leibniz starting first with integration and Newton with differentiation.

Leibniz believed in actual infinitesimals, but although this belief suited his metaphysics it had no sound basis in mathematics. Weierstrass, soon after the middle of the nineteenth century, showed how to establish the calculus without infinitesimals, and thus at last made it logically secure. Next came Georg Cantor, who developed the theory of continuity and infinite number. "Continuity" had been, until he defined it, a vague word, convenient for philosophers like Hegel, who wished to introduce metaphysical muddles into mathematics. Cantor gave a precise significance to the word, and showed that continuity, as he defined it, was the concept needed by mathematicians and physicists. By this means a great deal of mysticism, such as that of Bergson, was rendered antiquated.<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>The foundations of differential and integral calculus had been laid. In Cauchy's<space/><link><target>Cours d'Analyse</target></link>, we find a broad range of foundational approaches, including a definition of<space/><link><target>continuous function</target><part>continuity</part></link><space/>in terms of infinitesimals, and a (somewhat imprecise) prototype of an<space/><link><target>(, )-definition of limit</target></link><space/>in the definition of differentiation. In his work Weierstrass formalized the concept of<space/><link><target>Limit of a function</target><part>limit</part></link><space/>and eliminated infinitesimals. Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus on limits instead of infinitesimal quantities, though the subject is still occasionally called &quot;infinitesimal calculus&quot;.<space/><link><target>Bernhard Riemann</target></link><space/>used these ideas to give a precise definition of the integral.

Historically, the first method of doing so was by<space/><link><target>infinitesimal</target><trail>s</trail></link>. These are objects which can be treated like numbers but which are, in some sense, &quot;infinitely small&quot;. An infinitesimal number<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>''dx''</arg></template><space/>could be greater than 0, but less than any number in the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... and less than any positive<space/><link><target>real number</target></link>. Any integer multiple of an infinitesimal is still infinitely small, i.e., infinitesimals do not satisfy the<space/><link><target>Archimedean property</target></link>. From this point of view, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating infinitesimals. This approach fell out of favor in the 19th century because it was difficult to make the notion of an infinitesimal precise. However, the concept was revived in the 20th century with the introduction of<space/><link><target>non-standard analysis</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>smooth infinitesimal analysis</target></link>, which provided solid foundations for the manipulation of infinitesimals.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 19th century, infinitesimals were replaced by the<space/><link><target>epsilon, delta</target></link><space/>approach to<space/><link><target>Limit of a function</target><part>limit</part><trail>s</trail></link>. Limits describe the value of a<space/><link><target>function (mathematics)</target><part>function</part></link><space/>at a certain input in terms of its values at a nearby input. They capture small-scale behavior in the context of the<space/><link><target>real number</target><part>real number system</part></link>. In this treatment, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating certain limits. Infinitesimals get replaced by very small numbers, and the infinitely small behavior of the function is found by taking the limiting behavior for smaller and smaller numbers. Limits were the first way to provide rigorous foundations for calculus, and for this reason they are the standard approach.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Differential calculus</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Differential calculus</arg></template><link><target>File:Tangent derivative calculusdia.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>Tangent line at<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>(''x'', ''f''(''x''))</arg></template>.

Given a function and a point in the domain, the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small-scale behavior of the function near that point. By finding the derivative of a function at every point in its domain, it is possible to produce a new function, called the<space/><italics>derivative function</italics><space/>or just the<space/><italics>derivative</italics><space/>of the original function. In mathematical jargon, the derivative is a<space/><link><target>linear operator</target></link><space/>which inputs a function and outputs a second function. This is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra, where functions usually input a number and output another number. For example, if the doubling function is given the input three, then it outputs six, and if the squaring function is given the input three, then it outputs nine. The derivative, however, can take the squaring function as an input. This means that the derivative takes all the information of the squaring functionsuch as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so onand uses this information to produce another function. (The function it produces turns out to be the doubling function.)</paragraph><paragraph>The most common symbol for a derivative is an<space/><link><target>apostrophe</target></link>-like mark called<space/><link><target>prime (symbol)</target><part>prime</part></link>. Thus, the derivative of the function of<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>''f''</arg></template><space/>is<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>''f′''</arg></template>, pronounced &quot;f prime.&quot; For instance, if<space/><template><target>math</target><arg name="''f''(''x'') {{">}} ''x''<sup>2</sup></arg></template><space/>is the squaring function, then<space/><template><target>math</target><arg name="''f′''(''x'') {{">}} 2''x''</arg></template><space/>is its derivative, the doubling function.</paragraph><paragraph>If the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents change with respect to time. For example, if<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>''f''</arg></template><space/>is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output, then the derivative of<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>''f''</arg></template><space/>is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the<space/><link><target>velocity</target></link><space/>of the ball.</paragraph><paragraph>If a function is<space/><link><target>linear function</target><part>linear</part></link><space/>(that is, if the<space/><link><target>Graph of a function</target><part>graph</part></link><space/>of the function is a straight line), then the function can be written as<space/><template><target>math</target><arg name="''y'' {{">}} ''mx'' + ''b''</arg></template>, where<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>''x''</arg></template><space/>is the independent variable,<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>''y''</arg></template><space/>is the dependent variable,<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>''b''</arg></template><space/>is the<space/><italics>y</italics>-intercept, and:</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem><extension extension_name='math'>m= \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}= \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.</extension></listitem></list><paragraph>This gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line.

Derivatives give an exact meaning to the notion of change in output with respect to change in input. To be concrete, let<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>''f''</arg></template><space/>be a function, and fix a point<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>''a''</arg></template><space/>in the domain of<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>''f''</arg></template>.<space/><template><target>math</target><arg>(''a'', ''f''(''a''))</arg></template><space/>is a point on the graph of the function.
