'''Bastille Day''' is the name given in English-speaking countries to the French [[National Day]], which is celebrated on 14 July each year. In France, it is formally called '''La Fête nationale''' ({{IPA-fr|la fɛːt nasjɔnal}}; ''The National Celebration'') and commonly '''Le quatorze juillet''' ({{IPA-fr|lə katɔʁz(ə) ʒɥijɛ}}; ''the fourteenth of July'').

He reported his experience in a series of letters to America's Secretary of State, [[John Jay]]. We join Jefferson's story as tensions escalate to violence on July 12:
<br>
July 12
<br>
In the afternoon a body of about 100 German cavalry were advanced and drawn up in the Palace Louis XV. and about 300 Swiss posted at a little distance in their rear. This drew people to that spot, who naturally formed themselves in front of the troops, at first merely to look at them. But as their numbers increased 
their indignation arose: they retired a few steps, posted themselves on and behind large piles of loose stone collected in that Place for a bridge adjacent to it, and attacked the horse with stones. The horse charged, but the advantageous position of the people, and the showers of stones obliged them to retire, and even to quit the field altogether, leaving one of their number on the ground. The Swiss in their rear were observed never to stir. This was the signal for universal insurrection, and this body of cavalry, to avoid being massacred, retired towards Versailles.
<br>
The people now armed themselves with such weapons as they could find in Armourer's shops and private houses, and with bludgeons, and were roaming all night through all parts of the city without any decided and practicable object.
<br>
July 13
<br>
[...]A Committee of magistrates and electors of the city are appointed, by their bodies, to take upon them its government.
<br>
The mob, now openly joined by the French guards, force the prisons of St. Lazare, release all the prisoners, and take a great store of corn, which they carry to the corn market. Here they get some arms, and the French guards begin to form and train them. The City committee determines to raise 48,000 Bourgeois, or rather to restrain their numbers to 48,000.'}}</ref> as well as the [[Fête de la Fédération]] which celebrated the unity of the French people on 14 July 1790. Celebrations are held throughout France. The oldest and largest regular [[Bastille Day Military Parade|military parade]] in Europe is held on the morning of 14 July, on the [[Champs-Élysées]] in Paris in front of the [[President of France|President of the Republic]], along with other French officials and foreign guests.<ref name="paris1">{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.com/paris_city_guide/city_visits_of_paris/champs_elysees_arc_de_triomphe |title=Champs-Élysées city visit in Paris, France&nbsp;– Recommended city visit of Champs-Élysées in Paris |publisher=Paris.com |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref><ref name="paris-attractions1">{{cite web|url=http://paris-attractions.net/celebrate-bastille-day-in-paris-this-year/ |title=Celebrate Bastille Day in Paris This Year |publisher=Paris Attractions |date=3 May 2011 |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|right|none|225px|''Storming of the Bastille'', by Jean-Pierre-Louis-Laurent Houel]]

===Storming of the Bastille===
{{main|Storming of the Bastille}}

On 19 May 1789, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] convened the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] (''les États-généraux'') to hear their grievances. The deputies of the Third Estate (''le Tiers État''), representing the common people (the two others were the Catholic [[clergy]] (''clergé'', Roman Catholicism being the state religion at that time) and the [[nobility]] (''noblesse'')), decided to break away and form a National Assembly [the Third Estate took the [[Tennis Court Oath]] (''le serment du Jeu de paume'', 20 June 1789), swearing not to separate until a constitution had been established]. They were gradually joined by (liberal) delegates of the other estates; [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] started to recognize their validity on 27 June. The assembly renamed itself the National Constituent Assembly (''Assemblée nationale constituante'') on 9 July, and began to function as a legislature and to draft a constitution.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

In the wake of the dismissal of [[Jacques Necker]] (the finance minister, who was sympathetic to the Third Estate) on 11 July, the people of Paris, fearful that they and their representatives would be attacked by the royal army or foreign regiments of mecenaries at the king's service, and seeking to gain ammunition and gunpowder for the general populace, stormed the [[Bastille]], a fortress-prison in Paris which had often held people jailed on the basis of ''[[lettre de cachet|lettres de cachet]]'' (literally "signet letters"), arbitrary royal indictments that could not be appealed and didn't indicate the reason of the imprisonment. Besides holding a large cache of ammunition and gunpowder, the Bastille had been known for holding political prisoners whose writings had displeased the royal government, and was thus a symbol of the [[political absolutism|absolutism]] of the monarchy. As it happened, at the time of the attack in July 1789 there were only seven inmates, none of great political significance.<ref>G A Chevallaz, Histoire générale de 1789 à nos jours, p22, publ. Payot, Lausanne 1974</ref>

When the crowd—eventually reinforced by mutinous ''[[Gardes Françaises]]'' ("French Guards", whose usual role was to protect public buildings)—proved a fair match for the fort's defenders, [[Bernard-René de Launay|Governor de Launay]], the commander of the Bastille, capitulated and opened the gates to avoid a mutual massacre. However, possibly because of a misunder-standing, fighting resumed. According to the official documents, about 200  attackers and just one defender died in the actual fighting, but in the aftermath, de Launay and seven other defenders were killed, as was the ''prévôt des marchands'' ("provost of the merchants", the elected head of the city's guilds, who under the feudal monarchy had also the competences of a present-day mayor) [[Jacques de Flesselles]].<ref>J Isaac, L'époque révolutionnaire 1789-1851,p60, publ. Hachette, Paris 1950</ref>


Shortly after the storming of the Bastille, on 4 August 1789 late in the evening after a very "stormy" session of the ''Assemblée Constituante'', [[feudalism]] was abolished.  On 26 August 1789, the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' (''Déclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen'', the French word "homme" meaning both "man" and "human") was proclaimed.<ref>J Isaac, L'époque révolutionnaire 1789-1851, p64, publ. Hachette, Paris 1950</ref>

===''Fête de la Fédération''===
{{main|Fête de la Fédération}}

The Fête de la Fédération on 14 July 1790 was a celebration of the unity of the French Nation during the [[French Revolution]].The aim of this Celebration was to symbolize Peace one year after the [[Storming of the Bastille]].  The event took place on the Champ de Mars, which was at the time far outside Paris. The place had been transformed on a voluntary basis by the population of Paris itself, in what was recalled as the Journée des brouettes ("Wheelbarrow Day").

A mass was celebrated by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]], [[bishop of Autun]]. The popular [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|General Lafayette]], as captain of the National Guard of Paris and confidant of the king, took his oath to the constitution, followed by King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. After the end of the official celebration, the day ended in a huge four-day popular feast and people celebrated with fireworks, as well as fine wine and running nude through the streets in order to display their great freedom.

===Origin of the present celebration===
On 30 June 1878, a feast had been arranged in Paris by official decision to honour the French Republic (the event was commemorated in a painting by [[Claude Monet]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Adamson|first=Natalie|title=Painting, politics and the struggle for the École de Paris, 1944–1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgNGAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2011|date=15 August 2009|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-5928-0|page=68}}</ref> On 14 July 1879, another feast took place, with a semi-official aspect; the events of the day included a reception in the Chamber of Deputies, organised and presided over by [[Léon Gambetta]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Nord|first=Philip G.|title=Impressionists and politics: art and democracy in the nineteenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNSVHrVlGMQC&pg=PA37|accessdate=13 July 2011|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-20695-2|page=37}}</ref> a military review in Longchamp, and a Republican Feast in the [[Bois de Boulogne|Pré Catelan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nord|first=Philip G.|title=The republican moment: struggles for democracy in nineteenth-century France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDo7CFULR74C&pg=PA205|accessdate=13 July 2011|year=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-76271-8|page=205}}</ref> All through France, ''[[Le Figaro]]'' wrote, "people feasted much to honour the storming of the Bastille".<ref>{{cite news|title=Paris Au Jour Le Jour|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k277157p/f4.image|accessdate=15 January 2013|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=16 July 1879|page=4|quote=On a beaucoup banqueté avant-hier, en mémoire de la prise de la Bastille, et comme tout banquet suppose un ou plusieurs discours, on a aussi beaucoup parlé.}}</ref>

On 21 May 1880, [[Benjamin Raspail]] proposed a law to have "the Republic choose the 14 July as a yearly national holiday". The Assembly voted in favour of the proposal on 21 May and 8 June.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lüsebrink|first1=Hans-Jürgen|last2=Reichardt|first2=Rolf|title=The Bastille: a history of a symbol of despotism and freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jN9WU-2X8t4C&pg=PA229|accessdate=13 July 2011|year=1997|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8223-1894-1|page=229}}</ref> The Senate approved on it 27 and 29 June, favouring 14 July against 4 August (honouring the [[The Abolition of Feudalism|end of the feudal system]] on 4 August 1789). The law was made official on 6 July 1880, and the Ministry of the Interior recommended to Prefects that the day should be "celebrated with all the brilliance that the local resources allow".{{Cite quote|date=July 2011}} Indeed, the celebrations of the new holiday in 1880 were particularly magnificent.

In the debate leading up to the adoption of the holiday, [[Henri Martin (historian)|Henri Martin]], chairman of the French Senate, addressed that chamber on 29 June 1880:
{{Quote|text=Do not forget that behind this 14&nbsp;July, where victory of the new era over the ''[[ancien régime]]'' was bought by fighting, do not forget that after the day of 14&nbsp;July 1789, there was the day of 14&nbsp;July 1790.... This [latter] day cannot be blamed for having shed a drop of blood, for having divided the country. It was the consecration of the unity of France.... If some of you might have scruples against the first 14&nbsp;July, they certainly hold none against the second. Whatever difference which might part us, something hovers over them, it is the great images of national unity, which we all desire, for which we would all stand, willing to die if necessary.|sign=[[Henri Martin (historian)|Henri Martin]], Chairman of the Sénat, 1880<ref>[http://blog.greetingcarduniverse.com/2011/07/le-quatorze-juillet/ Le Quatorze Juillet] at the [http://blog.greetingcarduniverse.com/ Greeting Card Universe Blog]</ref>}}

===Bastille Day Military Parade===
{{main|Bastille Day Military Parade}}
The [[Bastille Day Military Parade]] is the French [[military parade]] that has been held on the morning of 14 July each year in Paris since 1880. While previously held elsewhere within or near the capital city, since 1918 it has been held on the [[Champs-Élysées]], with the participation of the Allies as represented in the Versailles Peace Conference, and with the exception of the period of German occupation from 1940 to 1944 (when the ceremony took place in London under the command of General [[Charles de Gaulle]]).<ref>[http://www.garnison-paris.terre.defense.gouv.fr/14juillet2008/les-coulisses/historique-du-defile.htm Défilé du 14 juillet, des origines à nos jours] (14 July Parade, from its origins to the present)</ref> The parade passes down the Champs-Élysées from the [[Arc de Triomphe]] to the [[Place de la Concorde]], where the [[President of the French Republic]], his government and foreign ambassadors to France stand. This is a popular event in France, broadcast on French TV, and is the oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe.<ref name="paris1"/><ref name="paris-attractions1"/> In some years, invited detachments of foreign troops take part in the parade and foreign statesmen attend as guests.

Smaller military parades are held in French garrison towns, including [[Toulon]] and [[Belfort]], with local troops.
