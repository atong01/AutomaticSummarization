==Etymology==
{{main|Etymology of Edinburgh}}
"Edin", the root of the city's name, is most likely of [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin, from the [[Cumbric language]] or a variation of it that would have been spoken by the earliest known people of the area, an [[Iron Age]] tribe known to the Romans as the ''[[Votadini]]'', and latterly in sub-Roman history as the [[Gododdin]]. It appears to derive from the place name ''Eidyn'' mentioned in the [[Old Welsh]] epic poem ''[[Y Gododdin]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Beginnings of Welsh Poetry: Studies |last=Williams |first=Ifor |authorlink=Ifor Williams |year=1972 |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=0-7083-0035-9 |page=47}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The British Heroic Age: the Welsh and the Men of the North |last=Chadwick |first=Nora K. |authorlink=Nora Kershaw Chadwick |year=1968 |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=0-7083-0465-6 |page=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Dumville |first1= David |year=1994 |title=The eastern terminus of the Antonine Wall: 12th or 13th century evidence |journal=[[Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] |volume=124 |issue= |pages=293–98}}</ref>

The poem names ''Din Eidyn'' as a hill fort (''Din'' meaning "[[dun]]") in the territory of the Gododdin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cessford |first1=Craig |year=1994 |title=Gardens of the 'Gododdin' |journal=Garden History |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=114–15}}</ref> The change in nomenclature, from ''Din Eidyn'' to ''Edinburgh'', reflects changes in the local language from Cumbric to [[Old English]], the Germanic language of the Anglian kingdom of [[Bernicia]] that permeated the area from the mid-7th century and is regarded as the ancestor of modern [[Scots language|Scots]]. The Celtic element ''din'' was dropped and replaced by the Old English ''[[burh]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Placenames of the World |last=Room |first=Adrian |year=2006 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0-7864-2248-3 |pages=118–119 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref> The first documentary evidence of the medieval [[burgh]] is a [[royal charter]], c.1124–1127, by [[David I of Scotland|King David I]] granting a [[burgage|toft]] in "burgo meo de Edenesburg" to the [[Dunfermline Abbey|Priory of Dunfermline]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Barrow | first1 = Geoffrey | title = The Charters of King David I: The Written Acts of David I King of Scots ... | page = 63 | accessdate = 27 October 2013 | isbn = 978-0851157313}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Edinburgh}}

===Early history===
[[File:Arthurs seat edinburgh.jpg|thumb|right|Edinburgh, showing Arthur's Seat, one of the earliest known sites of human habitation in the area]]

The earliest known human habitation in the Edinburgh area is from [[Cramond]] where evidence was found of a [[Mesolithic]] camp-site dated to c. 8500 BC.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba60/news.shtml | title = Earliest evidence found of settlers in Scotland: hazelnuts and stone tools excavated near Edinburgh date to around 8500 BC | accessdate = 31 October 2013}}</ref> Traces of later [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] settlements have been found on [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]], [[Arthur's Seat]], [[Craiglockhart]] Hill and the [[Pentland Hills]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Coghill |first=Hamish  |title=Lost Edinburgh |year=2008 |publisher=Birlinn Ltd |isbn=1-84158-747-8 |pages=1–2}}</ref>

When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] arrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they discovered a Celtic [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britonnic]] tribe whose name they recorded as the [[Votadini]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Ritchie |first=J.

Although its exact location has not been identified, it seems more than likely they would have chosen a commanding position like the [[Edinburgh Castle#Earliest habitation|Castle Rock]] or Arthur's Seat or [[Calton Hill]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Fraser|first=James |authorlink=James E.

In 638 AD the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal to [[Oswald of Northumbria|King Oswald]] of [[Northumbria]], and around this time control of [[Lothian]] passed to the [[Angles]]. Their influence continued for the next three centuries until around 950 AD, when, during the reign of [[Indulf]], son of [[Constantine II of Scotland|Constantine II]], the "burh" (fortress), named in the 10th-century ''[[Pictish Chronicle]]'' as "oppidum Eden",<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson |first=William |title=The Celtic Place Names of Scotland |year=1926 |isbn=1-906566-35-6 |page=340}}</ref> fell to the Scots and thenceforth remained under their jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lynch |first=Michael |title=The Oxford Companion to Scottish History |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-923482-0 |page=658}}</ref>

In the 17th century, the boundaries of Edinburgh were still defined by the city's defensive [[Edinburgh town walls|town walls]]. As a result, expansion took the form of the houses increasing in height to accommodate a growing population. Buildings of 11 storeys or more were common,<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BFkLAAAAYAAJ |title=Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh, from 1385 to 1824 |accessdate=17 February 2013 |last=Chambers |first=Robert|page=11}}</ref> and have been described as forerunners of the modern-day skyscraper.<ref>{{cite book |last =Wilson |first =Neil |title=Edinburgh Encounter |publisher= |series = | page=37 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ygf59UOCPfQC&pg=PA37&dq=edinburgh+old+town+skyscraper&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ox4YUe_ADOSa0QWfjoGQBQ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=skyscrapers&f=false|isbn=1-74179-306-8}}</ref> Most of these old structures were later replaced by the predominantly [[Victorian era|Victorian]] buildings seen in today's Old Town.

From the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant "one-family" residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the social character of the city.

Although Edinburgh's traditional industries of printing, brewing and distilling continued to grow in the 19th century and were joined by new [[Hunter Boot Ltd|rubber works]] and [[Engineering|engineering works]] there was little industrialisation compared with other cities in Britain. By 1821, Edinburgh had been overtaken by [[Glasgow]] as Scotland's largest city.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pryde |first1=George Smith |title=Scotland from 1603 to the present day |year=1962 |publisher=Nelson |isbn= |page=141 |quote=Population figures for 1801 – Glasgow 77,385; Edinburgh 82,560; for 1821 – Glasgow 147,043; Edinburgh 138,325}}</ref> The city centre between Princes Street and George Street became a major commercial and shopping district, a development partly stimulated by the arrival of railways in the 1840s. The Old Town became an increasingly dilapidated, overcrowded slum with high mortality rates.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hogg |first=A |title=Scotland: The Rise of Cities 1694–1905 |year=1973 |publisher=Evans Brothers Ltd. |location=London |isbn=978-0237286569 |chapter=Topic 3:Problem Areas}}</ref> Improvements carried out under Lord Provost [[William Chambers (publisher)|William Chambers]] in the 1860s began the transformation of the area into the predominantly [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] Old Town seen today.<ref>{{cite book |last=McWilliam |first=C |title= Scottish Townscape |year=1975 |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=0-00-216743-3 |page=196 }}</ref> More improvements followed in the early 20th century as a result of the work of [[Patrick Geddes]],<ref>{{cite book |last=McWilliam |first=C |title= Scottish Townscape |year=1975 |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=0-00-216743-3|page=197}}</ref> but relative economic stagnation during the two world wars and beyond saw the Old Town deteriorate further before major slum clearance in the 1960s and 1970s began to reverse the process. University building developments which transformed the [[George Square, Edinburgh|George Square]] and Potterrow areas proved highly controversial.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coghill |first=H|title=Lost Edinburgh |year=2008 |publisher=Birlinn Ltd.|location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-1-84158-747-9 |pages=219–220}}</ref>

Since the 1990s a new "financial district", including a new [[Edinburgh International Conference Centre]], has grown mainly on demolished railway property to the west of the castle, stretching into [[Fountainbridge]], a run-down 19th-century industrial suburb which has undergone radical change since the 1980s with the demise of industrial and brewery premises. This ongoing development has enabled Edinburgh to maintain its place as the second largest financial and administrative centre in the United Kingdom after London.<ref>{{cite book |last=Keay |first=John |title=Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland |year=1994 |publisher=1994 |location= |isbn=0-00-255082-2 |page=286}}</ref> Financial services now account for a third of all commercial office space in the city.<ref name="W Rae, Edinburgh 1994, p.164">{{cite book |last=Rae |first=William |title=Edinburgh, Scotland's Capital City |year=1994 |publisher=Mainstream  |isbn=1-85158-605-9 |page=164}}</ref> The development of [[Edinburgh Park]], a new business and technology park covering {{convert|38|acres|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|4|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the city centre, has also contributed to the District Council's strategy for the city's major economic regeneration.<ref name="W Rae, Edinburgh 1994, p.164"/>

In 1998, the [[Scotland Act 1998|Scotland Act]], which came into force the following year, established a [[Devolution|devolved]] Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive (renamed the Scottish Government since September 2007<ref>{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6974798.stm | title = Scottish Executive renames itself | accessdate = 24 August 2014}}</ref>). Both based in Edinburgh, they are responsible for governing Scotland while [[Reserved and excepted matters|reserved matters]] such as defence, taxation and foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46 |title=Scotland Act 1998 |date=19 November 1998 |accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Cityscape===
Situated in Scotland's [[Central Belt]], Edinburgh lies on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. The city centre is {{convert|2+1/2|mi|km}} southwest of the shoreline of [[Leith]] and {{convert|26|mi|km}} inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the [[North Sea]] at [[Dunbar]].<ref>{{cite map |title=Geographia Atlas of the World |year=1984 |publisher=Geographia Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-09-202840-3 |page=99}}</ref> While the early burgh grew up in close proximity to the [[prominence|prominent]] [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]], the modern city is often said to be built on [[Hills in Edinburgh|seven hills]], namely [[Calton Hill]], [[Corstorphine Hill]], [[Craiglockhart Hill]], [[Braid Hills|Braid Hill]], [[Blackford Hill]], [[Arthur's Seat]] and the Castle Rock,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seven-hills.org.uk/course.asp |title=Seven Hills of Edinburgh |accessdate=28 February 2013 |publisher=[[VisitScotland]]}}</ref> giving rise to allusions to the [[seven hills of Rome]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.org/features/voltaire-said |title=Voltaire said: Athens of the North |publisher=Scotland.org |date=September 2003 |accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>

Occupying a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the [[Pentland Hills]] and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.

Other prominent landforms such as Calton Hill and Corstorphine Hill are similarly products of glacial erosion.<ref name="geology"/> The Braid Hills and Blackford Hill are a series of small summits to the south west of the city commanding expansive views looking northwards over the urban area to the Forth.<ref name="geology"/>
[[File:View of Edinburgh from Blackford Hill 2.jpg|thumb|700px|centre|View of Edinburgh from Blackford Hill]]
Edinburgh is drained by the river named the [[Water of Leith]], which rises at the Colzium Springs in the Pentland Hills and runs for {{Convert|29|km|mi}} through the south and west of the city, emptying into the Firth of Forth at Leith.<ref name="waterofleith">{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst2805.html |title=Overview of the Water of Leith |accessdate=19 April 2009 |publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland, Institute of Geography, University of Edinburgh}}</ref> The nearest the river gets to the city centre is at [[Dean Village]] on the north-western edge of the New Town, where a deep gorge is spanned by [[Thomas Telford]]'s [[Dean Bridge]], built in 1832 for the road to [[South Queensferry|Queensferry]].<ref name="waterofleith"/> The [[Water of Leith Walkway]] is a mixed use [[trail]] that follows the course of the river for {{convert|19.6|km|mi|1}} from [[Balerno]] to Leith.<ref name="walkway">{{cite web|url=http://www.waterofleith.org.uk/walkway/ |title=The Water of Leith Walkway |accessdate=19 April 2009 |publisher=Water of Leith Conservation Trust}}</ref>

Excepting the shoreline of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a [[green belt]], designated in 1957, which stretches from [[Dalmeny]] in the west to [[Prestongrange]] in the east.<ref name="greenbelt">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/08/19785/41543 |title=Review of Green Belt policy in Scotland – Edinburgh and Midlothian |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=10 April 2009 |publisher=Scottish Government}}</ref> With an average width of {{convert|3.2|km|mi|0}} the principal objectives of the green belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas.<ref name="greenbelt"/> Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as [[Edinburgh Airport]] and the [[Royal Highland Showground]] at [[Ingliston]] lie within the zone.<ref name="greenbelt"/> Similarly, outlying suburbs such as [[Juniper Green]] and Balerno are situated on green belt land.<ref name="greenbelt"/> One feature of the Edinburgh green belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, even though they do not connect with the peripheral ring. Examples of these independent wedges of green belt include [[Holyrood Park]] and Corstorphine Hill.<ref name="greenbelt"/>

===Areas===
Edinburgh is divided into distinct areas that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the sprawling city of the nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/areas |title=Edinburgh Areas |publisher=edinburghguide.com |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Many residences are multi-occupancy buildings known as [[tenement]]s, although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been more affluent with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/features/146/edinburgh-area-guide |title=Edinburgh area guide |publisher=timeout.com |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Edinburgh map.png|thumb|Map showing the areas of central Edinburgh]]
The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swathe of [[Princes Street Gardens]]. To the south the view is dominated by [[Edinburgh Castle]], built high on the castle rock, and the long sweep of the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] descending towards [[Holyrood Palace]]. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.

The West End includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the [[Edinburgh International Conference Centre]].

The Old and New Towns of Edinburgh were listed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining [[Dean Village]] and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500 [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed buildings]] within the city,<ref name="www.edinburgh.org world-heritage-site"/> a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.

The Old Town runs downhill and terminates at [[Holyrood Palace]]. Minor streets (called closes or [[wynd]]s) lie on either side of the main spine forming a herringbone pattern.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728 |title=Old and New Towns of Edinburgh |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> The street has several fine public buildings such as the church of [[St Giles' Cathedral|St Giles]], the [[Edinburgh City Chambers|City Chambers]] and the [[Courts of Scotland|Law Courts]]. Other places of historical interest nearby are [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] and the [[Grassmarket]]. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many northern European cities.

The castle perches on top of a rocky crag (the remnant of an extinct volcano) and the Royal Mile runs down the crest of a ridge from it. Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest "high rise" residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as ''lands'' were the norm from the 16th century onwards with ten and eleven storeys being typical and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys.
<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Chambers | first1 = Robert | authorlink1 = Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802) | title = Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh: from 1385 to 1824&nbsp;... | url = http://books.google.com/?id=BFkLAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Notices+of+the+most+remarkable+fires+in+Edinburgh,+from+1385+to+1824#v=onepage&q=fifteen&f=false | accessdate =9 January 2012 | year = 1824}}</ref> Numerous vaults below street level were inhabited to accommodate the influx of incomers, particularly [[Irish migration to Great Britain|Irish immigrants]], during the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a "New Town" was won by [[James Craig (architect)|James Craig]], a 27-year-old architect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cruft, Kitty |title=James Craig 1739–1795: Correction of his Date of Birth |journal=Book of the Old Edinburgh Club |volume=New Series Vol. 5 |pages=pp.103–5}}</ref> The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of rationality. The principal street is [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]], running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the "Old Town". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become the main shopping street in Edinburgh and now has few of its original [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] buildings. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by [[St Andrew Square, Edinburgh|St Andrew Square]] and [[Charlotte Square]] respectively. The latter, designed by [[Robert Adam]], influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/architectsactive.pdf|title=Scottish Architects Homecoming|publisher=Historic Scotland|accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref> [[Bute House]], the official residence of the [[First Minister of Scotland]], is on the north side of Charlotte Square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/venue/butehouse |title=Bute House |publisher=edinburghguide.com |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>

The hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the [[Nor Loch]], which was originally created for the town's defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their [[sewage]]. It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city's northward expansion. Craig's original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch,<ref name="princeshist"/> but this idea was abandoned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/from-monks-on-strike-to-dove-s-dung-1-881129|title=From monks on strike to dove's dung |publisher=scotsman.com |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the [[loch]] to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as [[The Mound]].

In the middle of the 19th century the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[Royal Scottish Academy Building]] were built on The Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between [[Haymarket railway station|Haymarket]] and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Waverley]] stations were driven through it.

The Southside is a popular residential part of the city, which includes the districts of St Leonards, [[Marchmont]], [[Newington, Edinburgh|Newington]], [[Sciennes]], [[The Grange, Edinburgh|the Grange]] and [[Blackford, Edinburgh|Blackford]]. The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the [[Burgh Muir]], and grew in popularity as a residential area after the opening of the [[South Bridge, Edinburgh|South Bridge]] in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families (many state and private schools are here), young professionals and students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around [[George Square, Edinburgh|George Square]] just north of Marchmont and [[The Meadows (park)|the Meadows]]), and [[Napier University]] (with major campuses around Merchiston and Morningside). The area is also well provided with hotel and "bed and breakfast" accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example, [[Church Hill, Edinburgh|Church Hill]] in Morningside, was the home of [[Muriel Spark]]'s Miss Jean Brodie,
<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geraldinemcewan.com/JeanBrodie.html |title=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie |publisher=geraldinemcewan.com |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>
and [[Ian Rankin]]'s [[Inspector Rebus]] lives in Marchmont and works in St Leonards.

[[File:The Shore, Leith.JPG|thumb|The Shore, Leith]]
[[Leith]] was historically the port of Edinburgh, an arrangement of unknown date that was reconfirmed by the royal charter Robert the Bruce granted to the city in 1329.<ref>{{cite book |last=Edinburgh Corporation |first= |title=Edinburgh 1329–1929, Sexcentenary of Bruce Charter |year=1929 |publisher=Oliver And Boyd |location=Edinburgh |isbn= |page=xxvii }}</ref> The port developed a separate identity from Edinburgh, which to some extent it still retains, and it was a matter of great resentment when the two burghs merged in 1920 into the City of Edinburgh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/leith/33.htm|title=The Story of Leith XXXIII. How Leith was Governed}}</ref> Even today the parliamentary seat is known as "Edinburgh North and Leith". The loss of traditional industries and commerce (the [[Henry Robb|last shipyard]] closed in 1983) resulted in economic decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esds.ac.uk/doc/4927/mrdoc/pdf/q4927uguide.pdf |title=Untitled |publisher=Economic and Social Data Service |accessdate=14 October 2013 |postscript=--note incorrect date given for Henry Robb shipyard closure}}</ref> The Edinburgh Waterfront development which has transformed old dockland areas from Leith to Granton into residential areas with shopping and leisure facilities, has helped rejuvenate the area. With the redevelopment, Edinburgh has gained the business of cruise liner companies which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The coastal suburb of [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] is characterised by Georgian villas, Victorian tenements, a popular beach and [[promenade]] and cafes, bars, restaurants and independent shops. There are rowing and sailing clubs and a restored Victorian swimming pool, including [[Turkish baths]].

The urban area of Edinburgh is almost entirely contained within the [[City of Edinburgh Council]] boundary, merging with [[Musselburgh]] in East Lothian. Towns within easy reach of the city boundary include [[Dalkeith]], [[Bonnyrigg]], [[Loanhead]], [[Newtongrange]], [[Prestonpans]], [[Tranent]], [[Penicuik]], [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]], [[Broxburn, West Lothian|Broxburn]] and [[Dunfermline]]. According to the European Statistical agency, [[Eurostat]], Edinburgh lies at the heart of a Functional Urban Area covering {{convert|1724|km2|sqmi}} with a population in 2011 of 834,648.<ref name="Eurostat">{{cite web |url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do |title= Population on 1 January by age groups and sex - larger urban zone |author=Eurostat |accessdate=15 August 2015 }}</ref>

===Climate===
Like most of Scotland, Edinburgh has a [[temperate climate|temperate]], [[maritime climate]] which is relatively mild despite its northerly latitude.<ref name="temperature">{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/es/ |title=Regional Climate – Eastern Scotland |accessdate=19 April 2009 |publisher=Met Office}}</ref> Winter daytime temperatures rarely fall below freezing and are milder than places such as Moscow and [[Newfoundland]] which lie at similar latitudes.<ref name="temperature"/> Summer temperatures are normally moderate, rarely exceeding {{convert|22|C}}.<ref name="temperature"/> The highest temperature ever recorded in the city was {{convert|31.4|C}} on 4 August 1975<ref name="temperature"/> at Turnhouse Airport. The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was {{convert|-14.6|C}} during December 2010 at Gogarbank.<ref>{{cite web

|title=December 2010 minimum
|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref>

The proximity of the city to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. Given Edinburgh's position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as "the windy city", with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south west, which is frequently associated with warm, unstable air from the [[North Atlantic Current]] that can give rise to rainfall – although considerably less than cities to the west, such as Glasgow.<ref name="temperature"/> Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.<ref name="temperature"/> Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by [[haar (fog)|haar]], a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as [[European windstorm]]s, can affect the city between October and May.<ref name="temperature"/>

There is also a weather station in Gogarbank on the outskirts of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcvw5vmsn|title=Edinburgh Gogarbank Climate Averages 1981–2010|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref> This slightly inland station has a slightly wider temperature span between seasons, is cloudier and somewhat wetter, but differences are minor.

===Historical===
A census conducted by the Edinburgh presbytery in 1592 recorded a population of 8,003 adults spread equally north and south of the High Street which runs along the spine of the ridge sloping down from the Castle.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lynch |first=Michael |title=The Oxford Companion to Scottish History |url= |accessdate= |year=2001 |publisher=OUP Oxford |location= |isbn=0-19-969305-6 |page=219 |pages=}}</ref> In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population expanded rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831, primarily due to migration from rural areas.<ref name="overcrowding">{{cite book |title=Edinburgh: The Making of a Capital City |last1=Edwards |first1=Brian |last2=Jenkins |first2=Paul |year=2005 |isbn=0-7486-1868-6  |publisher= |page= 9}}</ref> As the population grew, problems of overcrowding in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped [[tenements]] that lined the present day Royal Mile and the [[Cowgate]], were exacerbated.<ref name="overcrowding"/> Poor sanitary arrangements resulted in a high incidence of disease,<ref name="overcrowding"/> with outbreaks of [[cholera]] occurring in 1832, 1848 and 1866.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gilbert (ed.)|first=W M |title=Edinburgh in the Nineteenth Century |year=1967 |publisher=J & R Allan Ltd. |location=Edinburgh |year=1901 |pages=95, 120, 140}}</ref>

The construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.
<ref name="etmoac46">{{cite book |title=Edinburgh: The Making of a Capital City |last1=Edwards |first1=Brian |last2=Jenkins |first2=Paul |year=2005 |isbn=0-7486-1868-6  |publisher= |page= 46}}</ref> Expansion southwards from the Old Town saw more tenements being built in the 19th century, giving rise to [[Victorian era|Victorian]] suburbs such as Newington, Marchmont and Bruntsfield.<ref name="etmoac46"/>

Early 20th century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh's population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central London.<ref name="dwellings">{{cite web|url=http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf <!--access denied-->|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090318032701/http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf|archivedate=18 March 2009|title=Edinburgh Comparisons – Dwellings |accessdate=8 February 2009 |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council}}</ref>

From the early to mid 20th century the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as [[Dumbiedykes]], [[Leith]], and [[Fountainbridge]], led to the creation of new estates such as [[Stenhouse, Edinburgh|Stenhouse]] and [[Saughton]], [[Craigmillar]] and [[Niddrie, Edinburgh|Niddrie]], [[Pilton, Edinburgh|Pilton]] and [[Muirhouse]], [[Piershill]], and [[Sighthill, Edinburgh|Sighthill]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/edinburgh.html |title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=localhistories.org}}</ref>

Notorious criminals from Edinburgh's past include [[Deacon Brodie]], head of a trades guild and Edinburgh city councillor by day but a burglar by night, who is said to have been the inspiration for [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s story, the ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/Deacon-William-Brodie/ |title=Deacon William Brodie |publisher=historic-uk.com |accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref> and murderers [[Burke and Hare]] who delivered fresh corpses for dissection to the famous anatomist [[Robert Knox]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rosner |first=Lisa |title=The Anatomy Murders |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2010|isbn=0-8122-4191-6}}</ref>

Another well-known Edinburgh resident was [[Greyfriars Bobby]]. The small [[Skye Terrier]] reputedly kept vigil over his dead master's grave in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] for 14 years in the 1860s and 1870s, giving rise to a story of canine devotion which plays a part in attracting visitors to the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/Greyfriars-Bobby/ |title=Greyfriars Bobby |publisher=historic-uk.com |accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref>
