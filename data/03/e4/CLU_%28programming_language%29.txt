'''CLU''' is a pioneering [[programming language]] created at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] by [[Barbara Liskov]] and her students between 1974 and 1975. While it did not find extensive use itself, it introduced many features that are now widely used, and is seen as a step in the development of [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP). However, it is not object-oriented itself, instead being considered "object-based", as it lacked many features of OOP.

Key contributions include [[abstract data type]]s,<ref>{{Cite conference| doi = 10.1145/800233.807045| chapter = Programming with abstract data types| title = Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Very high level languages| pages = 50–59| year = 1974| last1 = Liskov | first1 = Barbara | authorlink1 = Barbara Liskov| last2 = Zilles | first2 = Stephen| ref = harv}}</ref> [[call-by-sharing]], [[iterator]]s, multiple return values (a form of [[parallel assignment]]), type-safe [[parameterized type]]s, and type-safe [[variant type]]s. It is also notable for its use of [[Class (computer programming)|classes]] with [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructors]] and methods, but without [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]].

== Clusters ==
The [[syntax]] of CLU was based on [[ALGOL]], then the starting point for most new language designs. The key addition was the concept of a ''cluster'', CLU's type extension system and the root of the language's name (CLUster).<ref name=Liskov1977>{{Cite journal| last1 = Liskov | first1 = B. | authorlink1 = Barbara Liskov| last2 = Snyder | first2 = A.| last3 = Atkinson | first3 = R.| last4 = Schaffert | first4 = C.| title = Abstraction mechanisms in CLU| doi = 10.1145/359763.359789| journal = [[Communications of the ACM|Comm. ACM]]| volume = 20| issue = 8| pages = 564–576| date=August 1977 | id = {{citeseerx|10.1.1.112.656}} }}</ref> Clusters correspond generally to the concept of an "class" in an OO language, and have similar syntax. For instance, here is the CLU syntax for a cluster that implements [[complex number]]s:
<!-- Not actually Algol68, but this attribute is required-->
<source lang="algol68">
    complex_number = cluster is add, subtract, multiply, ...
        rep = record [ real_part: real, imag_part: real ]
        add = proc ... end add;
        subtract = proc ... end subtract;
        multiply = proc ... end multiply;
        ...
    end complex_number;
</source>

A cluster is a module that encapsulates all of its components except for those explicitly named in the "is" clause. These correspond to the public components of a class in recent OO languages. A cluster also defines a type that can be named outside the cluster (in this case, "complex_number"), but its representation type (rep) is hidden from external clients.

Cluster names are global, and no namespace mechanism was provided to group clusters or allow them to be created "locally" inside other clusters.

CLU does not perform implicit type conversions. In a cluster, the explicit type conversions 'up' and 'down' change between the abstract type and the representation. There is a universal type 'any', and a procedure force[] to check that an object is a certain type. Objects may be mutable or immutable, the latter being "base types" such as integers, booleans, characters and strings.<ref name=Liskov1977/>

== Other features ==
Another key feature of the CLU type system are ''[[iterator]]s'', which return objects from a collection one after the other.<ref name=Liskov1977 /> Iterators offer an identical [[application programming interface|API]] no matter what data they are being used with. Thus the iterator for a collection of <code>complex_number</code>s can be used interchangeably with that for an array of <code>integer</code>s. A distinctive feature of CLU iterators is that they are implemented as coroutines, with each value being provided to the caller via a "yield" statement. Iterators like those in CLU are now a common feature of many modern languages, such as C#, Ruby, and Python, though recently they are often referred to as generators.

CLU also includes [[exception handling]], based on various attempts in other languages; exceptions are raised using <code>signal</code> and handled with <code>except</code>. Unlike most other languages with exception handling, exceptions are not implicitly resignaled up the calling chain; exceptions that are neither caught nor resignaled explicitly are immediately converted into a special failure exception that typically terminates the program.

CLU is often credited as being the first language with type-safe [[variant type]]s (called oneofs), preceding ML in this respect.

A final distinctive feature in CLU is [[parallel assignment]] ("multiple assignment"), where more than one variable can appear on the left hand side of an [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment operator]]. For instance, writing <code>x,y = y,x</code> would exchange values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. In the same way, functions could return several values, like <code>x,y,z = f(t)</code>. Parallel assignment (though not multiple return values) predates CLU, appearing in [[CPL (programming language)|CPL]] (1963), under the name '''simultaneous assignment''',<ref>{{cite journal | first1 = D. W. | last1 = Barron | first2 = J. N. | last2 = Buxton | first3 = D. F. | last3 = Hartley | first4 = E. | last4 = Nixon | first5 = C. | last5 = Strachey | title = The main features of CPL | journal = Computer Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–143 | date = 1963 | url = http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/6/2/134 | doi = 10.1093/comjnl/6.2.134 }}</ref> but CLU popularized it and is often credited as the direct influence leading to parallel assignment in later languages.

All objects in a CLU program live in the heap, and memory management is automatic.

CLU supported [[generic programming|type parameterized]] user-defined data abstractions. It was the first language to offer type-safe bounded parameterized types, using structure "where clauses" to express constraints on actual type arguments.

== Influence on other programming languages ==
<!-- this should probably be incorporated into the main article instead of having bullet points -->
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] borrowed several concepts from CLU, such as [[call by sharing]], the ''yield'' statement, and multiple assignment{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
* CLU and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] were major inspirations for [[C++]] templates.
* CLU's exception handling mechanisms also influenced newer languages like C++ and [[Java (programming language)|Java]].
* [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], Python, and [[Sather]] include [[iterator]]s, which first appeared in CLU.
* [[Perl]] and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] took multiple assignment and multiple returns from function calls from CLU.<ref>{{Cite conference| last1 = Ierusalimschy | first1 = R.| last2 = De Figueiredo | first2 = L.
