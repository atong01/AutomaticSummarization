'''Digital Access Signalling System 1''' ('''DASS1''') is a [[proprietary protocol]] defined by [[British Telecom]] to provide [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] services in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is now obsolete, having been replaced by [[DASS2]]. This too will become obsolete over the coming years as [[Q.931]], a [[Europe]]an standard, becomes widely adopted in the [[European Union|EU]].
