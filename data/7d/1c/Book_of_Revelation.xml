The message of Revelation is the same as that of all scripture: there will be an eventual triumph on this earth of God over the devil; a permanent victory of good over evil, of the Saints over their persecutors, of the kingdom of God over the kingdoms of men and of Satan. This is the subject on which Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Paul, Peter, and all the prophets have written. They spoke of a day of victory that would come, and that the end would be better (more glorious) than the beginning. The victory would be achieved through Jesus Christ.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>&quot;Such is the theme of the Revelation. The details about the beasts, the wars, the angels, the men, etc., contribute to the development of this theme. By a little study, the theme can be perceived even if the details are not completely identified.

His lasting contribution has been to show how much more meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are when treated as poets first and foremost.

North in his<space/><italics>The Second Isaiah</italics><space/>London: OUP (1964) p. 23 says of Torrey's earlier Isaiah theory, &quot;Few scholars of any standing have accepted his theory.&quot; This is the general view of Torrey's theories. However, Christopher North goes on to cite Torrey on 20 major occasions and many more minor ones in the course of his book. So, Torrey must have had some influence and poetry is the key.</extension><space/>Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, he would have had to use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Apocalypse of John</italics><space/>p. 7</extension><space/>This was why the surviving Greek translation was written in such a strange idiom. It was a literal translation that had to comply with the warning at Revelation 22:18 that the text must not be corrupted in any way. According to Torrey, the story is that &quot;The Fourth Gospel was brought to Ephesus by a Christian fugitive from Palestine soon after the middle of the first century. It was written in Aramaic.&quot; Later, the Ephesians claimed this fugitive had actually been the beloved disciple himself. Subsequently, this John was banished by Nero and died on Patmos after writing Revelation. Torrey argued that until AD 80, when Christians were expelled from the synagogues,<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Apocalypse of John</italics><space/>p. 37</extension><space/>the Christian message was always first heard in the synagogue and, for cultural reasons, the evangelist would have spoken in Aramaic, else &quot;he would have had no hearing.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Apocalypse of John</italics><space/>p. 8</extension><space/>Torrey showed how the three major songs in Revelation (the new song, the song of Moses and the Lamb and the chorus at 19: 68) each fall naturally into four regular metrical lines plus a coda.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Apocalypse of John</italics><space/>p. 137</extension><space/>Other dramatic moments in Revelation, such as 6: 16 where the terrified people cry out to be hidden, behave in a similar way.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Apocalypse of John</italics><space/>p. 140</extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Christina Rossetti</target></link><space/>was a Victorian poet who believed the sensual excitement of the natural world found its meaningful purpose in death and in God.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Flowers preach to us if we will hear,&quot; begins her poem 'Consider the lilies of the field'<space/><italics>Goblin Market</italics><space/>London: Oxford University Press (1913) p. 87</extension><space/>Her<space/><italics>The Face of the Deep</italics><space/>is a meditation upon the Apocalypse.

Professor Schuessler Fiorenza believes that Revelation has particular relevance today as a liberating message to disadvantaged groups. John's book is a vision of a just world, not a vengeful threat of world-destruction. Her view that Revelation's message is not gender-based has caused dissent. She says we are to look behind the symbols rather than make a fetish out of them. In contrast, Tina Pippin states that John writes &quot;horror literature&quot; and &quot;the misogyny which underlies the narrative is extreme.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Tina Pippin<space/><italics>Death &amp; Desire: The rhetoric of gender in the Apocalypse of John</italics><space/>Louisville: Westminster-John Knox (1993) p. 105</extension><space/>Professor Schuessler Fiorenza would seem to be saying John's book is more like science fiction; it does not foretell the future but uses present-day concepts to show how contemporary reality could be very different.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>D.

Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies. One of these he called &quot;the sovereignty of the intellect&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Apocalypse</italics><space/>p. xxiii</extension><space/>which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society. The other enemy he styled &quot;vulgarity&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Apocalypse</italics><space/>p. 6</extension><space/>and that was what he found in Revelation. &quot;It is very nice if you are poor and not humble ... to bring your enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur. And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Apocalypse p. 11 Lawrence did not consider how these two types of Christianity (good and bad in his view) might be related other than as opposites. He noted the difference meant that the John who wrote a gospel could not be the same John that wrote Revelation.</extension><space/>His specific aesthetic objections to Revelation were that its imagery was unnatural and that phrases like &quot;the wrath of the Lamb&quot; were &quot;ridiculous.&quot; He saw Revelation as comprising two discordant halves. In the first, there was a scheme of cosmic renewal in &quot;great Chaldean sky-spaces&quot;, which he quite liked. After that, Lawrence thought, the book became preoccupied with the birth of the baby messiah and &quot;flamboyant hate and simple lust ... for the end of the world.&quot; Lawrence coined the term &quot;Patmossers&quot; to describe those Christians who could only be happy in paradise if they knew their enemies were suffering in hell.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Academic</heading><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">June 2015</arg></template>Modern biblical scholarship attempts to understand Revelation in its 1st century historical context within the genre of Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature. This approach considers the text as an address to seven historical communities in Asia Minor. Under this interpretation, assertions that &quot;the time is near&quot; are to be taken literally by those communities. Consequently, the work is viewed as a warning to not conform to contemporary Greco-Roman society which John &quot;unveils&quot; as beastly, demonic, and subject to divine judgment. There is further information on these topics in the entries on<space/><link><target>higher criticism</target></link><space/>and apocalyptic literature.</paragraph><paragraph>Although the acceptance of Revelation into the<space/><link><target>Biblical canon</target><part>canon</part></link><space/>has from the beginning been controversial, it has been essentially similar to the career of other texts. The eventual exclusion of other contemporary apocalyptic literature from the canon may throw light on the unfolding historical processes of what was officially considered orthodox, what was<space/><link><target>heterodox</target></link>, and what was even heretical. Interpretation of meanings and imagery are anchored in what the historical author intended and what his contemporary audience inferred; a message to Christians not to assimilate into the Roman imperial culture was John's central message. Thus, his letter (written in the apocalyptic genre) is pastoral in nature, and the symbolism of Revelation is to be understood entirely within its historical, literary, and social context. Critics study the conventions of apocalyptic literature and events of the 1st century to make sense of what the author may have intended.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Old Testament origins</heading><paragraph>Much of Revelation employs ancient sources, primarily but not exclusively the<space/><link><target>Old Testament</target></link>. For example, Howard-Brook and Gwyther<extension extension_name='ref'>Wes Howard-Brook &amp; Anthony Gwyther<space/><italics>Unveiling Empire</italics><space/>New York: Orbis (1999) p. 76</extension><space/>regard the<space/><link><target>Book of Enoch</target></link><space/>(1 Enoch) as an equally significant but contextually different source. &quot;Enoch's journey has no close parallel in the Hebrew scriptures.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Academics showed little interest in this topic until recently.<extension extension_name='ref'>S Moyise p.13 reports no work whatsoever done between 1912 and 1984</extension><space/>This was not, however, the case with popular writers from non-conforming backgrounds, who interspersed the text of Revelation with the prophecy they thought was being promised. For example, an anonymous Scottish commentary of 1871<extension extension_name='ref'>Anon<space/><italics>An exposition of the Apocalypse on a new principle of literal interpretation</italics><space/>Aberdeen: Brown (1871)</extension><space/>prefaces Revelation 4 with the Little Apocalypse of Mark 13, places Malachi 4:5 (&quot;Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord&quot;) within Revelation 11 and writes Revelation 12:7 side-by-side with the role of &quot;the Satan&quot; in the<space/><link><target>Book of Job</target></link>. The message is that everything in Revelation will happen in its previously appointed time.</paragraph><paragraph>Steve Moyise<extension extension_name='ref'>S. Moyise<space/><italics>The Old Testament in the Book of Revelation</italics><space/>Sheffield:<space/><link><target>Sheffield Academic Press</target></link><space/>(1995) p. 31</extension><space/>uses the index of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament to show that &quot;Revelation contains more Old Testament allusions than any other New Testament book, but it does not record a single quotation.&quot; Perhaps significantly, Revelation chooses different sources than other New Testament books. Revelation concentrates on Isaiah, Psalms, and Ezekiel, while neglecting, comparatively speaking, the books of the Pentateuch that are the dominant sources for other New Testament writers. Methodological objections have been made to this course as each allusion may not have an equal significance. To counter this, G. K. Beale sought to develop a system that distinguished 'clear', 'probable', and 'possible' allusions. A clear allusion is one with almost the same wording as its source, the same general meaning, and which could not reasonably have been drawn from elsewhere. A probable allusion contains an idea which is uniquely traceable to its source. Possible allusions are described as mere echoes of their putative sources.</paragraph><paragraph>Yet, with Revelation, the problems might be judged more fundamental. The author seems to be using his sources in a completely different way to the originals. For example, he borrows the 'new temple' imagery of Ezekiel 4048 but uses it to describe a New Jerusalem which, quite pointedly, no longer needs a temple because it is God's dwelling. Ian Boxall<extension extension_name='ref'>Ian Boxall The Revelation of St John London: Continuum &amp; Peabody MA: Hendrickson (2006) p. 254</extension><space/>writes that Revelation &quot;is no montage of biblical quotations (that is not John's way) but a wealth of allusions and evocations rewoven into something new and creative.&quot; In trying to identify this &quot;something new&quot;, Boxall argues that Ezekiel provides the 'backbone' for Revelation. He sets out a comparative table listing the chapters of Revelation in sequence and linking most of them to the structurally corresponding chapter in Ezekiel. The interesting point is that the order is not the same. John, on this theory, rearranges Ezekiel to suit his own purposes.</paragraph><paragraph>Some commentators argue that it is these purposes and not the structure that really matter. G. K.
