The '''Book of Revelation''', often known simply as '''Revelation''' or '''The Apocalypse of John''', is a book of the [[New Testament]] that occupies a central place in [[Christian eschatology]]. Its title is derived from the [[Incipit|first word]] of the text, written in [[Koine Greek]]: ''apokalypsis'', meaning "unveiling" or "revelation". The Book of Revelation is the only apocalyptic document in the New Testament [[Biblical canon|canon]] (although there are short apocalyptic passages in various places in [[the Gospels]] and the [[Epistles]]).{{Efn | Other apocalypses popular in the [[early Christian]] era did not achieve canonical status, except [[2 Esdras]] (also known as the Apocalypse of Ezra), which is recognized as canonical in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] Churches.}}

The author names himself in the text as "John", but his precise identity remains a point of academic debate. Second century Christian writers such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Melito]] the bishop of Sardis, and [[Clement of Alexandria]] and the author of the  [[Muratorian fragment]] identify [[John the Apostle]] as the "John" of Revelation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Don|title=An Introduction to the New Testament|date=2005|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=0-310-51940-3|page=465ff|edition=2nd}}</ref> Modern scholarship generally takes a different view,{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28}} and many consider that nothing can be known about the author except that he was a [[Christian]] prophet.{{sfn|Bauckham|1992|p=2}} Some modern scholars characterise Revelation's author as a putative figure which they call "[[John of Patmos]]". The bulk of traditional sources date the book to the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (AD 81-96), and the evidence tends to confirm this.{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|p=1535-1536}}

The book spans three literary genres: the [[letter (message)|epistolary]], the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]], and the [[prophetic]].{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|p=1536}} It begins with John, on the island of [[Patmos]] in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], addressing a letter to the "[[seven churches of Asia|Seven Churches]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]". He then describes a series of prophetic [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]], including figures such as the [[Whore of Babylon]] and [[The Beast (Revelation)|the Beast]], culminating in the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]].

The obscure and extravagant imagery has led to a wide variety of Christian interpretations: [[Historicism (Christianity)|historicist]] interpretations see in Revelation a broad view of history; [[preterist]] interpretations treat Revelation as mostly referring to the events of the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic era (1st century)]], or, at the latest, the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]; [[Futurism (Christianity)|futurists]] believe that Revelation describes future events; and [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|idealist or symbolic]] interpretations consider that Revelation does not refer to actual people or events, but is an [[allegory]] of the spiritual path and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.

===Title, authorship, and date===
[[File:ApocalypseStSeverFol026vJohnRecievesRev.jpg|thumb|St. John receives his Revelation. [[Saint-Sever Beatus]], 11th century.]]
{{Main|Authorship of the Johannine works}}
The title is taken from the first word of the book in [[Koine Greek]]: ἀποκάλυψις ''apokalypsis'', meaning "unveiling" or "revelation". The author names himself as "John", but it is extremely unlikely that the author of Revelation was also the author of the [[Gospel of John]]. Some of the evidence for this was set out as early as the second half of the 3rd century by Dionysius, archbishop of Alexandria, who noted that the gospel and the epistles attributed to John, unlike Revelation, do not name their author, and that the Greek of the gospel is correct and elegant while that of Revelation is neither; some later scholars believe that the two books also have radical differences in theological perspective.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28–29}} Tradition links him to [[John the Apostle]], but it is unlikely that the apostle could have lived into the most likely time for the book's composition, the reign of Domitian, and the author never states that he knew Jesus.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=26–27}} All that is known is that this John was a [[Jewish Christian]] prophet, probably belonging to a group of such prophets, and was accepted as such by the congregations to whom he addresses his letter.{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|p=1535–1536}}{{sfn||1992|p=2, 24–25}} His precise identity remains unknown,{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|p=1535}} and modern scholarship commonly refers to him as [[John of Patmos]].

Early Church tradition dates the book to end of the emperor [[Domitian]] (reigned AD 81–96), and most modern scholars agree, although the author may have written a first version under Vespasian (AD 69–79) and updated it under Domitian.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=503–504}} The beast with seven heads and the number 666 seem to allude directly to the emperor [[Nero]], but this does not require that Revelation was written in the 60s, as there was a widespread belief in later decades that Nero would return.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=100}}{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|p=1535–1536}}

In her volume in the original Anchor Bible, J. Massyngberde Ford argues that the core of Revelation, chapters 4-11, was written by John the Baptist and later surrounded with a Christian beginning and ending. <ref>http://www.amazon.com/Revelation-Anchor-Bible-Vol-38/dp/0385008953/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1446259545&sr=1-3&keywords=revelation+anchor+bible</ref>

===Genre===
Revelation is an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] prophecy with an epistolary introduction addressed to seven churches in the Roman province of Asia.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} "Apocalypse" means the revealing of divine mysteries;{{sfn|McKim|2014|p=16}} John is to write down what is revealed (what he sees in his vision) and send it to the seven churches.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} The entire book constitutes the letter—the letters to the seven individual churches are introductions to the rest of the book, which is addressed to all seven.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} While the dominant genre is apocalyptic, the author seems himself as a Christian prophet: Revelation uses the word in various forms twenty-one times, more than any other [[New Testament]] book.{{sfn|Couch|2001|p=81}}

===Sources===
Although Revelation rarely quotes directly from the [[Old Testament]], it is permeated with allusions and echoes in almost every verse. Over half of the references are to [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]], and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], with Daniel providing the largest number in proportion to length and Ezekiel standing out as the most influential. Because these references are allusions rather than quotes, it is difficult to know whether the author was using the Hebrew or the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures, but he was clearly often influenced by the Greek. He very frequently combines multiple references, and again the allusional style makes it impossible to be certain to what extent he was doing so consciously.{{sfn|Beale|McDonough|2007|p=1081-1084}}

===Setting===
The conventional understanding until recently was that Revelation was written to comfort beleaguered Christians as they underwent persecution at the hands of a [[megalomania]]cal Roman emperor, but much of this has now been jettisoned: Domitian is no longer viewed as a despot imposing an imperial cult, and it is no longer believed that there was any systematic empire-wide persecution of Christians in his time.{{sfn|Stephens|p=143-145}} The current view is that Revelation was composed in the context of a conflict within the Christian community of Asia Minor over whether to engage with, or withdraw from, the far larger non-Christian community: Revelation rejects those Christians who wanted to reach an accommodation with society.{{sfn|Stephens|p=152}} This is not to say that Christians in Roman Asia were not suffering, for withdrawal from the wider Roman society imposed very real penalties; Revelation offered an escape from this reality by offering an apocalyptic hope: in the words of professor Adela Yarbro Collins, "What ought to be was experienced as a present reality."{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=154}}

===Canonical history===
{{main|Development of the New Testament canon}}
Revelation was the last book to be accepted into the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]], and even at the present day some [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] churches reject it.{{sfn|Wall|2011|p=no page number}} It was tainted because the heretical sect of the [[Montanism|Montanists]] relied on it{{sfn|Stonehouse|1929|p=138–142}} and doubts were raised over its Jewishness and authorship.{{sfn|Pattemore|2004|p=1}}  It was not included in the canon until 419.{{sfn|McDonald|Sanders|p=append.D-2,note 19}}

Doubts resurfaced during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. [[Martin Luther]] called it "neither apostolic nor prophetic" and it was the only New Testament book on which [[John Calvin]] did not write a commentary.{{sfn|Hoekema|1979|p=297}} Even today, it is the only New Testament work not read in the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], though it is included in Catholic and Protestant liturgies.

===Texts and manuscripts===
There are approximately 230 Greek manuscripts of Revelation. The major manuscripts are the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] (4th century), [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (5th century), and [[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]] (5th century). In addition, there are numerous [[Papyrus|papyri]], especially that of ''p''<sup>47</sup> (3rd century); the [[Greek minuscule|minuscule]]s (8th to 10th century), plus fragmentary quotations in the Church fathers of the 2nd to 5th centuries and the 6th century Greek commentary on Revelation by Andreas.{{sfn|Pate|2010|p=no page number}}

===Literary structure===

Divisions in the book seem to be marked by the repetition of key phrases, by the arrangement of subject matter into blocks, and around its Christological passages,{{sfn|Tenney|1988|p=32-41}} and much use is made of significant numbers, especially the number seven, which represented perfection according to ancient numerology.{{sfn|Senior|Getty|1990|p=398-399}} Nevertheless, there is a "complete lack of consensus" among scholars about the structure of Revelation.{{sfn|Mounce|1998|p=32}} The following is therefore an outline of the book's contents rather than of its structure.

#The Seven Spiritual Figures. (Events leading into the Third Woe)
##A Woman "clothed with a white robe, with the sun at her back, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars" is in pregnancy with a male child. (12:1–2)
##A great Dragon (with seven heads, ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads) drags a third of the stars of Heaven with his tail, and throws them to the Earth. (12:3–4). The Dragon waits for the birth of
# the child so he can devour it. However, sometime after the child is born, he is caught up to God's throne while the Woman flees into the wilderness into her place prepared of God that they should feed her there for 1,260 days (3½ years). (12:5–6). War breaks out in heaven between Michael and the Dragon, identified as that old Serpent,  the Devil, or Satan (12:9). After a great fight, the Dragon and his angels are cast out of Heaven for good, followed by praises of victory for God's kingdom. (12:7–12). The Dragon engages to persecute the Woman, but she is given aid to evade him. Her evasiveness enrages the Dragon, prompting him to wage war against the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (12:13–17)
##A Beast (with seven heads, ten horns, and ten crowns on his horns and on his heads names of blasphemy) emerges from the Sea, having one mortally wounded head that is then healed. The people of the world wonder and follow the Beast. The Dragon grants him power and authority for forty-two months. (13:1–5)
##The Beast of the Sea blasphemes God's name (along with God's tabernacle and His kingdom and all who dwell in Heaven), wages war against the Saints, and overcomes them. (13:6–10)
##Then, a Beast emerges from the Earth having two horns, head like a lamb, body as a sheep, tail like a wolf, feet like a goat, and speaking voice like a dragon. He directs people to make an image of the Beast of the Sea who was wounded yet lives, breathing life into it, and forcing all people to bear "[[Number of the Beast|the mark of the Beast]]," "666". Events leading into the Third Woe:
##The Lamb stands on [[Mount Zion]] with the 144,000 "first fruits" who are redeemed from Earth and victorious over the Beast and his mark and image. (14:1–5)
###The proclamations of three angels. (14:6–13)
###One like the Son of Man reaps the earth. (14:14–16)
###A second angel reaps "the vine of the Earth" and throws it into "the great winepress of the wrath of God... and blood came out of the winepress... up to one thousand six hundred [[furlong]]s." (14:17–20)
###The temple of the tabernacle, in Heaven, is opened(15:1–5), beginning the "Seven Bowls" revelation.
###Seven angels are given a golden bowl, from the Four Living Creatures, that contains the seven last plagues bearing the wrath of God. (15:6–8)
#[[Seven bowls]] are poured onto Earth:
##First Bowl: A "foul and malignant sore" afflicts the followers of the Beast. (16:1–2)
##Second Bowl: The Sea turns to blood and everything within it dies. (16:3)
##Third Bowl: All fresh water turns to blood. (16:4–7)
##Fourth Bowl: The Sun scorches the Earth with intense heat and even burns some people with fire. (16:8–9)
##Fifth Bowl: There is total darkness and great pain in the Beast's kingdom. (16:10–11)
##Sixth Bowl: The Great River Euphrates is dried up and preparations are made for the kings of the East and the final battle at [[Armageddon]] between the forces of good and evil. (16:12–16)
##Seventh Bowl: A great earthquake and heavy hailstorm: "every island fled away and the mountains were not found." (16:17–21)
#Aftermath: Vision of John given by "an angel who had the seven bowls"
##The great Harlot who sits on a scarlet Beast(with seven heads and ten horns and names of blasphemy all over its body) and by many waters: Babylon the Great. The angel showing John the vision of the Harlot and the scarlet Beast reveals their identities and fates (17:1–18)
## New Babylon is destroyed. (18:1–8)
##The people of the Earth (the kings, merchants, sailors, etc.) mourn New Babylon's destruction. (18:9–19)
##The permanence of New Babylon's destruction. (18:20–24)
#The Marriage Supper of the Lamb
##A great multitude praises God. (19:1–6)
##The marriage Supper of the Lamb. (19:7–10)

##After the Thousand Years
###The Dragon is released and goes out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the Earth—[[Gog and Magog]]—and gathers them for battle at the holy city. The Dragon makes war against the people of God, but is defeated. (20:7–9)
###The Dragon is cast into the Lake of Fire with the Beast and the False Prophet. (20:10)
###The Last Judgment: the wicked, along with Death and Hades, are cast into the Lake of Fire, which is the second death. (20:11–15)
#The New Heaven and Earth, and New Jerusalem
##A new, glorious Heaven replaces the old Earth. There is no more suffering or death. (21:1–8)
##God comes to dwell with humanity in the New Jerusalem. (21:2–8)
##Description of the New Jerusalem. (21:9–27)
##The River of Life and the Tree of Life appear for the healing of the nations and peoples. The curse of sin is ended. (22:1–5)
#Conclusion
##Christ's reassurance that his coming is imminent. Final admonitions. (22:6–21)

==Interpretations==
{{Christian Eschatology}}
Revelation has a wide variety of interpretations, ranging from the simple message that we should have faith that God will prevail ("symbolic interpretation"), to complex end time scenarios ("futurist interpretation"),<ref>Robert J. Karris (ed.) The Collegeville Bible Commentary Liturgical Press, 1992 p. 1296.</ref><ref>Ken Bowers, Hiding in plain sight, Cedar Fort, 2000 p. 175.</ref> to the views of critics who deny any spiritual value to Revelation at all.<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]] in his autobiography ''Memories Dream Reflections'' said "I will not discuss the transparent prophecies of the Book of Revelation because no one believes in them and the whole subject is felt to be an embarrassing one."</ref>

===Eschatological===
Most Christian interpretations fall into one or more of the following categories:
* Historicism, which sees in Revelation a broad view of history;
* [[Preterism]], in which Revelation mostly refers to the events of the [[apostolic era]] (1st century) or, at the latest, the fall of the [[Roman Empire]];
* [[Amillennialism]], which contends that the millennium has already begun and is identical with the current [[Dispensation (period)|church age]];
* [[Futurism (Christianity)|Futurism]], which believes that Revelation describes future events (modern believers in this interpretation are often called "[[Millennialism|millennialists]]"); and
* [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealism]], which holds that Revelation does not refer to actual people or events, but is an [[allegory]] of the spiritual path and the ongoing struggle between [[good and evil]].

====Eastern Orthodox====
[[File:Apokalipsis XVI.jpg|thumb|Orthodox [[icon]] of the Apocalypse of St. John (16th century)]]
[[Eastern Orthodoxy]] treats the text as simultaneously describing contemporaneous events (events occurring at the same time) and as prophecy of events to come, for which the contemporaneous events were a form of foreshadow. It rejects attempts to determine, before the fact, if the events of Revelation are occurring by mapping them onto present-day events, taking to heart the Scriptural warning against those who proclaim "He is here!" prematurely. Instead, the book is seen as a warning to be spiritually and morally ready for the end times, whenever they may come ("as a thief in the night"), but they will come at the time of God's choosing, not something that can be precipitated nor trivially deduced by mortals.<ref>{{Cite book

</ref> This view is also held by many Catholics, although there is a diversity of opinion about the nature of the Apocalypse within Catholicism.

Book of Revelation is the only book of the New Testament that is not read during services by the Eastern Orthodox Church. In the Coptic Orthodox Church (which is not in communion with the Eastern Orthodox church but is liturgically similar), the whole Book of Revelation is read during Apocalypse Night or [[Bright Saturday]] (6 days after Pascha).

====Paschal liturgical====
This interpretation, which has found expression among both Catholic and Protestant theologians, considers the liturgical worship, particularly the [[Easter]] rites, of early Christianity as background and context for understanding the Book of Revelation's structure and significance. This perspective is explained in ''The Paschal Liturgy and the Apocalypse'' (new edition, 2004) by [[Massey H. Shepherd]], an Episcopal scholar, and in [[Scott Hahn]]'s ''The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth'' (1999), in which he states that Revelation in form is structured after creation, fall, judgment and redemption. Those who hold this view say that the Temple's destruction (AD 70) had a profound effect on the Jewish people, not only in Jerusalem but among the Greek-speaking Jews of the Mediterranean.<ref>Scott Hahn, ''The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth'', ISBN 0-385-49659-1. New York City: Doubleday, 1999.</ref> They believe The Book of Revelation provides insight into the early Eucharist, saying that it is the new Temple worship in the New Heaven and Earth. The idea of the Eucharist as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet is also explored by British Methodist Geoffrey Wainwright in his book ''Eucharist and Eschatology'' (Oxford University Press, 1980). According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]] some of the images of Revelation should be understood in the context of the dramatic suffering and persecution of the churches of Asia in the 1st century.

Accordingly, the Book of Revelation should not be read as an enigmatic warning, but as an encouraging vision of Christ's definitive victory over evil.<ref>{{cite web|author=Catholic Online |url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=20995 |title=Pope Benedict: Read Book of Revelation as Christ's victory over evil – International – Catholic Online |publisher=Catholic.org |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>

====Latter-day Saints====
"Also known as the Apocalypse, a Greek word meaning revealed or uncovered. The message of Revelation is the same as that of all scripture: there will be an eventual triumph on this earth of God over the devil; a permanent victory of good over evil, of the Saints over their persecutors, of the kingdom of God over the kingdoms of men and of Satan. This is the subject on which Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Paul, Peter, and all the prophets have written. They spoke of a day of victory that would come, and that the end would be better (more glorious) than the beginning. The victory would be achieved through Jesus Christ."

"Such is the theme of the Revelation. The details about the beasts, the wars, the angels, the men, etc., contribute to the development of this theme. By a little study, the theme can be perceived even if the details are not completely identified. It may be in this sense that the Prophet [[Joseph Smith]] said that Revelation was 'one of the plainest books God ever caused to be written' ([[History of the Church]] 5:342). However, the more fully the details are understood, the greater will be the appreciation of the theme. If we fail to catch a glimpse of the theme, we fail in our comprehension, no matter how many details we are able to understand."<ref>https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/revelation-of-john?lang=eng&letter=r</ref>

The Book of Mormon confirms that [[John the Apostle]] is the author of Revelation and that he was foreordained by God to write it.<ref>https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.18-27?lang=eng#17</ref>

Latter-day revelation through the Prophet Joseph Smith contained in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 77, provides answers to specific questions regarding the symbolism contained in the Book of Revelation.<ref>https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.35?lang=eng#34</ref>  Topics include: the sea of glass, the four beasts and their appearance, the 24 elders, the book with seven seals, certain angels, the sealing of the 144,000, the little book eaten by John, and the two witnesses in Chapter 11.

Latter-day Saints believe that the warning contained in Revelation 22:18-19<ref>https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/22.18-19?lang=eng#17</ref> does not refer to the biblical canon as a whole.<ref>https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1981/04/no-man-shall-add-to-or-take-away?lang=eng&query=book+of+revelation</ref>  Rather, an open and ongoing dialogue between God and the modern-day Prophet and Apostles of the LDS faith constitute an open canon of scripture.<ref>https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.35?lang=eng#34</ref><ref>https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.9?lang=eng#8</ref>

====Seventh-day Adventist====
{{main|Historicism (Christianity)#Seventh-day Adventists}}
Adventists maintain a historicist interpretation of the Bible's predictions of the apocalypse.

====Bahai Faith====
[['Abdu'l-Baha]] has given some interpretations about the 11th and 12th chapters of Revelation in ''[[Some Answered Questions]]''.  The 1260 days spoken of in different forms refers to the 1260 years of Islam that lasted until the beginning of the Revelation of the [[Báb]] in 1260 AH or AD 1844.  The "two witnesses" spoken of are [[Muhammad]] and [['Ali]].<ref>http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-11.html</ref>  "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads."  The seven heads and seven crowns are the seven countries and dominions that the [[Umayyads]] had control over, while the ten horns were the ten names of the Umayyad leaders.<ref>http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-13.html</ref>  A more detailed explanation can be found in the references.

====Esoteric====
The [[Esotericism|esoterist]] views Revelation as bearing multiple levels of meaning, the lowest being the literal or "dead-letter." Those who are instructed in esoteric knowledge enter gradually into more subtle levels of understanding of the text.  They see the book as delivering both a series of warnings for humanity and a detailed account of internal, spiritual processes of the individual soul.

The Gnostic Kabbalist believes that Revelation (like Genesis) is a very profound book of [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] symbolism.

Christian Gnostics, however, are unlikely to be attracted to the teaching of Revelation because the doctrine of salvation through the sacrificed Lamb, which is central to Revelation, is repugnant to Gnostics. Christian Gnostics "believed in the Forgiveness of Sins, but in no vicarious sacrifice for sin ... they accepted Christ in the full realisation of the word; his life, not his death, was the keynote of their doctrine and their practice."<ref>R. [[Frances Swiney]] (Rosa Frances Emily Biggs) ''The Esoteric Teaching of the Gnostics'' London: Yellon, Williams & Co (1909) p.3 & 4</ref>

[[James Morgan Pryse]] was an esoteric gnostic who saw Revelation as a western version of the Hindu theory of the [[Chakra]]. He began his work, "The purpose of this book is to show that the Apocalypse is a manual of spiritual development and not, as conventionally interpreted, a cryptic history or prophecy."<ref>James M. Pryse ''Apocalypse Unsealed'' London: Watkins (1910). The theory behind the book is given in [[Arthur Avalon]] (Sir John Woodroffe) ''The Serpent Power'' Madras (Chennai): Ganesh & Co (1913). One version of how these beliefs might have travelled from India to the Middle East, Greece and Rome is given in the opening chapters of [[Rudolf Otto]] ''The Kingdom of God and the Son of Man'' London: Lutterworth (1938)</ref> Such diverse theories have failed to command widespread acceptance. But Christopher Rowland argues: "there are always going to be loose threads which refuse to be woven into the fabric as a whole. The presence of the threads which stubbornly refuse to be incorporated into the neat tapestry of our world-view does not usually totally undermine that view."<ref>Christopher Rowland ''Revelation'' London:Epworth (1993) p.5</ref>

====Radical discipleship====
The [[radical discipleship]] interpretation asserts that the Book of Revelation is best understood as a handbook for radical discipleship; i.&nbsp;e., how to remain faithful to the spirit and teachings of Jesus and avoid simply assimilating to surrounding society. In this interpretation the primary agenda of the book is to expose as impostors the worldly powers that seek to oppose the ways of God and God's Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The chief temptation for Christians in the 1st century, and today, is to fail to hold fast to the non-violent teachings and example of Jesus and instead be lured into unquestioning adoption and assimilation of worldly, national or cultural values – [[imperialism]], [[nationalism]], and [[civil religion]] being the most dangerous and insidious.

This perspective (closely related to [[liberation theology]]) draws on the approach of Bible scholars such as [[Ched Myers]], [[William Stringfellow]], [[Richard Horsley]], [[Daniel Berrigan]], Wes Howard-Brook,<ref>{{cite book|title=Unveiling Empire: Reading Revelation Then and Now|last= Howard-Brook|first=Wes|author2=Gwyther, Anthony|publisher=[[Orbis Books]]|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57075-287-2}}</ref> and Joerg Rieger.<ref>{{cite book| title=Christ & Empire: From Paul to Postcolonial Times |last=Rieger| first=Joerg |publisher=[[Fortress Press]]| year=2007| isbn=978-0-8006-2038-7}}</ref> Various [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]], such as [[Jacques Ellul]], have identified the [[State (polity)|State]] and [[political power]] as [[The Beast (Bible)|the Beast]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=123–126 |url=|quote=Revelation}}</ref>

===Aesthetic and literary===
Many literary writers and theorists have contributed to a wide range of theories about the origins and purpose of the Book of Revelation. Some of these writers have no connection with established Christian faiths but, nevertheless, found in Revelation a source of inspiration. Revelation has been approached from Hindu philosophy and Jewish [[Midrash]]. Others have pointed to aspects of composition which have been ignored such as the similarities of prophetic inspiration to modern poetic inspiration, or the parallels with Greek drama. In recent years, theories have arisen which concentrate upon how readers and texts interact to create meaning and which are less interested in what the original author intended.

[[Charles Cutler Torrey]] taught Semitic languages at Yale. His lasting contribution has been to show how much more meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are when treated as poets first and foremost. He thought this was a point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose.<ref>Charles C. Torrey ''The Apocalypse of John'' New Haven: Yale University Press (1958). Christopher R. North in his ''The Second Isaiah'' London: OUP (1964) p. 23 says of Torrey's earlier Isaiah theory, "Few scholars of any standing have accepted his theory." This is the general view of Torrey's theories. However, Christopher North goes on to cite Torrey on 20 major occasions and many more minor ones in the course of his book. So, Torrey must have had some influence and poetry is the key.</ref> Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, he would have had to use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 7</ref> This was why the surviving Greek translation was written in such a strange idiom. It was a literal translation that had to comply with the warning at Revelation 22:18 that the text must not be corrupted in any way. According to Torrey, the story is that "The Fourth Gospel was brought to Ephesus by a Christian fugitive from Palestine soon after the middle of the first century. It was written in Aramaic." Later, the Ephesians claimed this fugitive had actually been the beloved disciple himself. Subsequently, this John was banished by Nero and died on Patmos after writing Revelation. Torrey argued that until AD 80, when Christians were expelled from the synagogues,<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 37</ref> the Christian message was always first heard in the synagogue and, for cultural reasons, the evangelist would have spoken in Aramaic, else "he would have had no hearing."<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 8</ref> Torrey showed how the three major songs in Revelation (the new song, the song of Moses and the Lamb and the chorus at 19: 6–8) each fall naturally into four regular metrical lines plus a coda.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 137</ref> Other dramatic moments in Revelation, such as 6: 16 where the terrified people cry out to be hidden, behave in a similar way.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 140</ref>

[[Christina Rossetti]] was a Victorian poet who believed the sensual excitement of the natural world found its meaningful purpose in death and in God.<ref>"Flowers preach to us if we will hear," begins her poem 'Consider the lilies of the field' ''Goblin Market'' London: Oxford University Press (1913) p. 87</ref> Her ''The Face of the Deep'' is a meditation upon the Apocalypse. In her view, what Revelation has to teach is patience.<ref>Ms Rossetti remarks that patience is a word which does not occur in the Bible until the New Testament, as if the usage first came from Christ's own lips. Christina Rossetti ''The Face of the Deep'' London: SPCK (1892) p. 115</ref> Patience is the closest to perfection the human condition allows.<ref>"Christians should resemble fire-flies, not glow-worms; their brightness drawing eyes upward, not downward." ''The Face of the Deep'' p. 26</ref> Her book, which is largely written in prose, frequently breaks into poetry or jubilation, much like Revelation itself. The relevance of John's visions<ref>'vision' lends the wrong emphasis as Ms Rossetti sought to minimise the distinction between John's experience and that of others. She quoted 1 John 3:24 "He abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us" to show that when John says, "I was in the Spirit" it is not exceptional.</ref> belongs to Christians of all times as a continuous present meditation. Such matters are eternal and outside of normal human reckoning. "That winter which will be the death of Time has no promise of termination. Winter that returns not to spring ... – who can bear it?"<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 301</ref> She dealt deftly with the vengeful aspects of John's message. "A few are charged to do judgment; everyone without exception is charged to show mercy."<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 292</ref> Her conclusion is that Christians should see John as "representative of all his brethren" so they should "hope as he hoped, love as he loved."<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 495</ref>

Recently, aesthetic and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation as a work of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil. [[Elisabeth Schuessler Fiorenza]] wrote ''Revelation: Vision of a Just World'' from the viewpoint of rhetoric.<ref>Elisabeth Schuessler Fiorenza ''Revelation: Vision of a Just World'' Edinburgh: T&T Clark (1993). The book seems to have started life as ''Invitation to the Book of Revelation'' Garden City: Doubleday (1981)</ref> Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John goes about saying things, partially by the context in which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic. Professor Schuessler Fiorenza believes that Revelation has particular relevance today as a liberating message to disadvantaged groups. John's book is a vision of a just world, not a vengeful threat of world-destruction. Her view that Revelation's message is not gender-based has caused dissent. She says we are to look behind the symbols rather than make a fetish out of them. In contrast, Tina Pippin states that John writes "horror literature" and "the misogyny which underlies the narrative is extreme."<ref>Tina Pippin ''Death & Desire: The rhetoric of gender in the Apocalypse of John'' Louisville: Westminster-John Knox (1993) p. 105</ref> Professor Schuessler Fiorenza would seem to be saying John's book is more like science fiction; it does not foretell the future but uses present-day concepts to show how contemporary reality could be very different.

[[D. H. Lawrence]] took an opposing, pessimistic view of Revelation in the final book he wrote, ''Apocalypse''.<ref>D. H. Lawrence ''Apocalypse'' London: Martin Secker (1932) published posthumously with an introduction (p. v – xli) by Richard Aldington which is an integral part of the text.</ref> He saw the language which Revelation used as being bleak and destructive; a 'death-product'. Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies. One of these he called "the sovereignty of the intellect"<ref>''Apocalypse'' p. xxiii</ref> which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society. The other enemy he styled "vulgarity"<ref>''Apocalypse'' p. 6</ref> and that was what he found in Revelation. "It is very nice if you are poor and not humble ... to bring your enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur. And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation."<ref>Apocalypse p. 11 Lawrence did not consider how these two types of Christianity (good and bad in his view) might be related other than as opposites. He noted the difference meant that the John who wrote a gospel could not be the same John that wrote Revelation.</ref> His specific aesthetic objections to Revelation were that its imagery was unnatural and that phrases like "the wrath of the Lamb" were "ridiculous." He saw Revelation as comprising two discordant halves. In the first, there was a scheme of cosmic renewal in "great Chaldean sky-spaces", which he quite liked. After that, Lawrence thought, the book became preoccupied with the birth of the baby messiah and "flamboyant hate and simple lust ... for the end of the world." Lawrence coined the term "Patmossers" to describe those Christians who could only be happy in paradise if they knew their enemies were suffering in hell.

===Academic===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Modern biblical scholarship attempts to understand Revelation in its 1st century historical context within the genre of Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature. This approach considers the text as an address to seven historical communities in Asia Minor. Under this interpretation, assertions that "the time is near" are to be taken literally by those communities. Consequently, the work is viewed as a warning to not conform to contemporary Greco-Roman society which John "unveils" as beastly, demonic, and subject to divine judgment. There is further information on these topics in the entries on [[higher criticism]] and apocalyptic literature.

Although the acceptance of Revelation into the [[Biblical canon|canon]] has from the beginning been controversial, it has been essentially similar to the career of other texts. The eventual exclusion of other contemporary apocalyptic literature from the canon may throw light on the unfolding historical processes of what was officially considered orthodox, what was [[heterodox]], and what was even heretical. Interpretation of meanings and imagery are anchored in what the historical author intended and what his contemporary audience inferred; a message to Christians not to assimilate into the Roman imperial culture was John's central message. Thus, his letter (written in the apocalyptic genre) is pastoral in nature, and the symbolism of Revelation is to be understood entirely within its historical, literary, and social context. Critics study the conventions of apocalyptic literature and events of the 1st century to make sense of what the author may have intended.

==Old Testament origins==
Much of Revelation employs ancient sources, primarily but not exclusively the [[Old Testament]]. For example, Howard-Brook and Gwyther<ref>Wes Howard-Brook & Anthony Gwyther ''Unveiling Empire'' New York: Orbis (1999) p. 76</ref> regard the [[Book of Enoch]] (1 Enoch) as an equally significant but contextually different source. "Enoch's journey has no close parallel in the Hebrew scriptures."

Academics showed little interest in this topic until recently.<ref>S Moyise p.13 reports no work whatsoever done between 1912 and 1984</ref> This was not, however, the case with popular writers from non-conforming backgrounds, who interspersed the text of Revelation with the prophecy they thought was being promised. For example, an anonymous Scottish commentary of 1871<ref>Anon ''An exposition of the Apocalypse on a new principle of literal interpretation'' Aberdeen: Brown (1871)</ref> prefaces Revelation 4 with the Little Apocalypse of Mark 13, places Malachi 4:5 ("Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord") within Revelation 11 and writes Revelation 12:7 side-by-side with the role of "the Satan" in the [[Book of Job]]. The message is that everything in Revelation will happen in its previously appointed time.

Steve Moyise<ref>S. Moyise ''The Old Testament in the Book of Revelation'' Sheffield: [[Sheffield Academic Press]] (1995) p. 31</ref> uses the index of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament to show that "Revelation contains more Old Testament allusions than any other New Testament book, but it does not record a single quotation." Perhaps significantly, Revelation chooses different sources than other New Testament books. Revelation concentrates on Isaiah, Psalms, and Ezekiel, while neglecting, comparatively speaking, the books of the Pentateuch that are the dominant sources for other New Testament writers. Methodological objections have been made to this course as each allusion may not have an equal significance. To counter this, G. K. Beale sought to develop a system that distinguished 'clear', 'probable', and 'possible' allusions. A clear allusion is one with almost the same wording as its source, the same general meaning, and which could not reasonably have been drawn from elsewhere. A probable allusion contains an idea which is uniquely traceable to its source. Possible allusions are described as mere echoes of their putative sources.

Yet, with Revelation, the problems might be judged more fundamental. The author seems to be using his sources in a completely different way to the originals. For example, he borrows the 'new temple' imagery of Ezekiel 40–48 but uses it to describe a New Jerusalem which, quite pointedly, no longer needs a temple because it is God's dwelling. Ian Boxall<ref>Ian Boxall The Revelation of St John London: Continuum & Peabody MA: Hendrickson (2006) p. 254</ref> writes that Revelation "is no montage of biblical quotations (that is not John's way) but a wealth of allusions and evocations rewoven into something new and creative." In trying to identify this "something new", Boxall argues that Ezekiel provides the 'backbone' for Revelation. He sets out a comparative table listing the chapters of Revelation in sequence and linking most of them to the structurally corresponding chapter in Ezekiel. The interesting point is that the order is not the same. John, on this theory, rearranges Ezekiel to suit his own purposes.

Some commentators argue that it is these purposes – and not the structure – that really matter. G. K. Beale believes that, however much John makes use of Ezekiel, his ultimate purpose is to present Revelation as a fulfillment of [[Daniel 7]].<ref>G. K. Beale John's use of the Old Testament in Revelation Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press (1998) p. 109</ref>
