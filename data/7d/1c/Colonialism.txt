'''Colonialism''' is the establishment, exploitation, maintenance, acquisition, and expansion of colony in one territory by a political power from another territory. It is a set of unequal relationships between the colonial power and the [[colony]] and often between the colonists and the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous population]].

The ''[[History of colonialism|European colonial period]]'' was the era from the 16th century to the mid-20th century when several [[Europe]]an powers established colonies in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[the Americas]]. At first the countries followed [[mercantilism|mercantilist policies]] designed to strengthen the home economy at the expense of rivals, so the colonies were usually allowed to trade only with the mother country. By the mid-19th century, however, the powerful British Empire gave up mercantilism and trade restrictions and introduced the principle of [[free trade]], with few restrictions or tariffs.

[[File:Fundacion de Santiago.jpg|thumb|1541 founding of [[Santiago de Chile]]]]

''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' defines colonialism as "the policy and practice of a power in extending control over weaker people or areas."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/colonialism|title=Colonialism|year=2011|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> The ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary'' offers four definitions, including "something characteristic of a colony" and "control by one power over a dependent area or people."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/colonialism|title=Colonialism|year=2010|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>

The 2006 ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' "uses the term 'colonialism' to describe the process of European settlement and political control over the rest of the world, including Americas, Australia, and parts of Africa and Asia." It discusses the distinction between colonialism and [[imperialism]] and states that "given the difficulty of consistently distinguishing between the two terms, this entry will use colonialism as a broad concept that refers to the project of European political domination from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries that ended with the national liberation movements of the 1960s."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/|title=Colonialism|author=Margaret Kohn|year=2006|work= [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>

In his preface to [[Jürgen Osterhammel]]'s ''Colonialism: A Theoretical Overview'', Roger Tignor says, "For Osterhammel, the essence of colonialism is the existence of colonies, which are by definition governed differently from other territories such as protectorates or informal spheres of influence."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tignor|first1=Roger|title=Preface to Colonialism: a theoretical overview|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CMfksrnWaUkC&pg=PR10#v=onepage |accessdate= 5 April 2010|year=2005|publisher=Markus Weiner Publishers|isbn=978-1-55876-340-1 |page=x}}</ref> In the book, Osterhammel asks, "How can 'colonialism' be defined independently from 'colony?'"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Osterhammel|first1=Jürgen|authorlink1=Jürgen Osterhammel |others=trans.

==Types of colonialism==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Rijsttafel TMnr 60053682.jpg|thumb|Dutch family in [[Java]], 1927]]

Historians often distinguish between two [[Mutually exclusive events|overlapping]] forms of colonialism:

*[[Settler colonialism]] involves large-scale [[immigration]], often motivated by religious, political, or economic reasons.
*[[Exploitation colonialism]] involves fewer colonists and focuses on access to resources for export, typically to the [[metropole]]. This category includes [[trading posts]] as well as larger colonies where colonists would constitute much of the political and economic administration, but would rely on indigenous resources for [[labour (economics)|labour]] and material. Prior to the end of the [[slave trade]] and widespread [[Abolitionism|abolition]], when indigenous labour was unavailable, [[Slavery|slaves]] were often imported to the Americas, first by the Portuguese Empire, and later by the Spanish, Dutch, French and British.

[[Plantation (settlement or colony)|Plantation colonies]] would be considered exploitation colonialism; but colonizing powers would utilize either type for different territories depending on various social and economic factors as well as climate and geographic conditions.

[[Surrogate Colonialism|Surrogate colonialism]] involves a settlement project supported by colonial power, in which most of the settlers do not come from the mainstream of the ruling power.

[[Internal colonialism]] is a notion of uneven structural power between areas of a [[nation state]]. The source of exploitation comes from within the state.

==Socio-cultural evolution==

As colonialism often played out in pre-populated areas, [[sociocultural evolution]] included the formation of various ethnically hybrid populations. Colonialism gave rise to culturally and ethnically mixed populations such as the [[mestizo]]s of the [[Americas]], as well as racially-divided populations such as those found in [[French Algeria]] or in [[Southern Rhodesia]]. In fact, everywhere where colonial powers established a consistent and continued presence, hybrid communities existed.

Notable examples in Asia include the [[Anglo-Burmese people|Anglo-Burmese]],  [[Anglo-Indian]], [[Burgher people|Burgher]], [[Eurasian Singaporean]], [[Filipino mestizo]], [[Kristang people|Kristang]] and [[Macanese people]]s. In the [[Dutch East Indies]] (later [[Indonesia]]) the vast majority of "Dutch" settlers were in fact Eurasians known as [[Indo people|Indo-Europeans]], formally belonging to the European legal class in the colony (see also [[Indos in pre-colonial history|Indos in Pre-Colonial History]] and [[Indos in colonial history|Indos in Colonial History]]).<ref>

[[File:Colonialism in 1945 updated legend.png|thumb|right|Map of colonial empires at the end of the Second World War, 1945]]

Activity that could be called colonialism has a long history starting with the pre-colonial African empires which led to the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] who all built [[colonies in antiquity]]. The word "metropole" comes from the Greek ''metropolis'' [Greek: "μητρόπολις"]—"mother city". The word "colony" comes from the Latin ''colonia''—"a place for agriculture". Between the 11th and 18th centuries, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] established military colonies south of their original territory and absorbed the territory, in a process known as [[nam tiến]].<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/11.htm The Le Dynasty and Southward Expansion]</ref>

Modern colonialism started with the [[Age of Discovery]]. [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] discovered new lands across the oceans and built trading posts or conquered large extensions of land. For some people, it is this building of colonies across oceans that differentiates colonialism from other types of [[expansionism]]. These new lands were divided between the [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]], first by the papal bull [[Inter caetera]] and then by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] and the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]].

This period is also associated with the [[Commercial Revolution]]. The late Middle Ages saw reforms in accountancy and banking in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean. These ideas were adopted and adapted in western Europe to the high risks and rewards associated with colonial ventures.

The 17th century saw the creation of the [[French colonial empire]] and the [[Dutch Empire]], as well as the [[English overseas possessions]], which later became the [[British Empire]]. It also saw the establishment of a [[Danish colonial empire]] and some [[Swedish overseas colonies]].

The spread of colonial empires was reduced in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. However, many new colonies were established after this time, including the [[German colonial empire]] and [[Belgian colonial empire]]. In the late 19th century, many European powers were involved in the [[Scramble for Africa]].

The [[Russian Empire]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Empire]] existed at the same time as the above empires, but did not expand over oceans. Rather, these empires expanded through the more traditional route of conquest of neighbouring territories. There was, though, some [[Russian colonization of the Americas]] across the Bering Strait. The [[Empire of Japan]] modelled itself on European colonial empires. The [[United States of America]] gained overseas territories after the [[Spanish–American War]] for which the term "[[American imperialism|American Empire]]" was coined.

After the [[World War I|First World War]], the victorious [[Allies of World War I|allies]] divided up the German colonial empire and much of the Ottoman Empire between themselves as [[League of Nations mandate]]s. These territories were divided into three classes according to how quickly it was deemed that they would be ready for independence.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/United-Nations/The-Trusteeship-Council-THE-MANDATE-SYSTEM-OF-THE-LEAGUE-OF-NATIONS.html|title=The Trusteeship Council - The mandate system of the League of Nations|year=2010|work=Encyclopedia of the Nations|publisher=Advameg|accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref>

The colonial system was the major cause of the [[Second World War]]. The war in the Pacific was caused by Japan's efforts to create a colonial empire that sought to conquer the existing empires held by the British, French, Dutch and the United States. The war in Europe and North Africa was caused partially by Germany and Italy's efforts to create colonial empires that sought to conquer existing British, French and Russian colonial empires in these areas.

After [[World War II]], [[decolonization]] progressed rapidly. This was caused by a number of reasons. First, the Japanese victories in the Pacific War showed Indians, Chinese, and other subject peoples that the colonial powers were not invincible. Second, many colonial powers were significantly weakened by World War Two.

Dozens of independence movements and global political solidarity projects such as the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] were instrumental in the decolonization efforts of former colonies. These included significant wars of independence fought in Malaysia, Vietnam, Algeria, and Kenya. Eventually, the European powers—pressured by the United States—resigned themselves to decolonization.

In 1962 the [[United Nations]] set up a [[Special Committee on Decolonization]], often called the Committee of 24, to encourage this process.

===European empires in 1914===
The major European empires consisted of the following colonies at the start of World War I (former colonies of the Spanish Empire became independent before 1914 and are not listed; former colonies of other European empires that previously became independent, such as the former French colony [[Haiti]], are not listed).

[[File:Emigrants Leave Ireland by Henry Doyle 1868.jpg|thumb|upright|Millions of [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] left Ireland for Canada and U.S. following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in the 1840s]]

By 1914, Europeans had migrated to the colonies in the millions. Some intended to remain in the colonies as temporary settlers, mainly as military personnel or on business. Others went to the colonies as immigrants. British people were by far the most numerous population to migrate to the colonies: 2.5 million settled in Canada; 1.5 million in Australia; 750,000 in New Zealand; 450,000 in the Union of South Africa; and 200,000 in India. French citizens also migrated in large numbers, mainly to the colonies in the north African [[Maghreb]] region: 1.3 million settled in Algeria; 200,000 in Morocco; 100,000 in Tunisia; while only 20,000 migrated to French Indochina. Dutch and German colonies saw relatively scarce European migration, since Dutch and German colonial expansion focused on commercial goals rather than settlement. Portugal sent 150,000 settlers to Angola, 80,000 to Mozambique, and 20,000 to Goa. During the Spanish Empire, approximately 550,000 Spanish settlers migrated to [[Latin America]].<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration|year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles|isbn=0-520-26151-8|pages=34–5}}</ref>

===Neocolonialism===
{{Main|Neocolonialism}}
The term [[neocolonialism]] has been used to refer to a variety of contexts since decolonization that took place after [[World War II]]. Generally it does not refer to a type of direct colonization, rather, colonialism by other means. Specifically, neocolonialism refers to the theory that former or existing economic relationships, such as the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]], created by former colonial powers were or are used to maintain control of their former colonies and dependencies after the colonial independence movements of the post–World War II period.

==Colonialism and the history of thought==
{{see also|Historiography of the British Empire}}

===Universalism===
The conquest of vast territories brings multitudes of diverse cultures under the central control of the imperial authorities. From the time of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, this fact has been addressed by empires adopting the concept of universalism, and applying it to their imperial policies towards their subjects far from the imperial capitol. The capitol, the metropole, was the source of ostensibly enlightened policies imposed throughout the distant colonies.

The empire that grew from Greek conquest, particularly by [[Alexander the Great]], spurred the spread of Greek language, religion, science and philosophy throughout the colonies. The Greeks considered their own culture superior to all others. They referred to people speaking foreign languages as [[barbarian]]s, dismissing foreign languages as inferior mutterings that sounded to Greek ears like "bar-bar".

Romans found efficiency in imposing a universalist policy towards their colonies in many matters. [[Roman law]] was imposed on Roman citizens, as well as colonial subjects, throughout the empire. [[Latin]] spread as the common language of government and trade, the [[lingua franca]], throughout the Empire. Romans also imposed peace between their diverse foreign subjects, which they described in beneficial terms as the [[Pax Romana]]. The use of universal regulation by the Romans marks the emergence of a European concept of universalism and internationalism. Tolerance of other cultures and beliefs has always been secondary to the aims of empires, however. The Roman Empire was tolerant of diverse cultures and religious practises, so long as these did not threaten Roman authority. [[Napoleon]]'s foreign minister, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand]], once remarked: "Empire is the art of putting men in their place".<ref>{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=Peoples and Empires|year=2003|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=0-8129-6761-5|pages=xxiii}}</ref>

===Colonialism and geography===

Settlers acted as the link between the natives and the imperial hegemony, bridging the geographical, ideological and commercial gap between the colonisers and colonised. Advanced technology made possible the expansion of European states. With tools such as cartography, shipbuilding, navigation, mining and agricultural productivity colonisers had an upper hand. Their awareness of the Earth's surface and abundance of practical skills provided colonisers with a knowledge that, in turn, created power.<ref name=Painter>"Painter, J. & Jeffrey, A., 2009. ''Political Geography'', 2nd ed., Sage. "Imperialism" p. 23 (GIC).</ref>

Painter and Jeffrey argue that geography as a discipline was not and is not an objective science, rather it is based on assumptions about the physical world. Whereas it may have given "The West" an advantage when it came to exploration, it also created zones of racial inferiority.

Maps played an extensive role in colonialism, as Bassett would put it "by providing geographical information in a convenient and standardized format, cartographers helped open West Africa to European conquest, commerce, and colonization".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bassett|first1=Thomas J.|title=Cartography and Empire Building in Nineteenth-Century West Africa|journal=Geographical Review|date=July 1994|volume=84, No.3|issue=American Geographical Society|page=317|url=: http://www.jstor.org/stable/215456 .|accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref> But, because the relationship between colonialism and geography was not scientifically objective cartography during the colonial era was often manipulated. Social norms and values had an effect on the constructing of maps. During colonialism map-makers used rhetoric in their formation of boundaries and in their art. The rhetoric favored the view of the conquering Europeans; this is evident in the fact that any map created by a non-European was instantly regarded as inaccurate. Furthermore, European cartographers were required to follow a set of rules which led to ethnocentrism; portraying one's own ethnicity in the center of the map. As Harley would put it "The steps in making a map - selection, omission, simplification, classification,the creation of hierarchies, and 'symbolization' - are all inherently rhetorical."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harley|first1=J B|title=DECONSTRUCTING THE MAP|issue=University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee /|page=2,7,11|accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref>

A common practice by the European powers of the time was to map unexplored areas as "blank spaces". This influenced colonial powers in that it sparked competition between each other to explore and colonize these blank areas on the map. Imperialists aggressively and passionately looked forward to filling these spaces for the glory of their respective countries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bassett|first1=Thomas J.|title=Cartography and Empire Building in Nineteenth-Century West Africa|journal=Geographical Review|date=July 1994|volume=84, No 3|issue=American Geographical Society|pages=322, 324–325|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/215456|accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref>

===Colonialism and imperialism===
[[File:DeGaulle in Chad.jpg|thumb|Governor-General [[Félix Éboué]] welcomes [[Charles de Gaulle]] to [[French Chad|Chad]]]]

A colony is a part of an empire and so colonialism is closely related to [[imperialism]]. Assumptions are that colonialism and imperialism are interchangeable, however [[Robert J. C. Young]] suggests that imperialism is the concept while colonialism is the practice. Colonialism is based on an imperial outlook, thereby creating a consequential relationship. Through an empire, colonialism is established and capitalism is expanded, on the other hand a capitalist economy naturally enforces an empire. In the next section Marxists make a case for this mutually reinforcing relationship.

===Marxist view of colonialism===

Marxism views colonialism as a form of capitalism, enforcing exploitation and social change. Marx thought that working within the global capitalist system, colonialism is closely associated with uneven development. It is an "instrument of wholesale destruction, dependency and systematic exploitation producing distorted economies, socio-psychological disorientation, massive poverty and neocolonial dependency."<ref name=Dic>Dictionary of Human Geography, "Colonialism"</ref> Colonies are constructed into modes of production. The search for raw materials and the current search for new investment opportunities is a result of inter-capitalist rivalry for [[capital accumulation]]. Lenin regarded colonialism as the root cause of imperialism, as imperialism was distinguished by monopoly capitalism via colonialism and as [[Lyal S. Sunga]] explains: "Vladimir Lenin advocated forcefully the principle of self-determination of peoples in his "Theses on the Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination" as an integral plank in the programme of socialist internationalism" and he quotes Lenin who contended that "The right of nations to self-determination implies exclusively the right to independence in the political sense, the right to free political separation from the oppressor nation.  Specifically, this demand for political democracy implies complete freedom to agitate for secession and for a referendum on secession by the seceding nation."<ref>In the Emerging System of International Criminal Law: Developments and Codification, Brill Publishers (1997) at page 90, Sunga traces the origin of the international movement against colonialism, and relates it to the rise of the right to self-determination in international law.</ref> Non Russian marxists within the RSFSR and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai,  meanwhile, between 1918 and 1923 and then after 1929, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.

In his critique of colonialism in Africa, the Guyanese historian and political activist [[Walter Rodney]] states:
:"The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for Africa spring mainly from the fact that Africa lost power. Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups. It implies the ability to defend one's interests and if necessary to impose one's will by any means available.... When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society that in itself is a form of [[underdevelopment]]&nbsp;... During the centuries of pre-colonial trade, some control over social political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism. Colonialism went much further than trade. It meant a tendency towards direct appropriation by Europeans of the social institutions within Africa. Africans ceased to set indigenous cultural goals and standards, and lost full command of training young members of the society. Those were undoubtedly major steps backwards&nbsp;... Colonialism was not merely a system of exploitation, but one whose essential purpose was to repatriate the profits to the so-called 'mother country'. From an African view-point, that amounted to consistent expatriation of surplus produced by African labour out of African resources. It meant the development of Europe as part of the same dialectical process in which Africa was underdeveloped."

"Colonial Africa fell within that part of the international capitalist economy from which surplus was drawn to feed the metropolitan sector. As seen earlier, exploitation of land and labour is essential for human social advance, but only on the assumption that the product is made available within the area where the exploitation takes place."

<ref>{{cite book|author=Walter Rodney|title=How Europe Underdeveloped Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CwSSkemSJLcC&pg=PA224|publisher=East African Publishers|pages=149, 224}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Henry Schwarz|author2=Sangeeta Ray|title=A Companion To Postcolonial Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eyiZafDHpqoC&pg=PA271|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=271}}</ref>

According to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the new imperialism emphasized the transition of capitalism from [[free trade]] to a stage of [[monopoly]] [[capitalism]] to finance [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. He states it is, "connected with the intensification of the struggle for the partition of the world".  As [[free trade]] thrives on [[exports]] of commodities, monopoly capitalism thrived on the export of capital amassed by profits from banks and industry. This, to Lenin, was the highest stage of capitalism. He goes on to state that this form of capitalism was doomed for war between the capitalists and the exploited nations with the former inevitably losing. War is stated to be the consequence of imperialism. As a continuation of this thought G.N. Uzoigwe states, "But it is now clear from more serious investigations of African history in this period that imperialism was essentially economic in its fundamental impulses."

===Liberalism, capitalism and colonialism===

[[Classical liberals]] were generally in abstract opposition to colonialism (as opposed to colonization) and imperialism, including [[Adam Smith]], [[Frédéric Bastiat]], [[Richard Cobden]], John Bright, Henry Richard, [[Herbert Spencer]], H. R. Fox Bourne, Edward Morel, Josephine Butler, W. J. Fox and [[William Ewart Gladstone]].<ref name=dk>[http://www.setav.org/ups/dosya/24514.pdf Liberal Anti-Imperialism], professor Daniel Klein, 1.7.2004</ref> Their philosophies found the [[Imperialism|colonial enterprise]], particularly [[mercantilism]], in opposition to the principles of [[free trade]] and [[Political freedom|liberal policies]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Anticolonialism | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Western Colonialism since 1450 | publisher=Macmillan Reference USA | accessdate=May 22, 2015 | author=Hidalgo, Dennis | editor=Benjamin, Thomas | year=2007 | edition=Gale Virtual Reference Library | location=Detroit | pages=57–65 | URL=https://www.academia.edu/9048629/Anticolonialism}}</ref> [[Adam Smith]] wrote in ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' that Britain should grant independence to all of its colonies and also argued that it would be economically beneficial for British people in the average, although the merchants having mercantilist privileges would lose out.<ref name=dk/><ref>{{cite book | title=The nature and causes of the wealth of nations ("Of Colonies") | publisher=T.

===Scientific thought in colonialism, race and gender===

The act of colonizing spread and synthesized social and political western ideas of a gender and racial hierarchy to colonized areas, as well as elicited the further development of ideas about the gender dichotomy and racial divisions in European society during the colonial era.<ref name="Stoler 1989">{{cite journal|last=Stoler|first=Ann L.|title=Making Empire Respectable: The Politics of Race and Sexual Morality in 20th-Century Colonical Cultures|journal=American Ethnologist|date=Nov 1989|volume= 16|issue= 4|pages=634–660|doi=10.1525/ae.1989.16.4.02a00030}}</ref><ref name=Fee>{{cite journal|last=Fee|first=Elizabeth|title=Nineteenth Century Craniology: The Study of the Female Skull|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|year=1979|volume=53|pages=415–53}}</ref><ref name="Fausto-Sterling 2001">{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|work=The Gender and Science Reader|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|title=Gender, Race, and Nation: The Comparative Anatomy of "Hottentot" women in Europe, 1815–1817|editor=Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch}}</ref> Popular political practices of the time were to support colonialism rule by legitimizing European male authority and female and non European inferiority through studies of [[Craniology]], [[Comparative Anatomy]], and [[Phrenology]].<ref name="Fee"/><ref name="Fausto-Sterling 2001"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Stepan|first=Nancy|title=The "Racial" Economy of Science|year=1993|publisher=Indiana University press|isbn=978-0-253-20810-1|pages=359–376|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Racial_Economy_of_Science.html?id=CmJWBaANlsEC|edition=3|editor=Sandra Harding}}</ref> Biologists, naturalists, anthropologists, and ethnologists of the 1800s were focused on the study of colonized indigenous women, as in the case of [[Georges Cuvier]]'s study of [[Saartjie Baartman|Sarah Baartman]].<ref name="Fausto-Sterling 2001"/> Such cases embraced a natural superiority and inferiority relationship between the races based on European naturalists' observations; they gave rise to the perception that African women's anatomy, and especially genitalia, resembled those of mandrills, baboons, and monkeys, thus differentiating colonized Africans from what were viewed as the features of the evolutionarily superior, and thus rightfully authoritarian, European woman.<ref name="Fausto-Sterling 2001"/>

In addition to what would now be viewed as pseudo-scientific studies of race which supported new racially hierarchical and evolutionary ideology of the time, new science based ideology about gender was also emerging in reaction to the colonial era of European history.<ref name=Fee /> Female inferiority across all cultures was emerging as an idea based in [[craniology]] that led scientists to argue human women's brain size, based on skull measurements, was minuscule and therefore less developed and less evolutionarily advanced compared to men.<ref name=Fee /> The influence that led to such studies was the establishment of comparative anatomy of humans that developed in response to European scientists' delving into the question of biological racial difference.

Thus Non Europeans and women faced invasive study by colonial powers in the interest of scientific ideology and theory that encouraged the political institution of colonialism.<ref name="Fausto-Sterling 2001"/> Such studies of race and gender coincided with the era of colonialism and the introduction of foreign cultures, appearances, and gender roles into the line of vision of European scholars.

===Post-colonialism===

[[File:HK Queen Victoria Street The Central Market.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Victoria Street, Hong Kong|Queen Victoria Street]] in the former British colony of [[Hong Kong]]]]
Post-colonialism (or post-colonial theory) can refer to a set of theories in philosophy and literature that grapple with the legacy of colonial rule. In this sense, postcolonial literature may be considered a branch of [[postmodern literature]] concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires. Many practitioners take [[Edward Said|Edward Saïd]]'s book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978) as the theory's founding work (although French theorists such as [[Aimé Césaire]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] made similar claims decades before Said).

Saïd analyzed the works of [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] and [[Lautréamont]] arguing that they helped to shape a societal fantasy of European racial superiority. Writers of post-colonial fiction interact with the traditional colonial [[discourse]], but modify or subvert it; for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story. [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s ''[[Subaltern (post-colonialism)|Can the Subaltern Speak?]]'' (1998) gave its name to [[Subaltern Studies]].

In ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason'' (1999), Spivak argued that major works of European [[metaphysics]] (such as those of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]]) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human [[subject (philosophy)|subjects]]. Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), famous for its explicit ethnocentrism, considers [[Western culture|Western civilization]] as the most accomplished of all, while Kant also had some traces of [[Racism|racialism]] in his work.

===Trade and commerce===

Economic expansion has accompanied imperial expansion since ancient times.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Greek trade-networks spread throughout the Mediterranean region, while Roman trade expanded with the main goal of directing tribute from the colonized areas towards the Roman metropole. According to [[Strabo]], by the time of emperor [[Augustus]], up to 120 Roman ships would set sail every year from [[Myos Hormos]] in [[Roman Egypt]] to India.<ref>"[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html Strabo's Geography Book II Chapter 5 ]"</ref> With the development of trade routes under the [[Ottoman Empire]],

}}

[[Aztec civilization]] developed into a large empire that, much like the Roman Empire, had the goal of exacting tribute from the conquered colonial areas. For the Aztecs, the most important tribute was the acquisition of sacrificial victims for their religious rituals.<ref>
{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=Peoples and Empires|year=2003|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=0-8129-6761-5|page=5}}</ref>

On the other hand, European colonial empires sometimes attempted to channel, restrict and impede trade involving their colonies, funnelling activity through the metropole and taxing accordingly.

===Slaves and indentured servants===
{{further |Atlantic slave trade|Indentured servant|Coolie|Blackbirding}}
[[File:Slave memorial Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|Slave memorial in [[Zanzibar]]. The Sultan of Zanzibar complied with British demands that slavery be banned in Zanzibar and that all the slaves be freed.]]

European nations entered their imperial projects with the goal of enriching the European metropole. Exploitation of non-Europeans and other Europeans to support imperial goals was acceptable to the colonizers. Two outgrowths of this imperial agenda were slavery and indentured servitude. In the 17th century, nearly two-thirds of English settlers came to North America as indentured servants.<ref>"[http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html White Servitude]", by Richard Hofstadter, Montgomery College</ref>

[[African slavery]] had existed long before Europeans discovered it as an exploitable means of creating an inexpensive labour force for the colonies. Europeans brought transportation technology to the practise, bringing large numbers of African slaves to the Americas by sail. Spain and Portugal had [[Atlantic slave trade|brought African slaves]] to work at African colonies such as [[Cape Verde]] and the [[Azores]], and then Latin America, by the 16th century. The British, French and Dutch joined in the slave trade in subsequent centuries. Ultimately, around 11 million Africans were taken to the Caribbean and North and South America as slaves by European colonizers.<ref name="King 2010 24">{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration|year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-26124-2|page=24}}</ref>

[[abolitionism|Abolitionists]] in Europe and America protested the inhumane treatment of African slaves, which led to the elimination of the slave trade by the late 18th century. The labour shortage that resulted inspired European colonizers to develop a new source of labour, using a system of indentured servitude. [[Indentured servant]]s consented to a contract with the European colonizers. Under their contract, the servant would work for an employer for a term of at least a year, while the employer agreed to pay for the servant's voyage to the colony, possibly pay for the return to the country of origin, and pay the employee a wage as well. The employee was "indentured" to the employer because they owed a debt back to the employer for their travel expense to the colony, which they were expected to pay through their wages. In practice, indentured servants were exploited through terrible working conditions and burdensome debts created by the employers, with whom the servants had no means of negotiating the debt once they arrived in the colony.

India and China were the largest source of indentured servants during the colonial era. Indentured servants from India travelled to British colonies in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and also to French and Portuguese colonies, while Chinese servants travelled to British and Dutch colonies. Between 1830 and 1930, around 30 million indentured servants migrated from India, and 24 million returned to India. China sent more indentured servants to European colonies, and around the same proportion returned to China.<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration|year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-26124-2|pages=26–7}}</ref>

Following the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. By the end of the colonial period they were mostly successful in this aim, though slavery is still very active in Africa.<ref name="Lovejoy, Paul E. 2012"/>

===Military innovation===

Imperial expansion follows military conquest in most instances. Imperial armies therefore have a long history of military innovation in order to gain an advantage over the armies of the people they aim to conquer. Greeks developed the [[phalanx]] system, which enabled their military units to present themselves to their enemies as a wall, with foot soldiers using shields to cover one another during their advance on the battlefield. Under [[Philip II of Macedon]], they were able to organize thousands of soldiers into a formidable battle force, bringing together carefully trained infantry and cavalry regiments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=Peoples and Empires|year=2003|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=0-8129-6761-5|page=6}}</ref> [[Alexander the Great]] exploited this military foundation further during his conquests.

The Spanish Empire held a major advantage over [[Mesoamerican]] warriors through the use of weapons made of stronger metal, predominantly iron, which was able to shatter the blades of axes used by the [[Aztec civilization]] and others. The European development of firearms using [[gunpowder]] cemented their military advantage over the peoples they sought to subjugate in the Americas and elsewhere.

===The end of empire===
[[File:Lord Pethic-Lawrence and Gandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] with [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence|Lord Pethwick-Lawrence]], British Secretary of State for India, after a meeting on 18 April 1946]]
The populations of some colonial territories, such as Canada, enjoyed relative peace and prosperity as part of a European power, at least among the majority; however, minority populations such as [[First Nations]] peoples and French-Canadians experienced marginalization and resented colonial practises. Francophone residents of [[Quebec]], for example, were vocal in opposing conscription into the armed services to fight on behalf of Britain during World War I, resulting in the [[Conscription crisis of 1917]]. Other European colonies had much more pronounced conflict between European settlers and the local population. Rebellions broke out in the later decades of the imperial era, such as India's [[Sepoy Rebellion]].

The territorial boundaries imposed by European colonizers, notably in central Africa and South Asia, defied the existing boundaries of native populations that had previously interacted little with one another. European colonizers disregarded native political and cultural animosities, imposing peace upon people under their military control. Native populations were often relocated at the will of the colonial administrators. Once independence from European control was achieved, civil war erupted in some former colonies, as native populations fought to capture territory for their own ethnic, cultural or political group. The [[Partition of India]], a 1947 civil war that came in the aftermath of India's independence from Britain, became a conflict with 500,000 killed. Fighting erupted between Hindu, Sikh and Muslim communities as they fought for territorial dominance. Muslims fought for an independent country to be partitioned where they would not be a religious minority, resulting in the creation of [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Matthew|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|year=2012|publisher=W.W.

===Post-independence population movement===
[[File:Notting Hill Carnival 2002 large.jpg|thumb|The annual [[Notting Hill Carnival]] in [[London]] is a celebration led by the [[Trinidadian and Tobagonian British]] community.]]

In a reversal of the migration patterns experienced during the modern colonial era, post-independence era migration followed a route back towards the imperial country. In some cases, this was a movement of settlers of European origin returning to the land of their birth, or to an ancestral birthplace. 900,000 French colonists (known as the ''[[Pied-Noir]]s'') resettled in France following Algeria's independence in 1962. A significant number of these migrants were also of Algerian descent. 800,000 people of [[Processo Revolucionário Em Curso#The retornados|Portuguese]] origin migrated to Portugal after the independence of former colonies in Africa between 1974 and 1979; 300,000 settlers of Dutch origin migrated to the Netherlands from the Dutch West Indies after Dutch military control of the colony ended.<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration|year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-26124-2|page=35}}</ref>

After WWII 300,000 Dutchmen from the [[Dutch East Indies]], of which the majority were people of Eurasian descent called [[Indo people|Indo Europeans]], repatriated to the Netherlands. A significant number later migrated to the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.<ref>Willems, Wim "De uittocht uit Indie (1945–1995), De geschiedenis van Indische Nederlanders" (Publisher: Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2001).

ISBN 90-5589-173-8</ref>

Global travel and migration in general developed at an increasingly brisk pace throughout the era of European colonial expansion. Citizens of the former colonies of European countries may have a privileged status in some respects with regard to immigration rights when settling in the former European imperial nation. For example, rights to dual citizenship may be generous,<ref>{{cite web|title=British Nationality Act 1981|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61|publisher=The National Archives, United Kingdom|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> or larger immigrant quotas may be extended to former colonies.

In some cases, the former European imperial nations continue to foster close political and economic ties with former colonies. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] is an organization that promotes cooperation between and among Britain and its former colonies, the Commonwealth members. A similar organization exists for former colonies of France, the [[Francophonie]]; the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] plays a similar role for former Portuguese colonies, and the [[Dutch Language Union]] is the equivalent for former colonies of the Netherlands.

Migration from former colonies has proven to be problematic for European countries, where the majority population may express hostility to ethnic minorities who have immigrated from former colonies. Cultural and religious conflict have often erupted in France in recent decades, between immigrants from the [[Maghreb]] countries of north Africa and the majority population of France. Nonetheless, immigration has changed the ethnic composition of France; by the 1980s, 25% of the total population of "inner Paris" and 14% of the metropolitan region were of foreign origin, mainly Algerian.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seljuq|first=Affan|title=Cultural Conflicts: North African Immigrants in France|journal=The International Journal of Peace Studies|date=July 1997|volume= 2|issue= 2|issn=1085-7494|url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol2_2/seljuq.htm|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Florentinoviruela.JPG|thumb|Aztecs dying of smallpox, ("[[Florentine Codex|The Florentine Codex]]" 1540–85)]]

Encounters between explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced new diseases, which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence.<ref>Kenneth F. Kiple, ed.

Disease killed the entire native ([[Guanches]]) population of the [[Canary Islands]] in the 16th century. Half the native population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1518 was killed by [[smallpox]]. Smallpox also ravaged [[Mexico]] in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in [[Tenochtitlan]] alone, including the emperor, and [[Peru]] in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors.
