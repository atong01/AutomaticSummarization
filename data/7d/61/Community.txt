{{Community}}

A '''community''' is a [[Level of analysis#Meso-level|social unit]] of any size that shares common [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] or that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a village or town).  Although embodied or face-to-face communities are usually small, larger or more extended communities such as a [[nation]]al community, [[international community]] and [[virtual community]] are also studied. In [[human]] communities, [[intention|intent]], [[belief]], [[Natural resource|resources]], [[preference]]s, [[Need assessment|needs]], [[risk]]s, and a number of other conditions may be present and common, affecting the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.the main realistic meaning of a community is a group of people who connect well together socially, mentally or sometimes economically

Since the advent of the [[Internet]], the concept of community has less geographical limitation,  [[people]] can now gather virtually in an online community and share common interests regardless of physical location. Prior to the Internet, [[Virtual community|virtual communities]] (like social or academic organizations) were far more limited by the constraints of available communication and transportation technologies.

The word "community" is derived from the [[Old French]] ''comuneté'' which is derived from the [[Latin]] ''[[communitas]]'' (from Latin ''[[wikt:communis|communis]]'', things held in common), a broad term for fellowship or organized society.<ref>"community" Oxford Dictionaries.

==Perspectives from various disciplines==

===Sociology===
{{Sociology}}

====Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft====
{{Main|Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft}}

German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] distinguished between two types of human association: ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' (usually translated as "community") and ''[[Gesellschaft]]'' ("society" or "association"). In his 1887 work, ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Tönnies argued that ''Gemeinschaft'' is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a "unity of will."<ref>Tönnies, F. 1887. ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', p. 22.</ref> He added that [[family]] and [[kinship]] were the perfect expressions of ''Gemeinschaft'', but that other shared characteristics, such as place or belief, could also result in ''Gemeinschaft''. This paradigm of communal networks and shared social understanding has been applied to multiple cultures in many places throughout history.<ref>Messing, A. (2009). Panxenos: An outsider's sociology of self. ''Human Architecture'' 7.3, pp. 155-172. [http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20VII%203/Messing-FM.pdf]</ref> ''Gesellschaft'', on the other hand, is a group in which the individuals who make up that group are motivated to take part in the group purely by [[Selfishness|self-interest]]. He also proposed that in the real world, no group was either pure ''Gemeinschaft'' or pure ''Gesellschaft,'' but, rather, a mixture of the two.

====Social capital====
{{Main|Social capital}}

If community exists, both freedom and security may exist as well. The community then takes on a life of its own, as people become free enough to share and secure enough to get along. The sense of connectedness and formation of social networks comprise what has become known as '''[[social capital]]'''.<ref>Putnam, D. 2000. ''Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of the American Community,'' p. 19.</ref>

Social capital is defined by [[Robert D. Putnam]] as "the collective value of all [[social networks]] and species (who people know) and the inclinations that arise from these works to do things for each other (norms of reciprocity)."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/saguaro/primer.htm |title=SAGUARO SEMINAR - Civic Engagement in America |publisher=Hks.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080502020439/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/saguaro/primer.htm |archivedate = May 2, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Social capital in action can be seen in all sorts of groups, including neighbors keeping an eye on each other's homes. However, as Putnam notes in ''[[Bowling Alone|Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community]]'' (2000), social capital has been falling in the United States. Putnam found that over the past 25 years, attendance at club meetings has fallen 58 percent, family dinners are down 33 percent, and having friends visit has fallen 45 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bowlingalone.com/ |title=''Bowling Alone'' web site |publisher=Bowlingalone.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>

The same patterns are also evident in many other western countries. [[Western world|Western]] [[cultures]] are thus said to be losing the spirit of community that once were found in [[institutions]] including [[church (building)|churches]] and [[Community centre|community centers]]. [[Sociologist]] [[Ray Oldenburg]] states in ''[[The Great Good Place (Oldenburg)|The Great Good Place]]'' that people need three places: 1) the [[home]], 2) the [[office]], and, 3) the community hangout or [[gathering place]].<ref>Project for Public Spaces. 2006. [http://www.pps.org/info/placemakingtools/placemakers/roldenburg Ray Oldenburg].</ref> With this philosophy in mind, many [[grassroots]] efforts such as The [[Project for Public Spaces]] are being started to create this "[[Third Place]]" in communities. They are taking form in independent bookstores, coffeehouses, local pubs, and through new and innovative means to create the social capital needed to foster the sense and spirit of community.<ref>University of Florida. 2006. [http://usfcollab.usf.edu/PDF/socialcapital.pdf Social Capital in Tampa Bay: An Update Report].</ref>

===As a measure of religiosity===
According to the sociologist [[Mervin F. Verbit|Mervin Verbit]], community may be understood as one of the key components of religiosity. And communal involvement itself may be broken down into four dimensions:
*content
*frequency
*intensity
*centrality
The content of one's communal involvement may vary from person to person (or from one religious organization to the next), as will the degree of the person's participation (frequency), and the intensity and centrality of that involvement (for that person).<ref>Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. ''American Mosaic'', 24, 39.</ref><ref>Küçükcan, T. (2010).

====Community====
{{Main|Sense of community}}

In a seminal 1986 study, McMillan and Chavis identify four elements of "sense of community":
#membership,
#influence,
#integration and fulfillment of needs,
#shared emotional connection.

They give the following example of the interplay between these factors:

<blockquote>Someone puts an announcement on the dormitory bulletin board about the formation of an intramural dormitory basketball team. People attend the organizational meeting as strangers out of their individual needs (integration and fulfillment of needs). The team is bound by place of residence (membership boundaries are set) and spends time together in practice (the contact hypothesis). They play a game and win (successful shared valent event). While playing, members exert energy on behalf of the team (personal investment in the group). As the team continues to win, team members become recognized and congratulated (gaining honor and status for being members), Influencing new members to join and continue to do the same. Someone suggests that they all buy matching shirts and shoes (common symbols) and they do so (influence).<ref>McMillan, D.W., & Chavis, D.M. 1986. "Sense of community: A definition and theory," p. 16.</ref></blockquote>
[[File:Bigdayout crowd2.jpg|thumb|To what extent do participants in joint activities experience a [[sense of community]]?]]

A ''Sense of Community Index'' (SCI) has been developed by Chavis and colleagues and revised and adapted by others. Although originally designed to assess sense of community in neighborhoods, the index has been adapted for use in schools, the workplace, and a variety of types of communities.<ref>Perkins, D.D., Florin, P., Rich, R.C., Wandersman, A. & Chavis, D.M. (1990). Participation and the social and physical environment of residential blocks: Crime and community context. ''American Journal of Community Psychology'', 18, 83-115. Chipuer, H.

Studies conducted by the APPA show substantial evidence that young adults who feel a sense of belonging in a community, particularly small communities, develop fewer psychiatric and depressive disorders than those who do not have the feeling of love and belonging.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Anthropology===
[[Cultural anthropology|Cultural]] (or [[social anthropology|social]]) anthropology has traditionally looked at community through the lens of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] fieldwork and ethnography continues to be an important methodology for study of modern communities. Other anthropological approaches that deal with various aspects of community include [[cross-cultural studies]] and the [[anthropology of religion]]. Cultures in modern society are also studied in the fields of [[urban anthropology]], [[ethnic studies]], [[ecological anthropology]], and [[psychological anthropology]]. Since the 1990s, internet communities have increasingly been the subject of research in the emerging field of [[cyber anthropology]].

The group of people having same identity is called community, Anthropologist [[Rhone Ian B. Antonino]]

===Archaeology===
In [[Archaeology|archaeological studies]] of social communities the term "community" is used in two ways, paralleling usage in other areas. The first is an informal definition of community as a place where people used to live. In this sense it is synonymous with the concept of an ancient [[Human settlement|settlement]], whether a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]], [[village]], [[town]], or [[city]]. The second meaning is similar to the usage of the term in other [[social sciences]]: a community is a group of people living near one another who interact socially. [[Social interaction]] on a small scale can be difficult to identify with archaeological data. Most reconstructions of social communities by archaeologists rely on the principle that social interaction is conditioned by physical distance. Therefore, a small village settlement likely constituted a social community, and spatial subdivisions of cities and other large settlements may have formed communities. Archaeologists typically use similarities in [[material culture]]—from house types to styles of pottery—to reconstruct communities in the past. This is based on the assumption that people or households will share more similarities in the types and styles of their material goods with other members of a social community than they will with outsiders.<ref>Canuto, Marcello A. and Jason Yaeger (editors) (2000) ''The Archaeology of Communities''. Routledge, New York. Hegmon, Michelle (2002) Concepts of Community in Archaeological Research. In ''Seeking the Center: Archaeology and Ancient Communities in the Mesa Verde Region,'' edited by Mark D. Varien and Richard H. Wilshusen, pp. 263-279. University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City.</ref>

===Business and communications===

====Organizational communication====
{{Main|Organizational communication}}

Effective [[communication]] practices in group and organizational settings are very important to the formation and maintenance of communities. The ways that ideas and values are communicated within communities are important to the induction of new members, the formulation of agendas, the selection of leaders and many other aspects. Organizational communication is the study of how people communicate within an organizational context and the influences and interactions within [[organizational structure]]s. Group members depend on the flow of communication to establish their own identity within these structures and learn to function in the group setting. Although organizational communication, as a field of study, is usually geared toward companies and business groups, these may also be seen as communities. The principles of organizational communication can also be applied to other types of communities.

=== Internet Communities ===
Groups of people are complex, in ways that make those groups hard to form and hard to sustain; much of the shape of traditional institutions is a response to those difficulties. New social tools relieve some of those burdens, allowing for new kinds of group-forming, like using simple sharing to anchor the creation of new groups.

One simple form of cooperation, almost universal with social tools, is conversation; when people are in one another's company, even virtually, they like to talk. Conversation creates more of a sense of community than sharing does.

Collaborative production is a more involved form of cooperation, as it increases the tension between individual and group goals. The litmus test for collaborative production is simple: no one person can take credit for what gets created, and the project could not come into being without the participation of many.

An online community builds weaker bonds and allows users to be anonymous. [[Clay Shirky]], a researcher on digital media, states in reference to the audience of an online community, "An audience isn’t just a big community; it can be more anonymous, with many fewer ties among users. A community isn’t just a small audience either; it has a social density that audiences lack." The sites that offer online communities, like [[Myspace]], [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]],  [[Instagram]], [[Tumblr]], and [[Pinterest]] allow users to "stalk" their community and act anonymously.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Here Comes Everybody|last = Skirty|first = Clay|publisher = Penguin Group|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-59420-153-0|location = |pages = Chapter 2}}</ref>

===Ecology===
{{Main|Community (ecology)}}

In ecology, a community is an assemblage of populations of different species, interacting with one another. Community ecology is the branch of [[ecology]] that studies interactions between and among species. It considers how such interactions, along with interactions between species and the [[abiotic]] environment, affect community structure and species richness, diversity and patterns of abundance. Species interact in three ways: [[competition]], [[predation]] and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]. Competition typically results in a double negative—that is both species lose in the interaction. Predation is a win/lose situation with one species winning. Mutualism, on the other hand, involves both species cooperating in some way, with both winning.

===Public Administration===

Public administration is the province of local, state and federal governments, with local governments responsible for units in towns, cities, villages, and counties, among others. The most well known "community department" is housing and community development which has responsibility for both economic development initiatives, and  as public housing and community infrastructure (e.g., business development).

==Interdisciplinary perspectives==

===Socialization===
{{Main|Socialization}}
[[File:Lewes Bonfire, Martyrs Crosses.jpg|thumb|[[Lewes#Lewes Bonfire|Lewes Bonfire Night]] procession commemorating 17 Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake from 1555 to 1557]]

The process of learning to adopt the [[behavior]] patterns of the community is called [[socialization]]. The most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life, during which [[individual]]s develop the skills and knowledge and learn the [[role]]s necessary to function within their [[culture]] and [[social environment]].<ref name=Socialization>Newman, D. 2005. [http://www.pineforge.com/upm-data/9006_Chapter_5.pdf Chapter 5. "Building Identity: Socialization"] pp. 134-140.</ref> For some psychologists, especially those in the [[psychodynamic]] tradition, the most important period of socialization is between the ages of one and ten. But socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment, where they must learn a new set of behaviors.<ref>Newman, D. 2005, p. 141.</ref>

Socialization is influenced primarily by the family, through which children first learn community [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. Other important influences include schools, [[Peer group|peer]] groups, people, mass media, the workplace, and government. The degree to which the norms of a particular society or community are adopted determines one's willingness to engage with others. The norms of [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] are important "habits of the heart," as [[Alexis de Tocqueville|de Tocqueville]] put it, in an individual's involvement in community.<ref name = Community>Smith, M. 2001. [http://www.infed.org/community/community.htm Community].</ref>

==Community development==
{{Main|Community development}}

Community development is often linked with [[community work]] or community planning, and may involve stakeholders, foundations, governments, or contracted entities including [[non-government organisations]] (NGOs), universities or government agencies to progress the social well-being of local, regional and, sometimes, national communities. More grassroots efforts, called [[community building]] or [[community organizing]], seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities.<ref>Kelly, Anthony, "With Head, Heart and Hand: Dimensions of Community Building" (Boolarong Press)
ISBN 978-0-86439-076-9</ref> These skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups working for a common agenda. Community development practitioners must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions within the context of larger social institutions. Public administrators, in contrast, need to understand community development in the context of rural and urban development, housing and economic development, and community, organizational and business development.

Formal accredited programs conducted by universities, as part of degree granting institutions, are often used to build a knowledge base to drive curricula in public administration, sociology and [[community studies]]. The [[General Social Survey]] from the [[National Opinion Research Center]] at the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[Saguaro Seminar]] at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] are examples of national community development in the [[United States]]. The [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] at Syracuse University in New York State offers core courses in community and economic development, and in areas ranging from non-profit development to US budgeting (federal to local, community funds). In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Oxford University]] has led in providing extensive research in the field through its '' Community Development Journal,''<ref>[http://cdj.oxfordjournals.org/ Community Development Journal], Oxford University Press</ref> used worldwide by sociologists and community development practitioners.

At the intersection between community ''development'' and community ''building'' are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools. One example of this is the program of the Asset Based Community Development Institute of [[Northwestern University]]. The institute makes available downloadable tools<ref>ABCD Institute, in cooperation with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. 2006. [http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/abcd/kelloggabcd.htmll ''Discovering Community Power: A Guide to Mobilizing Local Assets and Your Organization's Capacity''].</ref> to assess community assets and make connections between [[Non-profit organization|non-profit groups]] and other organizations that can help in community building. The Institute focuses on helping communities develop by "mobilizing neighborhood assets"&nbsp;— building from the inside out rather than the outside in.<ref>ABCD Institute. 2006. [http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/abcd.html Welcome to ABCD].</ref> In the disability field, community building was prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s with roots in John McKnight's approaches.<ref>Lutfiyya, Z.M (1988, March).

===Community building and organizing===
[[File:Affinity group collateral damage.jpg|thumb|upright|The anti-war [[affinity group]] "Collateral Damage" [[Activism|protesting]] the [[Iraq war]]]]

In ''The Different Drum: Community-Making and Peace,'' [[M. Scott Peck|Scott Peck]] argues that the almost accidental sense of community that exists at times of crisis can be consciously built. Peck believes that conscious community building is a process of deliberate design based on the knowledge and application of certain rules.<ref>[[M. Scott Peck]], (1987). ''The Different Drum: Community-Making and Peace,'' pp. 83-85.</ref> He states that this process goes through four stages:<ref>Peck (1987), pp. 86-106.</ref>

# '''Pseudocommunity''': The beginning stage when people first come together.  This is the stage where people try to be ''nice'', and present what they feel are their most personable and friendly characteristics.
# '''Chaos''': When people move beyond the inauthenticity of pseudo-community and feel safe enough to present their "shadow" selves. This stage places great demands upon the facilitator for greater leadership and organization, but Peck believes that "organizations are not communities", and this pressure should be resisted.
# '''Emptiness''': This stage moves beyond the attempts to fix, heal and convert of the chaos stage, when all people become capable of acknowledging their own woundedness and brokenness, common to us all as human beings. Out of this emptiness comes...
# '''True community''': the process of deep respect and true listening for the needs of the other people in this community. This stage Peck believes can only be described as "glory" and reflects a deep yearning in every human soul for compassionate understanding from one's fellows.
More recently Peck remarked that building a sense of community is easy but maintaining this sense of community is difficult in the modern world.<ref>M. Scott Peck (1991). [http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC29/Peck.htm "The Joy of Community"]. An interview with M. Scott Peck by Alan Atkisson. ''In Context'' #29, p. 26.</ref> Community building can use a wide variety of practices, ranging from simple events such as [[potluck]]s and small [[Book discussion club|book clubs]] to larger-scale efforts such as mass [[festival]]s and [[construction]] projects that involve local participants rather than outside contractors.

Community building that is geared toward citizen action is usually termed "community organizing."<ref name = organizing>Walls, David (1994) [http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/community-organizing.shtml "Power to the People: Thirty-five Years of Community Organizing"]. From ''The Workbook'', Summer 1994, pp. 52-55. Retrieved on: June 22, 2008.</ref> In these cases, organized community groups seek accountability from elected officials and increased direct representation within decision-making bodies. Where good-faith negotiations fail, these constituency-led organizations seek to pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, [[boycott]]ing, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics. The [[ARISE Detroit!]] coalition and the [[Toronto Public Space Committee]] are examples of [[activism|activist networks]] committed to shielding local communities from government and corporate domination and inordinate influence.

Community organizing is sometimes focused on more than just resolving specific issues. Organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure, often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community. Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance. Such groups facilitate and encourage [[consensus decision-making]] with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group. The three basic types of community organizing are [[grassroots]] organizing, [[coalition]] building, and "institution-based community organizing," (also called "broad-based community organizing," an example of which is [[faith-based community|faith-based community organizing]], or [[Congregation-based Community Organizing]]).<ref>Jacoby Brown, Michael, (2006), ''Building Powerful Community Organizations: A Personal Guide To Creating Groups That Can Solve Problems and Change the World'' (Long Haul Press)</ref>

If communities are developed based on something they share in common, whether that be location or values, then one challenge for developing communities is how to incorporate individuality and differences. Indeed, as Rebekah Nathan suggests in her book, ''My Freshman Year'', we are actually drawn to developing communities totally based on sameness, despite stated commitments to diversity, such as those found on university websites. Nathan states that certain commonalities allow college students to cohere: "What holds students together, really, is age, pop culture, a handful of (recent) historical events, and getting a degree" (qtd. In Barrios 229). Universities may try to create community through all freshman reads, freshman seminars, and school pride; however, Nathan argues students will only form communities based on the attributes, such as age and pop culture, that they bring with them to college. Nathan's point, then, is that people come to college and don't expand their social horizons and cultural tolerance, which can prevent the development of your social community. (Barrios, Barclay. ''Emerging: Contemporary Readings for Writers''. New York: Bedford St. Martins, 2010.)

====Community currencies====
Some communities have developed their own "[[Local Exchange Trading Systems]]" (LETS)<ref>Local Exchange Trading Systems were first developed by [[Michael Linton]], in [[Courtenay, British Columbia|Courtenay, BC]], ''see'' [http://www.gmlets.u-net.com/explore/home.html "LETSystems - new money"]. Retrieved: 2006-08-01.</ref> and [[local currencies]], such as the [[Ithaca Hours]] system,<ref>The Ithaca Hours system, developed by [[Paul Glover]] is outlined in [http://www.ithacahours.com/intro.html "Creating Community Economics with Local Currency"]. Retrieved: 2006-08-01.</ref> to encourage economic growth and an enhanced sense of community. Community currencies have recently proven valuable in meeting the needs of people living in various South American nations, particularly Argentina, that recently suffered as a result of the collapse of the Argentinian national currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strohalm.net/en/site.php |title=Social Trade Organisation |publisher=Strohalm.net |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929083106/http://www.strohalm.net/en/site.php |archivedate = September 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

===Community services===
{{Main|Community service}}

[[Community services]] is a term that refers to a wide range of community institutions, governmental and non-governmental services, voluntary, third sector organizations, and grassroots and neighborhood efforts in local communities, towns, cities, and suburban-exurban areas. In line with governmental and community thinking, volunteering and unpaid services are often preferred (e.g., altruism, beneficence) to large and continued investments in infrastructure and community services personnel, with private-public partnerships often common.

[[Non-profit organizations]] from youth services, to family and neighborhood centers, recreation facilities, civic clubs, and employment, housing and poverty agencies are often the foundation of community services programs, but it may also be undertaken under the auspices of government (which funds all NGOs), one or more businesses, or by individuals or newly formed collaboratives. Community services is also the broad term given to health and human services in local communities and was specifically used as the framework for deinstitutionalization and [[community integration]] to homes, families and local communities (e.g., community residential services).<ref>Racino, J. (2014). ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US''. London and NY, NY: CRC Press.</ref>

In a broad discussion of community services, schools, hospitals, clinics, rehabilitation and criminal justice institutions also view themselves as community planners and decisionmakers together with governmental leadership (e.g., city and county offices, state-regional offices). However, while many community services are voluntary, some may be part of alternative [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] approaches in a [[justice system]] and it can be required by educational institutions as part of internships, employment training, and post-graduation plans.

Community services may be paid for through different revenue streams which include targeted federal funds, taxpayer contributions, state and local grants and contracts, voluntary donations, Medicaid or health care funds, community development block grants, targeted education funds, and so forth. In the 2000s, the business sector began to contract with government, and also consult on government policies, and has shifted the framework of community services to the for-profit domains.

However, by the 1990s, the call was to return to community and to go beyond community services to belonging, relationships, community building and welcoming new population groups and diversity in community life.<ref>McKnight, J. (1989). ''Beyond Community Services''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University.</ref><ref>O'Brien, J. & O'Brien, C.L. (1995). Building better communities: people with disabilites and their allies.

[[File:Community Circle at OUR Ecovillage.jpg|thumb|upright|Participants in Diana Leafe Christian's "Heart of a Healthy Community" seminar circle during an afternoon session at O.U.R. [[Ecovillage]]]]

A number of ways to categorize types of community have been proposed. One such breakdown is as follows:
# '''Location-based communities''': range from the local [[neighbourhood]], [[suburb]], [[village]], [[town]] or [[city]], region, nation or even the planet as a whole. These are also called '''communities of place'''.
# '''Identity-based communities''': range from the local clique, sub-culture, [[ethnic group]], [[religious]], [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] or [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] [[civilisation]], or the [[globalisation|global]] community cultures of today. They may be included as ''communities of need'' or ''identity'', such as [[disability|disabled persons]], or [[Senior Citizens|frail aged]] people.
# '''Organizationally based communities''': range from communities organized informally around [[family]] or [[Social network|network]]-based guilds and associations to more formal [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated associations]], [[politics|political]] [[decision making]] structures, [[economics|economic]] enterprises, or professional associations at a small, national or international scale.

The usual categorizations of community relations have a number of problems:<ref>Gerhard Delanty, Community, Routledge, London, 2003.</ref> 1. they tend to give the impression that a particular community can be defined as just this kind or another; 2. they tend to conflate modern and customary community relations; 3. they tend to take sociological categories such as ethnicity or race as given, forgetting that different ethnically defined persons live in different kinds of communities — grounded, interest-based, diasporic, etc.<ref>{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In—Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= http://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}</ref>

In response to these problems, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and his colleagues have developed a taxonomy that maps community relations, and recognizes that actual communities can be characterized by different kinds of relations at the same time:<ref>{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Nadarajah | first2= Yaso | last3= Haive | first3= Karen | last4= Stead | first4= Victoria | title= Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development: Other Paths for Papua New Guinea | url= http://www.academia.edu/3230875/Sustainable_Communities_Sustainable_Development_Other_Paths_for_Papua_New_Guinea_author_with_Nadarajah_Stead_and_Have_University_of_Hawaii_Press_Honolulu_2012 pdf download | year= 2012 | publisher= University of Hawaii Press | location= Honolulu }}</ref>

::1. '''Grounded community relations''' This involves enduring attachment to particular places and particular people. It is the dominant form taken by customary and [[tribal communities]]. In these kinds of communities, the land is fundamental to identity.

::2. '''Life-style community relations''' This involves giving give primacy to communities coming together around particular chosen ways of life, such as morally charged or interest-based relations or just living or working in the same location. Hence the following sub-forms:
::* community-life as morally bounded, a form taken by many traditional faith-based communities.
::* community-life as interest-based, including sporting, leisure-based and business communities which come together for regular moments of engagement.
::* community-life as proximately-related, where neighbourhood or commonality of association forms a community of convenience, or a [[community of place]] (see below).

::3. '''Projected community relations'''
::This is where a community is self-consciously treated as an entity to be projected and re-created. It can be projected as through thin advertising slogan, for example [[gated community]], or can take the form of ongoing associations of people who seek political integration, [[communities of practice]]<ref>Etienne Wenger, Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning and Identity, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.</ref> based on professional projects, associative communities which seek to enhance and support individual creativity, autonomy and mutuality. A [[nation]] is one of the largest forms of projected or [[imagined community]].

In these terms, communities can be nested and/or intersecting; one community can contain another—for example a location-based community may contain a number of ethnic communities.<ref>Tropman John E., Erlich, John L. and Rothman, Jack (2006), "Tactics and Techniques of Community Intervention" (Wadsworth Publishing)</ref> Both lists above can used in a cross-cutting matrix in relation to each other.

===Location===
{{Details|Community of place}}

Possibly the most common usage of the word ''"community"'' indicates a large group living in close proximity. Examples of [[local community]] include:
* A [[municipality]] is an administrative local area generally composed of a clearly defined territory and commonly referring to a [[town]] or [[village]].
[[Image:Wakefield common.jpg|thumb|[[Wakefield, Massachusetts]] is an example of a small town which constitutes a local community.]]
:Although large [[cities]] are also municipalities, they are often thought of as a collection of communities, due to their diversity.
* A [[neighborhood]] is a geographically localized community, often within a larger [[city]] or [[suburb]].
* A [[new town|planned community]] is one that was [[urban planning|designed]] from scratch and expanded more or less following the plan. Several of the world's [[Capital (political)|capital cities]] are planned cities, notably [[Washington, D.C.]], in the [[United States]], [[Canberra]] in [[Australia]], and [[Brasília]] in [[Brazil]]. It was also common during the [[European colonization of the Americas]] to build according to a plan either on fresh ground or on the ruins of earlier [[Amerindian]] cities. Community service is a free service.

===Identity===
{{Details|Community of interest}}

In some contexts, ''"community"'' indicates a group of people with a common identity other than location. Members often interact regularly. Common examples in everyday usage include:
* A "professional community" is a group of people with the same or related occupations. Some of those members may join a [[professional society]], making a more defined and formalized group. These are also sometimes known as [[Community of practice|communities of practice]].
* A [[virtual community]] is a [[group (sociology)|group]] of people primarily or initially communicating or interacting with each other by means of information technologies, typically over the [[Internet]], rather than in person. These may be either communities of interest, [[Virtual Community of Practice|practice]] or communion. Research interest is evolving in the [[motivations for contributing to online communities]].
* These communities are key to our modern day society, because we have the ability to share information with millions in a matter of seconds.

===Overlaps===
{{Details|Intentional community}}

Some communities share both location and other attributes. Members choose to live near each other because of one or more common interests.
* A [[retirement community]] is designated and at least usually designed for retirees and seniors—often restricted to those over a certain age, such as 56. It differs from a [[retirement home]], which is a single building or small complex, by having a number of autonomous households.
* An intentional community is a deliberate residential community with a much higher degree of social communication than other communities. The members of an intentional community typically hold a common social, political or spiritual vision and share responsibilities and resources. Intentional communities include [[Amish]] villages, [[ashrams]], [[cohousing]], [[commune (intentional community)|communes]], [[ecovillages]], [[housing cooperative]]s, [[kibbutzim]], and [[land trust]]s.

==Special nature of human community==
Definitions of community as "organisms inhabiting a common environment and interacting with one another,"<ref>Australian Academy of Science. [http://www.science.org.au/nova/010/010glo.htm Nova: Science in the News]. Retrieved: 2006-07-21.</ref> while scientifically accurate, do not convey the richness, diversity and complexity of human communities. Their classification, likewise is almost never precise. Untidy as it may be, community is vital for humans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[M. Scott Peck]] expresses this in the following way: "There can be no vulnerability without risk; there can be no community without vulnerability; there can be no peace, and ultimately no life, without community."<ref>Peck (1987), p. 233.</ref>
