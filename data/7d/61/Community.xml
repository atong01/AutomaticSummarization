Most reconstructions of social communities by archaeologists rely on the principle that social interaction is conditioned by physical distance. Therefore, a small village settlement likely constituted a social community, and spatial subdivisions of cities and other large settlements may have formed communities. Archaeologists typically use similarities in<space/><link><target>material culture</target></link>from house types to styles of potteryto reconstruct communities in the past. This is based on the assumption that people or households will share more similarities in the types and styles of their material goods with other members of a social community than they will with outsiders.<extension extension_name='ref'>Canuto, Marcello A. and Jason Yaeger (editors) (2000)<space/><italics>The Archaeology of Communities</italics>.

Organizational communication is the study of how people communicate within an organizational context and the influences and interactions within<space/><link><target>organizational structure</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Group members depend on the flow of communication to establish their own identity within these structures and learn to function in the group setting.

Indeed, as Rebekah Nathan suggests in her book,<space/><italics>My Freshman Year</italics>, we are actually drawn to developing communities totally based on sameness, despite stated commitments to diversity, such as those found on university websites. Nathan states that certain commonalities allow college students to cohere: &quot;What holds students together, really, is age, pop culture, a handful of (recent) historical events, and getting a degree&quot; (qtd. In Barrios 229). Universities may try to create community through all freshman reads, freshman seminars, and school pride; however, Nathan argues students will only form communities based on the attributes, such as age and pop culture, that they bring with them to college. Nathan's point, then, is that people come to college and don't expand their social horizons and cultural tolerance, which can prevent the development of your social community.
