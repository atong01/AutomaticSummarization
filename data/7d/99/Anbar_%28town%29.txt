'''Anbar''' ('''{{lang|ar|الأنبار}}''') was a town in [[Iraq]], at lat. 33 deg.  22' N., long. 43 deg.  49' E, on the east bank of the [[Euphrates]], just south of the Nahr 'Isa, or Sakhlawieh [[canal]], the northernmost of the canals connecting that river with the [[Tigris]].

==History==
Anbar was originally called '''Pērōz-Šāpūr''' or '''Pērōz-Šābuhr''' (from {{lang-pal|𐭯𐭥𐭩𐭥𐭦𐭱𐭧𐭯𐭥𐭧𐭥𐭩}}, meaning "Victorious Shapur"; in {{lang-xpr|𐭐𐭓𐭂𐭅𐭆𐭔𐭇𐭐𐭅𐭇𐭓}} ''prgwzšhypwhr''; in {{lang-arc|פירוז שבור}}), and became known as '''Perisapora''' or '''Pirisabora''' to the Greeks and Romans. The city was founded ca. 350 by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persian]] king [[Shapur II]], and located in the Sassanid province of [[Asōristān]]. Perisapora was sacked and burned by Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in April 363, during [[Julian's Persian expedition|his invasion]] of the [[Sassanid Empire]].<ref>G. W. Bowersock, ''Julian the Apostate'', (Harvard University Press, 1978), 112.</ref>  The town became a refuge for the [[Arab]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Jew]]ish colonies of that region.{{sfn|Peters|1911}} According to medieval Arabic sources, most of the inhabitants of the town migrated north to find the city of [[Hdatta]] south of [[Mosul]].<ref name=EOI>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Lewis | first = Bernard | authorlink = Bernard Lewis | editor = Hertzfeld, E | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam | isbn = 9789004081185 | title = Ḥadīt̲a  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=d9JSXwAACAAJ | accessdate = 12 October 2012 | edition = Second | year = 1986 | publisher = BRILL | volume = 3 | pages = 29 }}</ref>

Anbar was adjacent or identical to the [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism|Babylonian Jewish]]  center of [[Nehardea]] ({{lang-arc|נהרדעא}}), and lies a short distance from the present-day town of [[Fallujah]], formerly the [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism|Babylonian Jewish]] center of [[Pumbeditha]] ({{lang-arc|פומבדיתא}}).

The name of the town was then changed to ''Anbar'' ([[Middle Persian]] word for "[[granaries]]"). [[As-Saffah|Abu al-Abbas as-Saffah]], the founder of the [[Abbasid]] caliphate, made it his capital, and such it remained until the founding of [[Baghdad]] in 762. 
It continued to be a place of much importance throughout the Abbasid period.{{sfn|Peters|1911}}

Anbar used to host an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] community from the fifth century: the town was the seat of a bishopric of the [[Church of the East]]. The names of 14 of its bishops of the period 486–1074 are known, three of whom became patriarchs.<ref>Michel Lequien, [http://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 1171-1174</ref> No longer a residential bishopric, Anbar is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]] of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ISBN 978-88-209-9070-1), p. 832</ref>

==Today==
It is now entirely deserted, occupied only by mounds of ruins, whose great number indicate the city's former importance.{{sfn|Peters|1911}}
