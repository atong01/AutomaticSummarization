The Latin letter 'E' differs little from its derivational source, the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[epsilon]], 'Œï'. In [[etymology]], the [[Semitic]] ''[[He (letter)|h√™]]''&#160; has been suggested to have started as a praying or calling human figure (''[[hillul]]'' 'jubilation'), and was probably based on a similar [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] that indicated a different pronunciation. In Semitic, the letter represented {{IPA|/h/}} (and {{IPA|/e/}} in foreign words); in Greek, ''h√™'' became the letter epsilon, used to represent {{IPA|/e/}}.  [[Etruria|Etruscan]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] followed this usage.

==Use in writing systems==

===English===
Although [[Middle English]] spelling used {{angbr|e}} to represent long and short /e/, the [[Great Vowel Shift]] changed long /eÀê/ (as in 'me' or 'bee') to /iÀê/ while short /e/ (as in 'met' or 'bed') remained a [[mid vowel]]. In other cases, the letter is [[Silent_e|silent]], generally at the end of words.

===Other languages===
In the orthography of many languages it represents either these or /{{IPA link|…õ}}/, or some variation (such as a [[Nasal vowel|nasalized]] version) of these sounds, often with diacritics (as: {{angle bracket|e [[√™]] [[√©]] [[√®]] [[√´]] [[ƒì]] [[ƒï]] [[ƒõ]] [[·∫Ω]] [[ƒó]] [[·∫π]] [[ƒô]] [[·∫ª]]}}) to indicate contrasts.  Less commonly, as in Saanich, {{angbr|e}} represents a [[mid-central vowel]] /…ô/. [[Digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]] with {{angbr|e}} are common to indicate either [[diphthong]]s or [[monophthong]]s, such as {{angbr|ea}} or {{angbr|ee}} for {{IPA|/iÀê/}} or {{IPA|/e…™/}} in English, {{angbr|ei}} for {{IPA|/a…™/}} in [[German language|German]], and {{angbr|eu}} for {{IPA|/√∏/}} in [[French language|French]] or {{IPA|/…î…™/}} in German.

===Other systems===
The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] uses {{angbr|{{IPA|e}}}} for the [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] or the [[mid front unrounded vowel]].

==Most common letter==
'E' is the most common (or highest-[[Frequency (statistics)|frequency]]) letter in the English alphabet (starting off the typographer's phrase [[ETAOIN SHRDLU]]) and several other European [[languages]], which has implications in both [[cryptography]] and [[data compression]]. In the story [[The Gold Bug]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], a character figures out a random character code by remembering that the most used letter in English is E. This makes it a hard and popular letter to use when writing [[lipogram]]s. [[Ernest Vincent Wright]]'s ''[[Gadsby (novel)|Gadsby]]'' (1939) is considered a "dreadful" novel, and supposedly "at least part of Wright's narrative issues were caused by language limitations imposed by the lack of ''E''."<ref>Ross Eckler, ''Making the Alphabet Dance: Recreational Word Play''. New York: St. Martin's Press (1996): 3</ref> Both [[Georges Perec]]'s novel ''[[A Void (novel)|A Void]]'' (''La Disparition'') (1969) and its English translation by Gilbert Adair omit 'e' and are considered better works.<ref>Eckler (1996): 3. Perec's novel "was so well written that at least some reviewers never realized the existence of a letter constraint."</ref>
