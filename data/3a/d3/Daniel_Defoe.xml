By September 1706, Harley ordered Defoe to<space/><link><target>Edinburgh</target></link><space/>as a secret agent to do everything possible to help secure acquiescence in the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Union</target></link>.

Some of his pamphlets were purported to be written by Scots, misleading even reputable historians into quoting them as evidence of Scottish opinion of the time. The same is true of a massive history of the Union which Defoe published in 1709 and which some historians still treat as a valuable contemporary source for their own works.
