==History==
The school was founded in 1949 under the name '''United Baptist Bible Training School''' (UBBTS), and served as both a [[secondary school]] and a Bible school. Over two decades, the focus of the school gradually shifted toward post-secondary programs. In 1968, UBBTS became a Bible and junior Christian liberal arts college, and in 1970 the name was changed to '''Atlantic Baptist College''' (ABC). A sustained campaign to expand the school's faculty and improve the level of education resulted in ABC being able to grant full [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees in 1983.<ref>http://www.crandallu.ca/cu/history Crandall University - History</ref> Its campus at this time was located along the Salisbury Road, west of [[Moncton]]'s central business district.

The institution moved to a new campus constructed on the Gorge Road, north of the central business district, in 1996. The name was also changed to '''Atlantic Baptist University''', a reflection of expanded student enrollment and academic accreditation. ABU sports teams play under the name ''Blue Tide''. The institution was the first, and thus far only, [[English language|English]] university in Moncton. The ''Atlantic Baptist University Act'' was passed by the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] in 2008.<ref>http://www.gnb.ca/legis/bill/FILE/56/2/Bill-64-e.htm Atlantic Baptist University Act</ref>

On August 21, 2009 it was announced that the institution had changed its name to '''Crandall University''' in honour of Rev. [[Joseph Crandall]], a pioneering Baptist minister in New Brunswick.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2009/08/21/nb-atlantic-baptist-university-crandall-557.html Atlantic Baptist University changes name</ref> In conjunction with the University name change, Crandall Athletics took on a new identity as "The Crandall Chargers."

In 2012, Crandall University came under public scrutiny for receiving municipal funds regardless of having an anti-gay hiring policy.<ref name="thestar.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/06/01/new_brunswick_university_under_fire_for_antigay_hiring_policy.html|title=New Brunswick university under fire for anti-gay hiring policy|date=1 June 2012|work=thestar.com|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2012/05/31/nb-crandall-hiring-policy-205.html|title=Crandall University defends anti-gay hiring policy|date=31 May 2012|work=cbc.ca|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>

==Controversy==
The University has been criticized for accepting public money (municipal, provincial and federal) to fund programs and expansions to the campus but maintaining a hiring policy which would prohibit gay faculty.<ref name="thestar.com"/> A year after the controversy erupted, the University opted to not apply for $150,000 in public funding that it had received annually in order to avoid changing its hiring policy.<ref name="CBC_Controversy_1">{{Citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2013/02/05/nb-crandall-university-funding-709.html |title=Crandall University drops request for city funding |newspaper= CBC.ca|date=2013-02-05|accessdate=2013-04-06}}</ref>
