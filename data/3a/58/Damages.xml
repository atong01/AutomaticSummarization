In English law solicitors like to call personal injury claims as general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenity (PSLA). Solicitors quantify personal injury claims by reference to previous awards made by the courts which are similar to the case in hand. The guidance solicitors will take into account to help quantify general damages are as hereunder:</paragraph><paragraph><bold>1	The age of the client</bold></paragraph><paragraph>The age of the client is important especially when dealing with fatal accident claims or permanent injuries. The younger the injured victim with a permanent injury the longer that person has to live with the PSLA. As a consequence, the greater the compensation payment. In fatal accident claims, generally the younger deceased, the greater the dependency claim by the partner and children.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>2	The nature and extent of the injuries sustained.</bold></paragraph><paragraph>Solicitors will consider like for like injuries with the case in hand and similar cases decided by the courts previously. These cases are known as precedents. Generally speaking decisions from the higher courts will bind the lower courts. Therefore, judgments from the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal have greater authority than the lower courts such as the High Court and the County Court. A compensation award can only be right or wrong with reference to previous judgments. Sometimes it is a matter of opinion of how much an injury claim is worth and the skill of the solicitor is persuading the opponent and ultimately the judge that their assessment is right.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2009</arg></template><space/>Solicitors must be careful when looking at older cases when quantifying a claim to ensure that the award is brought up to date and to take into account the court of appeal case in<space/><link><target>Heil v Rankin</target></link><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite BAILII</target><arg name="litigants"><space/>Heil v Rankin & Another<space/></arg><arg name="link"><space/></arg><arg name="country"><space/></arg><arg name="court"><space/>EWCA<space/></arg><arg name="division"><space/>Civ<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>2000<space/></arg><arg name="num"><space/>84<space/></arg><arg name="para"><space/></arg><arg name="eucase"><space/></arg><arg name="parallelcite"><space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="courtname"><space/>[[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]<space/></arg><arg name="juris"><space/></arg></template></extension><space/>Generally speaking the greater the injury the greater the damages awarded.</paragraph><paragraph>A quick guide to assess personal injury claims is by reference to the<space/><link><target>Judicial Studies Board Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases</target></link><space/><link type='external' href='http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199595334.do'></link>. Some case examples can also be considered<space/><link type='external' href='http://workaccidents.org.uk/compensation-claims/'></link></paragraph><paragraph><bold>3	Gender of the client</bold></paragraph><paragraph>Generally speaking damages for personal injury for males and females are the same. However where there can be a difference weighted in favour of females is where the injury results in permanent scarring to the skin. Where the scarring is clearly visible such as the face, legs, and arms, females will usually obtain a greater amount of compensation than males. The compensation reflects the general assumption that females will be affected more than males by scarring and thus will be awarded more. However each case will be decided on its own particular facts. For instance a male model who sustains a scarring tissue to his face may obtain just as much as a female.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">October 2010</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><bold>4	Personal attributes and fortitude of the client</bold></paragraph><paragraph>This heading is inextricably linked with the other points above. Where two clients are of the same age, experience and suffer the same injury, it does not necessarily mean that they will be affected the same. We are all different. Some people will recover more quickly than others. The courts will assess each claim on its own particular facts and therefore if one claimant recovers more quickly than another, the damages will be reflected accordingly. It is important to note here that psychological injuries may also follow from an accident which may increase the quantum of damages.</paragraph><paragraph>When a personal injury claim is settled either in court or out of court, the most common way the compensation payment is made is by a lump sum award in full and final settlement of the claim. Once accepted there can be no further award for compensation at a later time unless the claim is settled by provisional damages often found in industrial injury claims such as asbestos related injuries.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Special damages</heading><paragraph><italics>Special damages</italics><space/>compensate the claimant for the quantifiable monetary losses suffered by the plaintiff.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">April 2010</arg></template><space/>For example, extra costs, repair or replacement of damaged property, lost earnings (both historically and in the future), loss of irreplaceable items, additional domestic costs, and so on. They are seen in both personal and commercial actions.</paragraph><paragraph>Special damages can include direct losses (such as amounts the claimant had to spend to try to<space/><link><target>migiration (law)</target><part>mitigate</part></link><extension extension_name='ref'>There is a duty to mitigate losses<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.trans-lex.org/949000'>Trans-Lex.org</link></extension><space/>problems) and consequential or economic losses resulting from lost profits in a business. Special damages basically include the compensatory and punitive damages for the tort committed in lieu of the injury or harm to the plaintiff.</paragraph><paragraph>Damages in tort are awarded generally to place the claimant in the position in which he would have been had the tort not taken place. Damages for breach of contract are generally awarded to place the claimant in the position in which he would have been had the contract not been breached. This can often result in a different measure of damages. In cases where it is possible to frame a claim in either contract or tort, it is necessary to be aware of what gives the best outcome.</paragraph><paragraph>If the transaction was a &quot;good bargain,&quot; contract generally gives a better result for the claimant.</paragraph><paragraph>As an example, Neal agrees to sell Mary an antique Rolex for 100. In fact the watch is a fake and worth only 50. If it had been a genuine antique Rolex, it would have been worth 500. Neal is in breach of contract and could be sued. In contract, Mary is entitled to an item worth 500, but she has only one worth 50. Her damages are 450. Neal also induced Mary to enter into the contract through a misrepresentation (a tort). If Mary sues in tort, she is entitled to damages that put herself back to the same financial position place she would have been in had the misrepresentation not been made. She would clearly not have entered into the contract knowing the watch was fake, and is entitled to her 100 back. Thus her damages in tort are 100. (However, she would have to return the watch, or else her damages would be 50.)</paragraph><paragraph>If the transaction were a &quot;bad bargain&quot;, tort gives a better result for the claimant. If in the above example Mary had overpaid, paying 750 for the watch, her damages in contract would still be 450 (giving him the item he contracted to buy), however in tort damages are 700. This is because damages in tort put her in the position she would have been in had the tort not taken place, and are calculated as her money back (750) less the value of what she actually got (50).</paragraph><heading level='2'>Various matters</heading><paragraph><template><target>Judicial remedies</target></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Incidental and consequential losses</heading><paragraph>Special damages are sometimes divided into<space/><link><target>incidental damages</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>consequential damages</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Incidental losses include the costs needed to remedy problems and put things right. The largest element is likely to be the reinstatement of property damage. Take for example a factory which was burnt down by the negligence of a contractor. The claimant would be entitled to the direct costs required to rebuild the factory and replace the damaged machinery.</paragraph><paragraph>The claimant may also be entitled to any consequential losses. These may include the lost profits that the claimant could have been expected to make in the period whilst the factory was closed and rebuilt.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Proximate cause</heading><paragraph>Recovery of damages is subject to the legal principle that damages must be proximately caused by the wrongful conduct of the defendant. This is known as the principle of proximate cause. This principle governs the recovery of all compensatory damages, whether the underlying claim is based on contract, tort, or both.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Brinig</arg><arg name="first">Brian P., JD, CPA<space/></arg><arg name="title">Finance & Accounting for Lawyers</arg><arg name="year">2011</arg><arg name="publisher">BV Resources, LLC</arg><arg name="location">Portland, OR</arg><arg name="isbn">978-1-935081-71-5</arg><arg name="pages">200</arg><arg name="url">http://www.BVResources.com</arg></template></extension><space/>Damages are likely to be limited to those reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.
