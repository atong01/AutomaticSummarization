The first civilization that developed within the city's sphere of influence is referred to as [[Punic]] (a form of the word "Phoenician") or Carthaginian. The city of Carthage is located on the eastern side of [[Lake Tunis]] across from the centre of [[Tunis]]. According to Greek historians, Carthage was founded by [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]]-speaking [[Phoenicia]]n colonists from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] (in modern [[Lebanon]]) under the leadership of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Elissa or Dido]]. It became a large and rich city and thus a major power in the Mediterranean. The resulting rivalry with [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Numidia]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] was accompanied by several wars with respective invasions of each other's homeland.

[[Hannibal]]'s invasion of Italy in the [[Second Punic War]] culminated in the Carthaginian [[Battle of Cannae|victory at Cannae]] and led to a serious threat to the continuation of Roman rule over Italy; however, the Romans gained the upper hand by invading Africa and defeating Carthage at the [[Battle of Zama]] in 202&nbsp;BC. Following the [[Third Punic War]], the city was destroyed by the Romans in 146&nbsp;BC. However, the Romans refounded Carthage, which became the empire's fourth most important city and the second most important city in the [[Latin West]]. It later became the capital of the short-lived [[Vandals#Kingdom in North Africa|Vandal kingdom]]. After its conquest by [[Belisarius]], it remained of the most important cities until the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Muslim conquest]], when it was destroyed a second time in 698.

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote extensively on Carthaginian politics, and he considered the city to have some of the best governing institutions in the world, along with those of the Greek states of [[Sparta]] and [[Crete]].<ref>[http://books.google.nl/books?id=SSXJtdBL2PoC&pg=PA47&dq=aristotle+phoenicians&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=ixgnU4jKPOOw4QSFyoCgCQ&ved=0CGAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=aristotle%20phoenicians&f=false Aristotle and Hamilton (p. 43)]</ref><ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/aristotle-carthage.asp Constitution of Carthage]</ref><ref>http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/AriCar.html</ref>

==Topography==
Carthage was built on a [[promontory]] with sea inlets to the north and the south. The city's location made it master of the Mediterranean's maritime trade. All ships crossing the sea had to pass between [[Sicily]] and the coast of Tunisia, where Carthage was built, affording it great power and influence.

[[File:Carthage, Tunisia EO-1.jpg|left|[[Earth Observing-1|EO-1]]|thumb|260px]]
Two large, artificial harbors were built within the city, one for harboring the city's massive navy of 220 warships and the other for mercantile trade. A walled tower overlooked both harbours.

The city had massive walls, {{convert|23|mi|0|abbr=out|disp=flip}} in length, longer than the walls of comparable cities. Most of the walls were located on the shore and thus could be less impressive, as Carthaginian control of the sea made attack from that direction difficult. The {{convert|2.5|to|3|mi|1|abbr=out|disp=flip}} of wall on the [[isthmus]] to the west were truly massive and were never penetrated.

The city had a huge [[necropolis]] or burial ground, religious area, market places, council house, towers and a theater and was divided into four equally sized residential areas with the same layout. Roughly in the middle of the city stood a high citadel called the [[Byrsa]].

Carthage was one of the largest cities in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] times and was among the largest cities in pre-industrial history. Whereas by 14 A.D. Rome had at least 750,000 inhabitants, and in the following century may have reached 1 million, the cities of Alexandria, Antioch, and Carthage numbered only a few hundred thousand or less.<ref name="CharlesworthEdwards2000">{{cite book|author1=Martin Percival Charlesworth|author2=Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards|author3=John Boardman|author4=Frank William Walbank|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: The fourth century B.C., 2nd ed., 1994|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WgHhAAAAMAAJ&dq="Rome+was+larger"|year=2000|publisher=University Press|page=813}}</ref> According to the not always reliable history of [[Herodian]], Carthage rivaled Alexandria for second place in the Roman empire.<ref name="Grant2004">{{cite book|author=Robert McQueen Grant|title=Augustus to Constantine: The Rise and Triumph of Christianity in the Roman World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d_vxEB7nT_QC&pg=PP54|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22772-2|pages=54‚Äì}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Carthage}}

[[File:Carthage.png|thumb|Layout of the city.]]
The historical study of Carthage is difficult because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the [[Third Punic War]] and few primary Carthaginian [[primary source|historical sources]] survived. While there are few ancient translations of [[Punic]] texts into Greek and Latin, inscriptions remain on monuments and buildings discovered in North Africa, the main sources are [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historians, including [[Livy]], [[Polybius]], [[Appian]], [[Cornelius Nepos]], [[Silius Italicus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Dio Cassius]] and [[Herodotus]].<ref>{{cite web

===Foundation legends===

====Queen Elissa (Dido)====
[[File:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|Carthage]]
According to Roman sources, [[Phoenicia]]n colonists from modern-day [[Lebanon]], led by [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido]] (Elissa), founded Carthage (c. 814 B.C.).<ref name="Moscati2001">{{cite book|author=Sabatino Moscati|title=The Phoenicians|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1EEtmT9Tbj4C&pg=PA654|date=January 2001|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-85043-533-4|page=654}}</ref> Queen Elissa (also known as "Alissar") was an exiled princess of the ancient Phoenician city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. At its peak,  the metropolis she founded, Carthage, came to be called the "shining city," ruling 300 other cities around the western [[Mediterranean]] and leading the [[Phoenicia]]n (or Punic) world.

Elissa's brother, King [[Pygmalion of Tyre]], had murdered her husband, the high priest. Elissa escaped the tyranny of her own country, founding the "new city" of Carthage and subsequently its later dominions. Details of her life are sketchy and confusing, but the following can be deduced from various sources. According to [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], Princess Elissa was the daughter of King Belus II of Tyre. When he died, the throne was jointly bequeathed to her and her brother, Pygmalion. She married her uncle [[Acherbas]] (also known as [[Sychaeus]]), the High Priest of [[Melqart]], a man with both authority and wealth comparable to the king. This led to increased rivalry between [[religion and politics|religion and the monarchy]]. Pygmalion was a tyrant, lover of both gold and intrigue, who desired the authority and fortune enjoyed by Acherbas.<ref name="Aubet2001">{{cite book|author=Maria Eugenia Aubet|title=The Phoenicians and the West: Politics, Colonies and Trade|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B7SLWT2vpNcC&pg=PA215|date=6 September 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79543-2|page=215}}</ref> Pygmalion assassinated Acherbas in the temple and kept the misdeed concealed from his sister for a long time, deceiving her with lies about her husband's death. At the same time, the people of Tyre called for a single sovereign.

=====Virgil's Aeneid=====
In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] epic of Virgil, the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido]], the Greek name for Queen Elissa, is first introduced as an extremely respected character. In just seven years, since their exodus from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], the Carthaginians have rebuilt a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Her character is perceived by Virgil as even more noble when she offers asylum to [[Aeneas]] and his men, who have recently escaped from [[Troy]]. A spirit in the form of the messenger god, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], sent by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], reminds Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love, Dido, but to sail to Italy to found Rome. Virgil ends his legend of Dido with the story that, when Aeneas tells Dido, her heart broken, she orders a [[pyre]] to be built where she falls upon Aeneas' sword. As she lay dying, she predicted eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own: "rise up from my bones, avenging spirit" (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) she says, an invocation of [[Hannibal]]. The details of Virgil's story do not, however, form part of the original legend and are significant mainly as an indication of Rome's attitude towards the city she had destroyed, exemplified by [[Cato the Elder]]'s much-repeated utterance, "''[[Carthago delenda est]]''", "Carthage must be destroyed."<ref>Carthage and the Carthaginians, R Bosworth Smithp16</ref>

===Carthaginian Republic===
{{Main|Carthaginian Republic}}
[[File:CarthageMap.png|thumb|Carthaginian-held territory in the early 3rd century BC]]
The Carthaginian Republic was one of the longest-lived and largest states in the ancient Mediterranean. Reports relay several wars with [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] and finally, [[Rome]], which eventually resulted in the defeat and destruction of Carthage in the third Punic war. The Carthaginians were [[Semitic]] [[Phoenicia]]n settlers originating in the [[Mediterranean]] coast of the [[Near East]]. They spoke [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] and followed a predominantly [[Canaanite religion]].

====Army====
{{Main|Military of ancient Carthage}}
According to Polybius, Carthage relied heavily, though not exclusively, on foreign mercenaries,<ref>Polybius, Book 6, 52. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234&query=head%3D%23524 On the ''Perseus'' project]</ref> especially in overseas warfare. The core of its army was from its own territory in north Africa (ethnic [[Libyans]] and [[Numidians]] (modern northern [[Algeria]]), as well as "Liby-Phoenicians"‚Äîi.e., [[Phoenicians]] proper). These troops were supported by mercenaries from different ethnic groups and geographic locations across the Mediterranean who fought in their own national units; [[Celt]]ic, [[Balearic Islands|Balearic]], and [[Iberians|Iberian]] troops were especially common. Later, after the [[Barcid]] conquest of Iberia (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]), [[Iberians]] came to form an even greater part of the Carthaginian forces. Carthage seems to have fielded a formidable cavalry force, especially in its North African homeland; a significant part of it was composed of Numidian contingents of [[Numidian cavalry|light cavalry]]. Other mounted troops included [[North African elephant]]s (now extinct), trained for war, which, among other uses, were commonly used for frontal assaults or as anti-cavalry protection. An army could field up to several hundred of these animals but on most reported occasions fewer than a hundred were deployed. The riders of these elephants were armed with a spike and hammer to kill the elephants, in case they charged toward their own army.

====Navy====
[[File:Romtrireme.jpg|thumb|Roman [[trireme]] mosaic from Sousse, [[Sousse Archaeological Museum]], [[Sousse]].]]
The navy of Carthage was one of the largest in the [[Mediterranean]], using [[serial production]] to maintain high numbers at moderate cost. The sailors and [[marine (military)|marines]] of the Carthaginian navy were predominantly recruited from the [[Phoenicia]]n citizenry, unlike the multi-ethnic allied and [[mercenary]] troops of the Carthaginian armies. The navy offered a stable profession and financial security for its sailors. This helped to contribute to the city's political stability, since the unemployed, debt-ridden poor in other cities were frequently inclined to support revolutionary leaders in the hope of improving their own lot.<ref>Adrian Goldsworthy&nbsp;‚Äì The Fall of Carthage</ref> The reputation of her skilled sailors implies that there was in peacetime a training of oarsmen and coxswains, giving their navy a cutting edge in naval matters.

The trade of Carthaginian merchantmen was by land across the [[Sahara]] and especially by sea throughout the [[Mediterranean]] and far into the [[Atlantic]] to the tin-rich [[Cassiterides]],<ref>[[Iain Stewart (geologist)|Professor Iain Stewart]], BBC series "How the Earth Made Us", episode 1: Deep Earth (2010)</ref> and also to North West Africa. There is evidence that at least one Punic expedition, that of [[Hanno the Navigator|Hanno]], may have sailed along the West African coast to regions south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]].<ref name="Encyclopedia.2011">{{cite book|author=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|title=World Exploration From Ancient Times|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jfmcAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|date=1 February 2011|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|isbn=978-1-61535-455-9|page=63}}</ref>

[[Polybius]] wrote in the sixth book of his History that the Carthaginians were "more exercised in maritime affairs than any other people."<ref>Polybius, History Book 6</ref> Their navy included some 300 to 350 warships. The Romans, who had little experience in naval warfare prior to the [[First Punic War]], managed to finally defeat Carthage with a combination of reverse engineering captured Carthaginian ships, recruitment of experienced [[Greeks|Greek]] sailors from the ranks of its conquered cities, the unorthodox [[Corvus (weapon)|corvus]] device, and their superior numbers in marines and rowers. In the [[Third Punic War]] Polybius describes a tactical innovation of the Carthaginians, augmenting their few triremes with small vessels that carried hooks (to attack the oars) and fire (to attack the hulls). With this new combination, they were able to stand their ground against the numerically superior Roman for a whole day.

====Fall====
[[File:Tunisie Carthage Ruines 08.JPG|right|thumb|Ruins of Carthage]]
The fall of Carthage came at the end of the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC at the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]].<ref>''Wine: The 8,000-Year-Old Story of the Wine Trade'', Thomas Pellechia (2006)</ref> Despite initial devastating Roman naval losses and Rome's recovery from the brink of defeat after the terror of a 15-year occupation of much of Italy by [[Hannibal]], the end of the series of wars resulted in the end of Carthaginian power and the complete destruction of the city by [[Scipio Aemilianus]]. The Romans pulled the Phoenician warships out into the harbour and burned them before the city, and went from house to house, capturing and enslaving the people. Fifty thousand Carthaginians were sold into [[slavery in ancient Rome|slavery]].<ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001198.html Ancient History]</ref> The city was set ablaze and razed to the ground, leaving only ruins and rubble. After the fall of Carthage, Rome annexed the majority of the Carthaginian colonies, including other North African locations such as [[Volubilis]], [[Lixus (ancient city)|Lixus]], [[Chellah]], and [[Mogador]].<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 C. Michael Hogan (2007) ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. by A. Burnham]</ref> The legend that the city was [[Salting the earth|sown with salt]] remains widely accepted despite lacking evidence among ancient historical accounts;<ref name="Carthage 1988 pp. 308">B. H. Warmington "The Destruction of Carthage, A Retratatio", ''Classical Philology'' '''83''':4 (1988). pp. 308‚Äì10</ref> R.T. Ridley found that the earliest such claim is attributed to B.L. Hallward's chapter in Cambridge Ancient History, published in 1930. Ridley contended that Hallward's claim may have gained traction due to historical evidence of other salted-earth instances such as [[Abimelech]]'s salting of [[Shechem]] in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 9:45.<ref>R.T. Ridley, "To Be Taken with a Pinch of Salt: The Destruction of Carthage", ''Classical Philology'' '''81''':2 (1986).</ref><ref>{{cite book| author = George Ripley|author2=Charles Anderson Dana| title = The new American encyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge| url = http://books.google.com/?id=bK4rAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA497| year = 1863| publisher = D. Appleton and company| page = 497 }}</ref> Many historians have since issued retractions acknowledging Ridley. B.H. Warmington similarly admitted fault in repeating Hallward's error but posited that the legend precedes 1930 and inspired repetitions of the practice. After [[Pope Boniface VIII|Boniface VIII]]'s destruction of [[Palestrina]] in 1299 he issued a [[papal bull]] referring to the plowing and salting of defeated Carthage. For this reason, Warmington suggested that the symbolic value of the legend is so great and enduring that it mitigates the deficiency of concrete evidence that it happened and is useful to understand how subsequent historical narratives have been framed.<ref name="Carthage 1988 pp. 308"/>

===Byrsa===
{{Main|Byrsa}}

[[File:Maison punique byrsa.jpg|thumb|right|Punic ruins in Byrsa]]
On top of [[Byrsa]] hill, the location of the [[Forum (Roman)|Roman Forum]], a residential area from the last century of existence (early 2nd century) of the Punic city was excavated by the French archaeologist Serge Lancel. The neighborhood, with its houses, shops and private spaces, is significant for what it reveals about daily life there over twenty-one hundred years ago.<ref>Serge Lancel and Jean-Paul Morel, "Byrsa. Punic vestiges"; ''To save Carthage. Exploration and conservation of the city Punic, Roman and Byzantine'', Unesco / INAA, 1992, pp. 43‚Äì59</ref>

The habitat is typical, even stereotypical. The street was often used as a storefront; cistern tanks were installed in basements to collect water for domestic use, and a long corridor on the right side of each residence led to a courtyard containing a [[sump]], around which various other elements may be found. In some places the ground is covered with mosaics called punica pavement, sometimes using a characteristic red mortar.

The remains have been preserved under embankments, the substructures of the later [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] forum, whose foundation piles dot the district. The housing blocks are separated by a grid of straight streets approximately six metres wide, with a roadway consisting of clay; there are ''in situ'' stairs to compensate for the slope of the hill. Construction of this type presupposes organization and political will, and has inspired the name of the neighborhood, "[[Hannibal]] district", referring to the legendary Punic general or [[Suffete]] (consul) at the beginning of the 2nd century BC.

===Roman Carthage===
[[File:Karta Karthago.PNG|thumb|Roman Carthage]]
When Carthage fell, its nearby rival [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], a Roman ally, was made capital of the region and replaced Carthage as the leading centre of Punic trade and leadership. It had the advantageous position of being situated on the outlet of the [[Majardah River]], Tunisia's only river that flowed all year long. However, grain cultivation in the Tunisian mountains caused large amounts of [[silt]] to erode into the river. This silt accumulated in the harbour until it became useless, and Rome was forced to rebuild Carthage.

By 122 BC [[Gaius Gracchus]] founded a short-lived [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], called ''[[Colonia Junonia|Colonia Iunonia]]'', after the Latin name for the Punic goddess [[Tanit]], ''Iuno caelestis''. The purpose was to obtain arable lands for impoverished farmers. The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] abolished the colony some time later, in order to undermine Gracchus' power.

After this ill-fated attempt a new city of Carthage was built on the same land by [[Julius Caesar]] in 49‚Äì44 BC period, and by the 1st century A.D. it had grown to be the second largest city in the western half of the [[Roman Empire]], with a peak population of 500,000{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. It was the centre of the Roman province of [[Africa Province, Roman Empire|Africa]], which was a major breadbasket of the Empire. Among its major monuments was an [[Carthage amphitheatre|amphitheater]].

Carthage also became a [[Early centres of Christianity#Carthage|centre of early Christianity]] (see [[Carthage (episcopal see)]]). In the first of a string of rather poorly reported councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than 70 bishops attended. [[Tertullian]] later broke with the mainstream that was represented more and more in the west by the [[Early centres of Christianity#Rome|bishop of Rome]], but a more serious rift among Christians was the [[Donatist]] controversy, which [[Augustine of Hippo]] spent much time and parchment arguing against. In 397 AD at the [[Council at Carthage]], the [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|biblical canon for the western Church was confirmed]].

===Vandals===
{{Main|Vandal kingdom}}
[[File:NE 500ad.jpg|thumb|Vandal Empire in 500 AD, centred on Carthage.]]
The political fallout from the deep disaffection of [[African Christians]] is supposedly a crucial factor in the ease with which Carthage and the other centres were captured in the 5th century by [[Gaiseric]], king of the [[Vandals]], who defeated the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[general]] [[Bonifacius]] and made the city his capital. Gaiseric was considered a heretic too, an [[Arianism|Arian]], and though Arians commonly despised orthodox Catholic Christians, a mere promise of toleration might have caused the city's population to accept him. After a failed attempt to recapture the city in the 5th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman empire]] finally subdued the Vandals in the [[Vandalic War]] 533‚Äì534.

Thereafter the city became the seat of the [[praetorian prefecture of Africa]], which during the emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice's]] reign, was made into an [[Exarchate]], as was [[Ravenna]] in [[Italy]]. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of the Roman empire, all that remained of its power in the west. In the early 7th century it was the exarch of Carthage who overthrew emperor [[Phocas]].

===Islamic conquests===
The Roman [[Exarchate of Africa]] was not able to withstand the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim]] conquerors of the 7th century. [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] in 686 AD sent a force led by Zuhayr ibn Qais who won a battle over Romans and [[Berber people|Berbers]] led by [[Kusaila]], on the [[Qairawan]] plain, but he could not follow that up. In 695 AD [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] captured Carthage and advanced into the [[Atlas Mountains]]. An imperial fleet arrived and retook Carthage, but in 698 AD [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] returned and defeated Emperor [[Tiberios III]] at the [[Battle of Carthage (698)|Battle of Carthage]]. Roman imperial forces withdrew from all Africa except [[Ceuta]]. Roman Carthage was destroyed‚Äîits walls torn down, its water supply cut off and its harbours made unusable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=C. Edmund|title=Historic Cities of the Islamic World|year=2008|publisher=Brill Academic Press|isbn=978-9004153882|page=436}}</ref> It was replaced by [[Tunis]] as the major regional centre. The destruction of the Exarchate of Africa marked a permanent end to the Byzantine Empire's influence in the region.

==Modern suburb==
Modern '''Carthage''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|k|…ër|Œ∏|…™|d í}}; {{lang-ar|<big>ŸÇÿ±ÿ∑ÿßÿ¨</big>}} ''Qar·π≠ƒÅj'', {{lang-ber|‚¥Ω‚¥∞‚µî‚µú‚¥∞‚µä‚¥ª‚µè}} ''Kartajen'') is a suburb of [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], situated at the site of the ancient capital of the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian empire]].
It was little more than an agricultural village for nine hundred years until the middle of the 20th century; since then it has grown rapidly as an upscale coastal suburb.<ref name="RingSalkin1996">{{cite book|author1=Trudy Ring|author2=Robert M.

In February 1985, [[Ugo Vetere]], the mayor of [[Rome]], and Chedly Klibi, the mayor of Carthage, signed a symbolic treaty "officially" ending the conflict between their cities, which had been supposedly [[List of wars extended by diplomatic irregularity|extended by the lack of a peace treaty]] for more than 2,100 years.<ref>[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198503/delenda.est.carthago.htm written by John Lawton]</ref>

Carthage remains a popular [[tourist]] attraction and residential [[suburb]] of [[Tunis]]. The [[Carthage Palace]] (the Tunisian presidential palace) is located in the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=648961&publicationSubCategoryId=200|agency=philSTAR.com|title=More Tunisia unrest: Presidential palace gunbattle |date=17 January 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref>  Modern Carthage, on a [[peninsula]], attracts more wealthy residents.<ref>David Lambert, ''Notables des colonies.

==Portrayals in fiction==
Carthage features in [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s historical novel ''[[Salammb√¥ (novel)|Salammb√¥]]'' (1862). Set around the time of the [[Mercenary War]], it includes a dramatic description of child sacrifice, and the boy Hannibal narrowly avoiding being sacrificed.

''The Young Carthaginian'' (1887) by [[G.A. Henty]] is a boys' adventure novel told from the perspective of Malchus, a fictional teenage lieutenant of Hannibal during the Second Punic War.

In ''[[The Dead Past]]'', a science fiction short story by [[Isaac Asimov]], a leading character is an ancient historian who is trying to disprove the allegation that the Carthaginians carried out child sacrifice.

In [[Kushiel's Mercy]] by [[Jacqueline Carey]], Carthage is a conquering nation geographically and culturally based on the historical Carthage.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

''The Purple Quest'' by [[Frank G. Slaughter]] is about the founding of Carthage.

''Die Sterwende Stad'' (The Dying City) is a novel written in [[Afrikaans]] by Antonie P. Roux and published in 1956.  It is a fictional account of life in Carthage and included the defeat of Hannibal by Scipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama.  For several years it was prescribed reading for South African  year 11 and 12 high school students studying the Afrikaans language.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

A duology by [[John Maddox Roberts]], comprising ''[[Hannibal's Children]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Seven Hills]]'' (2005), is set in an [[alternate history]] where Hannibal defeated Rome in the Second Punic War, and Carthage is still a major Mediterranean power in 100 BC.
