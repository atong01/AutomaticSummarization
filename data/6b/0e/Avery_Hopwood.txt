'''James Avery Hopwood''' (May 28, 1882 - July 1, 1928), was an American playwright, called the most successful playwright of the Jazz Age, having four plays running simultaneously on Broadway in 1920.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from the [[University of Michigan]] (1905).

Hopwood started out as a journalist for a Cleveland newspaper as its New York correspondent, but within a year had a play, ''Clothes'' (1906), produced on Broadway. He became known as "The Playboy Playwright"<ref name=imdbbio>Jim Beaver [http://imdb.com/name/nm0394479/bio Biography for Avery Hopwood] at [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> and specialized in comedies and farces, some of them with material considered risqué  at the time.  One play, ''[[The Demi-Virgin]]'' in 1921, prompted a court case because of its suggestive subject matter, including a risque game of cards, "Stripping Cupid", where a bevy of showgirls teased the audience in their lingerie.  The case was dismissed.

===Dramatist===
His many plays included ''Nobody's Widow'' (1910), starring Blanche Bates; ''[[Fair and Warmer]]'' (1915), starring Madge Kennedy (filmed in 1919); ''[[The Gold Diggers (play)|The Gold Diggers]]'' (1919), starring Ina Claire (filmed in 1923 as ''[[The Gold Diggers (1923 film)|The Gold Diggers]]'', in 1928 as ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' and also as ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]''); ''[[Ladies' Night (play)|Ladies' Night]]'', 1920, starring [[Charlie Ruggles]] (filmed in 1928); the famous mystery play ''[[The Bat (play)|The Bat]]'' (with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]), 1920 (filmed in 1926 ''[[The Bat (1926 film)|The Bat]]'', 1930 ''[[The Bat Whispers]],'' and 1959 ''[[The Bat, (1959 film)|The Bat]])''; ''[[Getting Gertie's Garter (play)|Getting Gertie's Garter]]'' (with Wilson Collison), 1921, starring [[Hazel Dawn]] (filmed in 1927 and 1945); ''The Demi-Virgin'', 1921, also starring Dawn; ''The Alarm Clock'', 1923; ''The Best People'' (with David Gray), 1924 (filmed in 1925 and as ''[[Fast and Loose (1930 film)|Fast and Loose]]'' in 1930), the song-farce ''Naughty Cinderella'', 1925, starring [[Irene Bordoni]] and ''The Garden of Eden'' in 1927 (filmed in 1928 as ''[[The Garden of Eden (1928 film)|The Garden of Eden]]'').

Hopwood was asked to write the third act of Mary Roberts Rinehart's play; ''The Bat''.<ref name="University of Pittsburgh press">{{cite book|last1=Cohn|first1=Jan|title=Improbable Fiction: The Life of Mary Roberts Rinehart|date=1980|publisher=University of Pittsburgh press|page=138}}</ref> Hopwood collaborated with Rinehart to then work on the last act of the play in Sewickley and sometimes in New York.<ref name="University of Pittsburgh press"/>

Interestingly, the early sound film, ''The Bat Whispers'', played an influence on Bob Kane's [[Batman]] because the inspiration for Batman's costume came from the "mysterious Bat" character portrayed in the movie from 1930.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kane|first1=Bob|title=Batman and Me|publisher=Eclipse Books|location=Forestville, CA|page=38}}</ref>

A clever, adroit, masterful craftsman who wrote to the tastes of his public, Hopwood was inexhaustible in his work ethic.  Although the press reported that he was engaged to vaudeville dancer and choreographer Rose Rolanda in 1924, Hopwood's close friend [[Carl Van Vechten]] confirmed in later years that it was all a publicity stunt.  Rolanda would later marry caricaturist Miguel Covarrubias.

===Death===
While swimming at [[Juan-les-Pins]] on the French Riviera, July 1, 1928, he suffered a heart attack and died. He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland, Ohio, next to his mother, Jule.<ref>Vigil, Vicki Blum (2007). ''Cemeteries of Northeast Ohio: Stones, Symbols & Stories''.

==Hopwood Awards==
The terms of Hopwood's will left a substantial portion of his estate to his alma mater, the University of Michigan for the establishment of the [[Hopwood Award|Avery Hopwood and Jule Hopwood Creative Writing Awards]]. The bequest stipulated: "It is especially desired that students competing for prizes shall be allowed the widest possible latitude, and that the new, the unusual, and the radical shall be especially encouraged." Famous Hopwood award winners include [[Robert Hayden]], [[Marge Piercy]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Betty Smith]], [[Lawrence Kasdan]], [[John Ciardi]], [[Mary Gaitskill]], [[Edmund White]], [[Nancy Willard]], [[Frank O’Hara]], and [[Steve Hamilton (author)|Steve Hamilton]].

===''The Great Bordello''===
Throughout his life, Hopwood worked on a novel that he hoped would "expose" the strictures the commercial theater machine imposed on playwrights, but the manuscript was never published. Jack Sharrar recovered the manuscript for this novel in 1982 during his research for ''Avery Hopwood, His Life and Plays''. The novel was published in July 2011 as ''The Great Bordello''.
