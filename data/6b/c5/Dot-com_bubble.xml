Previously, individuals were less capable of accessing the Internet, many stopped by lack of local access/connectivity to the infrastructure, and/or the failure to understand use for Internet technologies. The absence of infrastructure and a lack of understanding were two major obstacles that previously obstructed mass connectivity. For these reasons, individuals had limited capabilities in what they could do and what they could achieve in accessing technology. Increased means of connectivity to the Internet than previously available allowed the use of ICT (Information Communicative Technology) to progress from a luxury good to a necessity good. As connectivity grew, so did the potential for venture capitalists to take advantage of the growing field. The functionalism, or impacts of technologies driven from the cost effectiveness of new Internet websites ultimately influenced the demand growth during this time.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Soaring stocks</heading><paragraph>In financial markets, a<space/><link><target>stock market bubble</target></link><space/>is a self-perpetuating rise or boom in the share prices of stocks of a particular industry; the term may be used with certainty only in retrospect after share prices have crashed. A bubble occurs when speculators note the fast increase in value and decide to buy in anticipation of further rises, rather than because the shares are undervalued. Typically, during a bubble, many companies thus become grossly overvalued. When the bubble &quot;bursts&quot;, the share prices fall dramatically. The prices of many non-technology stocks increased in tandem and were also pushed up to valuations discorrelated relative to fundamentals.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last1">Anderson<space/></arg><arg name="first1">Keith<space/></arg><arg name="last2">Brooks<space/></arg><arg name="first2">Chris<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink2">Chris Brooks (academic)<space/></arg><arg name="last3">Katsaris<space/></arg><arg name="first3">Apostolos<space/></arg><arg name="date">2010<space/></arg><arg name="title">Speculative bubbles in the S&P 500: was the tech bubble confined to the tech sector?<space/></arg><arg name="journal">Journal of Empirical Finance<space/></arg><arg name="volume">17<space/></arg><arg name="issue">3<space/></arg><arg name="pages">345â€“361<space/></arg><arg name="ISSN">0927-5398<space/></arg><arg name="doi">10.1016/j.jempfin.2009.12.004</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>American news media, including respected business publications such as<space/><italics><link><target>Forbes</target></link></italics><space/>and the<space/><italics><link><target>Wall Street Journal</target></link></italics>, encouraged the public to invest in risky companies, despite many of the companies' disregard for basic financial and even legal principles.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Origins of the Crash: The Great Bubble and Its Undoing</italics>,<space/><link><target>Roger Lowenstein</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Penguin Books</target></link>, 2004, ISBN 1-59420-003-3, ISBN 978-1-59420-003-8 pp. 114115.</extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Andrew Smith (author)</target><part>Andrew Smith</part></link><space/>argued that the financial industry's handling of<space/><link><target>initial public offering</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>tended to benefit the banks and initial investors rather than the companies.<extension extension_name='ref' name="autogenerated1"><italics>Totally Wired: On the Trail of the Great Dotcom Swindle</italics><space/><link><target>Andrew Smith (author)</target></link><space/><link><target>Bloomsbury Books</target></link><space/>2012 ISBN 978-1-84737-449-3</extension><space/>This is because company staff were typically barred from reselling their shares for a<space/><link><target>lock-up period</target><part>lock-in period</part></link><space/>of 12 to 18 months, and so did not benefit from the common pattern of a huge short-lived share price spike on the day of the launch.

Companies that produced network equipment like<space/><link><target>Nortel Networks</target></link><space/>were irrevocably damaged by such over-extension; Nortel declared<space/><link><target>bankruptcy</target></link><space/>in early 2009. Companies like Cisco, which did not have any production facilities, but bought from other manufacturers, were able to leave quickly and actually do well from the situation as the bubble burst and products were sold cheaply.</paragraph><paragraph>In the struggle to become a technology hub, many cities and states used tax money to fund technology conference centers, advanced infrastructure, and created favorable business and tax law to encourage development of the dotcom industry in their locale. Virginia's<space/><link><target>Dulles Technology Corridor</target></link><space/>is a prime example of this activity. Large quantities of high-speed fiber links were laid, and the State and local governments gave tax exemptions to technology firms.
