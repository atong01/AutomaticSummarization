'''Brian Wilson Kernighan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɜr|n|ɨ|h|æ|n}}; born January 1, 1942)<ref name="NYT 2002"/> is a Canadian [[computer scientist]] who worked at [[Bell Labs]] alongside [[Unix]] creators [[Ken Thompson]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]] and contributed to the development of [[Unix]]. He is also coauthor of the [[AWK]] and [[AMPL]] [[programming language]]s. The "K" of [[The C Programming Language|K&R C]] and the "K" in AWK both stand for "Kernighan". Since 2000 Brian Kernighan has been a Professor at the Computer Science Department of [[Princeton University]], where he is also the Undergraduate Department Representative.

Kernighan's name became widely known through co-authorship of the first book on the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] with [[Dennis Ritchie]]. Kernighan affirmed that he had no part in the design of the C language ("it's entirely Dennis Ritchie's work").<ref name="LJ 2003">{{cite web |title=Interview with Brian Kernighan |url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7035 |publisher =[[Linux Journal]] |first=Aleksey |last=Dolya |date=29 July 2003}}</ref> He authored many [[Unix]] programs, including [[troff|ditroff]], and [[cron]] for [[Version 7 Unix]].

In collaboration with Shen Lin he devised well-known [[heuristic]]s for two [[NP-complete]] optimization problems: [[graph partition]]ing and the [[travelling salesman problem]]. (In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the ''[[Kernighan–Lin algorithm]]'', while the latter is styled ''[[Lin–Kernighan heuristic|Lin–Kernighan]]''.)

Kernighan was the software editor for [[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hall International]]. His "Software Tools" series spread the essence of "C/Unix thinking" with makeovers for [[BASIC]], [[Fortran|FORTRAN]], and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and most notably his "[[Ratfor]]" (rational FORTRAN) was put in the public domain.

He has said that if stranded on an island with only one programming language it would have to be C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~mihaib/kernighan-interview/index.html |title=An Interview with Brian Kernighan |first=Mihai |last=Budiu |date=July 2000}}</ref>

Kernighan coined the term [[Unix]] and helped popularize Thompson's [[Unix philosophy]].<ref name="reader">{{cite techreport |first1=M. D. |last1=McIlroy |authorlink1=Doug McIlroy |year=1987 |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf |title=A Research Unix reader: annotated excerpts from the Programmer's Manual, 1971–1986 |series=CSTR |number=139 |institution=Bell Labs}}</ref> Kernighan is also known as a coiner of the expression "What You See Is All You Get" (WYSIAYG), which is a sarcastic variant of the original "What You See Is What You Get" ([[WYSIWYG]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}  Kernighan's term is used to indicate that WYSIWYG systems might throw away information in a document that could be useful in other contexts.

Kernighan's original 1978 implementation of [[Hello, World!]] was sold at [[The Algorithm Auction]], the world’s first auction of [[computer algorithms]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Brian Kernighan {{ndash}} Hello World|url=https://www.artsy.net/artwork/brian-kernighan-hello-world|website=Artsy|publisher=Artsy|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
[[File:Brian Kernighan in 2012 at Bell Labs 3.jpg|thumb|Brian Kernighan speaks at a tribute to [[Dennis Ritchie]] in 2012 at [[Bell Labs]].]]
Born in [[Toronto]], Kernighan attended the [[University of Toronto]] between 1960 and 1964, earning his [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[engineering physics]].<ref name="LJ 2003" /> He received his PhD in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Princeton University]], where he has held a professorship in the department of computer science since 2000.  Each fall he teaches a course called "Computers in Our World", which introduces the fundamentals of computing to non-majors.

==Summary of achievements==
* The [[AMPL]] programming language
* The [[AWK]] programming language, with [[Alfred Aho]] and [[Peter J. Weinberger]], and its book ''The AWK Programming Language''
* ditroff, or "device independent [[troff]]", which allowed troff to be used with any device
* [[The Elements of Programming Style]], with [[P. J. Plauger]]
* The first documented [["Hello, world!" program]], in Kernighan's [http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/btut.html "A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B"] (1972)
* Ratfor{{r|reader}}
* ''Software Tools'', a book and set of tools for Ratfor, co-created in part with P. J. Plauger
* ''Software Tools in Pascal'', a book and set of tools for [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], with P. J. Plauger
* ''The C Programming Language'', with C creator [[Dennis Ritchie]], the first book on C
* The [[eqn]] typesetting language for troff, with [[Lorinda Cherry]]{{r|reader}}
* The [[m4 (computer language)|m4]] macro processing language, with Dennis Ritchie
* The [[pic language|pic]] typesetting language for troff{{r|reader}}
* [[The Practice of Programming]], with [[Rob Pike]]
* [[The Unix Programming Environment]], a tutorial book, with Rob Pike
* [http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html "Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language"], a popular criticism of [[Niklaus Wirth]]'s [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Some parts of the criticism are obsolete due to ISO 7185 (Programming Languages - Pascal); the criticism was written before ISO 7185 was created. (AT&T Computing Science Technical Report #100)

== Writings ==
* ''[[The Elements of Programming Style]]'' (1974, 1978) with P.&nbsp;J. Plauger
* ''Software Tools'' (1976) with P.&nbsp;J. Plauger
* ''[[The C Programming Language]]'' (1978, 1988) with Dennis M. Ritchie
* ''Software Tools in Pascal'' (1981) with P.&nbsp;J. Plauger
* ''[[The Unix Programming Environment]]'' (1984) with Rob Pike
* ''[[The AWK Programming Language]]'' (1988) with Alfred Aho and Peter J. Weinberger
* ''[[The Practice of Programming]]'' (1999) with Rob Pike
* ''AMPL: A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming, 2nd ed.'' (2003) with [[Robert Fourer]] and David Gay
* ''D is for Digital: What a well-informed person should know about computers and communications'' (2011)
* ''[[The Go Programming Language]]'' (2015) with Alan Donovan
