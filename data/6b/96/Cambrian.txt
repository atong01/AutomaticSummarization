== Stratigraphy ==
{{Further|Stratigraphy of the Cambrian}}

Despite the long recognition of its distinction from younger [[Ordovician]] rocks and older [[Precambrian]] rocks, it was not until 1994 that this time  period was internationally ratified. The base of the Cambrian is defined on a complex assemblage of [[trace fossils]] known as the ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' assemblage.<ref name=Knoll2004a>A. Knoll, M. Walter, G. Narbonne, and N. Christie-Blick (2004) "[http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/ediacaran/Knoll_et_al_2004a.pdf The Ediacaran Period: A New Addition to the Geologic Time Scale.]" Submitted on Behalf of the Terminal Proterozoic Subcommission of the International Commission on Stratigraphy.</ref>
Nevertheless, the usage of ''Treptichnus pedum'', a reference [[Trace fossil|ichnofossil]] for the lower boundary of the Cambrian, for the stratigraphic detection of this boundary is always risky because of occurrence of very similar trace fossils belonging to the Treptichnids group well below the ''T. pedum'' in [[Namibia]], Spain and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and possibly, in the western USA. The stratigraphic range of ''T. pedum'' overlaps the range of the [[Ediacaran]] fossils in Namibia, and probably in Spain.<ref name=Fedonkin2007>M.A. Fedonkin, B.S.

=== Subdivisions {{anchor|Subdivisions}} ===

The Cambrian period follows the [[Ediacaran]] and is followed by the [[Ordovician]] period. The Cambrian is divided into four [[epoch (geology)|epochs]] or [[series (stratigraphy)|series]] and ten [[age (geology)|ages]] or [[stage (stratigraphy)|stages]]. Currently only two series and five stages are named and have a [[GSSP]].

Because the international stratigraphic subdivision is not yet complete, many local subdivisions are still widely used. In some of these subdivisions the Cambrian is divided into three epochs with locally differing names&nbsp;– the Early Cambrian (Caerfai or Waucoban, {{period span|early cambrian}} mya), [[Middle Cambrian]] (St Davids or Albertan, {{period span|middle cambrian}} mya) and [[Furongian]] ({{period span|late cambrian}} mya; also known as Late Cambrian, Merioneth or Croixan). Rocks of these epochs are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle, or Upper Cambrian.

[[Trilobite zone]]s allow biostratigraphic correlation in the Cambrian.

Each of the local epochs is divided into several stages. The Cambrian is divided into several regional [[faunal stages]] of which the Russian-Kazakhian system is most used in international parlance:

=== Cambrian dating ===
[[Image:Archeocyathids.JPG|thumb|[[Archeocyathid]]s from the [[Poleta formation]] in the [[Death Valley]] area]]
The time range for the Cambrian has classically been thought to have been from about 542 million-years-ago (mya) to about 488 mya. The lower boundary of the Cambrian was traditionally set at the earliest appearance of [[trilobite]]s and also unusual forms known as [[Archeocyatha|archeocyathids]] (literally "ancient cup") that are thought to be the earliest sponges and also the first non-microbial [[reef]] builders.

The end of the period was eventually set at a fairly definite faunal change now identified as an [[extinction event]]. [[Fossil]] discoveries and [[radiometric dating]] in the last quarter of the 20th century have called these dates into question. Date inconsistencies as large as 20 million years are common between authors. Framing dates of ''ca.'' 545 to 490 mya were proposed by the International Subcommission on Global Stratigraphy as recently as 2002.

A radiometric date from [[New Brunswick]] puts the end of the Lower Cambrian around 511 mya. This leaves 21 mya for the other two series/epochs of the Cambrian.

A more precise date of 542 ± 0.3 mya for the extinction event at the beginning of the Cambrian has recently been submitted.<ref name=Gradstein2004>{{cite book
 | author = Gradstein, F.M. |author2=Ogg, J.G. |author3=Smith, A.G.
 | year = 2004
 | title = A Geologic Time Scale 2004
 | publisher = Cambridge University Press
 | isbn = 
 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> The rationale for this precise dating is interesting in itself as an example of [[Paleontology|paleological]] [[deductive reasoning]]. Exactly at the Cambrian boundary there is a marked fall in the abundance of [[carbon-13]], a "reverse spike" that [[paleontologist]]s call an ''excursion''. It is so widespread that it is the best indicator of the position of the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary in [[stratigraphic]] sequences of roughly this age. One of the places that this well-established carbon-13 excursion occurs is in [[Oman]]. Amthor (2003) describes evidence from Oman that indicates the [[carbon]]-[[isotope]] excursion relates to a mass extinction: the disappearance of distinctive fossils from the [[Precambrian]] coincides exactly with the carbon-13 anomaly. Fortunately, in the Oman sequence, so too does a [[volcanic ash]] horizon from which [[zircon]]s provide a very precise age of 542 ± 0.3 mya (calculated on the decay rate of [[uranium]] to lead). This new and precise date tallies with the less precise dates for the carbon-13 anomaly, derived from sequences in [[Siberia]] and [[Namibia]].

== Climate ==
The Earth was generally cold during the early Cambrian, probably due to the ancient continent of Gondwana covering the [[South Pole]] and cutting off polar ocean currents. There were likely polar ice caps and a series of glaciations, as the planet was still recovering from an earlier [[Snowball Earth]]. It became warmer towards the end of the period; the glaciers receded and eventually disappeared, and sea levels rose dramatically. This trend would continue into the [[Ordovician]] period.

Although there were a variety of macroscopic marine plants (e.g. ''[[Margaretia]]'' and ''[[Dalyia]]''), no true [[land plant]] ([[embryophyte]]) fossils are known from the Cambrian. However, biofilms and microbial mats were well developed on Cambrian tidal flats and beaches.,<ref>Schieber et al., 2007, pp. 53–71.</ref> and further inland were a variety of lichens,{{citation needed|reason=earliest unequivocal lichen fossils are Devonian, from the Rhynie chert|date=April 2013}} fungi and microbes forming microbial earth ecosystems, comparable with modern [[cryptobiotic soil|soil crust]] of desert regions, contributing to soil formation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Retallack | first1 = G.J. | year = 2008 | title = Cambrian palaeosols and landscapes of South Australia | url = | journal = Alcheringa | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 1083–1106 | doi=10.1080/08120090802266568|bibcode = 2008AuJES..55.1083R }}</ref><ref>[http://phys.org/news/2013-07-greening-earth.html Greening of the Earth pushed way back in time]</ref>

== Fauna ==
{{Main|Cambrian explosion}}
Most animal life during the Cambrian was aquatic, with [[trilobite]]s assumed to be the dominant life form,<ref>[http://www.humboldt.edu/natmus/lifeThroughTime/Cambrian.web/index.html Cambrian HSU NHM]</ref> which has since proven to be incorrect. [[Arthropod]]s in general were by far the most dominating animals in the ocean, but at the time, trilobites were only a minor part of the total arthropod diversity. What made them different from their relatives was their heavy armor, which fossilized far more easily than the fragile exoskeleton of other arthropods, leaving behind numerous preserved remains which give the false impression that they were the most abundant part of the fauna.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11630&page=57 Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere]</ref> The period marked a steep change in the diversity and composition of Earth's biosphere. The incumbent [[Ediacaran biota]] suffered a mass extinction at the base of the period, which corresponds to an increase in the abundance and complexity of burrowing behaviour. This behaviour had a [[Cambrian substrate revolution|profound and irreversible effect on the substrate]] which transformed the [[seabed]] [[ecosystem]]s. Before the Cambrian, the sea floor was covered by [[microbial mat]]s. By the end of the period, burrowing animals had destroyed the mats through [[bioturbation]], and gradually turned the seabeds into what they are today. As a consequence, many of those organisms that were dependent on the mats went extinct, while the other species adapted to the changed environment that now offered new ecological niches.<ref>[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/48630/title/As_the_worms_churn As the worms churn]</ref>
Around the same time there was a seemingly rapid appearance of representatives of all the  mineralized [[phylum|phyla]] except the [[Bryozoa]], which appear in the Lower [[Ordovician]].<ref name=Taylor2013>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1666/13-029|title=Reinterpretation of the Cambrian 'bryozoan' ''Pywackia'' as an octocoral|year=2013|last1=Taylor|first1=P.D.|last2=Berning|first2=B.|last3=Wilson|first3=M.A.|journal=Journal of Paleontology|volume=87|issue=6|pages=984–990}}</ref> However, many of these phyla were represented only by stem-group forms; and since mineralized phyla generally have a benthic origin, they may not be a good proxy for (more abundant) non-mineralized phyla.<ref name=Budd2000>{{BuddJensen2000}}</ref>

While the early Cambrian showed such diversification that it has been named the Cambrian Explosion, this changed later in the period, when it was exposed to a sharp drop in biodiversity. About 515 million years ago, the number of species going extinct exceeded the amount of new species appearing. Five million years later, the number of genera had dropped from an earlier peak of about 600 to just 450. Also the [[speciation]] rate in many groups was reduced to between a fifth and a third of previous levels. 500 million years ago, oxygen levels fell dramatically in the oceans, leading to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], while the levels of poisonous [[hydrogen sulfide]] simultaneously increased, causing another extinction. The later half of Cambrian was surprisingly barren and show evidence of several rapid extinction events; the [[stromatolite]]s which had been replaced by reef building sponges known as [[Archaeocyatha]], returned once more as the archaeocyathids went extinct. This declining trend did not change before the [[Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event|Ordovician]].<ref>[http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/the-ordovician-explosion-651.doc The Ordovician: Life's second big bang]</ref><ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19916-oxygen-crash-led-to-cambrian-mass-extinction.html#.UxUDwmeYacw Oxygen crash led to Cambrian mass extinction]</ref>

Some Cambrian organisms ventured onto land, producing the trace fossils ''[[Protichnites]]'' and ''[[Climactichnites]]''. Fossil evidence suggests that [[euthycarcinoid]]s, an extinct group of arthropods, produced at least some of the ''Protichnites''.<ref>Collette & Hagadorn, 2010.</ref><ref>Collette, Gass & Hagadorn, 2012</ref> Fossils of the maker of ''Climactichnites'' have not been found; however, fossil trackways and resting traces suggest a large, [[slug]]-like [[mollusk]].<ref>Yochelson & Fedonkin, 1993.</ref><ref>Getty & Hagadorn, 2008.</ref>

In contrast to later periods, the Cambrian fauna was somewhat restricted; free-floating organisms were rare, with the majority living on or close to the sea floor;<ref name=Munnecke2010>{{Cite journal| last1 = Munnecke | first1 = A.| last2 = Calner | first2 = M.| last3 = Harper | first3 = D.
