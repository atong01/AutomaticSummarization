The rain forest may contain as many as 3,000<space/><link><target>species</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>flora</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>fauna</target></link><space/>within a<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>2.6</arg><arg>km2</arg><arg>sqmi</arg><arg>0</arg><arg name="sp">us</arg><arg name="sing">on</arg></template><space/>area. The Atlantic Forest is reputed to have even greater biological diversity than the Amazon rain forest, which, despite apparent homogeneity, contains many types of vegetation, from high canopy forest to bamboo groves.</paragraph><paragraph>In the semiarid Northeast,<space/><link><target>caatinga</target></link>, a dry, thick, thorny vegetation, predominates. Most of central Brazil is covered with a woodland savanna, known as the<space/><link><target>cerrado</target></link><space/>(sparse scrub trees and drought-resistant grasses), which became an area of agricultural development after the mid-1970s. In the<space/><link><target>Southern Region, Brazil</target><part>South</part></link><space/>(Sul), needle-leaved<space/><link><target>pine</target><trail>woods</trail></link><space/>(Paran pine or<space/><link><target>araucaria</target></link>) cover the highlands; grassland similar to the Argentine<space/><link><target>pampa</target></link><space/>covers the sea-level plains. The Mato Grosso<space/><link><target>swampland</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(<link><target>Pantanal</target></link><space/>Mato-grossense) is a<space/><link><target>Florida</target></link>-sized plain in the western portion of the Center-West (Centro-Oeste). It is covered with tall<space/><link><target>grass</target><trail>es</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>Woody plant</target><part>bush</part><trail>es</trail></link>, and widely dispersed trees similar to those of the cerrado and is partly submerged during the rainy season.</paragraph><paragraph>Brazil, which is named after reddish dyewood (<link><target>pau brasil</target></link>), has long been famous for the wealth of its tropical forests. These are not, however, as important to world markets as those of Asia and Africa, which started to reach depletion only in the 1980s. By 1996 more than 90% of the original Atlantic forest had been cleared, primarily for agriculture, with little use made of the wood, except for araucaria pine in Paran.</paragraph><paragraph>The inverse situation existed with regard to clearing for wood in the Amazon rain forest, of which about 15% had been cleared by 1994, and part of the remainder had been disturbed by selective logging. Because the Amazon forest is highly heterogeneous, with hundreds of woody species per<space/><link><target>hectare</target></link>, there is considerable distance between individual trees of economic value, such as<space/><link><target>mahogany</target></link><space/>and cerejeira. Therefore, this type of forest is not normally cleared for timber extraction but logged through high-grading, or selection of the most valuable trees. Because of vines, felling, and transportation, their removal causes destruction of many other trees, and the litter and new growth create a risk of<space/><link><target>forest fire</target><trail>s</trail></link>, which are otherwise rare in<space/><link><target>rain forest</target><trail>s</trail></link>. In favorable locations, such as Paragominas, in the northeastern part of<space/><link><target>Par</target></link><space/>State, a new pattern of timber extraction has emerged: diversification and the production of<space/><link><target>plywood</target></link><space/>have led to the economic use of more than 100 tree species.</paragraph><paragraph>Starting in the late 1980s, rapid deforestation and extensive burning in Brazil received considerable international and national attention.<space/><link><target>Satellite image</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>have helped document and quantify deforestation as well as fires, but their use also has generated considerable controversy because of problems of defining original vegetation, cloud cover, and dealing with secondary growth and because fires, as mentioned above, may occur in old pasture rather than signifying new clearing. Public policies intended to promote sustainable management of timber extraction, as well as sustainable use of nontimber forest products (such as rubber,<space/><link><target>Brazil nut</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>fruit</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>seed</target><trail>s</trail></link>,<space/><link><target>vegetable oil</target><part>oils</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>vine</target><trail>s</trail></link>), were being discussed intensely in the mid-1990s. However, implementing the principles of sustainable development, without irreversible damage to the environment, proved to be more challenging than establishing international agreements about them.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Brazil veg 1977.jpg</target><part>Natural vegetation map of Brazil, 1977</part></link></paragraph><heading level='2'>Climate</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Climate of Brazil</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Koppen climate classification Brazil.tif</target><part>400px</part><part>thumb</part><part>Kppen climate classification Brazil</part><part>Climate classification for Brazil, according to the Kppen criteria.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Alvares et al. 2013"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Alvares, C.

In 1995 there were 9,274 districts. All municipal and district seats, regardless of size, are considered officially to be urban. For purely statistical purposes, the municipalities were grouped in 1990 into 559 micro-regions, which in turn constituted 136 meso-regions. This grouping modified the previous micro-regional division established in 1968, a division that was used to present census data for 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985.</paragraph><paragraph>Each of the five major regions has a distinct<space/><link><target>ecosystem</target></link>.

Its main biome is the<space/><link><target>cerrado</target></link>, the tropical savanna in which natural grassland is partly covered with twisted shrubs and small trees. The cerrado was used for low-density cattle-raising in the past but is now also used for soybean production.

In 1990, 6.6% of the region's territory was considered altered by anthropic (man-made) action, with state levels varying from 0.9% in Amap to 14.0% in Rondnia.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1996 the North had 11.1 million inhabitants, only 7% of the national total. However, its share of Brazil's total had grown rapidly in the 1970s and early 1980s as a result of interregional migration, as well as high rates of natural increase.

The region has the largest share of the country's population, 63 million in 1991, or 39% of the national total, primarily as a result of internal migration since the mid-19th century until the 1980s. In addition to a dense urban network, it contains the megacities of So Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which in 1991 had 18.7 million and 11.7 million inhabitants in their metropolitan areas, respectively. The region combines the highest living standards in Brazil with pockets of urban poverty. In 1994 So Paulo boasted an average income of US$4,666, while Minas Gerais reported only US$2,833.</paragraph><paragraph>Originally, the principal biome in the Southeast was the Atlantic Forest, but by 1990 less than 10% of the original forest cover remained as a result of clearing for farming, ranching, and charcoal making.

Of all<space/><link><target>Latin American</target></link><space/>countries, Brazil still has the largest portion (66%) of its territory covered by forests, but<space/><link><target>clearing</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>burning</target></link><space/>in the Amazon proceeded at alarming rates in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the clearing resulted from the activities of ranchers, including large corporate operations, and a smaller portion resulted from<space/><link><target>slash and burn</target></link><space/>techniques used by small farmers. Technical changes involved in the transition from horizontal expansion of agriculture to increasing productivity also accounted for decreasing rates of deforestation.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Desertification</target></link>, another important environmental problem in Brazil, only received international attention following the<space/><link><target>United Nations</target></link><space/>Conference on the Environment and Development, also known as the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. Desertification means that the soils and vegetation of drylands are severely degraded, not necessarily that land turns into desert. In the early 1990s, it became evident that the semiarid<space/><link><target>caatinga</target></link><space/>ecosystem of the Northeast was losing its natural vegetation through clearing and that the zone was therefore running the risk of becoming even more arid, as was occurring also in some other regions.</paragraph><paragraph>In areas where agriculture is more intense and developed, there are serious problems of<space/><link><target>soil erosion</target></link>,<space/><link><target>silt</target><trail>ation</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>sedimentation</target></link><space/>of streams and rivers, and pollution with<space/><link><target>pesticide</target><trail>s</trail></link>. In parts of the<space/><link><target>savanna</target><trail>s</trail></link>, where irrigated<space/><link><target>soybean</target></link><space/>production expanded in the 1980s, the<space/><link><target>water table</target></link><space/>has been affected. Expansion of pastures for cattle raising has reduced natural<space/><link><target>biodiversity</target></link><space/>in the savannas. Swine effluents constitute a serious environmental problem in Santa Catarina in the South.</paragraph><paragraph>In urban areas, at least in the largest cities, levels of<space/><link><target>air pollution</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Traffic congestion</target><part>congestion</part></link><space/>are typical of, or worse than, those found in cities in<space/><link><target>developed countries</target></link>. At the same time, however, basic environmental problems related to the lack of<space/><link><target>sanitation</target></link>, which developed countries solved long ago, persist in Brazil. These problems are sometimes worse in middle-sized and small cities than in large cities, which have more resources to deal with them. Environmental problems of cities and towns finally began to receive greater attention by society and the government in the 1990s.</paragraph><paragraph>According to many critics, the<space/><link><target>economic crisis</target></link><space/>in the 1980s worsened environmental degradation in Brazil because it led to<space/><link><target>overexploitation</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>natural resources</target></link>, stimulated settlement in fragile lands in both rural and urban areas, and weakened environmental protection. At the same time, however, the lower level of economic activity may have reduced pressure on the environment, such as the aforementioned decreased level of investment in large-scale clearing in the Amazon. That pressure could increase if economic growth accelerates, especially if consumption patterns remain unchanged and more sustainable forms of production are not found.</paragraph><paragraph>In Brazil public policies regarding the<space/><link><target>Environment (biophysical)</target><part>environment</part></link><space/>are generally advanced, although their implementation and the enforcement of<space/><link><target>environmental law</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>have been far from ideal. Laws regarding forests, water, and wildlife have been in effect since the 1930s. Brazil achieved significant institutional advances in environmental policy design and implementation after the Stockholm Conference on the Environment in 1972. Specialized environmental agencies were organized at the federal level and in some states, and many<space/><link><target>national park</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and reserves were established. By 1992 Brazil had established 34 national parks and fifty-six<space/><link><target>biological reserve</target><trail>s</trail></link>. In 1981 the National Environment Policy was defined, and the National System for the Environment (Sistema Nacional do Meio AmbienteSisnama) was created, with the National Environmental Council (Conselho Nacional do Meio AmbienteConama) at its apex, municipal councils at its base, and state-level councils in between. In addition to government authorities, all of these councils include representatives of civil society.</paragraph><paragraph>The 1988 constitution incorporates environmental precepts that are advanced compared with those of most other countries. At that time, the<space/><link><target>Chamber of Deputies of Brazil</target><part>Chamber of Deputies</part></link><space/>(Cmara dos Deputados) established its permanent Commission for Defense of the Consumer, the Environment, and Minorities.

The Ministry of Environment was created in late 1992, after President Collor had left office. In August 1993, it became the Ministry of Environment and the<space/><link><target>Legal Amazon</target></link><space/>and took a more pragmatic approach than had the combative Lutzemberger. However, because of turnover in its leadership, a poorly defined mandate, and lack of funds, its role and impact were limited. In 1995 its mandate and name were expanded to include water resourcesthe Ministry of Environment, Hydraulic Resources, and the Legal Amazonit began a process of restructuring to meet its mandate of &quot;shared management of the sustainable use of natural resources.&quot; In 1997 the Commission on Policies for Sustainable Development and Agenda 21 began to function under the aegis of the Civil Household. One of its main tasks was to prepare Agenda 21 (a plan for the twenty-first century) for Brazil and to stimulate preparation of state and local agendas.</paragraph><paragraph>Institutional development at the official level was accompanied and in part stimulated by the growth, wide diffusion, and growing professional development of<space/><link><target>nongovernmental organization</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(<link><target>NGO</target><trail>s</trail></link>) dedicated to environmental and socio-environmental causes. The hundreds of NGOs throughout Brazil produce documents containing both useful information and passionate criticisms. Among the Brazilian environmental NGOs, the most visible are SOS Atlantic Forest (<link><target>SOS Mata Atlntica</target></link>), the Social-Environmental Institute (Instituto Scio-AmbientalISA), the Pro-Nature Foundation (Fundao Pr-NaturezaFunatura), and the Amazon Working Group (Grupo de Trabalho AmaznicoGTA). The Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for the Environment and Development and the Brazilian Association of Nongovernmental Organizations (Associaco Brasileira de Organizaes No-GovernamentaisABONG) are national networks, and there are various regional and thematic networks as well. The main international environmental NGOs that have offices or affiliates in Brazil are the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Conservation International (CI), and Nature Conservancy.</paragraph><paragraph>Especially after the events of the late 1980s, international organizations and developed countries have allocated significant resources for the environmental sector in Brazil. In 1992 environmental projects worth about US$6.8 million were identified, with US$2.6 in counterpart funds (funds provided by the Brazilian government). More than 70% of the total value was for sanitation, urban pollution control, and other urban environmental projects. Thus, the allocation of resources did not accord with the common belief that funding was influenced unduly by alarmist views on deforestation in the Amazon.</paragraph><paragraph>Among the specific environmental projects with international support, the most important was the National Environmental Plan (Plano Nacional do Meio AmbientePNMA), which received a US$117 million loan from the World Bank. The National Environmental Fund (Fundo Nacional do Meio AmbienteFNMA), in addition to budgetary funds, received US$20 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to finance the environmental activities of NGOs and small municipal governments. The Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forests (Programa Piloto para a Proteo das Florestas Tropicais do BrasilPPG-7) was supported by the world's seven richest countries (the so-called G-7) and the European Community, which allocated US$258 million for projects in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), created in 1990, set aside US$30 million for Brazil, part of which is managed by a national fund called Funbio. GEF also established a small grants program for NGOs, which focused on the cerrado during its pilot phase. The World Bank also made loans for environmental and natural resource management in Rondnia and Mato Grosso, in part to correct environmental and social problems that had been created by the World Bank-funded development of the northwest corridor in the 1980s.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite favorable laws, promising institutional arrangements, and external funding, the government has not, on the whole, been effective in controlling damage to the environment. This failure is only in small measure because of the opposition of anti-environmental groups. In greater part, it can be attributed to the traditional separation between official rhetoric and actual practice in Brazil. It is also related to general problems of governance, fiscal crisis, and lingering doubts about appropriate tradeoffs between the environment and development. Some of the most effective governmental action in the environmental area has occurred at the state and local levels in the most developed states and has involved NGOs. In 1994 the PNMA began to stress decentralization and strengthening of state environmental agencies, a tendency that subsequently gained momentum.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Environment - current issues:</bold><link><target>Deforestation</target></link><space/>in Amazon Basin destroys the habitat and endangers the existence of a multitude of plant and animal species indigenous to the area; there is a lucrative illegal wildlife trade; air and water pollution in<space/><link><target>Rio de Janeiro</target></link>, So Paulo, and several other large cities; land degradation and water pollution caused by improper mining activities; wetland degradation; severe oil spills<xhtml:br></xhtml:br><italics>note:</italics>President<space/><link><target>Fernando Henrique Cardoso</target><part>Cardoso</part></link><space/>in September 1999 signed into force an environmental crime bill which for the first time defines<space/><link><target>pollution</target></link><space/>and deforestation as crimes punishable by stiff fines and jail sentences</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Environment - international agreements:</bold><xhtml:br></xhtml:br><italics>party to:</italics>Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-<link><target>Kyoto Protocol</target></link>, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling<xhtml:br></xhtml:br><italics>signed, but not ratified:</italics>none of selected agreements</paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>loc</target></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>CIA World Factbook</target></template></listitem></list><heading level='2'>External links</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.wdl.org/en/item/807'>Brazil</link><space/>- from 1565<space/><template><target>en icon</target></template></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.wdl.org/en/item/1074'>Brazil: of the Noble Class, of Loves, and of Letters</link><space/>a map from around 1640<space/><template><target>la icon</target></template><space/><template><target>en icon</target></template></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Brazil topics</target></template><template><target>Geography of South America</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Geography Of Brazil</target></template><link><target>Category:Geography of Brazil</target><part></part></link></paragraph></article>
