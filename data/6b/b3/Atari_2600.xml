At first, the design was not going to be cartridge-based, but after seeing a &quot;fake&quot; cartridge system on another machine, they realized they could place the games on cartridges essentially for the price of the connector and packaging.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1976,<space/><link><target>Fairchild Semiconductor</target></link><space/>released their own CPU-based system, the<space/><link><target>Fairchild Channel F</target><part>Video Entertainment System</part></link>.

However, both systems were now in the midst of a vicious round of price-cutting:<space/><italics>Pong</italics><space/>clones that had been made obsolete by these newer and more powerful machines were sold off to discounters for ever-lower prices. Soon many of the clone companies were out of business, and both Fairchild and Atari Inc. were selling to a public that was completely burnt out on Pong. In 1977, Atari Inc. sold 250,000 Video Computer Systems.</paragraph><paragraph>For the first year of production, the Video Computer System was manufactured in<space/><link><target>Sunnyvale, California</target></link>. The consoles manufactured there had thick plastic molding around the sides and bottom. These added weight to the console, and because all six switches were on the front, these consoles were nicknamed &quot;Heavy Sixers&quot;. After this first year, production moved to<space/><link><target>Hong Kong</target></link>, and the consoles manufactured there had thinner plastic molding. In 1978, only 550,000 units from a production run of 800,000 were sold, requiring further financial support from Warner to cover losses. This led directly to the disagreements that caused Atari Inc. founder Nolan Bushnell to leave the company in 1978.<extension extension_name='ref'>Steve Fulton,<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3766/atari_the_golden_years__a_.php?page=6'>&quot;Atari: The Golden Years -- A History, 1978-1981&quot;</link>,<space/><italics>Gamasutra</italics>, 21 August 2008, pg. 6</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Once the public realized it was possible to play video games other than<space/><italics>Pong</italics>, and programmers learned how to push its hardware's capabilities, the VCS gained popularity.

One advantage the 2600 has over more powerful contemporary competitors such as the<space/><link><target>ColecoVision</target></link><space/>is that the 2600 has no protection against altering settings in mid-line. For example, although each sprite nominally has only one color, it is possible to color the rows differently by changing the sprite's color as it is drawn. If the two hardware sprites are not enough for a game, a developer may share one sprite among several objects (as with the ghosts in<space/><italics><link><target>Pac-Man (Atari 2600)</target><part>Pac-Man</part></link></italics>) or draw software sprites, which is only a little more difficult than drawing a fixed playfield. The<space/><italics><link><target>Pitfall!</target></link></italics><space/>screenshot below (section: &quot;Games&quot;) demonstrates some of these tricks: the player is a multicolor sprite, one sprite is multiplexed for the logs and the scorpion, and the swinging vine is drawn by shifting the position of the &quot;ball&quot; on each scan line. Despite the hardware limitations, many Atari 2600 games have a lot of action on the screen, creating an engaging experience.</paragraph><paragraph>Additionally, the 2600 supports several types of input devices (joysticks, paddles, keyboards, etc.) as well as third-party peripherals. Many of these peripherals are interchangeable with the<space/><link><target>MSX</target></link><space/>and other Japanese systems; and, in some cases, it is possible to use the Atari joysticks with the<space/><link><target>Commodore 64</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Commodore 128</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Amiga</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Sega Master System</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Sega Genesis</target><part>Mega Drive/Genesis</part></link>, though functionality may be somewhat limited. Also, although Master System and Mega Drive/Genesis controllers work on the Atari 2600, only the &quot;B&quot; button can be used in most games. Another adapter is the<space/><link><target>Starpath Supercharger</target></link>, an add-on created by Starpath to expand the game capabilities of the Atari 2600. The Supercharger's interface adds an extra 6 kB to the Atari 2600's 128 bytes of RAM, allowing for larger games with higher-resolution graphics. A cord coming out of the side of the cartridge plugs into the earphone jack of any standard cassette player. Games for the Supercharger are stored on standard audio cassettes.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Color and graphics</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Television Interface Adapter</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The Atari 2600 uses different color palettes depending on the television signal format used.<extension extension_name='ref'>Atari 2600<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/archives/200109/msg00285.html'>&quot;TIA color chart&quot;</link>.</extension><space/>With the NTSC format, a 128-color palette is available,<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://yearofcodes.tumblr.com/what-is-rgb<space/></arg><arg name="title">What is RGB colour?<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2014-03-12</arg></template></extension><space/>while in PAL, only 104 colors are available.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">August 2015</arg></template><space/>Additionally, the<space/><link><target>SECAM</target></link><space/>palette consists of only 8 colors.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">August 2015</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Games</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:A2600 Pitfall.png</target><part>thumbnail</part><part>right</part><part>''<link><target>Pitfall!</target></link>'', one of the most popular third party games for the Atari 2600.</part></link><template><target>Main</target><arg>List of Atari 2600 games</arg><arg>List of Atari 2600 prototype games</arg></template>In 1977, nine games were released on cartridge to accompany the launch of the machine, including Outlaw, Space War and Breakout.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.retrogamer.net/profiles/hardware/atari-2600/</extension><space/>During the console's lifetime, Atari Inc and Atari Corp. published many titles: these games included<space/><italics><link><target>Adventure (Atari 2600)</target><part>Adventure</part></link></italics><space/>(often credited as starting the<space/><link><target>action-adventure game</target></link><space/>genre<extension extension_name='ref' name="WarrenSite"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last"><space/>Robinett

While Atari never officially stated the reason for not releasing the 2000, experts have cited the poor quality and durability of its built-in joysticks and the greater in-house popularity of the competing 2600 Jr. design as the most likely reasons.<extension extension_name='ref' name="atari2000"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="author">Curt Vendel<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2000/a2000.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Atari CX-2000 Prototype<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Atari Museum<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2009-07-06</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Atari 3200</heading><paragraph>Atari started work on a replacement to the 2600, called the<space/><bold>Atari 3200</bold>, with codenames including Super Stella, Sylvia, and PAM (a note attached reads &quot;Super Stella: Multipurpose&quot;). The system was to have compatibility with Atari 2600 cartridges, and was rumored to be based on a 10-bit processor, although design documents shows it was to actually be based around the<space/><link><target>MOS Technology 6502</target><part>6502</part></link><space/>8-bit CPU.

Despite the relative simplicity of the 2600 system, it is not an easy system to emulate. While it does not require a lot of computational power to emulate the 2600, it is hard to accurately do so. For example, because of the lack of a<space/><link><target>frame buffer</target></link>, 2600<space/><link><target>Video game console emulator</target><part>emulators</part></link><space/>must not only emulate the console, but the television as well. Due to the longevity of the system, many 2600 games use undocumented features, and even exploit bugs in the<space/><link><target>Computer hardware</target><part>hardware</part></link><space/>to squeeze the most functionality and performance out of the system, doing things even the original designers would deem impossible. A notable example is the starfield of the game<space/><italics><link><target>Cosmic Ark</target></link></italics>.
