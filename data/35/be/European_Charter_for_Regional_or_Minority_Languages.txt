The '''European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages''' ('''ECRML''') is a European [[treaty]] (CETS 148) adopted in 1992  under the auspices of the [[Council of Europe]] to protect and promote historical [[regional language|regional]] and [[minority language]]s in [[Europe]]. The preparation for the charter was undertaken by the predecessor to the current [[Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe|Congress of Local and Regional Authorities]], the Standing Conference of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe because involvement of local and regional government was essential. The actual charter was written in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] based on the Congress' Recommendations. It only applies to [[language]]s traditionally used by the nationals of the State Parties (thus excluding languages used by recent [[immigrant]]s from other states, see [[immigrant language]]s), which significantly differ from the majority or [[official language]] (thus excluding what the state party wishes to consider as mere local dialects of the official or majority language) and that either have a territorial basis (and are therefore traditionally spoken by populations of regions or areas within the State) or are used by linguistic minorities within the State as a whole (thereby including such languages as [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Romani language|Romani]], which are used over a wide geographic area).

Some states, such as the Ukraine and Sweden, have tied the status of minority language to the recognized national minorities, which are defined by ethnic, cultural and/or religious criteria, thereby circumventing the Charter's notion of linguistic minority. 

Languages that are official within regions, provinces or federal units within a State (for example [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in [[Spain]]) are not classified as official languages of the State and may therefore benefit from the Charter. On the other hand, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] has not been able to sign the Charter on behalf of the [[Irish language]] (although a minority language) as it is defined as the first official language of the state. The [[United Kingdom]] has ratified the Charter in respect to (among other languages) [[Welsh language|Welsh]] in [[Wales]] and [[Irish language in Northern Ireland|Irish]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. [[France]], although a signatory, has been constitutionally blocked from ratifying the Charter in respect to the [[languages of France]].

The charter provides a large number of different actions state parties can take to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages. There are two levels of protection&mdash;all signatories must apply the lower level of protection to qualifying languages. Signatories may further declare that a qualifying language or languages will benefit from the higher level of protection, which lists a range of actions from which states must agree to undertake at least 35.

==Protections==
Countries can ratify the charter in respect of its minority languages based on Part II or Part III of the charter, which contain varying principles. Countries can treat languages differently under the charter, for example, in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Welsh language]] is ratified under the general Part II principles as well as the more specific Part III commitments, while the [[Cornish language]] is ratified only under Part II.

===Part II===
Part II of the Charter details eight main principles and objectives upon which States must base their policies and legislation. They are seen as a framework for the preservation of the languages concerned.<ref name="about">[http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/aboutcharter/default_en.asp About the Charter - Council of Europe]</ref>
*Recognition of regional or minority languages as an expression of cultural wealth.
*Respect for the geographical area of each regional or minority language.
*The need for resolute action to promote such languages.
*The facilitation and/or encouragement of the use of such languages, in speech and writing, in public and private life.
*The provision of appropriate forms and means for the teaching and study of such languages at all appropriate stages.
*The promotion of relevant transnational exchanges.
*The prohibition of all forms of unjustified distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference relating to the use of a regional or minority language and intended to discourage or endanger its maintenance or development.
*The promotion by states of mutual understanding between all the country’s linguistic groups.

===Part III===
Part III details comprehensive rules across a number of sectors, that states agree to abide by. Each language to which Part III of the Charter is applied must be specifically named by the government. States must select at least thirty-five of the undertakings in respect of each language. Many provisions contain several options, of varying degrees of stringency, one of which has to be chosen “according to the situation of each language”.  The areas from which these specific undertakings must be chosen are as follows:<ref name="about" />
*Education
*Judicial authorities
*Administrative authorities and public services
*Media
*Cultural activities and facilities
*Economic and social life
*Transfrontier exchanges
