The contracts are negotiated at a<space/><link><target>futures exchange</target></link>, which acts as an intermediary between buyer and seller. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future, the &quot;buyer&quot; of the contract, is said to be &quot;<link><target>Long (finance)</target><part>long</part></link>&quot;, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future, the &quot;seller&quot; of the contract, is said to be &quot;<link><target>Short (finance)</target><part>short</part></link>&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>While the futures contract specifies a trade taking place in the future, the purpose of the futures exchange is to act as intermediary and mitigate the risk of default by either party in the intervening period. For this reason, the futures exchange requires both parties to put up an initial amount of cash (performance bond), the<space/><link><target>Futures contract#Margin</target><part>margin</part></link>. Margins, sometimes set as a percentage of the value of the futures contract, need to be proportionally maintained at all times during the life of the contract to underpin this mitigation because the price of the contract will vary in keeping with supply and demand and will change daily and thus one party or the other will theoretically be making or losing money. To mitigate risk and the possibility of default by either party, the product is marked to market on a daily basis whereby the difference between the prior agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is settled on a daily basis. This is sometimes known as the variation margin where the futures exchange will draw money out of the losing party's margin account and put it into the other party's thus ensuring that the correct daily loss or profit is reflected in the respective account. If the margin account goes below a certain value set by the Exchange, then a margin call is made and the account owner must replenish the margin account. This process is known as &quot;marking to market&quot;. Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the<space/><link><target>spot price</target><part>spot value</part></link><space/>(i.e., the original value agreed upon, since any gain or loss has already been previously settled by marking to market). Upon marketing the strike price is often reached and creates lots of income for the &quot;caller&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>A closely related contract is a<space/><link><target>forward contract</target></link>. A forward is like a futures in that it specifies the exchange of goods for a specified price at a specified future date. However, a forward is not traded on an exchange and thus does not have the interim partial payments due to marking to market. Nor is the contract standardized, as on the exchange.Unlike an<space/><link><target>option (finance)</target><part>option</part></link>, both parties of a futures contract must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying asset to the buyer, or, if it is a cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures<space/><link><target>position (finance)</target><part>position</part></link><space/>can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date.

commodities, stocks, bonds, interest rates and currencies, but they can also be other derivatives, which adds another layer of complexity to proper valuation. The components of a firm's capital structure, e.g., bonds and stock, can also be considered derivatives, more precisely options, with the underlying being the firm's assets, but this is unusual outside of technical contexts.</paragraph><paragraph>From the economic point of view, financial derivatives are cash flows, that are conditionally stochastically and discounted to present value.

Derivatives therefore allow the breakup of ownership and participation in the market value of an asset. This also provides a considerable amount of freedom regarding the contract design. That contractual freedom allows to modify the participation in the performance of the underlying asset almost arbitrarily. Thus, the participation in the market value of the underlying can be effectively weaker, stronger (leverage effect), or implemented as inverse. Hence, specifically the market price risk of the underlying asset can be controlled in almost every situation.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ssrn.com"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>There are two groups of derivative contracts: the privately traded<space/><link><target>over-the-counter (finance)</target><part>over-the-counter</part></link><space/>(OTC) derivatives such as<space/><link><target>swap (finance)</target><part>swaps</part></link><space/>that do not go through an exchange or other intermediary, and<space/><link><target>Exchange-traded derivative contract</target><part>exchange-traded derivatives</part></link><space/>(ETD) that are traded through specialized<space/><link><target>derivatives exchange</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>or other exchanges.</paragraph><paragraph>Derivatives are more common in the modern era, but their origins trace back several centuries.

This distinction is important because the former is a prudent aspect of operations and financial management for many firms across many industries; the latter offers managers and investors a risky opportunity to increase profit, which may not be properly disclosed to stakeholders.</paragraph><paragraph>Along with many other financial products and services, derivatives reform is an element of the<space/><link><target>DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</target></link><space/>of 2010.

Based upon movements in the underlying asset over time, however, the value of the contract will fluctuate, and the derivative may be either an asset (i.e. &quot;<link><target>in the money</target></link>&quot;) or a liability (i.e. &quot;<link><target>out of the money</target></link>&quot;) at different points throughout its life. Importantly, either party is therefore exposed to the credit quality of its<space/><link><target>counterparty</target></link><space/>and is interested in protecting itself in an<space/><link><target>event of default</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Option products have immediate value at the outset because they provide specified protection (<link><target>intrinsic value (finance)</target><part>intrinsic value</part></link>) over a given time period (<link><target>Option time value</target><part>time value</part></link>). One common form of option product familiar to many consumers is insurance for homes and automobiles. The insured would pay more for a policy with greater liability protections (intrinsic value) and one that extends for a year rather than six months (time value). Because of the immediate option value, the option purchaser typically pays an up front premium. Just like for lock products, movements in the underlying asset will cause the option's intrinsic value to change over time while its time value deteriorates steadily until the contract expires. An important difference between a lock product is that, after the initial exchange, the option purchaser has no further liability to its counterparty; upon maturity, the purchaser will execute the option if it has positive value (i.e. if it is &quot;in the money&quot;) or expire at no cost (other than to the initial premium) (i.e. if the option is &quot;out of the money&quot;).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Hedging</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Hedge (finance)</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Derivatives allow risk related to the price of the underlying asset to be transferred from one party to another. For example, a<space/><link><target>wheat</target></link><space/>farmer and a<space/><link><target>miller</target></link><space/>could sign a<space/><link><target>futures contract</target></link><space/>to exchange a specified amount of cash for a specified amount of wheat in the future. Both parties have reduced a future risk: for the wheat farmer, the uncertainty of the price, and for the miller, the availability of wheat. However, there is still the risk that no wheat will be available because of events unspecified by the contract, such as the weather, or not that one party will<space/><link><target>Revocation</target><part>renege</part></link><space/>on the contract. Although a third party, called a<space/><link><target>clearing house (finance)</target><part>clearing house</part></link>, insures a futures contract, not all derivatives are insured against counter-party risk.</paragraph><paragraph>From another perspective, the farmer and the miller both reduce a risk and acquire a risk when they sign the futures contract: the farmer reduces the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract and acquires the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract (thereby losing additional income that he could have earned). The miller, on the other hand, acquires the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract (thereby paying more in the future than he otherwise would have) and reduces the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract. In this sense, one party is the insurer (risk taker) for one type of risk, and the counter-party is the insurer (risk taker) for another type of risk.</paragraph><paragraph>Hedging also occurs when an individual or institution buys an asset (such as a commodity, a bond that has<space/><link><target>coupon (bond)</target><part>coupon payments</part></link>, a stock that pays dividends, and so on) and sells it using a futures contract. The individual or institution has access to the asset for a specified amount of time, and can then sell it in the future at a specified price according to the futures contract. Of course, this allows the individual or institution the benefit of holding the asset, while reducing the risk that the future selling price will deviate unexpectedly from the market's current assessment of the future value of the asset.<link><target>File:Chicago bot.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>250px</part><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>Derivatives traders at the<space/><link><target>Chicago Board of Trade</target></link></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Derivatives trading of this kind may serve the financial interests of certain particular businesses.<extension extension_name='ref'>Peterson, Sam (2010).

The distinction is critical because regulation should help to isolate and curtail speculation with derivatives, especially for &quot;systemically significant&quot; institutions whose default could be large enough to threaten the entire financial system. At the same time, the legislation should allow for responsible parties to hedge risk without unduly tying up working capital as collateral that firms may better employ elsewhere in their operations and investment.<extension extension_name='ref'>Zubrod, Luke (2011).

More importantly, the reasonable collateral that secures these different counterparties can be very different. The distinction between these firms is not always straight forward (e.g. hedge funds or even some private equity firms do not neatly fit either category). Finally, even financial users must be differentiated, as 'large' banks may classified as &quot;systemically significant&quot; whose derivatives activities must be more tightly monitored and restricted than those of smaller, local and regional banks.</paragraph><paragraph>Over-the-counter dealing will be less common as the<space/><link><target>DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</target></link><space/>comes into effect.
