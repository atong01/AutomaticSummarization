'''Dionysius Thrax''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Διονύσιος ὁ Θρᾷξ}}, {{IPA-el|di.o.ný.si.os ho tʰrâːɪ̯ks|a}}, Contemporary [[Koine]]: {{IPA-el|di.o.ný.si.os ho tʰrâːks|k}}; 170–90 BC) was a [[Hellenization|Hellenistic]] [[Philologist|grammarian]] and a pupil of [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]]. His place of origin was not [[Thrace]] as the epithet "Thrax" denotes, but probably [[Alexandria]] (his father's descent was Thracian). He lived and worked in this city but later taught at [[Rhodes]].

The first extant grammar of [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[Art of Grammar]]'' ({{lang|grc|Τέχνη γραμματική}} ''Tékhnē grammatiké'') is attributed to him but many scholars today doubt that the work really belongs solely to him due to the difference between the technical approach of most of the work and the more literary approach (similar to the 2nd century's Alexandrian tradition) of the first few sections. It concerns itself primarily with a [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] description of Greek, lacking any treatment of [[syntax]]. The work was translated into [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Syriac]] in the early [[Christian]] era.

Thrax defines grammar at the beginning of the ''Tékhnē'' as "the practical knowledge of the general usages of [[poet]]s and [[prose]] writers." Thus Dionysius Thrax, like contemporary Alexandrian scholars who edited [[Attic Greek]] and [[Homer|Homeric texts]], was concerned with facilitating the teaching of classic Greek literature to an audience who spoke [[Koine]] Greek.<ref>There are extensive scholia to the Techne, which have been edited by A. Hilgard in 1901: Scholia in Dionysii Thracis Artem Grammaticam, recensuit et apparatum criticum indicesque adiecit Alfredus Hilgard, Lipsiae: in aedibus B.G. Teubneri 1901. The collections of scholia are the following: Prolegomena Vossiana (p.1); Commentarius Melampodis seu Diomedis (p. 10); Commentarius Heliodori (p. 67); Scholiorum collectio Vaticana (p. 106); Scholiorum collectio Marciana (p. 292); Scholiorum collectio Londinensis (p. 442); Commentariolus Byzantinus (pp. 565–586).</ref>
