'''Telecommunications in Botswana''' include newspapers, radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.

In addition to the government-owned newspaper and national [[radio]] network, there is an active, independent [[mass media|press]] (six weekly newspapers). Foreign publications are sold without restriction in Botswana. Two privately owned radio stations began operations in 1999. Botswana's first national television station, the government-owned [[Botswana TV|Botswana Television]] (BTV), was launched in July 2000. It began broadcasting with three hours of programming on weekdays and five on weekends, offering news in [[Setswana]] and [[English language|English]], entertainment, and [[sport]]s, with plans to produce 60% of its programming locally.  The [[cellular phone]] providers [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] and [[MTN Group|MTN]] cover most of the country.{{citation needed |date=January 2014}}
