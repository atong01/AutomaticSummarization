Just so, too, when the Christian dies, the body is left in the grave, an empty shell, but the soul takes wings and flies away to be with God. Thus you see that though an egg seems to be as dead as a sone, yet it really has life in it; and also it is like Christ's dead body, which was raised to life again. This is the reason we use eggs on Easter.

Even here, this relationship does not suddenly appear, but represents developments in ritual narrative that mus have begun at the very inception of the Christian message. Jesus of Nazareth was crucified during Pesach-Mazzot, an event that a new covenant people of Jews and Gentiles both saw as definitive and defining.

Whether there are baptisms at this point or not, it is traditional for the congregation to renew the vows of their baptismal faith. This act is often sealed by the sprinkling of the congregation with<space/><link><target>holy water</target></link><space/>from the font. The Catholic<space/><link><target>sacrament</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Confirmation</target></link><space/>is also celebrated at the Vigil.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Procesion semana santa jpereira.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>left</part><part><link><target>Holy Week</target></link><space/>procession in<space/><link><target>Santiago de Compostela</target></link>, Spain.</part></link>The Easter Vigil concludes with the celebration of the<space/><link><target>Eucharist</target></link><space/>(known in some traditions as Holy Communion). Certain variations in the Easter Vigil exist: Some churches read the Old Testament lessons before the procession of the Paschal candle, and then read the gospel immediately after the Exsultet.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:2007sunriseservice.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>250px</part><part>Sunrise service in<space/><link><target>Rockland, Maine</target></link>, United States.</part></link>Some churches prefer to keep this vigil very early on the Sunday morning instead of the Saturday night to reflect the gospel account of the women coming to the tomb at dawn on the first day of the week. These services are known as the<space/><link><target>Sunrise service</target></link><space/>and often occur in outdoor setting such as the church cemetery, yard, or a nearby park.</paragraph><paragraph>The first recorded &quot;Sunrise Service&quot; took place in 1732 among the Single Brethren in the<space/><link><target>Moravian Church</target><part>Moravian</part></link><space/>congregation at<space/><link><target>Herrnhut</target></link>, Saxony, in what is now Germany. Following an all-night<space/><link><target>vigil</target></link><space/>they went before dawn to the town graveyard,<space/><link><target>God's Acre</target></link>, on the hill above the town, to celebrate the Resurrection among the graves of the departed. This service was repeated the following year by the whole congregation and subsequently spread with the Moravian Missionaries around the world, including<space/><link><target>Old Salem</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Winston-Salem</target></link>,<space/><link><target>North Carolina</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Additional celebrations are usually offered on Easter Sunday itself. Typically these services follow the usual order of Sunday services in a congregation, but also typically incorporate more highly festive elements. The music of the service, in particular, often displays a highly festive tone; the incorporation of brass instruments (trumpets, etc.) to supplement a congregation's usual instrumentation is common. Often a congregation's worship space is decorated with special banners and flowers (such as<space/><link><target>Lilium longiflorum</target><part>Easter lilies</part></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>In predominantly Roman Catholic Philippines, the morning of Easter (known in the national language as &quot;Pasko ng Muling Pagkabuhay&quot; or the Pasch of the Resurrection) is marked with joyous celebration, the first being the dawn &quot;Salubong&quot;, wherein large statues of Jesus and Mary are brought together to meet, imagining the first reunion of Jesus and his mother Mary after Jesus' Resurrection. This is followed by the joyous Easter Mass.</paragraph><paragraph>In Polish culture, the Rezurekcja (Resurrection Procession) is the joyous Easter morning Mass at daybreak when church bells ring out and explosions resound to commemorate Christ rising from the dead. Before the Mass begins at dawn, a festive procession with the Blessed Sacrament carried beneath a canopy encircles the church. As church bells ring out, handbells are vigorously shaken by altar boys, the air is filled with incense and the faithful raise their voices heavenward in a triumphant rendering of age-old Easter hymns. After the Blessed Sacrament is carried around the church and Adoration is complete, the Easter Mass begins. Another Polish Easter tradition is<space/><link><target>wiconka</target></link>, the blessing of Easter baskets by the parish priest on Holy Saturday. This custom is celebrated not only in Poland, but also in the United States by Polish-Americans.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Eastern Christianity</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:17th-century unknown painters - The Resurrection of Christ - WGA23478.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>17th century Russian icon of the Resurrection</part></link>Easter is the fundamental and most important festival of the<space/><link><target>Eastern Orthodoxy</target><part>Eastern</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Oriental Orthodoxy</target><part>Oriental</part></link><space/>Orthodox Churches:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'><list type='ident'><listitem>This is the Expected and Holy Day,</listitem><listitem>the One among the Sabbaths,</listitem><listitem>the Sovereign and Lady of days,</listitem><listitem>Feast of feasts, Celebration of celebrations,</listitem><listitem>on which we praise Christ for all eternity!</listitem></list></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Paskhakustodiev.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>200px</part><part><link><target>Boris Kustodiev</target></link>'s ''Pascha Greetings'' (1912) shows traditional Russian ''<link><target>Paschal greeting</target><part>khristosovanie</part></link>'' (exchanging a triple kiss), with such foods as<space/><link><target>Easter eggs</target><part>red eggs</part></link>,<space/><link><target>kulich</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>paskha (dish)</target><part>paskha</part></link><space/>in the background.</part></link>Every other religious festival in their calendar, including Christmas, is secondary in importance to the celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.
