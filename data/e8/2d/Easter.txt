In Orthodoxy, the season of Pascha begins on Pascha and ends with the coming of the fortieth day, the [[Feast of the Ascension]].

Easter and the holidays that are related to it are ''[[moveable feast]]s'' in that they do not fall on a fixed date in the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] or [[Julian calendar|Julian]] calendars which follow only the cycle of the sun; rather, its date is determined on a [[lunisolar calendar]] similar to the [[Hebrew calendar]]. The [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) established two rules, independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity, which were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the council. No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that took centuries and generated a number of [[Easter controversy|controversies]]. It has come to be the first Sunday after the [[full moon]] that occurs on or soonest after 21 March,<ref name="oikoumene.org">[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-date-of-easter.html Frequently asked questions about the date of Easter]</ref> but calculations vary in [[Eastern Christianity|East]] and [[Western Christianity|West]]. Details of this complicated computation are found below in the section [[Easter#Date|Date]].

Easter is linked to the Jewish [[Passover]] by much of its symbolism, as well as by its position in the calendar. In many languages, the words for "Easter" and "Passover" are identical or very similar.<ref>{{cite book|first=Francis X.|last=Weiser|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/3957343/Handbook-of-Christian-Feasts-and-Customs|title=Handbook of Christian Feasts and Customs|page=214|location=New York|publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Company|year=1958|isbn=0-15-138435-5}}</ref> [[Easter customs]] vary across the [[Christendom|Christian world]], and include [[sunrise service]]s, exclaiming the [[Paschal greeting]], [[clipping the church]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198607663.001.0001/acref-9780198607663-e-201 | title=clipping the church | publisher=Oxford University Press | work=Oxford Reference|accessdate=30 March 2013| doi=10.1093/acref/9780198607663.001.0001 }}</ref> and decorating [[Easter eggs]], a symbol of the [[empty tomb]].<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=mzKVPZthGHUC&pg=PA51&dq=easter+egg+Christian#v=onepage&q=easter%20egg%20Christian&f=false|title = Christianity|publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]]|author= Anne Jordan|quote=Easter eggs are used as a Christian symbol to represent the empty tomb.

Just so, too, when the Christian dies, the body is left in the grave, an empty shell, but the soul takes wings and flies away to be with God. Thus you see that though an egg seems to be as dead as a sone, yet it really has life in it; and also it is like Christ's dead body, which was raised to life again. This is the reason we use eggs on Easter.

==Etymology==
{{main|Names of Easter}}
The modern English term ''Easter'', [[cognate]] with modern German ''Ostern'', developed from an [[Old English language|Old English]] word that usually appears in the form ''Ēastrun'', ''-on'', or ''-an''; but also as ''Ēastru'', ''-o''; and ''Ēastre'' or ''Ēostre''.<ref group ="nb">{{IPA-ang|ˈæːɑstre, ˈeːostre}}</ref> The most widely accepted theory of the origin of the term is that it is derived from the name of a goddess mentioned by the 7th to 8th-century English monk [[Bede]], who wrote that ''Ēosturmōnaþ'' (Old English 'Month of Ēostre', translated in Bede's time as "Paschal month") was an English month, corresponding to April, which he says "was once called after a [[List of Germanic deities|goddess]] of theirs named [[Ēostre]], in whose honour feasts were celebrated in that month".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yFsw-Vaup6sC&pg=PA53&dq=Eosturmonath+%22English+months%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ceD2U4feF4SL7Aat7oAI&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Eosturmonath%20%22English%20months%22&f=false Bede, ''The Reckoning of Time'', translated by Faith Wallis (Liverpool University Press 1999 ISBN 978-0-85323693-1), p. 54]</ref>

In Greek and Latin, the Christian celebration was and is called Πάσχα, ''Pascha'', a word derived from Aramaic פסחא, cognate to Hebrew פֶּסַח (''Pesach''). The word originally denoted the Jewish festival, known in English as [[Passover]], commemorating the story of [[the Exodus]].<ref name="HC">{{cite web | url=http://www.history.com/topics/history-of-easter/videos#history-of-the-holidays-easter-video | title=History of Easter | publisher=A&E Television Networks | work=The History Channel website | accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=PB-zfFmR0I0C&pg=PA21&dq=%22Pascha%22+name#v=onepage&q=%22Pascha%22%20name&f=false|title = The Antenicene Pascha: A Rhetorical History|author=Karl Gerlach|publisher = Peeters Publishers|quote=The second century equivalent of easter and the paschal Triduum was called by both Greek and Latin writers "Pascha (πάσχα)", a Greek transliteration of the Aramaic form of the Hebrew פֶּסַח, the Passover feast of Ex. 12.|page=XVIII|year= 1998}}</ref> Already in the 50s of the 1st century, [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], writing from [[Ephesus]] to the Christians in [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]],<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|5:7|ESV}}</ref> applied the term to Christ, and it is unlikely that the [[Early Christianity|Ephesian and Corinthian Christians]] were the first to hear Exodus 12 interpreted as speaking about the [[death of Jesus]], not just about the Jewish Passover ritual.<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=PB-zfFmR0I0C&pg=PA21&dq=%22Pascha%22+name#v=onepage&q=%22Pascha%22%20name&f=false|title = The Antenicene Pascha: A Rhetorical History|author=Karl Gerlach|publisher = Peters Publishers|quote=For while it is from Ephesus that Paul writes, "Christ our Pascha has been sacrificed for us," Ephesian Christians were not likely the first to hear that Ex 12 did not speak about the rituals of Pesach, but the death of Jesus of Nazareth.|page=21|year= 1998}}</ref> In most of the non-English speaking world, the feast is known by names derived from Greek and Latin ''Pascha''.<ref name="Etymology"/><ref name="Passover"/> Pascha is also a name by which Jesus himself is remembered in the Orthodox Church, especially in connection with his resurrection and with the season of its celebration.<ref>Orthros of Holy Pascha, Stichera: "Today the sacred Pascha is revealed to us.

Easter is linked to the [[Passover]] and [[Exodus from Egypt]] recorded in the [[Old Testament]] through the [[Last Supper]], [[Passion (Christianity)|sufferings]] and [[crucifixion of Jesus]] that preceded the resurrection.<ref name=Passover/> According to the New Testament, Jesus gave the Passover meal a new meaning, as in the [[Cenacle|upper room]] during the Last Supper he prepared himself and his disciples for his death.<ref name=Passover/> He identified the [[matzah]] and cup of wine as [[Body of Christ|his body]] soon to be sacrificed and [[Blood of Christ|his blood]] soon to be shed. [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] states, "Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed";<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|5:7|NIV}}</ref> this refers to the Passover requirement to have no yeast in the house and to the allegory of Jesus as the [[Korban Pesach|Paschal lamb]].<ref>{{bibleverse||John|1:29}}, {{bibleverse||Revelation|5:6}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|1:19}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|1:2}}, and the associated notes and Passion Week table in {{cite book|editor=Barker, Kenneth|title=Zondervan NIV Study Bible|publisher=[[Zondervan]]|location=[[Grand Rapids]]|year=2002|isbn=0-310-92955-5|page=1520}}<br/>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=PB-zfFmR0I0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title = The Antenicene Pascha: A Rhetorical History|author=Karl Gerlach|publisher = Peeters Publishers|pages=32, 56|year=1998}}</ref>

One interpretation of the [[Gospel of John]] is that Jesus, as the Passover lamb, was crucified at roughly the same time as the Passover lambs were being slain in the temple, on the afternoon of [[Quartodecimanism|Nisan 14]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:6}}</ref> The scriptural instructions specify that the lamb is to be slain "between the two evenings", that is, at twilight. By the Roman period, however, the sacrifices were performed in the mid-afternoon. Josephus, ''Jewish War'' 6.10.1/423 ("They sacrifice from the ninth to the eleventh hour"). Philo, ''Special Laws'' 2.27/145 ("Many myriads of victims from noon till eventide are offered by the whole people").

This interpretation, however, is inconsistent with the [[chronology of Jesus|chronology]] in the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. It assumes that text literally translated "the preparation of the passover" in John 19:14 refers to Nisan 14 (Preparation Day for the Passover) and not necessarily to [[Yom Shishi]] (Friday, Preparation Day for the Passover week [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]])<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:18}}, {{bibleverse||John|13:2}}, {{bibleverse||John|18:28}}, {{bibleverse||John|19:14}}.<br />{{cite book|editor=Barker, Kenneth|title=Zondervan NIV Study Bible|publisher=[[Zondervan]]|location=Grand Rapids|year=2002|isbn=0-310-92955-5}}</ref> and that the priests' desire to be ritually pure in order to "eat the passover"<ref>{{bibleverse||John|18:28|YLT}}</ref> refers to eating the Passover lamb, not to the public offerings made during the days of Unleavened Bread.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:8|KJV}}</ref>

==In the early Church==
[[File:Last-supper-from-Kremikovtsi.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Last Supper]] celebrated by Jesus and his disciples. The early Christians too would have celebrated this meal to commemorate Jesus' death and subsequent resurrection.]] The first Christians, [[Jewish Christians|Jewish]] and [[Gentile]], were certainly aware of the [[Hebrew calendar]].<ref group="nb">{{bibleverse||Acts|2:1}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|12:3}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|20:6}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|27:9}}, {{bibleverse|1|Cor|16:8}}</ref> Jewish Christians, the first to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus, timed the observance in relation to Passover.

Direct evidence for a more fully formed Christian festival of Pascha (Easter) begins to appear in the mid-2nd century. Perhaps the earliest extant primary source referring to Easter is a mid-2nd-century Paschal [[homily]] attributed to [[Melito of Sardis]], which characterizes the celebration as a well-established one.<ref name = "Melito">

While martyrs' days (usually the individual dates of martyrdom) were celebrated on fixed dates in the local solar calendar, the date of Easter was fixed by means of the local Jewish [[lunisolar]] calendar. This is consistent with the celebration of Easter having entered Christianity during its earliest, [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish period]], but does not leave the question free of doubt.<ref>Cheslyn Jones, Geoffrey Wainwright, Edward Yarnold, and Paul Bradshaw, Eds., ''The Study of Liturgy, Revised Edition'', Oxford University Press, New York, 1992, p. 459:"[Easter] is the only feast of the Christian Year that can plausibly claim to go back to apostolic times&nbsp;... [It] must derive from a time when Jewish influence was effective&nbsp;... because it depends on the lunar calendar (every other feast depends on the solar calendar)."</ref>

The ecclesiastical historian [[Socrates Scholasticus]] attributes the observance of Easter by the church to the perpetuation of its custom, "just as many other customs have been established", stating that neither Jesus nor his [[Apostles]] enjoined the keeping of this or any other festival. Although he describes the details of the Easter celebration as deriving from local custom, he insists the feast itself is universally observed.<ref>Socrates, ''Church History'', 5.22, in {{cite web| last = Schaff| first = Philip| title = The Author's Views respecting the Celebration of Easter, Baptism, Fasting, Marriage, the Eucharist, and Other Ecclesiastical Rites.| work = Socrates and Sozomenus Ecclesiastical Histories| publisher = Calvin College Christian Classics Ethereal Library|date=13 July 2005| url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.viii.xxiii.html| accessdate =28 March 2007}}</ref>

Jesus of Nazareth was crucified during Pesach-Mazzot, an event that a new covenant people of Jews and Gentiles both saw as definitive and defining.

Easter and the holidays that are related to it are ''[[moveable feast]]s'', in that they do not fall on a fixed date in the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] or [[Julian calendar|Julian]] calendars (both of which follow the cycle of the sun and the seasons). Instead, the date for Easter is determined on a [[lunisolar calendar]] similar to the [[Hebrew calendar]]. The [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) established two rules, independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity, which were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the Council. No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that took centuries and generated a number of [[Easter controversy|controversies]]. (See also [[Computus]] and [[Reform of the date of Easter]].) In particular, the Council did not decree that Easter must fall on Sunday. This was already the practice almost everywhere.<ref>{{harvnb|Sozomen|loc=Book 7, Chapter 18}}</ref>

In [[Western Christianity]], using the Gregorian calendar, Easter always falls on a Sunday between 22 March and 25 April inclusive, within about seven days after the astronomical full moon.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter]. Article from [[United States Naval Observatory]] (27 March 2007).</ref> The following day, [[Easter Monday]], is a [[legal holiday]] in many countries with predominantly Christian traditions.

[[Eastern Christianity]] bases its calculations on the [[Julian Calendar]]. Because of the 13-day difference between the calendars between 1900 and 2099, 21 March corresponds, during the 21st century, to 3 April in the [[Gregorian Calendar]]. Easter therefore varies between 4 April and 8 May on the Gregorian calendar (the Julian calendar is no longer used as the civil calendar of the countries where Eastern Christian traditions predominate). Also, because the Julian "full moon" is always several days after the astronomical full moon, the eastern Easter is often later, relative to the visible moon's phases, than western Easter.

Among the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] some churches have changed from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar and the date for Easter as for other fixed and moveable feasts is the same as in the Western church.<ref>"The Church in Malankara switched entirely to the Gregorian calendar in 1953, following Encyclical No. 620 from Patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem I, dt. December 1952." [http://sor.cua.edu/Calendar/index.html Calendars of the Syriac Orthodox Church]. Retrieved 22 April 2009</ref>

===Computations===
{{Main|Computus}}
In 725, [[Bede]] succinctly wrote, "The Sunday following the full Moon which falls on or after the [[equinox]] will give the lawful Easter."<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yFsw-Vaup6sC&pg=PA148 Bede: The reckoning of time]'', translated by Faith Wallis (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1999) chapter 62, p. 148.</ref> However, this does not precisely reflect the ecclesiastical rules. The full moon referred to (called the [[Paschal full moon]]) is not an astronomical full moon, but the [[ecclesiastical full moon|14th day]] of a calendar lunar month. Another difference is that the [[Equinox|astronomical equinox]] is a natural astronomical phenomenon, which can fall on 19, 20 or 21 March, while the ecclesiastical date is fixed by convention on 21 March.<ref>Paragraph 7 of [[Inter gravissimas]] [http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/138351/138352/1311683/4020763/2015225/8601RevN005_Inter_Gravissimas.pdf?nodeid=2179035&vernum=0refers ISO.org] to "the vernal equinox, which was fixed by the fathers of the [first] [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene Council]] at XII calends April [21 March]". This definition can be traced at least back to chapters 6 & 59 of [[Bede]]'s ''[[De temporum ratione]]'' (725).</ref>

In applying the ecclesiastical rules, Christian churches use 21 March as the starting point in determining the date of Easter, from which they find the next full moon, etc. The [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] continue to use the Julian calendar. Their starting point in determining the date of Orthodox Easter is also 21 March but according to the Julian reckoning, which in the current century corresponds to 3 April in the Gregorian calendar.

In addition, the lunar tables of the Julian calendar are four days (sometimes five days) behind those of the Gregorian calendar. The 14th day of the lunar month according to the Gregorian system is figured as the ninth or tenth day according to the Julian. The result of this combination of solar and lunar discrepancies is divergence in the date of Easter in most years (see table).

Easter is determined on the basis of [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] cycles. The lunar year consists of 30-day and 29-day lunar months, generally alternating, with an [[embolismic month]] added periodically to bring the lunar cycle into line with the solar cycle. In each solar year (1 January to 31 December inclusive), the lunar month beginning with an [[ecclesiastical new moon]] falling in the 29-day period from 8 March to 5 April inclusive is designated as the paschal lunar month for that year.<ref name="smart.net">Montes, Marcos J. [http://www.smart.net/~mmontes/ec-cal.html "Calculation of the Ecclesiastical Calendar"]. Retrieved 12 January 2008.</ref>

Easter is the third Sunday in the paschal lunar month, or, in other words, the Sunday after the paschal lunar month's 14th day. The 14th of the paschal lunar month is designated by convention as the [[Paschal full moon]], although the 14th of the lunar month may differ from the date of the astronomical full moon by up to two days.<ref name="smart.net"/> Since the ecclesiastical new moon falls on a date from 8 March to 5 April inclusive, the paschal full moon (the 14th of that lunar month) must fall on a date from 21 March to 18 April inclusive.

The Gregorian calculation of Easter was based on a method devised by the [[Calabria]]n doctor [[Aloysius Lilius]] (or Lilio) for adjusting the [[epact]]s of the moon,<ref>G Moyer (1983), [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=grc..&year=1983&volume=book&page_ind=181 "Aloisius Lilius and the 'Compendium novae rationis restituendi kalendarium'"], pages 171–188 in G.V. Coyne (ed.).</ref> and has been adopted by almost all Western Christians and by Western countries which celebrate national holidays at Easter. For the British Empire and colonies, a determination of the date of Easter Sunday using [[Golden number (time)|Golden Numbers]] and [[Sunday letter]]s was defined by the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]] with its Annexe. This was designed to match exactly the Gregorian calculation.

===Controversies over the date===
{{main|Easter controversy}}
[[File:5part-icon.jpeg|thumb|right|A five-part [[Russian Orthodox]] icon depicting the Easter story.<br>Eastern Orthodox Christians use a different computation for the date of Easter than the Western churches.]]
The precise date of Easter has at times been a matter of contention. By the later 2nd century, it was widely accepted that the celebration of the holiday was a practice of the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] and an undisputed tradition. The [[Quartodecimanism|Quartodeciman]] controversy, the first of several [[Easter controversy|Easter controversies]], arose concerning the date on which the holiday should be celebrated.

The term "Quartodeciman" refers to the practice of celebrating Easter on [[Nisan]] 14 of the [[Hebrew calendar]], "the {{LORD}}'s passover" ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:5}}). According to the church historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], the Quartodeciman [[Polycarp]] (bishop of Smyrna, by tradition a disciple of [[John the Evangelist]]) debated the question with [[Pope Anicetus|Anicetus]] (bishop of Rome). The [[Asia (Roman province)|Roman province of Asia]] was Quartodeciman, while the Roman and Alexandrian churches continued the fast until the Sunday following (the Sunday of Unleavened Bread), wishing to associate Easter with Sunday. Neither Polycarp nor Anicetus persuaded the other, but they did not consider the matter [[schism (religion)|schismatic]] either, parting in peace and leaving the question unsettled.

Controversy arose when [[Pope Victor I|Victor]], bishop of Rome a generation after Anicetus, attempted to excommunicate [[Polycrates of Ephesus]] and all other bishops of Asia for their Quartodecimanism. According to Eusebius, a number of synods were convened to deal with the controversy, which he regarded as all ruling in support of Easter on Sunday.<ref>Eusebius, Church History 5.23.</ref> Polycrates (''circa'' 190), however, wrote to Victor defending the antiquity of Asian Quartodecimanism. Victor's attempted excommunication was apparently rescinded, and the two sides reconciled upon the intervention of bishop [[Irenaeus]] and others, who reminded Victor of the tolerant precedent of Anicetus.

Quartodecimanism seems to have lingered into the 4th century, when [[Socrates of Constantinople]] recorded that some Quartodecimans were deprived of their churches by [[John Chrysostom]]<ref>Socrates, ''Church History'', 6.11, at {{cite web| last = Schaff| first = Philip| title = Of Severian and Antiochus: their Disagreement from John.| work = Socrates and Sozomenus Ecclesiastical Histories| publisher = Calvin College Christian Classics Ethereal Library|date=13 July 2005| url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.ix.xii.html| accessdate =28 March 2009}}</ref> and that some were harassed by [[Nestorius]].<ref>Socrates, ''Church History'' 7.29, at {{cite web| last = Schaff| first = Philip| title = Nestorius of Antioch promoted to the See of Constantinople.

It is not known how long the Nisan 14 practice continued. But both those who followed the Nisan 14 custom, and those who set Easter to the following Sunday had in common the custom of consulting their Jewish neighbors to learn when the month of Nisan would fall, and setting their festival accordingly. By the later 3rd century, however, some Christians began to express dissatisfaction with the custom of relying on the Jewish community to determine the date of Easter. The chief complaint was that the Jewish communities sometimes erred in setting Passover to fall before the [[Northern Hemisphere]] spring equinox.<ref>Eusebius, ''Church Histor''y, 7.32.</ref><ref>Peter of Alexandria, quoted in the [[Chronicon Paschale]]. In Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, eds., ''Ante-Nicene Christian Library, Volume 14: The Writings of Methodius, Alexander of Lycopolis, Peter of Alexandria, And Several Fragments'', Edinburgh, 1869, p. 326, at {{cite web| last = Donaldson| first = Alexander| title = That Up to the Time of the Destruction of Jerusalem, the Jews Rightly Appointed the Fourteenth Day of the First Lunar Month.| work = Gregory Thaumaturgus, Dionysius the Great, Julius Africanus, Anatolius and Minor Writers, Methodius, Arnobius| publisher = Calvin College Christian Classics Ethereal Library| date=1 June 2005| url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.ix.vi.v.html| accessdate =28 March 2009}}</ref> The [[Sardica paschal table]]<ref>MS Verona, Biblioteca Capitolare LX(58) folios 79v–80v.</ref> confirms these complaints, for it indicates that the Jews of some eastern Mediterranean city (possibly [[Antioch]]) fixed Nisan 14 on dates well before the spring equinox on multiple occasions.<ref>Sacha Stern, ''Calendar and Community: A History of the Jewish Calendar Second Century BCE – Tenth Century CE,'' Oxford, 2001, pp. 124–132.</ref>

Because of this dissatisfaction with reliance on the Jewish calendar, some Christians began to experiment with independent computations.{{refn|Eusebius reports that Dionysius, Bishop of Alexandria, proposed an 8-year Easter cycle, and quotes a letter from Anatolius, Bishop of Laodicea, that refers to a 19-year cycle.<ref>Eusebius, ''Church History'', 7.20, 7.31.</ref> An 8-year cycle has been found inscribed on a statue  unearthed in Rome in the 17th century, and since dated to the 3rd century.<ref>Allen Brent, ''Hippolytus and the Roman Church in the Third Century'', Leiden, E.J. Brill, 1995.</ref>|group=nb}} Others, however, believed that the customary practice of consulting Jews should continue, even if the Jewish computations were in error.

=== First Council of Nicaea (325 AD) ===
This controversy between those who advocated independent computations, and those who wished to continue the custom of relying on the Jewish calendar, was formally resolved by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, which endorsed changing to an independent computation by the Christian community in order to celebrate in common. This effectively required the abandonment of the old custom of consulting the Jewish community in those places where it was still used. [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] wrote in the mid-4th century:

<blockquote>...&nbsp;the emperor&nbsp;... convened a council of 318 bishops&nbsp;... in the city of Nicea&nbsp;... They passed certain ecclesiastical canons at the council besides, and at the same time decreed in regard to the Passover that there must be one unanimous concord on the celebration of God's holy and supremely excellent day. For it was variously observed by people&nbsp;...<ref name = Epiphianus>Epiphanius, ''Adversus Haereses'', Heresy 69, 11,1, in {{cite book | last = Willams | first = F. | title = The Panarion of Epiphianus of Salamis Books II and III | publisher = E.J. Brill |year=1994 | location = Leiden | page = 331}}</ref></blockquote>

That the older custom (called "protopaschite" by historians) did not at once die out, but persisted for a time, is indicated by the existence of canons<ref>Apostolic Canon 7: "If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon shall celebrate the holy day of Easter before the vernal equinox with the Jews, let him be deposed." ''A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church,'' Second Series, Volume 14: The Seven Ecumenical Councils'', Eerdmans, 1956, p. 594.</ref> and sermons<ref>St. John Chrysostom, "Against those who keep the first Passover", in ''Saint John Chrysostom: Discourses against Judaizing Christians'', translated by Paul W. Harkins, Washington, D.C., 1979, p. 47ff.</ref> against it.

[[Dionysius Exiguus]], and others following him, maintained that the 318 Bishops assembled at the Nicene Council had specified a particular method of determining the date of Easter; subsequent scholarship has refuted this tradition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A.|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-954312-0|pages=50–52, 62–65}}</ref> In any case, in the years following the council, the computational system that was worked out by the church of Alexandria came to be normative. It took a while for the Alexandrian rules to be adopted throughout Christian Europe, however. The [[octaeteris|8-year cycle]] originally employed was replaced by (or by the time of) [[Augustalis (bishop)|Augustalis]]'s treatise on the measurement of Easter, after which Rome used his 84-year [[lunisolar calendar]] cycle until 457. It then switched to an adaptation by [[Victorius of Aquitaine|Victorius]] of the Alexandrian rules.<ref name="Mosshammer 2008 239–244">{{cite book|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A.|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-954312-0|pages=239–244}}</ref><ref name="Holford-Strevens, Leofranc 1999 808–809">{{cite book|last=Holford-Strevens, Leofranc|first=and Blackburn, Bonnie|title=The Oxford Companion to the Year|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-214231-3|pages=808–809}}</ref>

Because this Victorian cycle differed from the Alexandrian cycle in the dates of some of the Paschal Full Moons, and because it tried to respect the Roman custom of fixing Easter to the Sunday in the week of the 16th to the 22nd of the lunar month (rather than the 15th to the 21st as at Alexandria), by providing alternative "Latin" and "Greek" dates in some years, occasional differences in the date of Easter as fixed by Alexandrian rules continued.<ref name="Mosshammer 2008 239–244"/><ref name="Holford-Strevens, Leofranc 1999 808–809"/> The Alexandrian rules were adopted in the West following the tables of Dionysius Exiguus in 525. From this time, therefore, all discrepancies between Alexandria and Rome as to the correct date for Easter cease, as both churches were using identical tables.

Early Christians in Britain and Ireland also used an 84-year cycle. From the 5th century onward this cycle set its equinox to 25 March and fixed Easter to the Sunday falling in the 14th to the 20th of the lunar month inclusive.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A.|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-954312-0|pages=223–224}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Holford-Strevens, Leofranc|first=and Blackburn, Bonnie|title=The Oxford Companion to the Year|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-214231-3|pages=870–875}}</ref> This 84-year cycle was replaced by the Alexandrian method in the course of the 7th and 8th centuries. Churches in western continental Europe used a late Roman method until the late 8th century during the reign of [[Charlemagne]], when they finally adopted the Alexandrian method. Since 1582, when the Catholic Church adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] while the Eastern Orthodox and most Oriental Orthodox Churches retained the [[Julian calendar]], the date on which Easter is celebrated has again differed.

The Greek island of [[Syros]], whose population is divided almost equally between Catholics and Orthodox, is one of the few places where the two Churches share a common date for Easter, with the Catholics accepting the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] date—a practice helping considerably in maintaining good relations between the two communities.<ref>{{cite news| title= Easter: A date with God | url= http://www.economist.com/node/18584376 | date=20 April 2011 | publisher=The Economist | accessdate=23 April 2011| quote= Only in a handful of places do Easter celebrants alter their own arrangements to take account of their neighbours.

In the 20th century, some individuals and institutions have propounded a fixed date for Easter, the most prominent proposal being the Sunday after the second Saturday in April. Despite having some support, proposals to reform the date have not been implemented.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/176858/Easter | title=Easter (holiday) | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> An Orthodox congress of Eastern Orthodox bishops, which included representatives mostly from the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] and the [[Patriarch of Serbia]], met in Constantinople in 1923, where the bishops agreed to the [[Revised Julian calendar]].<ref name="Hieromonk Cassian 1998, p.51">Hieromonk Cassian, ''A Scientific Examination of the Orthodox Church Calendar'', Center for Traditionalist Orthodox Studies, 1998, p.51–52, ISBN 0-911165-31-2.</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the [[Easter Act 1928]] set out legislation to allow the date of Easter to be fixed as the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April (or, in other words, the Sunday in the period from 9 to 15 April). However, the legislation has not been implemented, although it remains on the Statute book and could be implemented subject to approval by the various Christian churches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050406/text/50406w05.htm#wa_subhd_30 |title=Hansard Reports, April 2005, regarding the Easter Act of 1928 |publisher=United Kingdom Parliament |accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref>

At a summit in [[Aleppo]], Syria, in 1997, the [[World Council of Churches]] (WCC) proposed a reform in the calculation of Easter which would have replaced the present divergent practices of calculating Easter with modern scientific knowledge taking into account actual astronomical instances of the spring equinox and full moon based on the meridian of Jerusalem, while also following the Council of Nicea position of Easter being on the Sunday following the full moon.<ref>[http://www.oikoumene.org/index.php?id=2677 WCC: Towards a common date for Easter]</ref> The recommended World Council of Churches changes would have sidestepped the calendar issues and eliminated the difference in date between the Eastern and Western churches. The reform was proposed for implementation starting in 2001, but it was not ultimately adopted by any member body.

===Western Christianity===
In [[Western Christianity]], Easter is preceded by [[Lent]], a period of fasting and penitence in preparation for Easter, which begins on [[Ash Wednesday]] and lasts forty days (not counting Sundays). The week before Easter, known as [[Holy Week]], is very special in the Christian tradition. The Sunday before Easter is [[Palm Sunday]], with the Wednesday before Easter being known as [[Spy Wednesday]]. The last [[The Three Days|three days]] before Easter are [[Maundy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] (sometimes referred to as Silent Saturday).

Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday respectively commemorate Jesus' entry in Jerusalem, the [[Last Supper]] and the [[Crucifixion]]. Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday are sometimes referred to as the [[Easter Triduum]] ([[Latin]] for "Three Days"). Many churches begin celebrating Easter late in the evening of Holy Saturday at a service called the [[Easter Vigil]]. In some countries, Easter lasts two days, with the second called "[[Easter Monday]]".

The week beginning with Easter Sunday is called [[Easter Week]] or the [[Octave of Easter]], and each day is prefaced with "Easter", e.g. Easter Monday, Easter Tuesday, etc. [[Easter Saturday]] is therefore the Saturday ''after'' Easter Sunday. The day before Easter is properly called Holy Saturday. [[Eastertide]], or Paschaltide, the season of Easter, begins on Easter Sunday and lasts until the day of [[Pentecost]], seven weeks later.

===Eastern Christianity===

In [[Eastern Christianity]], the spiritual preparation for Easter begins with [[Great Lent]], which starts on [[Clean Monday]] and lasts for 40 continuous days (including Sundays). The last week of Great Lent (following the fifth Sunday of Great Lent) is called Palm Week, and ends with [[Lazarus Saturday]]. The [[Vespers]] which begins Lazarus Saturday officially brings Great Lent to a close, although the fast continues through the following week. After Lazarus Saturday comes [[Palm Sunday]], [[Holy Week]], and finally Easter itself, and the fast is broken immediately after the Paschal [[Divine Liturgy]].

The [[Paschal Vigil]] begins with the [[Midnight Office]], which is the last service of the [[Lenten Triodion]] and is timed so that it ends a little before midnight on [[Holy Saturday]] night. At the stroke of midnight the Paschal celebration itself begins, consisting of Paschal [[Matins]], [[Paschal Hours]], and Paschal Divine Liturgy.<ref name = "Eastern Liturgy">{{cite web | last = Moraitis | first = Ephrem (Archimandrite) | title = On the Holy and Great Sunday of Pascha | publisher = Monastery of Saint Andrew the First Called, Manchester, England |date=25 January 2007 | url = http://www.anastasis.org.uk/pascha.htm | accessdate =27 March 2007}}</ref> Placing the Paschal Divine Liturgy at midnight guarantees that no Divine Liturgy will come earlier in the morning, ensuring its place as the pre-eminent "Feast of Feasts" in the [[liturgical year]].

The liturgical season from Easter to the Sunday of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]] (the Sunday after [[Pentecost]]) is known as the [[Pentecostarion]] (the "fifty days"). The week which begins on Easter Sunday is called [[Bright Week]], during which there is no fasting, even on Wednesday and Friday. The [[Afterfeast]] of Easter lasts 39 days, with its [[Afterfeast|Apodosis]] (leave-taking) on the day before [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. Pentecost Sunday is the fiftieth day from Easter (counted inclusively).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://catholicism.about.com/od/holydaysandholidays/p/Pentecost.htm | title=Pentecost Sunday | publisher=About.com| accessdate= 28 March 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Resurrection.JPG|thumb|right|Depiction of ''The Resurrection of Jesus Christ'', by [[Piero della Francesca]].]]

===Western Christianity===
The Easter festival is kept in many different ways among Western Christians. The traditional, [[liturgy|liturgical]] observation of Easter, as practised among Roman Catholics, [[Lutheran]]s, and some [[Anglican]]s begins on the night of [[Holy Saturday]] with the [[Easter Vigil]]. This, the most important liturgy of the year, begins in total darkness with the blessing of the Easter fire, the lighting of the large [[Paschal candle]] (symbolic of the Risen Christ) and the chanting of the [[Exultet]] or Easter Proclamation attributed to Saint [[Ambrose of Milan]].

[[File:Epistle for the Solemn Mass of Easter Day.ogg|thumb|[[Epistle]] reading, [[I Corinthians]] {{Bibleverse-nb|I Corinthians|5:7-8|KJ21}} (in [[Latin]]), for the [[Solemn Mass]] of Easter Day.]]
After this service of light, a number of readings from the [[Old Testament]] are read. These tell the stories of [[Genesis creation myth|creation]], the sacrifice of [[Isaac]], the crossing of the [[Red Sea]], and the foretold coming of the [[Messiah]]. This part of the service climaxes with the singing of the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] and the [[Alleluia]] and the proclamation of the [[Gospel]] of the [[resurrection]]. At this time, the lights are brought up and the church bells are rung, according to local custom. A [[sermon]] may be preached after the gospel.

The focus then moves from the [[lectern]] to the [[Baptismal font|font]]. Anciently, Easter was considered the ideal time for converts to receive [[baptism]], and this practice continues within Roman Catholicism and the [[Anglican Communion]]. Whether there are baptisms at this point or not, it is traditional for the congregation to renew the vows of their baptismal faith. This act is often sealed by the sprinkling of the congregation with [[holy water]] from the font. The Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]] is also celebrated at the Vigil.

[[File:Procesion semana santa jpereira.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Holy Week]] procession in [[Santiago de Compostela]], Spain.]]
The Easter Vigil concludes with the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] (known in some traditions as Holy Communion). Certain variations in the Easter Vigil exist: Some churches read the Old Testament lessons before the procession of the Paschal candle, and then read the gospel immediately after the Exsultet.

[[File:2007sunriseservice.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sunrise service in [[Rockland, Maine]], United States.]]
Some churches prefer to keep this vigil very early on the Sunday morning instead of the Saturday night to reflect the gospel account of the women coming to the tomb at dawn on the first day of the week. These services are known as the [[Sunrise service]] and often occur in outdoor setting such as the church cemetery, yard, or a nearby park.

The first recorded "Sunrise Service" took place in 1732 among the Single Brethren in the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] congregation at [[Herrnhut]], Saxony, in what is now Germany. Following an all-night [[vigil]] they went before dawn to the town graveyard, [[God's Acre]], on the hill above the town, to celebrate the Resurrection among the graves of the departed. This service was repeated the following year by the whole congregation and subsequently spread with the Moravian Missionaries around the world, including [[Old Salem]] in [[Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]].

Additional celebrations are usually offered on Easter Sunday itself. Typically these services follow the usual order of Sunday services in a congregation, but also typically incorporate more highly festive elements. The music of the service, in particular, often displays a highly festive tone; the incorporation of brass instruments (trumpets, etc.) to supplement a congregation's usual instrumentation is common. Often a congregation's worship space is decorated with special banners and flowers (such as [[Lilium longiflorum|Easter lilies]]).

In predominantly Roman Catholic Philippines, the morning of Easter (known in the national language as "Pasko ng Muling Pagkabuhay" or the Pasch of the Resurrection) is marked with joyous celebration, the first being the dawn "Salubong", wherein large statues of Jesus and Mary are brought together to meet, imagining the first reunion of Jesus and his mother Mary after Jesus' Resurrection. This is followed by the joyous Easter Mass.

In Polish culture, the Rezurekcja (Resurrection Procession) is the joyous Easter morning Mass at daybreak when church bells ring out and explosions resound to commemorate Christ rising from the dead. Before the Mass begins at dawn, a festive procession with the Blessed Sacrament carried beneath a canopy encircles the church. As church bells ring out, handbells are vigorously shaken by altar boys, the air is filled with incense and the faithful raise their voices heavenward in a triumphant rendering of age-old Easter hymns. After the Blessed Sacrament is carried around the church and Adoration is complete, the Easter Mass begins. Another Polish Easter tradition is [[Święconka]], the blessing of Easter baskets by the parish priest on Holy Saturday. This custom is celebrated not only in Poland, but also in the United States by Polish-Americans.

===Eastern Christianity===
[[File:17th-century unknown painters - The Resurrection of Christ - WGA23478.jpg|right|thumb|17th century Russian icon of the Resurrection]]
Easter is the fundamental and most important festival of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental]] Orthodox Churches:

<blockquote>
:This is the Expected and Holy Day,
:the One among the Sabbaths,
:the Sovereign and Lady of days,
:Feast of feasts, Celebration of celebrations,
:on which we praise Christ for all eternity!
</blockquote>

[[File:Paskhakustodiev.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Boris Kustodiev]]'s ''Pascha Greetings'' (1912) shows traditional Russian ''[[Paschal greeting|khristosovanie]]'' (exchanging a triple kiss), with such foods as [[Easter eggs|red eggs]], [[kulich]] and [[paskha (dish)|paskha]] in the background.]]
Every other religious festival in their calendar, including Christmas, is secondary in importance to the celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is reflected in rich Paschal customs in the cultures of countries that have traditionally had an Orthodox Christian majority. [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] have similar emphasis in their calendars, and many of their liturgical customs are very similar.

This is not to say that Christmas and other elements of the Christian liturgical calendar are ignored. Instead, these events are all seen as necessary but ''preliminary'' to, and illuminated by, the full climax of the Resurrection, in which all that has come before reaches fulfillment and fruition. They shine only in the light of the Resurrection. Easter is the primary act that fulfills the purpose of Christ's ministry on earth—to defeat death by dying and to purify and exalt humanity by voluntarily assuming and overcoming human frailty. This is succinctly summarized by the [[Paschal troparion]], sung repeatedly for forty days, through the [[Afterfeast|Apodosis]] of Easter, which is the day before [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]]:

<blockquote>
:Χριστὸς ἀνέστη ἐκ νεκρῶν,
:θανάτῳ θάνατον πατήσας,
:καὶ τοῖς ἐν τοῖς μνήμασι
:ζωὴν χαρισάμενος.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
:Christ is risen from the dead,
:Trampling down death by death,
:And upon those in the tombs
:Bestowing life!
</blockquote>

Preparation for Easter begins with the season of [[Great Lent]]. In addition to fasting, almsgiving, and prayer, Orthodox Christians cut down on all entertainment and non-essential worldly activities, gradually eliminating them until [[Good Friday|Great and Holy Friday]], the most austere day of the year. On the evening of [[Holy Saturday|Great and Holy Saturday]], the [[Midnight Office]] commences an hour or two before midnight (see [[Paschal Vigil#Saturday Midnight|paschal vigil]]).

[[File:Kurskaya korennaya.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Religious Procession in Kursk Province]]'', a controversial painting by [[Ilya Repin]] (1880–83), cynically depicting a [[Bright Week]] [[Procession#Outdoors|outdoor procession]].]]
At its completion all light in the church building is extinguished, and all wait in darkness and silence for the stroke of midnight. Then, a new flame is struck in the altar, or the priest lights his candle from the [[sanctuary lamp|perpetual lamp]] kept burning there, and he then lights candles held by deacons or other assistants, who then go to light candles held by the congregation (this practice has its origin in the reception of the [[Holy Fire]] at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]]). Then the priest and congregation go in a [[Procession#Outdoors|procession]] around the [[Orthodox church (building)|temple]], holding lit candles, chanting:

<blockquote>
By Thy Resurrection O Christ our savior,
the angels in Heaven sing,
enable us who are on Earth,
to glorify thee in purity of heart.
</blockquote>

This procession reenacts the journey of the [[Myrrhbearers]] to the Tomb of Jesus "very early in the morning".<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|24:1|KJV}}</ref> After circling around the temple once or three times, the procession halts in front of the closed doors. In the Greek practice the priest reads a selection from the [[Gospel Book]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Mark|16:1–8|KJV}}</ref> Then, in all traditions, the priest makes the [[sign of the cross]] with the censer in front of the closed doors (which represent the sealed tomb).

[[File:Crucession Davidovo-Elizarovo Guslitci Moscow reg 8504.jpg|thumb|250px|Traditional Paschal Outdoor Procession during Bright Week by [[Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church]].]]
He and the people chant the Paschal Troparion, and all of the [[Church bell|bells]] and [[Semantron|semantra]] are sounded. Then all re-enter the temple and paschal [[matins]] begins immediately, followed by the paschal [[Canonical hours|hours]] and then the paschal [[Divine Liturgy|divine liturgy]]. The [[Paschal Homily]] of [[St. John Chrysostom]] is read at matins.

After the [[Dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal of the liturgy]], the priest may bless [[Easter eggs|paschal eggs]] and baskets brought by the faithful containing those foods which have been forbidden during the Great Fast. Immediately after the Liturgy it is customary for the congregation to share a meal, essentially an [[Agape|agápē]] dinner (albeit at 2:00&nbsp;am or later).

In Greece the traditional meal is ''mageiritsa'', a hearty stew of chopped lamb liver and wild greens seasoned with egg-and-lemon sauce. Traditionally, [[easter eggs]], hard-boiled eggs dyed bright red to symbolize the spilt [[Blood of Christ]] and the promise of eternal life, are cracked together to celebrate the opening of the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]].

The next morning, Easter Sunday proper, there is no [[Divine Liturgy]], since the liturgy for that day has already been celebrated. Instead, in the afternoon "[[Agape|Agápē]] [[Vespers]]" is sung. In this service, it has become customary during the last few centuries for the priest and members of the congregation to read a portion of the [[Gospel of John]] in as many languages as they can manage, to show the universality of the Resurrection.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

For the remainder of the week, known as "[[Bright Week]]", fasting (other than [[Eucharistic discipline#Eastern Orthodox practice|before holy communion]] is suppressed, and the customary [[Paschal greeting]] is: "Christ is risen!", to which the response is: "Truly he is risen!" This may also be done in many different languages. The services during Bright Week are nearly identical to those on Easter itself, except that they do not take place at midnight, but at their normal times during the day. The outdoor procession during Bright Week takes place either after paschal matins or the paschal divine liturgy.

==Non-observing Christian groups==
[[File:Croix-sous-neige.jpg|thumb|[[Nonconformist]] Protestant Christians prefer to use a simple [[Christian cross]], rather than a [[crucifix]], to emphasize the Resurrection.]]
Along with the celebration of [[Christmas]] and [[Advent]], many Lenten and Easter traditions were altered or even abandoned altogether by various offshoots of the [[Protestant Reformation]], as they were deemed "[[paganism|pagan]]" or "[[Popish]]" (and therefore tainted) by many of the Reformation's [[Puritan]] movements.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jmsuoCYAd0IC&pg=PA413&lpg=PA413&dq=easter+pagan+puritan&source=bl&ots=SB2YxJ6DS8&sig=CURoWP3NbJ2OAzb2kc74nn8uSxk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bxVTUc_fGYK-8ATpjIHoBA&ved=0CFYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=easter%20pagan%20puritan&f=false | title=Guess What I Discovered on the Way to Church? | publisher=Xulon Press | author=Otto, Diane L. | year=2007 | page=413 | isbn=978-1-60266-349-7}}</ref> However, some of the major Reformation Churches and movements ([[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Anglican]] for example), chose to retain a large proportion of the observances of the established [[Church Year]] along with many of its associated traditions. In Lutheran Churches, for example, not only were the days of Holy Week observed, but also Christmas, Easter and Pentecost were observed with three-day festivals (the day itself and the two following).

Other Protestant groups took a different attitude, with most [[Anabaptists]], [[Quakers]], [[Congregationalists]] and [[Presbyterian]] Puritans regarding such festivals as an [[abomination (Bible)|abomination]].<ref name="Daniels89">Daniels, Bruce Colin (1995). Puritans at Play: Leisure and Recreation in Colonial New England. Macmillan, p. 89, ISBN 978-0-31216124-8</ref> The [[Puritan]] rejection of Easter traditions was (and is) based partly upon their interpretation of 2 Corinthians 6:14–16 and partly upon a more general belief that, if a religious practice or celebration is not actually written in the Christian Bible, then that practice/celebration must be a later development and cannot be considered an authentic part of Christian practice or belief—so at best simply unnecessary, at worst actually sinful.

Groups such as the [[Restored Church of God]] reject the celebration of Easter, seeing it as originating in a pagan spring festival taken over by the "Roman" Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pack|first=David|title=The True Origin of Easter|url=http://www.thercg.org/books/ttooe.html#c|publisher=The Restored Church of God|accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] maintain a similar view, observing a yearly commemorative service of the [[Last Supper]] and the subsequent execution of Christ on the evening of Nisan 14 (as they calculate the dates derived from the lunar [[Hebrew Calendar]]). It is commonly referred to by many Witnesses as simply "The Memorial".<ref name="jw.org">{{cite web|title=Easter or the Memorial—Which Should You Observe?|url=http://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/wp19960401/origin-of-easter-not-in-bible/|work=Watchtower Magazine|publisher=Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.|accessdate=11 April 2014|date=1 April 1996}}</ref> Jehovah's Witnesses believe that such verses as Luke 22:19–20 and Cor| 11:26 constitute a commandment to remember the death of Christ though not the resurrection,<ref name="jw.org"/> and they do so on a yearly basis just as Passover is celebrated annually by the Jews.

Members of the [[Religious Society of Friends|Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)]], as part of their historic ''testimony against times and seasons'', do not celebrate or observe Easter or any other Christian holidays, believing instead that "every day is the Lord's day",<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1fgpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=%22every+day+is+the+Lord%27s+day%22+quaker&source=bl&ots=DLoh-R3TJ3&sig=tneApx8KAFDZ68BXJDY8Bme0zK8&hl=en&ei=rWziTovQCsiZ8gP797CSBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22every%20day%20is%20the%20Lord%27s%20day%22%20quaker&f=false A careful and free inquiry into the true nature and tendency of the religious principes of the Society of Friends by William Craig Brownlee; Philadelphia, 1824]</ref> and that elevation of one day above others suggests that it is acceptable to do un-Christian acts on other days.<ref>[http://qfp.quaker.org.uk/passage/27-42/ See ''Quaker Faith & practice'' of Britain Yearly Meeting, Paragraph 27:42]</ref> During the 17th and 18th centuries, Quakers were persecuted for this non-observance of Holy Days.<ref>[http://www.fum.org/QL/issues/1112/EarlyQuakerTop10.htm ''Quaker life'', December 2011: "Early Quaker Top 10 Ways to Celebrate (or Not) "the Day Called Christmas" by Rob Pierson]</ref>

Some Christian groups feel that Easter is something to be regarded with great joy: not marking the day itself, but remembering and rejoicing in the event it commemorates—the miracle of Christ's resurrection. In this spirit, these Christians teach that each day and all [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbaths]] should be kept holy, in Christ's teachings. [[Jewish Christians|Hebrew-Christian]], [[Sacred Name Movement|Sacred Name]], and [[Armstrongism|Armstrong]] movement churches (such as the [[Living Church of God]]) usually reject Easter in favor of Nisan 14 observance and celebration of the [[Christian Passover]]. This is especially true of Christian groups that celebrate the [[New Moon]]s or annual [[High Sabbaths]] in addition to [[seventh-day Sabbath]]. They support this textually with reference to the letter to the Colossians: "Let no one&nbsp;... pass judgment on you in matters of food and drink or with regard to a festival or new moon or sabbath. These are shadows of things to come; the reality belongs to Christ." (Col. 2:16–17, NAB)

In countries where Christianity is a [[state religion]], or where the country has large Christian population, Easter is often a [[public holiday]]. As Easter is always a Sunday, many countries in the world also have Easter Monday as a public holiday. Some retail stores, shopping malls, and restaurants are closed on Easter Sunday. [[Good Friday]], which occurs two days before Easter Sunday, is also a public holiday in many countries, as well as in 12 U.S. states. Even in states where Good Friday is not a holiday, many financial institutions, stock markets, and public schools are closed. Few banks that are normally open on regular Sundays are closed on Easter.

In the [[Netherlands]] both Easter Sunday and Easter Monday [[Public holidays in the Netherlands|are national holidays]].

In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations Easter Day is rarely a public holiday, as is the case for celebrations which fall on a Sunday. In the [[United Kingdom]] both Good Friday and Easter Monday are [[Public holidays in the United Kingdom|bank holidays]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UK bank holidays|url=https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays|publisher=gov.uk}}</ref> However, in Canada Easter Sunday is a public holiday, along with Easter Monday. In the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], either Good Friday or Easter Monday are statutory holidays (although most companies give both). In some countries [[Good Friday]] is a public holiday as well.

In [[Australia]], because of its location in the southern hemisphere, Easter takes place in autumn. Hence, Australian Easter is associated with [[harvest]] time, rather than with the coming of spring as in the northern hemisphere. The religious aspect of Easter remains the same.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Easter 2016|url = http://publicholidays.com.au/easter/|accessdate = 2015-06-01|publisher = Public Holidays Australia}}</ref> Good Friday and Easter Monday are public holidays across all states and territories.

[[File:Easter eggs - straw decoration.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Easter egg]]s are a popular cultural symbol of Easter.]]

===Easter eggs===

Easter eggs are specially decorated eggs given out to celebrate the Easter festival.
