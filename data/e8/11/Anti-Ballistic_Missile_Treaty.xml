Work started on a short-range, high-speed counterpart known as<space/><link><target>Sprint (missile)</target><part>Sprint</part></link><space/>to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves. By the mid-1960s, both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a limited ABM system dubbed<space/><link><target>National Missile Defense#Sentinel Program</target><part>Sentinel</part></link>.

A surprise attack from the Americans would destroy much of the Soviet ICBM fleet, allowing SDI to defeat a ragged Soviet retaliatory response. Furthermore, if the Soviets chose to enter this new arms race, they would further cripple their economy. The Soviets could not afford to ignore Reagans new endeavor, therefore their policy at the time was to enter negotiations with the Americans.<extension extension_name='ref'>Peter R.
