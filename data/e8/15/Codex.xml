The<space/><link><target>parchment</target></link><space/>notebook pages were commonly washed or scraped for re-use (called a<space/><link><target>palimpsest</target></link>) and consequently, writings in a codex were often considered informal and impermanent.</paragraph><paragraph>As early as the early 2nd century, there is evidence that a codexusually of<space/><link><target>papyrus</target></link>was the preferred format among<space/><link><target>Christianity</target><part>Christians</part></link>. In the library of the<space/><link><target>Villa of the Papyri</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Herculaneum</target></link><space/>(buried in AD 79), all the texts (of Greek literature) are scrolls (see<space/><link><target>Herculaneum papyri</target></link>). However, in the<space/><link><target>Nag Hammadi</target></link><space/>library, hidden about AD 390, all texts (Gnostic Christian) are codices. Despite this comparison, a fragment of a non-Christian parchment Codex of Demosthenes,<space/><italics>De Falsa Legatione</italics><space/>from Oxyrhynchus in Egypt demonstrates that the surviving evidence is insufficient to conclude whether Christians played a major or central role in the development of early codicesor if they simply adopted the format to distinguish themselves from<space/><link><target>Jews</target></link>.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>The earliest surviving fragments from codices come from Egypt, and are variously dated (always tentatively) towards the end of the 1st century or in the first half of the 2nd.

Between the 4th century, when the codex gained wide acceptance, and the<space/><link><target>Carolingian Renaissance</target></link><space/>in the 8th century, many works that were not converted from scroll to codex were lost. The codex improved on the scroll in several ways. It could be opened flat at any page for easier reading, pages could be written on both front and back (<link><target>recto and verso</target></link>), and the protection of durable covers made it more compact and easier to transport.</paragraph><paragraph>The ancients didn't use codices the way modern people might expect.

Introduction to Manuscript Studies. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008.</extension><space/>The parchment maker attaches the skin at points around the circumference. The skin attaches to the herse by cords. To prevent tearing, the maker wraps the area of the skin the cord attaches to around a pebble called a pippin.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Intro"></extension><space/>After completing that, the maker uses a crescent shaped knife called a<space/><italics>lunarium</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>lunellum</italics><space/>to clean any surviving hairs. Once the skin completely dries, the maker gives it a deep clean and processes it into sheets. The number of sheets from a piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the final product dimensions. For example, the average calfskin can provide three and half medium sheets of writing material. This can be doubled when folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a<space/><italics>bifolium</italics>. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers.<extension extension_name='ref' name="daniel">Thompson, Daniel. &quot;Medieval Parchment-Making.&quot; The Library 16, no. 4 (1935).</extension><space/>Defects can often be found in the membrane, whether from the original animal, human error during the preparation period, or from when the animal was killed. Defects can also appear during the writing process.

From the Carolingian period and all the way up to the Middle Ages, different styles of folding the quire came about. For example, in mainland Europe throughout the Middle Ages, the quire was put into a system in which each side folded on to the same style. The hair side met the hair side and the flesh side to the flesh side. This was not the same style used in the British Isles, where the membrane was folded so that it turned out an eight leaf quire, with single leaves in the third and sixth positions.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Intro"></extension><space/>The next stage was tacking the quire. Tacking is when the scribe would hold together the leaves in quire with thread. Once threaded together, the scribe would then sew a line of parchment up the spine of the manuscript, as to protect the tacking.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Aztec codices</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>History of books</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of codices</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of florilegia and botanical codices</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of New Testament papyri</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of New Testament uncials</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Maya codices</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Traditional Chinese bookbinding</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Volume (bibliography)</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References and sources</heading><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>References</defkey></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target><arg>30em</arg></template></paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Sources</defkey></listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>David Diringer</target></link>,<space/><italics>The Book Before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental</italics>, Courier Dover Publications, New York 1982, ISBN 0-486-24243-9</listitem><listitem><link><target>Larry Hurtado</target><part>L.
