[[File:Beer–Lambert law in solution.JPG|thumb|An example of Beer–Lambert law: green laser light in a solution of [[Rhodamine B|Rhodamine 6B]]. The beam radiant power becomes weaker as it passes through solution]]
The '''Beer–Lambert law''', also known as '''Beer's law''', the '''Lambert–Beer law''', or the '''Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law''' relates the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]] of [[light]] to the properties of the material through which the light is traveling. The law is commonly applied to [[chemical analysis]] measurements and used in understanding attenuation in [[physical optics]], for [[photons]], [[neutrons]] or rarefied gases. In [[mathematical physics]], this law arises as a solution of the [[Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook|BGK equation]].

== History ==
The law was discovered by [[Pierre Bouguer]] before 1729.<ref>Pierre Bouguer, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JNkTAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1 ''Essai d'optique sur la gradation de la lumière''] (Paris, France: Claude Jombert, 1729) pp. 16–22.</ref> It is often attributed to [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], who cited Bouguer's ''Essai d'optique sur la gradation de la lumière'' (Claude Jombert, Paris, 1729)—and even quoted from it—in his ''[[Photometria]]'' in 1760.<ref>J.H. Lambert, [http://imgbase-scd-ulp.u-strasbg.fr/displayimage.php?album=53&pos=1 ''Photometria sive de mensura et gradibus luminis, colorum et umbrae''] [Photometry, or, On the measure and gradations of light, colors, and shade] (Augsburg ("Augusta Vindelicorum"), Germany: Eberhardt Klett, 1760). See especially [http://imgbase-scd-ulp.u-strasbg.fr/displayimage.php?album=53&pos=405&lang=english p. 391].</ref> Lambert's law stated that absorbance of a material sample is directly proportional to its thickness (path length). Much later, [[August Beer]] discovered another attenuation relation in 1852. Beer's law stated that absorbance is proportional to the concentrations of the attenuating species in the material sample in 1852.<ref>Beer (1852) [http://books.google.com/books?id=PNmXAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA78 "Bestimmung der Absorption des rothen Lichts in farbigen Flüssigkeiten"] (Determination of the absorption of red light in colored liquids), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', vol. 86, pp. 78–88.</ref> The modern derivation of the Beer–Lambert law combines the two laws and correlates the absorbance to both the concentrations of the attenuating species as well as the thickness of the material sample.<ref>{{cite book|first=J. D. J.|last=Ingle|first2=S. R.|last2=Crouch|title=Spectrochemical Analysis|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|year=1988}}</ref>

== Beer–Lambert law ==
By definition, the [[transmittance]] of material sample is related to its [[optical depth]] ''τ'' and to its [[absorbance]] ''A'' as
:<math>T = \frac{\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{t}}{\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{i}} = e^{-\tau} = 10^{-A},</math>
where
* Φ<sub>e</sub><sup>t</sup> is the [[radiant flux]] ''transmitted'' by that material sample;
* Φ<sub>e</sub><sup>i</sup> is the radiant flux received by that material sample.

The '''Beer–Lambert law''' states that, for ''N'' attenuating species in the material sample,
:<math>T = e^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i \int_0^\ell n_i(z)\mathrm{d}z} = 10^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell c_i(z)\mathrm{d}z},</math>
or equivalently that
:<math>\tau = \sum_{i = 1}^N \tau_i = \sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i \int_0^\ell n_i(z)\,\mathrm{d}z,</math>
:<math>A = \sum_{i = 1}^N A_i = \sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell c_i(z)\,\mathrm{d}z,</math>
where
* ''σ''<sub>''i''</sub> is the [[Cross section (physics)|attenuation cross section]] of the attenuating species ''i'' in the material sample;
* ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> is the [[number density]] of the attenuating species ''i'' in the material sample;
* ''ε''<sub>''i''</sub> is the [[molar attenuation coefficient]] of the attenuating species ''i'' in the material sample;
* ''c''<sub>''i''</sub> is the [[amount concentration]] of the attenuating species ''i'' in the material sample;
* ''ℓ'' is the path length of the beam of light through the material sample.

Attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient are related by
:<math>\varepsilon_i = \frac{\mathrm{N_A}}{\ln{10}}\,\sigma_i,</math>
and number density and amount concentration by
:<math>c_i = \frac{n_i}{\mathrm{N_A}},</math>
where N<sub>A</sub> is the [[Avogadro constant]].

In case of ''uniform'' attenuation, these relations become<ref name=GoldBook>{{GoldBookRef|title=Beer–Lambert law|file=B00626|accessdate=2015-03-15}}</ref>
:<math>T = e^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i n_i\ell} = 10^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i c_i\ell},</math>
or equivalently
:<math>\tau = \sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i n_i\ell,</math>
:<math>A = \sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i c_i\ell.</math>

Cases of ''non-uniform'' attenuation occur in [[atmospheric science]] applications and [[radiation shielding]] theory for instance.

The law tends to break down at very high concentrations, especially if the material is highly [[scattering]]. If the radiation is especially intense, [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] processes can also cause variances. The main reason, however, is the following. At high concentrations, the molecules are closer to each other and begin to interact with each other. This interaction will change several properties of the molecule, and thus will change the attenuation.

=== Expression with attenuation coefficient ===
The Beer–Lambert law can be expressed in terms of [[attenuation coefficient]], but in this case is better called Lambert's law since amount concentration, from Beer's law, is hidden inside the attenuation coefficient. The (Napierian) attenuation coefficient ''μ'' and the decadic attenuation coefficient {{nobreak|1=''μ''<sub>10</sub> = ''μ''/ln 10}} of a material sample are related to its number densities and amount concentrations as
:<math>\mu(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \mu_i(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i n_i(z),</math>
:<math>\mu_{10}(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \mu_{10,i}(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i c_i(z)</math>
respectively, by definition of attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient. Then the Beer–Lambert law becomes
:<math>T = e^{-\int_0^\ell \mu(z)\mathrm{d}z} = 10^{-\int_0^\ell \mu_{10}(z)\mathrm{d}z},</math>
and
:<math>\tau = \int_0^\ell \mu(z)\,\mathrm{d}z,</math>
:<math>A = \int_0^\ell \mu_{10}(z)\,\mathrm{d}z.</math>

In case of ''uniform'' attenuation, these relations become
:<math>T = e^{-\mu\ell} = 10^{-\mu_{10}\ell},</math>
or equivalently
:<math>\tau = \mu\ell,</math>
:<math>A = \mu_{10}\ell.</math>

== Derivation ==
In concept, the derivation of the Beer–Lambert law is straightforward. Assume that a beam of light enters a material sample. Define ''z'' as an axis parallel to the direction of the beam. Divide the material sample into thin slices, perpendicular to the beam of light, with thickness d''z'' sufficiently small that one particle in a slice cannot obscure another particle in the same slice when viewed along the ''z'' direction. The radiant flux of the light that emerges from a slice is reduced, compared to that of the light that entered, by {{nobreak|1=dΦ<sub>e</sub>(''z'') = −''μ''(''z'')Φ<sub>e</sub>(''z'') d''z''}}, where ''μ'' is the (Napierian) [[attenuation coefficient]], which yields the following first-order [[Linear differential equation|linear ODE]]:
:<math>\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\mathrm{d}z}(z) = -\mu(z)\Phi_\mathrm{e}(z).</math>
The attenuation is caused by the photons that did not make it to the other side of the slice because of [[scattering]] or [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]. The solution to this differential equation is obtained by multiplying the [[integrating factor]]
:<math>e^{\int_0^z \mu(z')\mathrm{d}z'}</math>
throughout to obtain
:<math>\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\mathrm{d}z}(z)\,e^{\int_0^z \mu(z')\mathrm{d}z'} + \mu(z)\Phi_\mathrm{e}(z)\,e^{\int_0^z \mu(z')\mathrm{d}z'} = 0,</math>
which simplifies due to the [[product rule]] (applied backwards) to
:<math>\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}\bigl(\Phi_\mathrm{e}(z)\,e^{\int_0^z \mu(z')\mathrm{d}z'}\bigr) = 0.</math>
Integrating both sides and solving for Φ<sub>e</sub> for a material of real thickness ''ℓ'', with the incident radiant flux upon the slice {{nobreak|1=Φ<sub>e</sub><sup>i</sup> = Φ<sub>e</sub>(0)}} and the transmitted radiant flux {{nobreak|1=Φ<sub>e</sub><sup>t</sup> = Φ<sub>e</sub>(''ℓ'' )}} gives
:<math>\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{t} = \Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{i}\,e^{-\int_0^\ell \mu(z)\mathrm{d}z},</math>
and finally
:<math>T = \frac{\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{t}}{\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{i}} = e^{-\int_0^\ell \mu(z)\mathrm{d}z}.</math>
Since the decadic attenuation coefficient ''μ''<sub>10</sub> is related to the (Napierian) attenuation coefficient by {{nobreak|1=''μ''<sub>10</sub> = ''μ''/ln 10}}, one also have
:<math>T = e^{-\int_0^\ell \ln{10}\,\mu_{10}(z)\mathrm{d}z} = \bigl(e^{-\int_0^\ell \mu_{10}(z)\mathrm{d}z}\bigr)^{\ln{10}} = 10^{-\int_0^\ell \mu_{10}(z)\mathrm{d}z}.</math>

To describe the attenuation coefficient in a way independent of the [[Number density|number densities]] ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> of the ''N'' attenuating species of the material sample, one introduces the [[Cross section (physics)|attenuation cross section]] {{nobreak|1=''σ''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''μ''<sub>''i''</sub>(''z'')/''n''<sub>''i''</sub>(''z'')}}. ''σ''<sub>''i''</sub> has the dimension of an area; it expresses the likelihood of interaction between the particles of the beam and the particles of the specie ''i'' in the material sample:
:<math>T = e^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i \int_0^\ell n_i(z)\mathrm{d}z}.</math>

One can also use the [[molar attenuation coefficient]]s {{nobreak|1=''ε''<sub>''i''</sub> = (N<sub>A</sub>/ln 10)''σ''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, where N<sub>A</sub> is the [[Avogadro constant]], to describe the attenuation coefficient in a way independent of the [[amount concentration]]s {{nobreak|1=''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''z'') = ''n''<sub>''i''</sub>(''z'')/N<sub>A</sub>}} of the attenuating species of the material sample:
:<math>T = e^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{\ln{10}}{\mathrm{N_A}}\varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell n_i(z)\mathrm{d}z} = \Bigl(e^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell \frac{n_i(z)}{\mathrm{N_A}}\mathrm{d}z}\Bigr)^{\ln{10}} = 10^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell c_i(z)\mathrm{d}z}.</math>

== Validity ==
Under certain conditions Beer–Lambert law fails to maintain a linear relationship between attenuation and concentration of [[analyte]].<ref>Mehta A.[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2012/05/ultraviolet-visible-uv-vis-spectroscopy-%E2%80%93-limitations-and-deviations-of-beer-lambert-law/ Limitations and Deviations of Beer–Lambert Law]</ref> These deviations are classified into three categories:
# Real—fundamental deviations due to the limitations of the law itself.
# Chemical—deviations observed due to specific chemical species of the sample which is being analyzed.
# Instrument—deviations which occur due to how the attenuation measurements are made.

There are at least six conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for Beer–Lambert law to be valid. These are:
# The attenuators must act independently of each other.
# The attenuating medium must be homogeneous in the interaction volume.
# The attenuating medium must not scatter the radiation—no [[turbidity]]—unless this is accounted for as in [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy|DOAS]].
# The incident radiation must consist of parallel rays, each traversing the same length in the absorbing medium.
# The incident radiation should preferably be [[monochromatic]], or have at least a width that is narrower than that of the attenuating transition. Otherwise a spectrometer as detector for the power is needed instead of a photodiode which has not a selective wavelength dependence.
# The incident flux must not influence the atoms or molecules; it should only act as a non-invasive probe of the species under study. In particular, this implies that the light should not cause optical saturation or optical pumping, since such effects will deplete the lower level and possibly give rise to stimulated emission.

If any of these conditions are not fulfilled, there will be deviations from Beer–Lambert law.

== Chemical analysis by spectrophotometry ==
Beer–Lambert law can be applied to the analysis of a mixture by [[spectrophotometry]], without the need for extensive pre-processing of the sample. An example is the determination of [[bilirubin]] in blood plasma samples. The spectrum of pure bilirubin is known, so the molar attenuation coefficient ''ε'' is known. Measurements of decadic attenuation coefficient ''μ''<sub>10</sub> are made at one wavelength ''λ'' that is nearly unique for bilirubin and at a second wavelength in order to correct for possible interferences. The amount concentration ''c'' is then given by
:<math>c = \frac{\mu_{10}(\lambda)}{\varepsilon(\lambda)}.</math>

For a more complicated example, consider a mixture in solution containing two species at amount concentrations ''c''<sub>1</sub> and ''c''<sub>2</sub>. The decadic attenuation coefficient at any wavelength ''λ'' is, given by
:<math>\mu_{10}(\lambda) = \varepsilon_1(\lambda) c_1 + \varepsilon_2(\lambda) c_2.</math>

Therefore, measurements at two wavelengths yields two equations in two unknowns and will suffice to determine the amount concentrations ''c''<sub>1</sub> and ''c''<sub>2</sub> as long as the molar attenuation coefficient of the two components, ''ε''<sub>1</sub> and ''ε''<sub>2</sub> are known at both wavelengths. This two system equation can be solved using [[Cramer's rule]]. In practice it is better to use [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]] to determine the two amount concentrations from measurements made at more than two wavelengths. Mixtures containing more than two components can be analyzed in the same way, using a minimum of ''N'' wavelengths for a mixture containing ''N'' components.

The law is used widely in [[infra-red spectroscopy]] and [[near-infrared spectroscopy]] for analysis of [[polymer degradation]] and [[oxidation]] (also in biological tissue). The [[carbonyl group]] attenuation at about 6 micrometres can be detected quite easily, and degree of oxidation of the [[polymer]] calculated.

== Beer–Lambert law in the atmosphere ==
This law is also applied to describe the attenuation of solar or stellar radiation as it travels through the atmosphere. In this case, there is scattering of radiation as well as absorption. The optical depth for a slant path is {{nobreak|1=''τ''′ = ''mτ''}}, where ''τ'' refers to a vertical path, ''m'' is called the [[airmass|relative airmass]], and for a plane-parallel atmosphere it is determined as {{nobreak|1=''m'' = sec ''θ''}} where ''θ'' is the [[zenith angle]] corresponding to the given path. The Beer–Lambert law for the atmosphere is usually written
:<math>T = e^{-m(\tau_\mathrm{a} + \tau_\mathrm{g} + \tau_\mathrm{RS} + \tau_\mathrm{NO_2} + \tau_\mathrm{w} + \tau_\mathrm{O_3} + \tau_\mathrm{r} + \ldots)},</math>
where each ''τ''<sub>''x''</sub> is the optical depth whose subscript identifies the source of the absorption or scattering it describes:
* a refers to [[aerosols]] (that absorb and scatter);
* g are uniformly mixed gases (mainly [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>)  and molecular [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) which only absorb);
* NO<sub>2</sub> is [[nitrogen dioxide]], mainly due to urban pollution (absorption only);
* RS are effects due to [[Raman scattering]] in the atmosphere;
* w is [[water vapour]] [[water absorption|absorption]];
* O<sub>3</sub> is [[ozone]] (absorption only);
* r is [[Rayleigh scattering]] from molecular [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>) (responsible for the blue color of the sky);
* the selection of the attenuators which have to be considered depends on the wavelength range and can include various other compounds. This can include [[tetraoxygen]], [[HONO]], [[formaldehyde]], [[glyoxal]], a series of halogen radicals and others.

''m'' is the ''optical mass'' or ''[[airmass]] factor'', a term approximately equal (for small and moderate values of ''θ'') to 1/cos ''θ'', where ''θ'' is the observed object's [[celestial coordinate system|zenith angle]] (the angle measured from the direction perpendicular to the Earth's surface at the observation site). This equation can be used to retrieve ''τ''<sub>a</sub>, the aerosol [[optical depth|optical thickness]], which is necessary for the correction of satellite images and also important in accounting for the role of aerosols in climate.
