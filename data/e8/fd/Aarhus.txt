'''Aarhus''' or '''Århus''' ({{IPA-da|ˈɒːhuːˀs|-|Århus.ogg}}) is the second-largest city in [[Denmark]] and the seat of [[Aarhus Municipality]]. It is located on the east coast of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, in the geographical centre of Denmark, {{convert|187|km}} northwest of [[Copenhagen]] and {{convert|289|km}} north of [[Hamburg]], Germany. Aarhus' inner urban area has 261,570 inhabitants (1 January 2015), the municipal population is 326,676 and [[Eurostat]] calculates 845,971 inhabitants for the [[larger urban zone]].

The history of Aarhus began as a fortified [[Viking]] settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the [[bishopric]] seated there from at least 948. The city was founded on the northern shores of a [[Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|fjord]] at a natural coastal harbour and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products. [[Market town]] privileges were granted in 1441, but growth stagnated in the 17th century as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658–60)|Swedish Wars]]. In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the [[First Schleswig War|Schleswig Wars]] but avoided destruction. As the [[industrial revolution]] took hold, the city grew to become the second-largest in the country by the 20th century.

Today Aarhus is at the cultural and economic core of the region and the largest centre for trade, services and industry in Jutland. The city is the 92nd largest in the [[European Union]],<ref>[[List of largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits]]</ref> It is also a top 100 [[Meeting|conference]] city in the World.<ref>http://www.iccaworld.com/dcps/doc.cfm?docid=1696.</ref>
It is the principal industrial [[port]] of the country in terms of container handling and an important trade hub in [[Kattegat]]. Major Danish companies have based their headquarters here and people commute for work and leisure from a wide area in [[Region Midtjylland]]. It is a centre for research and education in the [[Nordic Countries]] and home to [[Aarhus University]], [[Scandinavia]]'s largest university, including [[Aarhus University Hospital]] and [[INCUBA Science Park]]. Being the youngest city in the country, with students (55.000) making up 13% of the population, Aarhus is also one of the fastest growing with an average growth of 4,000 people per annum since 2010. The city is a central part of the [[East Jutland metropolitan area]], the second largest area of population (1.26 million people) and economic growth in Denmark.

Aarhus is notable for its musical history. In the 1950s many jazz clubs sprang up around the city, fuelled by the young population. By the 1960s, the music scene diversified into rock and other genres. In the 1970s and 1980s, Aarhus became the centre for Denmark's rock music fostering many iconic bands such as [[TV-2 (band)|TV-2]] and [[Gnags]]. Aarhus is home to the annual eight-day [[Aarhus International Jazz Festival]], the [[Spot (music festival)|SPoT Festival]] and the [[NorthSide Festival (Denmark)|Northside Festival]].

==Etymology==
In [[Valdemar's Census Book]] (1231) the city was called ''Arus'', and in Icelandic it was known as ''Aros'', later written as Aars.<ref name=Salmonsen>{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/salmonsen/2/1/0067.html|title=Salmonsens konversationsleksikon / Anden Udgave / Bind I: A—Arbejdergilder /|page=53|publisher=Salmonsen|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> It is a compound of the two words ''ār'', genitive of ''ā'' ("river", Modern Danish ''å''), and ''ōss'' ("mouth", in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for "river delta").<ref name=dsd>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Jylland_-_byer/%C3%85rhus|title=Aarhus|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> The name originates from the city's location around the mouth of Aarhus Å ([[Aarhus River]]).<ref name="The Aarhus River">{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.dk/east-jutland/history/aarhus-aa|title=The Aarhus River|publisher=Visitaarhus.com|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.com/ln-int/denmark/vikings/history-of-aarhus|title= History of the city|publisher=Visitaarhus.com|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> The spelling "Aarhus" is first found in 1406 and gradually became the norm in the 17th century.<ref name=Salmonsen/>

;Aarhus/Århus spelling
With the [[Å#Origin|Danish spelling reform of 1948]], "Aa" was changed to "Å". Some Danish cities resisted the new spelling of their names, notably [[Aalborg]] and [[Aabenraa]]. Århus city council explicitly embraced the new spelling, as it was thought to enhance an image of progressiveness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/default.asp?Id=1881&AjrDcmntId=30979|title=Det omstridte bolle-å|publisher=Aarhus portalen|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> In 2010, the city council voted to change the name from "Århus" to "Aarhus" in order to strengthen the international profile of the city. The renaming came into effect on 1 January 2011.

Certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city, such as the Aarhus River, changed from "Århus Å" to "Aarhus Å".<ref name="The Aarhus River"/> It is still grammatically correct to write geographical names with the letter Å and local councils are allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative. Whichever spelling local authorities choose most newspapers and public institutions will accept it. Some official authorities such as the [[Dansk Sprognævn|Danish Language Committee]], publisher of the [[Retskrivningsordbogen|Danish Orthographic Dictionary]], still retain "Århus" as the main name, providing "Aarhus" as a new, second option, in brackets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dsn.dk/nyt/nyheder/2011/aarhus-eller-aarhus|title=Århus eller Aarhus?|year=2011|publisher=Danish Language Committee|language=Danish}}</ref>

===Early history===
Founded in the early [[Viking Age]], Aarhus is one of the oldest cities in Denmark, along with [[Ribe]] and [[Hedeby]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|title=Byhistoriske hovedtræk - Byens grundlæggelse|language=Danish|publisher=Kommuneatlas (GISportalen, Aarhus Municipality)|accessdate=15 August 2014}}. On the history and foundation of the city. Kommuneatlas is a public on-line source on the municipality of Aarhus.</ref>

Achaeological evidence under the Aros settlement's defences indicate the site was a town as early as the last quarter of the 8th century, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed.<ref name="Kristeligt">{{cite web|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/historie/vikingernes-aros-mellem-land-og-hav|title=Vikingernes Aros mellem land og hav|publisher=''Kristeligt Dagblad''|author=Claus Grymer|date=1 June 2005|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref><ref>[http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/tidligaros.htm The earliest Århus] [http://www.moesgaardmuseum.dk/vikingemuseet/ The Viking Museum] {{da icon}}</ref> Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half buried [[longhouse]]s, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/norrevold.htm|title=Excavations - Nørrevold|language=Danish|publisher=The Viking Museum (Moesgård Museum)|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/udgravninger.htm|title=Excavations|language=Danish|publisher=The Viking Museum (Moesgård Museum)|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>

The centre of Aarhus was once a [[Germanic paganism|pagan burial site]] until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it during the reign of [[Frode]], King of Jutland, around 900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Aarhus_0045-0059.pdf|title=Kirkerne i Århus|publisher=Danmarks Kirker: Nationalmuseet|page=52|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> In the 900s an earth rampart for the defence of the early city was constructed, encircling the settlement, much like the defence structures found at [[Viking ring fortress|ring fortresses]] elsewhere. The rampart was later reinforced by [[Harald Bluetooth]], and together with the town's geographical placement, this suggests that Aros was an important trade and military center. There are strong indications of a former royal residence from the Viking Age in [[Viby J|Viby]], a few kilometres south of the Aarhus city centre.<ref>[http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/viby.htm Vikingernes Aros] Vikingemuseet {{da icon}}</ref>

The bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least 948 when [[Adam of Bremen]] reported the bishop Reginbrand attended the [[synod of Ingelheim]] in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/aarhus-domkirke/?tx_historyview_pi1%5Blang%5D=1&cHash=a83dfe233ede9644167a9b5ea9aa35a4|title=Aarhus Cathedral|website=Danmarkshistorien.dk|publisher=Aarhus University|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_Oldtid/Yngre_Jernalder/Et_samfund_vendt_imod_havet_800-1050_e.Kr/By_efter_by|title=By efter by|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> The bishopric and the town's geographical location propelled prosperous growth and development of the early medieval town.<ref name="Danmarkshistorien">{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/aarhus-1/?tx_historyview_pi1%5Blang%5D=1&cHash=42dfd94aaa459af3505372f8b2af029a|title=Aarhus|website=Danmarkshistorien.dk|publisher=Aarhus University|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> The finding of six [[runestone]]s in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around the year 1000, as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/runesten.htm|title=Vikingernes Aros|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> The era was turbulent and violent with several naval attacks on the city, such as [[Harald Hardrada]]s assault around 1050, when the Holy Trinity Church was burned to the ground.<ref name="Kristeligt"/><ref name="year">{{cite web|url=http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/the-viking-age-in-scandinavia/aarhus/#.U-4-s2OuSM0|title=Aarhus|publisher=Viking Ship Museum|date=2 December 2011|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Aarhus domkirke.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Aarhus Cathedral (1300)]]
The growing influence of the Church during the [[Middle Ages]] gradually turned Aarhus, with its bishopric, into a prosperous religious centre. Many public and religious buildings were built in and around the city; notably [[Aarhus Cathedral]] was initiated in the late 12th century by the influential bishop [[Peder Vognsen]].

In 1441 [[Christopher III]] issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed as far back as the 12th century. The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus' birth certificate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/%C3%85rhus_k%C3%B8bstads_privilegium|title=Stenbroen|publisher=Aarhus Stadsarkiv|website=AarhusWiki|language=Danish|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Århus set fra nord. Stik fra Erich Pontoppidan Den danske Atlas (bd. 4)..JPG|thumb|left|upright=1|Aarhus seen from north, 1768, by [[Erik Pontoppidan]]]]
The official and religious status spurred growth so in 1477 the defensive earthern ramparts, ringing the town since the Viking age, were removed to accommodate expansion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/voldgraven.htm|title=The Moat|language=Danish|publisher=The Viking Museum|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Historien_om_Aarhus|title=Historien om Aarhus|language=Danish|publisher=Aarhus Stadsarkiv|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref> Aarhus grew to become one of the largest cities in the country by the early 16th century. In 1657 [[octroi]] was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades. Wooden city walls were erected to prevent smuggling, with gates and toll booths on the major thoroughfares, Mejlgade and Studsgade. The city gates funnelled most traffic through a few streets where [[merchant]] quarters were built.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/stenbro/side6.htm|title=Stenbroen|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|website=Aarhus Kommunes digitale korttjenester|language=Danish|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>

In the 17th century, Aarhus entered a period of recession as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658–60)|Swedish wars]] and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state.<ref name="Olsen2000"/> It was not until the middle of the 18th century growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural [[catchment area]]s around the city; particularly [[grain]] proved to be a remunerative export.<ref name="Danmarkshistorien"/> The first factories were established at this time as the [[industrial revolution]] reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.<ref name=dcfb>{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/by.aspx?koebstadID=74|title=Århus: Byhistorie|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>

===Industrialization===
[[File:Aarhus set fra bakkerne i Riis Skov.jpg|right|thumb|View of Aarhus, 1850]]
Following the [[Napoleonic wars]], Denmark lost Norway and was excluded from international trade for some years which caused a recession for Aarhus' trade based economy that lasted until the 1830s. The economy turned around as the [[industrial revolution]] reached the city and  factories with steam-driven machinery became more productive.

In 1838, the electoral laws were reformed leading to elections for the 15 seats on the city council. The rules were initially very strict allowing only the wealthiest citizens to run. In the 1844 elections only 174 citizens qualified out of a total population of more than 7,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Byraadet/Byens-raad-dengang/Byens-raad-1838-1868.aspx|title=Byens raad 1838-1868|language=Danish|author=Aarhus Kommune|website=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=Aarhus Municipality|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref> The first city council, mainly composed of wealthy merchants and industrialists, quickly looked to improve the harbour, situated along the [[Aarhus River]]. Larger ships and growing freight volumes made a river harbour increasingly impractical. In 1840, the harbour was moved to the coast, north of the river where it became the largest industrial harbour outside Copenhagen over the following 15 years. From the outset, the new harbour was controlled by the city council, as it is to this day.<ref name="Byhistorie.dk">{{cite web|url=http://blog.byhistorie.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/I-medgang-og-modgang-rapport-over-udviklingen-af-den-moderne-havn-i-Aarhus-fra-o.-1840-2006.pdf|title=Rapport over udviklingen af den moderne havn i Aarhus fra o. 1840-2006|language=Danish|author=Byhistorie.dk|publisher=Byhistorie.dk|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref>

During the [[First Schleswig War]] Aarhus was occupied by German troops from 21 June to 24 July 1849. The city was spared any fighting, but in [[Vejlby]] north of the city a cavalry skirmish known as [[Skirmish of Århus|Rytterfægtningen]] took place which stopped the German advance through Jutland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/AarhusStadsarkiv/Home/Servicesider/Nyheder/2014/3-kvartal/Ugens-Aarhushistorie-Rytterfaegtningen.aspx?sc_lang=da|title=Ugens Aarhushistorie - Rytterfægtningen|publisher=Stadsarkivet|website=http://www.aarhus.dk/|language=Danish|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> The war and occupation left a notable impact on the city as many streets, particularly in [[Frederiksbjerg]], are named after Danish officers of the time. Fifteen years later, in 1864, the city was occupied again, this time for seven months, during the [[Second Schleswig War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/nyheder/1864-jylland-besat-af-tyske-tropper|title=1864 Jylland besat af tyske tropper|author=Ivan Freund Nielsen|publisher=Aarhus Stiftstidende|language=Danish|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/perioder/det-unge-demokrati-1848-1901/treaarskrigen-1848-50-1-slesvigske-krig/|title=Det unge demokrati 1848-1901|publisher=Aarhus University|website=Danmarkshistorien.dk|author=Erik Strange Petersen|language=Danish|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref>

In spite of wars and occupation the city continued to develop. In 1851 [[octroi]] was abolished and the city walls were removed to provide easier access for trade. Regular [[steamship]] links with Copenhagen had begun in 1830 and in 1862 Jutland's first railway was established between Aarhus and [[Randers]].<ref name="Byhistorie.dk"/>

[[File:Havne udsigt fra dokken.jpg|thumb|right|''Toldkammeret'' (Custom House, 1898)]]
In the second half of the 19th century industrialization came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil and butter. Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus. The [[Ceres Brewery]] was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus' local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres-grunden (lit.: ''the Ceres-grounds'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceres.dk/Default.aspx?ID=25 |title=History|publisher=Ceres.dk|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoflev.dk/article.asp?id=134|title= Ceres Bryggerierne A/S|publisher=Hoflev.dk|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/ceres-grunden.asp|title=Ceres-grunden|language=Danish|publisher=Aarhusportalen (Jyllands-Posten)|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created KFK (Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet), focused on grain and [[Animal feed|feedstuffs]].

Aarhus became the largest provincial city in the country by the turn of the century and the city marketed itself as the "Capital of Jutland". The population increased from 15,000 in 1870 to 52,000 in 1901 and in response the city annexed large land areas to develop new residential quarters such as [[Trøjborg]], [[Frederiksbjerg]] and [[Marselisborg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/frederiksbjerg/side1.htm|title=Frederiksbjerg Øst - Århus|language=Danish|author=Magistratens 2. Afdeling|year=1979|website=Kommuneatlas|publisher=Aarhus Municipality|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> Many of its cultural institutions were also established at this time such as the [[Aarhus Theatre]] (1900), the national library (1902), [[Aarhus University]] (1928) and several hospitals.<ref>Aarhus Amtssygehus was established in 1882 (moved and expanded in 1935), Århus Kommunehospital was established in 1893 and Marselisborg Hospital was built in 1913.

===Second World War===
[[File:Ryesgade, Aarhus, May 1945. The resistance rounds up collaborators, Cheering crowds celebrate..jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.95|Liberation celebrations, 1945]]
On 9 April 1940, German troops invaded Denmark and occupied the city, establishing their headquarters in the university and from 1943 the [[Gestapo]] based their headquarters for Jutland there as well. In the later years of the war Aarhus became an important transport hub for seaborne supplies to Norway. On 4 July 1944, a [[1944 explosion in Aarhus|freight barge loaded with ammunition exploded]] in the harbour, killing 33 people and causing significant destruction to the harbour area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/aarhus/70-aar-siden-eksplosionen-paa-aarhus-havn|title=70 aar siden eksplosionen|publisher=Aarhus Stiftstidende|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref>

In 1944 the resistance movement in Jutland encouraged the Allies to conduct an air raid against the German headquarters in Aarhus to destroy files and obstruct operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/uhu/showroom/galleri/lokaliteterogbygninger/parkkollegierne/luftangrebetpaagestaposhovedkvarter31.10.1944/|title=Luftangrebet på gestapos hovedkvarter 31.10.1944|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref> On 31 October the [[Aarhus Air Raid]] saw a "daring, low-level precision bombing attack" on the Gestapo headquarters in Aarhus by 25 Mosquitoes from the Number 140 Wing of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force]]. Resistance leader Pastor [[Harald Sandbaek]] was being held captive there at the time. The bombs dropped in the centre of the former University of Aarhus building, killing an estimated 150–200 Gestapo members and some 30 Danes while destroying German files on the Danish resistance.{{sfn|Zabecki|1999|pp=1350-1}}{{Sfn|Trenear-Harvey|2009|p=2}}

Several [[Schalburgtage]] operations took place between August 1944 and May 1945, when the occupation ended. The largest occurred on the night of 22 February 1945 when a series of explosions in central Aarhus destroyed or damaged a number of buildings, including [[Aarhus Teater]]. Other such operations included two attempts at destroying [[Aarhus City Hall]], recently completed in 1941.

The surrender of German forces officially came into effect on 5 May 1945 but in Aarhus fighting broke out shortly before midday between resistance fighters and a small German force that refused surrender. The fighting claimed the lives of both resistance fighters and civilians but by the end of the day order was restored and on 8 May British forces entered the city, officially liberating it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE4463374/blodbad-pa-bispetorvet/|title=Blodbad på Bispetorvet|publisher=Jyllandsposten|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref>

===Post-war years===
[[File:Aarhus docklands by night.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Urban development in Aarhus city centre, 2013]]
In the 1980s the city entered a period of rapid growth and the service sector overtook trade, industry and crafts as the leading sector of employment for the first time. Workers gradually began commuting to the city from most of east and central Jutland as the region became more interconnected. The student population tripled between 1965 and 1977 turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/historie/aarstal/|title=VIGTIGE ÅRSTAL|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism; [[Gaffa (magazine)|Gaffa]] and the [[KaosPilot]] school were founded in 1983 and 1991 respectively, and Aarhus was at the center of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as [[TV-2 (band)|TV2]], [[Gnags]], [[Thomas Helmig]], [[Bamses Venner]], [[Anne Dorte Michelsen]], Mek Pek and [[Shit & Chanel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dengamleby.dk/aarhusrocks/|title=Aarhus Rocks|publisher=Den Gamle By|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nordeafonden.dk/aarhus-rocks-byen-og-musikken-1960-2014|title=Byen og Musikken 1960-2914|publisher=NordeaFonden|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Jylland_-_byer/%C3%85rhus/%C3%85rhus_(Musikliv)|title=Aarhus - rytmisk musik|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref>

Since the turn of the millennium both skyline and land use has changed as former industrial sites are being redeveloped into new city districts. Starting in 2007, the former docklands are being converted to a new mixed use district dubbed "Aarhus Ø" ([[Aarhus Docklands]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessaarhus.dk/da/Fremtidens-Aarhus/Udviklingsomraader/Aarhus-Oe.aspx|title=Business Aarhus, Aarhus Ø|publisher=Business Aarhus|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref> The site of the former [[Royal Unibrew]] [[Ceres Brewery|Ceres breweries]] began redevelopment in 2012 into "CeresByen", a residential district with educational institutions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ceresbyen.dk/ |title=CeresByen.dk|publisher=CeresByen |accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref> The former [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]] repair facilities at Frederiks Plads have been demolished and is being developed into a new business district with high-rise buildings scheduled for completion in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frederiksplads.dk/projekter/id%C3%A9en.aspx|title=Frederiks Plads|publisher=NCC Property Development A/S|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfmoller.com/g/Frederiks-Plads-ny-bydel-i-centrum-af-Aarhus-i13235.html|title=FREDERIKS PLADS - NY BYDEL I CENTRUM AF AARHUS|publisher=C.

Accelerating growth since the early 2000s brought the inner urban area to roughly 260,000 inhabitants by 2014. The rapid growth is expected to continue until at least 2030 when Aarhus municipality has set an ambitious target for 375,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/aarhus/FremtidensAarhus1.aspx|title=Fremtidens Aarhus|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref>

==Geography==
Aarhus is located on the Bay of Aarhus on the eastern shore of the Jutland peninsula, by road {{convert|38.5|km}} south of [[Randers]], {{convert|50|km}} north of [[Horsens]] and {{convert|44|km}} east of [[Silkeborg]].<ref name="GM">{{Google maps|url=http://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-is-it-between.htm|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> Aarhus lies south of the peninsula of [[Djursland]] and faces the [[Kattegat]] to the east with the peninsulas of [[Mols]] and [[Helgenæs]] across the bay to the north and east.

=== Topography ===
[[File:Egådalen (juli).jpg|thumb|right|Egådalen. A broad and flat valley, marking the northern limits of Aarhus]]
Aarhus was founded on the northern shores of a [[Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|fjord]] on the Bay of Aarhus which provides a natural harbour with a depth of {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} quite close to the shore.<ref name="Olsen2000">{{cite book|last=Olsen|first=Søren|title=Danmarks købstæder: 144 købstæder og andre gamle byer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2AKRQwAACAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Gyldendals Bogklubber|page=124|isbn=978-87-00-66364-0}}</ref> The fjord no longer exists as it has gradually [[Sediment transport#Fluvial|narrowed]] into the [[Aarhus River]] and [[Brabrand Lake]] west of the city.

The hilly area around Aarhus consists of a [[moraine|moranial plateau]] from the last ice age, broken by a complex system of [[tunnel valley]]s. The most prominent valleys of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south, stretching inland east-west with the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake and Tåstrup Sø (Tåstrup Lake) and the [[Egå|Egå Valley]] to the north, with the stream of [[Egå]]en, Kasted Mose (Kasted Bog) and Geding Sø (Geding Lake). Much of the two valleys has been drained and subsequently farmed, but recently some of the drainage was removed for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes the Lyngbygård Å (Lyngbygård River) in the west and valleys to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the [[quaternary|pre-quaternary]]. By contrast, the Aarhus River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late [[glacial meltwater valley]]s. The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow [[tertiary]] clay from the [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] (57 to 24 million years ago).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/%C3%85rhus_Kommune|title=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=''Den Store Danske'' |accessdate=19 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref><ref>[http://extra.geus.info/web/nm-grundvand-brabrand-dalen.htm Brabranddalen] Århus Amt.

Aarhus is in the [[humid continental climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb'') <ref name="WeatherOnline">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Denmark.htm|title=Denmark|publisher=WeatherOnline|accessdate=24 November 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> and the weather is influenced by [[low-pressure area|low-pressure systems]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climactic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.

Western winds from the Atlantic and [[North Sea]] are dominant resulting in more precipitation in western Denmark. In addition, Jutland rises sufficiently in the centre to lift air to higher, colder altitudes contributing to increased precipitation in eastern Jutland. Combined these factors make east and south Jutland comparatively wetter than other parts of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmi.dk/vejr/arkiver/normaler-og-ekstremer/klimanormaler-dk|title=Klimanormaler|publisher=DMI|accessdate=23 November 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> Average temperature over the year is {{convert|8.43|°C|0}} with February being the coldest month (0.1&nbsp;°C) and August the warmest (15.9&nbsp;°C). Temperatures in the sea can reach 17 to 22 degrees Celsius in June to August, but it is not uncommon for beaches to register 25 degrees Celsius locally.<ref name="WeatherOnline"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ditdanmark.com/article.95.html|title=The climate in Denmark|publisher=DitDanmark|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>

The geography in the area affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low-laying valley floor where central Aarhus is located. [[Brabrand Lake]] to the west further contributes to this effect and as a result the valley has a very mild, temperate climate. The sandy ground on the valley floor dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining [[boulder clay]]. These conditions effect crops and plants that often bloom 1–2 weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/%C3%85rhus_Kommune|title=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=23 November 2014|language=Danish}}</ref>

Because of the northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 2 minutes of daylight. The difference in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices is 10 hours and 30 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torbenhermansen.dk/almanak/almanak.php#|title=Sol op/ned |publisher=Almanak|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

{{see also|List of mayors of Aarhus}}
Aarhus is the seat of [[Aarhus Municipality]] and Aarhus City Council (''Aarhus Byråd'') is also the municipal government. The [[Mayor]] of Aarhus until 2017 is [[Jacob Bundsgaard]] of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/byraadet/byraadets-medlemmer/borgmester-jacob-bundsgaard.aspx|title=Jacob Bundsgaard|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=23 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> Municipal elections are held every fourth year on the third Tuesday of November. The city council consists of 31 members elected for four-year terms. When an election has determined the composition of the council, it elects a mayor, two deputy mayors and five [[alderman|aldermen]] from their ranks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/byraadet.aspx|title=Byråd|publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]]|date=15 July 2003|accessdate=10 July 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> Anyone who is eligible to vote and who resides within Aarhus municipality can run for a seat on the city council provided they can secure endorcements and signatures from 50 inhabitants of the municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/politik/Valg/For-kandidater/Stillere.aspx|title=Stillere|publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]]|date=6 August 2015|accessdate=6 August 2015|language=Danish}}</ref>

Administratively the city is divided in six minor agencies which together constitute the [[magistrate]] led by the mayor and five aldermen as  administrative directors. It is the only Danish city with a magistrate structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Saadan-styres-Aarhus.aspx|title=Sådan styres Aarhus|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=23 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> The six departments of the city are the ''Mayor's Department'', ''Social Affairs and Employment'', ''Technical Services and Environment'', ''Health and Care'', ''Culture and Citizens Services'' and ''Children and Young People'' which handle all the day-to-day operations of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Magistraten.aspx|title=Magistraten|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=23 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>

Politically Aarhus leans left and the largest political party has historically been the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democratic Party]] which has also held the mayors office for all terms with the notable exception of the 2001-2005 term when Louise Gade of [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] became both the first female and non-Social Democratic mayor. The gender composition of the city council has risen steadily in favour of women through the 20th century and currently 9 of 31 members are women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Byraadet/Byens-raad-dengang/Kvinder-i-byraadet-1909-2013.aspx|title=Kvinder i byraadet 1909-2013|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=10 December 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>

The first publicly elected mayor of Aarhus was appointed in 1919. In the [[1970 Danish Municipal Reform]] the current Aarhus Municipality was created by merging 20 municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Aarhus_Kommune|title=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> Aarhus was the seat of [[Aarhus County]] until the 2007 Danish Municipal Reform, which substituted the Danish counties with five regions and replaced Aarhus County with [[Central Denmark Region]] (''Region Midtjylland''), seated in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rm.dk/om-os/|title=Om os|publisher=Region Midtjylland|accessdate=23 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>

Aarhus municipality has 45 [[electoral wards]] and [[polling station]]s in four [[electoral districts]] for the [[folketing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Valg/Find-dit-valgsted/Distrikter.aspx|title=Find dit valgsted|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=3 August 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> The [[diocese of Aarhus]] has four [[deanery|deaneries]] composed of 60 [[parish]]es within Aarhus municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aarhusstift.dk/om/|title=Om Aarhus Stift|publisher=Aarhus Stift|accessdate=3 August 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> Aarhus municipality contains 21 [[Postal code|postal districts]] and some parts of another 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postdanmark.dk/da/Documents/Lister/regionsopdelt-postnummer-excel.xls|title=Regionsopdelt Postnummer|publisher=Postdanmark|accessdate=3 August 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> The urban area of Aarhus and the immediate suburbs are divided in the districts [[Aarhus C]], [[Aarhus N]], [[Aarhus V]], [[Viby J]], [[Højbjerg]] and [[Brabrand]].

Aarhus is segmented into districts on different levels often containing several distinct neighbourhoods within. The historical centre, known as ''Indre By'' (lit. [[English language|English]], "Inner City"), includes the neighborhoods ''Centralværkstedet'', the [[Latin Quarter]] and the areas around the [[Aarhus Central Station|Central Station]] and [[Aarhus Concert Hall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/bygninger_bevaringsvaerdier/Bygninger_bevaringsvaerdier_%2022.htm|title=Den Indre By|publisher=Kommuneatlas|accessdate=3 August 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> The inner city beltway [[Ring 1 (Aarhus)|Ring 1]] contains the larger district [[Midtbyen, Aarhus|Midtbyen]] (lit.

=== Environmental planning ===
{{Main|Energy in Denmark}}

Aarhus has increasingly been investing in [[environmental planning]]. The city council has identified a number of environmental targets for the coming years within energy efficiency and aquatic environment. The targets are designed to provide the guidelines for [[green growth]] in the city.<ref>[http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/gogreenwithaarhus/Home/Maal.aspx?sc_lang=en Targets] Aarhus Municipality</ref><ref>[http://stateofgreen.com/en/profiles/city-of-aarhus Profile: City of Aarhus] State of Green</ref> In accordance with national policy, Aarhus aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of [[fossil fuel]]s for heating by 2030.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/gogreenwithaarhus/Home/Maal/CO2-neutral.aspx?sc_lang=en|title=Climate Target 2030|publisher=Aarhus Municipality|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> These goals have materialized in a plan to increase multiple-source heat production and the waste and district heating service ''AffaldVarme Aarhus'' is building a combined heat and power plant running on [[biofuel]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/gogreenwithaarhus/Home/Maal/CO2-neutral/Varme-i-Aarhus-skal-vaere-uafhaengig-af-fossilt-braendstof.aspx?sc_lang=en|title=Heat in Aarhus must be independent of fossil fuels|publisher=Aarhus Municipality|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>

This should protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. One of the main tasks is to deal with the large quantities of [[nutrient pollution|excessive nutrients]] in and around Aarhus, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus. A second task is to tackle the increasing levels of precipitation brought about by current and future [[climate change]], and a third important task is to secure fresh, clean and safe drinking water for the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Planer-og-projekter/Vandvision2100.ashx|title=Vand Vision 2100|publisher=Aarhus Municipality, Technology & Environment|date=January 2010|accessdate=29 July 2014|language=Danish}}</ref>

[[File:True Skov 9.jpg|thumb|Recent afforestation in [[True Skov]]]]
Aarhus Municipality and the city council have attacked the challenges from different angles in a constructive collaboration with private partners. Many new underground rainwater basins have been built across the city in recent years. The two lakes of [[Brabrand Lake|Årslev Engsø]] and [[Egå Engsø]] were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. Large expanses of forest have been planted in vulnerable land areas in order to secure drinking water and avoid groundwater pollution from [[pesticides]] and other sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Park-og-skov/PDF-Vedr-skove/skovudviklingsplan-2010-2020.pdf|title=Skovudviklingsplan 2010-2020|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=1 August 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> Since 1988, the [[New Forests of Aarhus]] have been developed to assist in [[carbon sequestration|binding CO2]], securing [[drinking water]], protecting [[groundwater]] from pollution, dealing with [[Nutrient pollution|excessive nutrients]], increasing [[biodiversity]], creating an attractive countryside, providing easy access to nature and offering outdoor activities to the public. The [[afforestation]] plans were realized as a local project in collaboration with private land owners, under a larger national agenda, and there are new afforestation objectives to double the forest cover in Aarhus Municipality, before the year 2030.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/gogreenwithaarhus/Home/Maal/Attraktiv-by/Nye-skove-sikrer-drikkevand-natur-og-friluftsliv.aspx?sc_lang=da|title=Woodland Target 2030|publisher=Aarhus Municipality|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>

The city is home to 75 different religious groups and denominations most of which are Christian or Muslim with a smaller number of Buddhist and Hindu communities. Since the 1990s there has been a marked growth in diverse new spiritual groups although the total number of followers remains small.<ref name="Aarhus 2013 religion i forandring"/> The majority of the population are members of the Protestant state church, [[Church of Denmark]], which is by far the largest religious institution both in the city and the country as a whole. Some 20% of the population are not officially affiliated with any religion, a percentage that has been slowly rising for many years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://samtidsreligion.au.dk/fileadmin/Samtidsreligion/Religion_i_Aarhus_2013/online_med_forside.pdf|title=Religion_i_Aarhus_2013, s. 475|publisher=Center for Samtidsreligion, Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=8 December 2014|language=Danish}}</ref>

Some 15,000 have come from within Europe, with Poland, Germany, Romania and Norway being the largest contributors.<ref name="Danmarks Statistik: FOLK1"/>

Many immigrants have established themselves in [[Brabrand]], [[Hasle, Aarhus|Hasle]] and [[Viby J|Viby]], where the percentage of inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by 66% since the year 2000. This has resulted in several 'especially vulnerable residential areas' (a.k.a. [[ghetto]]s), with [[Gellerup]] as the most notable neighbourhood. In Brabrand and Gellerup, two thirds of the population now have a non-Danish ethnic background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/politik/ECE4470063/flere-indvandrere-til-belastede-omrader-i-arhus/|title=Flere indvandrere til belastede områder i Århus|publisher=''Jyllands Posten''|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref>  The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life and contribute many cultural flavours hitherto uncommon for the Nordic countries, including [[Bazar Vest]], a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bazarvest.dk/Brochurer.aspx?ID=674 |title=Brochures on Bazar Vest|publisher=Bazar Vest|accessdate=10 July 2014|language=Danish}}</ref>

The economy of Aarhus is predominantly knowledge and service based, strongly influenced by the [[University of Aarhus]] and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefitting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/erhverv.aspx?koebstadID=74|title=Danmarks Købsteder: Århus|publisher=Den digitale byport|accessdate=8 December 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 in the private sector and the rest split between state, region and municipality.<ref name="Aarhus Kommune"/> The region is a major [[agriculture|agricultural producer]], with many large farms in the outlying districts.<ref name="Aarhus: Economy">{{cite web|url=http://bcg.thetimes.co.uk/Europe/Denmark/Aarhus#/Europe/Denmark/Aarhuseconomy|title=Aarhus: Economy|publisher=''The Times''|accessdate=23 July 2014 }}</ref>

[[File:Eleonora in Aarhus (8789315200).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|[[Eleonora Maersk]] in the Port of Aarhus]]

The Port of Aarhus is one of the largest industrial ports in [[Northern Europe]] with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world.<ref name=aarhushavn>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/en/about_port_of_aarhus/about_port_of_aarhus.htm|title=About Port of Aarhus|publisher=Aarhus Havn|accessdate=16 July 2014 }}</ref><ref name="Signe Ferslev Pedersen">{{cite web|url=http://www.business.dk/transport/maersk-arving-vil-kapre-mere-gods-til-aarhus|title=Mærsk-arving vil kapre mere gods til Aarhus |author=Signe Ferslev Pedersen|publisher=''Berlingske''|date=21 July 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. The facilities handle some 9.5 million tonnes of cargo a year (2012). Grain is the principal export, while [[animal feed|feedstuff]]s, stone, cement and [[coal]] are among the chief imports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/en/about_port_of_aarhus/cargo_statistics/cargo_statistics.htm|title=Cargo statistics|publisher=Aarhus Havn|accessdate=21 July 2014 }}</ref> Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition from [[Port of Hamburg]] and freight volumes has decreased some from the peak in 2008.<ref name="Signe Ferslev Pedersen"/>

The ferry terminal presents the only alternative to the [[Great Belt Link]] for passenger transport between Jutland and [[Zealand]]. It has served different ferry companies since the first steamship route to Copenhagen opened in 1830. Currently [[Mols-Linien]] operates the route and annually transports some 2 million passengers and a million vehicles. Additional [[roll-on/roll-off]] cargo ferries serve [[Finland]] and [[Kalundborg]] on a weekly basis and smaller outlying Danish ports on irregular intervals. Since the early 2000s the port has increasingly become a destination for cruise lines operating in the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/download/formularer/aarsrapport2013.pdf|publisher=Aarhus Havn|title=Aarsrapport 2013|accessdate=9 December 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>

==Cityscape==
{{wide image|Panorama of Aarhus.jpg|1200px|Panoramic view of the Aarhus skyline seen from the top of [[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum|ARoS]].}}
Aarhus has developed in stages, from the Viking age to modern times, all visible in the city today. Many architectural styles are represented in different parts of the city such as [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[National Romantic Style|National Romantic]], [[Nordic Classicism|Nordic classicism]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[empire style|Empire]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|title=Arkitektur og byggeskik i byen|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=14 December 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> The city has grown up around the main transport hubs, the harbour and later the railway station and as a result, the oldest parts of the city are also the most central and busiest today.

[[File:Marselisborg3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marselisborg Palace]]]]
The streets Volden (lit ''Rampart'') and Graven (lit. ''Moat'') testify to the defences of the initial Viking settlement and ''Allégaderingen'' in [[Midtbyen, Aarhus|Midtbyen]] roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement. The street network in the [[Midtbyen (Aarhus)|inner city]] formed during the Middle Ages with narrow, curved streets and low, dense housing by the river and coast. ''Vesterport'' (lit. ''Western Gate'') still bears the name of a medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways ''Posthussmøgen'' and ''Telefonsmøgen'' are remnants of toll stations from that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reader.livedition.dk/aarhuskommune/188/|title=Kulturhistorisk redegørelse 2013|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=14 December 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> The inner city has the oldest preserved houses, especially the [[Latinerkvarteret, Aarhus|Latin Quarter]], with buildings dating back to the early 17th century in ''Mejlgade'' and ''Skolegade''.<ref name=Olsen2000/> Medieval merchants' mansions with courtyards can be seen in ''Klostergade'', ''Studsgade'' and ''Skolegade''.

=== Landmarks ===
[[Aarhus Cathedral]] (''Århus Domkirke'') in the center of Aarhus, is the longest and tallest church in Denmark at {{convert|93|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|96|m|abbr=on}} in length and height respectively.

It is smaller and less impressive, but it was the first cathedral of Aarhus and founded on an even older church constructed in 1060; the oldest stone church in Scandinavia.
