'''''Batman & Robin''''' is a 1997 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. It is the fourth and final installment of [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Batman in film#Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher series (1989–1997)|initial ''Batman'' film series]]. The film was directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] and written by [[Akiva Goldsman]]. It stars [[George Clooney]], [[Chris O'Donnell]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Uma Thurman]], and [[Alicia Silverstone]].

''Batman & Robin'' tells the story of the [[Batman and Robin (disambiguation)|Dynamic Duo]] as they attempt to prevent [[Mr. Freeze]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] from freezing all mankind to death and repopulating the earth with mutant plants, while at the same time struggling to keep their partnership together. This is also the only film appearance of [[Batgirl]], who helps the title characters win in the end.

Warner Bros. fast tracked development for ''Batman & Robin'' following the box office success of the previous film, ''[[Batman Forever]]''. Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the storyline during pre-production on ''[[A Time to Kill (film)|A Time to Kill]]'', while [[Val Kilmer]] decided not to reprise the role over scheduling conflicts with ''[[The Saint (film)|The Saint]]''. Schumacher had a strong interest in casting [[William Baldwin]] in Kilmer's place before George Clooney won the role. [[Principal photography]] began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the [[shooting schedule]].

''Batman & Robin'' was released on June 20, 1997 and has been called one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]]. Subsequently, Warner Bros. cancelled the unproduced ''[[Batman (1989 film series)#Batman Triumphant|Batman Triumphant]]'' and the film series was eventually [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed with ''[[Batman Begins]]'' in 2005. One of the songs recorded for the film, "[[The End Is the Beginning Is the End]]" by [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], won a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] at the [[40th Grammy Awards]].

==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->
[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]] fail to stop [[Mr. Freeze]] from stealing a cache of diamonds. They learn that Freeze was once a scientist named Victor Fries, who became dependent on a diamond-powered subzero suit following an accident in a cryogenics lab while working to save his wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]], from a [[terminal illness]] called MacGregor's Syndrome.

Meanwhile, botanist Dr. Pamela Isley is experimenting with the strength serum "[[Venom (DC Comics)|Venom]]" to create mutant plants capable of fighting back against mankind. She is angry that her senior colleague [[Floronic Man|Dr. Jason Woodrue]] used her Venom to transform a diminutive prisoner into the "super soldier" [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. She refuses to partner with Woodrue so he tries to kill her with animal-plant toxins and chemicals, causing her to transform into the beautiful [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]. She kills Woodrue with a venomous kiss and vows to establish botanical supremacy over the world.

[[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s niece [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara Wilson]] makes a surprise visit from England and is invited to stay at [[Wayne Manor]]. Later, Barbara finds the [[Batcave]] and creates her own crime-fighting persona with the help of a computer simulation of Alfred. The real Alfred is suffering from MacGregor's Syndrome. He is, however, in stage 1, for which Mr. Freeze has developed a cure despite being unable to cure his wife's condition because it is too advanced.

Ivy arrives in Gotham City with Bane as her henchman. She interrupts a Wayne Enterprises press conference at the Gotham Observatory where a giant telescope is being unveiled. Ivy demands Bruce Wayne use his fortune to safeguard the natural environment at the expense of millions of human lives, and Bruce refuses.

Ivy appears at the Gotham Botanical Gardens fundraiser, seducing everyone present with her [[pheromone]] dust, including the Dynamic Duo, who are there to protect a diamond from Mr. Freeze. When Freeze crashes the event Ivy is instantly captivated by his "ruthless charm". Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at the [[Arkham Asylum]] but is released by Ivy.

Ivy turns off Nora Fries' life support and makes Freeze believe Batman did it, persuading him that they should destroy Batman along with the society that created him. They plan to turn the observatory's new telescope into a giant freeze ray to kill all humanity to allow Ivy's mutant plants to take over the world.

Meanwhile, Robin is under Ivy's seductive spell and is rebelling against Batman. Robin goes to meet Ivy at her garden hideout, where her venomous kiss fails to kill Robin because Batman had prevailed on him to coat his lips with rubber. Ivy tries to drown Robin in her lily pond and entangles Batman in her crushing vines, but they are able to free themselves when [[Batgirl]] arrives and traps Ivy in her own floral throne.

Batgirl reveals herself as Barbara. The three crime-fighters arrive at the Observatory to stop Freeze who has already frozen all of Gotham. Bane attacks Robin and Batgirl, but they incapacitate him and restore him to his original human state. Robin and Batgirl save Gotham by using the observatory's satellites to reflect sunlight from outer space to thaw the city.

Batman shows Freeze video proof that Ivy pulled the plug on Nora and reveals that he, Batman was the one who saved her. He vows that Freeze will be allowed to continue his research at Arkham Asylum to cure Nora. Batman asks Freeze for his cure for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for Alfred and Freeze atones for his misdeeds by giving him two vials of the medicine.

At Arkham, Ivy is joined in her cell by Freeze, who vows to exact revenge on her. Back at Wayne Manor, Alfred is cured and Bruce invites Barbara to live with them, joining Batman and Robin to fight crime as Batgirl.

==Cast==

* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as [[Mr. Freeze|Dr. Victor Fries / Mr. Freeze]] <br> A [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[molecular biology|molecular biologist]] and two-time [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[Decathlon|decathlete]] who suffers a terrible accident while trying to cryogenically preserve his terminally ill wife.

* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara Wilson]] / [[Batgirl]] <br> Her parents had previously died in a car accident.  Alfred, her uncle, was very close to her mother, Margaret.

Despite proving more than a match for Batman and Robin earlier on, he is eventually defeated by Robin and Batgirl after they find a way to stop the venom flow to his brain. 
**Michael Reid MacKay portrays him in flashbacks prior to his transformation.

* [[Vendela Kirsebom]] as [[Nora Fries]] <br> Mr. Freeze's cryogenically-frozen wife.

According to ''Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Part 6: Batman Unbound'', Chris O'Donnell revealed that despite hanging out with Arnold Schwarzenegger a lot off set and during promotion for the film, they never worked a single day together. This was achieved with stand in's when one of the actors wasn't available.

Schumacher and producer Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of ''Batman & Robin'' on Warner Bros.' decision to fast track production. "There was a lot of pressure from Warner Bros. to make ''Batman & Robin'' more [[family-friendliness|family-friendly]]," Schumacher explained.

''Batman & Robin'' was nominated for the [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film]], as well as [[Saturn Award for Best Make-up|Best Make-up]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Costume|Best Costume]], but won none. [[Alicia Silverstone]] won the [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Award]] for Worst Supporting Actress. Other nominations at the Razzie Awards included Schumacher (Worst Director), George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell (Worst Screen Couple), Akiva Goldsman (Worst Screenplay), both Chris O'Donnell and Arnold Schwarzenegger (Worst Supporting Actor), Uma Thurman (Worst Supporting Actress), as well as [[Billy Corgan]] (Worst Song for "[[The End Is the Beginning Is the End]]"). ''Batman & Robin'' also received nominations for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]], Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property. Ultimately, out of 11 nominations, ''Batman & Robin'' garnered only one Razzie Award.

Many observers thought Schumacher added possible [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] [[innuendo]] in the storyline.<ref name=shadow/> [[James Berardinelli]] questioned the "random amount ''[sic]'' of rubber nipples and camera angle [[close-up]]s of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches."<ref>{{cite web | author=[[James Berardinelli]] | title = Batman and Robin | work=ReelViews.net | url = http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/batman4.html | accessdate = November 13, 2008}}</ref> Similar to ''Batman Forever'', this primarily included the decision to add nipples and enlarged [[codpiece]]s to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, "I had no idea that putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from [[Ancient Greek art|ancient Greek statue]]s, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct."<ref name=shadow/> Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt "it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece.

During the filming of ''Batman & Robin'', Warner Bros. was impressed with the [[dailies]], prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a sequel. However, writer [[Akiva Goldsman]] turned down an offer to write the script.<ref name=mike/> In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired [[Mark Protosevich]] to write the script for a fifth ''Batman'' film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced.<ref>{{cite news | first=Michael| last=Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117435255 | title = Helmer's 3rd At Bat |work=Variety  | date = February 21, 1997 | accessdate = October 17, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081019042349/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117435255| archivedate= October 19, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Titled ''Batman Triumphant'', Protosevich's script had the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] as the main villain. Through the use of his fear [[toxin]], he resurrects the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] as a hallucination in Batman's mind. [[Harley Quinn]] appeared as a supporting character, written as the Joker's daughter.<ref>{{cite news | first=Brian| last=Linder | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034019p1.html | title = Rumblings From Gotham | work=[[IGN]] | date = July 27, 2000 | accessdate = October 17, 2008}}</ref> George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, and Alicia Silverstone were set to reprise the roles of Batman, Robin, and Batgirl.

Warner Bros. decided to consider a live-action ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' film and an adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: Year One]]''. Warner would then produce whichever idea suited them the most.<ref name=ass/> Schumacher felt he "owe[d] the Batman culture a real ''Batman'' movie. I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight."<ref name=Jen/> He approached Warner Bros. about doing ''Batman: Year One'' in mid-1998,<ref name=Jen>{{cite news | first=Jeff| last=Jensen | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285969,00.html | title = Winging It |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = December 4, 1998 | accessdate = October 17, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081019113057/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285969,00.html| archivedate= October 19, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> but they were more interested in hiring [[Darren Aronofsky]]. Aronofsky and Frank Miller developed a ''Year One'' script with Aronofsky to direct, but it was ultimately canceled. [[Christopher Nolan]] was eventually hired to helm the next ''Batman'' film in January 2003, resulting in the [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).<ref name=ass>{{cite book | first=David| last=Hughes | title = Tales From Development Hell | publisher=[[Titan Books]] |date=March 2004 | location = London | pages = 192–211| chapter = The Dark Knight Strikes Out | isbn = 1-84023-691-4 }}</ref>

In "[[Chemistry (The New Batman Adventures)|Legends of the Dark Knight]]", an episode of ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', three teenagers discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like.

Additionally, there were worries within [[Warner Bros.]] surrounding the negative critical reaction to ''Batman & Robin'' and how that may come to harm the success of the subsequent direct-to-video animated film ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', which was originally planned for release at around the same time as ''Batman & Robin'' but was subsequently delayed.<ref name="stomptokyo1">{{cite web|url=http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/batman-subzero.html |title=Stomp Tokyo Video Reviews - Batman & Mr. Freeze: Subzero |publisher=Stomptokyo.com |date=March 25, 1998 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref> However, ''SubZero'' received a far stronger positive response from critics than ''Batman & Robin'', with Mr. Freeze's role within it being seen in a much more positive light, returning his popularity as a ''Batman'' villain to a level comparable to that reached by him within the two Emmy-winning episodes the character featured in of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.<ref name="stomptokyo1"/>
