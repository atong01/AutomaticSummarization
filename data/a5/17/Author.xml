Any person or entity wishing to use<space/><link><target>intellectual property</target></link><space/>held under copyright must receive permission from the copyright holder to use this work, and often will be asked to pay for the use of copyrighted material. After a fixed amount of time, the copyright expires on intellectual work and it enters the public domain, where it can be used without limit. Copyright law has been amended time and time again since the inception of the law to extend the length of this fixed period where the work is exclusively controlled by the copyright holder. However, copyright is merely the legal reassurance that one owns his/her work. Technically, someone owns their work from the time it's created. An interesting aspect of authorship emerges with copyright in that it can be passed down to another upon one's death. The person who inherits the copyright is not the author, but enjoys the same legal benefits.</paragraph><paragraph>Questions arise as to the application of copyright law. How does it, for example, apply to the complex issue of<space/><link><target>fan fiction</target></link>? If the media agency responsible for the authorized production allows material from fans, what is the limit before legal constraints from actors, music, and other considerations, come into play? As well, how does copyright apply to fan-generated stories for books?

In the wake of<space/><link><target>postmodern literature</target></link>, critics such as<space/><link><target>Roland Barthes</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Michel Foucault</target></link><space/>have examined the role and relevance of authorship to the meaning or interpretation of a text.</paragraph><paragraph>Barthes challenges the idea that a text can be attributed to any single author. He writes, in his essay<space/><italics>&quot;Death of the Author&quot;</italics><space/>(1968), that &quot;it is language which speaks, not the author&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="barthes"><template><target>Citation</target><arg name="last"><space/>Barthes<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Roland<space/></arg><arg name="chapter"><space/>The Death of the Author<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>1968<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Image, Music, Text<space/></arg><arg name="publication-date"><space/>1997<space/></arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>0-00-686135-0</arg></template></extension><space/>The words and language of a text itself determine and expose meaning for Barthes, and not someone possessing legal responsibility for the process of its production. Every line of written text is a mere reflection of references from any of a multitude of traditions, or, as Barthes puts it, &quot;the text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture&quot;; it is never original.<extension extension_name='ref' name="barthes"></extension><space/>With this, the perspective of the author is removed from the text, and the limits formerly imposed by the idea of one authorial voice, one ultimate and universal meaning, are destroyed. The explanation and meaning of a work does not have to be sought in the one who produced it, &quot;as if it were always in the end, through the more or less transparent allegory of the fiction, the voice of a single person, the author 'confiding' in us&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="barthes"></extension><space/>The psyche, culture, fanaticism of an author can be disregarded when interpreting a text, because the words are rich enough themselves with all of the traditions of language. To expose meanings in a written work without appealing to the celebrity of an author, their tastes, passions, vices, is, to Barthes, to allow language to speak, rather than author.</paragraph><paragraph>Michel Foucault argues in his essay<space/><italics>&quot;What is an author?&quot;</italics><space/>(1969), that all authors are<space/><link><target>writer</target><trail>s</trail></link>, but not all writers are authors.

Foucault warns of the risks of keeping the author's name in mind during interpretation, because it could affect the value and meaning with which one handles an interpretation.</paragraph><paragraph>Literary critics Barthes and Foucault suggest that readers should not rely on or look for the notion of one overarching voice when interpreting a written work, because of the complications inherent with a writer's title of &quot;author.&quot; They warn of the dangers interpretations could suffer from when associating the subject of inherently meaningful words and language with the personality of one authorial voice. Instead, readers should allow a text to be interpreted in terms of the language as &quot;author.&quot;</paragraph><heading level='2'>Relationship between author and publisher</heading><paragraph>The author of a work may receive a percentage calculated on a wholesale or a specific price and or a fixed amount on each sold book. Publishers, at times, reduced the risk of this type of arrangement, by agreeing only to pay this after a certain amount of copies had sold. In Canada this practice occurred during the 1890s, but was not commonplace until the 1920s. Established and successful authors may receive advance payments, set against future royalties, but this is no longer common practice. Most independent publishers pay royalties as a percentage of net receipts - how net receipts are calculated varies from publisher to publisher. Under this arrangement the author does not pay anything towards the expense of publication. The costs and financial risk are all carried by the Publisher, who will then take the greatest percentage of the receipts. See Compensation for more.</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Commissioned: This is where the Publisher makes all the publication arrangements and the author covers all expenses (today the practice of authors<space/><link><target>self-publishing</target></link><space/>or paying for their publications is sometimes called<space/><link><target>vanity publishing</target></link>, and is looked down upon by many mainstream<space/><link><target>publishers</target></link>, even though it may have been a common and accepted practice in the past). This type of publisher normally charges an flat fee for arranging publication, offers a platform for selling and then takes a percentage of the sale of every copy of a book, The author would receive the rest of the money made. An alternative<space/><link><target>self-publishing</target></link><space/>method commonly adopted is to use a third-party print-on-demand publishing platform such as http://www.createspace.com but this type of platforms creates books that are only available through limited outlets and not through mainstream distributors and bookshops (CreateSpace, for example, is exclusive to its owner Amazon).

For the author to reach his or her audience, the work usually must attract the attention of the editor. The idea of the author as the sole meaning-maker of necessity changes to include the influences of the editor and the publisher in order to engage the audience in writing as a social act. There are three principal areas covered by editors - Proofing (checking the Grammar and spelling, looking for typing errors), Story (potentially an area of deep angst for both author and publisher) and Layout (the setting of the final proof ready for publishing often requires minor text changes so a layout editor is required to ensure that these do not alter the sense of the text).</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Pierre Bourdieu</target></link>'s essay &quot;The Field of Cultural Production&quot; depicts the publishing industry as a &quot;space of literary or artistic position-takings,&quot; also called the &quot;field of struggles,&quot; which is defined by the tension and movement inherent among the various positions in the field.<extension extension_name='ref'>Bourdieu, Pierre. &quot;The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.&quot; The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature.

Even the book review by the editors has more significance than the readership's reception.<extension extension_name='ref'>Curran, James. &quot;Literary Editors, Social Networks and Cultural Tradition.&quot; Media Organizations in Society.

An advance is a lump sum paid in advance of publication. An advance must be earned out before royalties are payable. An advance may be paid in two lump sums: the first payment on contract signing, and the second on delivery of the completed manuscript or on publication.</paragraph><paragraph>An author's contract may specify, for example, that they will earn 10% of the retail price of each book sold. Some contracts specify a scale of royalties payable (for example, where royalties start at 10% for the first 10,000 sales, but then increase to a higher percentage rate at higher sale thresholds).</paragraph><paragraph>An author's book must earn the advance before any further royalties are paid. For example, if an author is paid a modest advance of $2000, and their royalty rate is 10% of a book priced at $20 - that is, $2 per book - the book will need to sell 1000 copies before any further payment will be made. Publishers typically withhold payment of a percentage of royalties earned against returns.</paragraph><paragraph>In some countries, authors also earn income from a government scheme such as the ELR (Educational Lending Right) and PLR (Public Lending Right) schemes in Australia. Under these schemes, authors are paid a fee for the number of copies of their books in educational and/or public libraries.</paragraph><paragraph>These days, many authors supplement their income from book sales with public speaking engagements, school visits, residencies, grants, and teaching positions.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Ghostwriter</target><trail>s</trail></link>, technical writers, and textbooks writers are typically paid in a different way: usually a set fee or a per word rate rather than on a percentage of sales.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Academic authorship</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Auteur</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Lead author</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Author editing</target><part>Authors' editor</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Novelist</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Lists of poets</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of novelists</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Lists of writers</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Professional writing</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>2</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Wikidata property</target><arg name="1">P50<space/></arg><arg name="2">author<space/></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Book Publishing Process</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Authority control</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Category:Writing occupations</target></link><link><target>Category:Literary criticism</target></link></paragraph></article>
