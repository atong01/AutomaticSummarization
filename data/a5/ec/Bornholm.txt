'''Bornholm''' ({{IPA-da|bɒːnˈhʌlˀm|}}; [[Old Norse]]: ''Burgundaholmr'') is a [[Denmark|Danish]] island in the [[Baltic Sea]], to the east of most of [[Denmark]], south of [[Sweden]], northeast of [[Germany]] and northwest of [[Poland]]. The main industries on the island include [[fishing]], arts and crafts such as [[glass production]] and [[pottery]] using locally worked [[clay]], and [[dairy farming]]. [[Tourism]] is important during the summer. The topography of the island consists of dramatic rock formations in the north (unlike the rest of [[Denmark]], which is mostly gentle rolling hills) sloping down towards pine and [[deciduous]] forests (greatly damaged by storms in the 1950s) and farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south.<ref>{{cite book| last = Blecher| first = Lone Thygesen|author2=George Blecher| title = Swedish Folktales & Legends| date = August 2004| publisher = University of Minnesota Press| isbn = 978-0-8166-4575-6| pages = xvi }}</ref>

'''Bornholm Regional [[Municipality]]''' covers the entire island. Bornholm was one of the three last Danish municipalities ({{lang-da|kommune}}) not belonging to a [[Counties of Denmark|county]]— the others were [[Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksberg]]. On 1 January 2007, the municipality lost its short-lived (2003 until 2006) county status and became part of the [[Capital Region of Denmark]].

The [[Ertholmene]] archipelago is located {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northeast of Bornholm. These islands, which do not belong to a municipality or region, are administered by the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]].

Strategically located in the [[Baltic Sea]], Bornholm has been fought over for centuries. It has usually been ruled by Denmark, but also by [[Lübeck]] and [[Sweden]]. The ruin of [[Hammershus]], at the northwestern tip of the island, is the largest [[Castle#History|medieval fortress]] in [[northern Europe]], testament to the importance of its location.

==Language==
{{Main|Bornholmsk dialect}}

Many inhabitants speak the [[Bornholmsk dialect]], which is officially a [[Danish language#Dialects|dialect of Danish]].<ref>Peter Skautrup, ''Det Danske Sprogs Historie'', Gyldendal, 1968, vol. 4, p. 105ff. (Danish)</ref> Bornholmsk retains three [[grammatical gender]]s, like [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and most dialects of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but unlike standard [[Danish language|Danish]]. Its [[phonology]] includes [[archaism]]s (unstressed {{IPA|[a]}} and internal {{IPA|[d̥, ɡ̊]}}, where other dialects have {{IPA|[ə]}} and {{IPA|[ð̞, ʊ / ɪ]}}) and innovations ({{IPA|[tɕ, dʝ]}} for {{IPA|[kʰ, ɡ̊]}} before and after front-tongue vowels). This makes the dialect difficult to understand for some Danish speakers. However, [[Swedish language|Swedish speakers]] often consider Bornholmian to be easier to understand than standard Danish. The [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] resembles the [[Scanian dialect]] spoken in nearby [[Scania]], the southernmost province of [[Sweden]].

Bornholm Regional Municipality is the local authority ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''kommune'') covering the entire island. It comprises the five former (1 April 1970 until 2002) municipalities on the island ([[Allinge-Gudhjem Municipality|Allinge-Gudhjem]], [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]], [[Nexø]], [[Rønne]] and [[Aakirkeby]]) and the former [[Bornholm County]]. The island had 22 municipalities until March 1970, of which 6 were market towns and 16 parishes. The market town municipalities were supervised by the county and not by the Interior Ministry as was the case in the rest of Denmark. The seat of the municipal council is the island's main town, Rønne. The voters decided to merge the county with the municipalities in a referendum May 29, 2001, effective from January 1, 2003. The first regional mayor was Thomas Thors, a physician and member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and previously mayor of Rønne Municipality. Bjarne Kristiansen, representing the local Borgerlisten political party, served as mayor from January 1, 2006 until 2009. From January 1, 2010 the mayor has been Winni Grosbøll, a high school teacher and a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''Socialdemokraterne'') [[Politics of Denmark|political party]].

Ferry services connect Rønne to [[Świnoujście]] ([[Poland]]), [[Sassnitz]] ([[Germany]]), [[Køge]] (near Copenhagen, [[Denmark]]); and [[catamaran]] services to [[Ystad]] ([[Sweden]]). [[Simrishamn]] ([[Sweden]]) has a ferry connection during the summer. There are also regular [[catamaran]] services between [[Nexø]] and the Polish ports of [[Kołobrzeg]], [[Łeba]] and [[Ustka]]. There are direct train and bus connections Ystad-Copenhagen, coordinated with the catamaran. There are also flights from [[Bornholm Airport]] to Copenhagen and other locations.

Bornholm Regional Municipality was not merged with other municipalities on 1 January 2007 in the nationwide [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|Municipal Reform of 2007]].

==Towns and villages==
The larger towns on the island are located on the coast and have a harbour. There is however one exception, centrally placed [[Aakirkeby]]. The largest town is [[Rønne]], the seat, in the southwest. The other main towns (clockwise round the island) are [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]], [[Allinge-Sandvig]], [[Gudhjem]], [[Svaneke]] and [[Nexø]]. Monday morning 22 September 2014 it was documented by ''Folkeregistret'' in the municipality that the number of people living in the municipality that day were 39,922, the lowest number in over 100 years.<ref>[http://www.jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE7049169/der-bor-nu-under-40000-pa-bornholm/].Retrieved 25 September 2014.</ref>

As of 2012, the Danish statistical office gave the populations as follows:<ref>[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=BEF44&PLanguage=1 "BEF44: Population 1st January, by urban areas"] database from [[Statistics Denmark]]. Retrieved 10 November 2012.</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Burg Hammershus 5.jpg|{{largethumb}}|right|[[Hammershus]] Ruin.]]

In Old Norse the island was known as ''Borgundarholm'', and in [[History of Danish|ancient Danish]] especially the island's name was ''Borghand'' or ''Borghund''; these names were related to [[Old Norse]] ''borg'' "height" and ''bjarg/berg'' "mountain, rock", as it is an island that rises high from the sea.<ref>[[J. P. Mallory|Mallory, J.P.]] and [[Douglas Q. Adams|D.Q. Adams]]. ''[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]''. London: [[Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers]], 1997: p. 269</ref> Other names known for the island include ''Burgendaland'' (9th century), ''Hulmo'' / ''Holmus'' (''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]''), ''Burgundehulm'' (1145), and ''Borghandæholm'' (14th century).<ref>Politikens Nudansk Ordborg (1993), 15th edition, entry "Bornholm" {{da icon}}</ref> [[Alfred the Great]] uses the form ''Burgenda land''.<ref>King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon version of Orosius, London, 1859, edited by J. Bosworth</ref> Some scholars<ref>Essai sur l'histoire du peuple burgonde, de Bornholm (Burgundarholm) vers la Bourgogne et les Bourguignons, 1965, by Rene Guichard, published by A. et J. Picard et Cie.</ref> believe that the [[Burgundians]] are named after Bornholm; the Burgundians were [[Germanic peoples]] who moved west when the [[Western Roman Empire]] collapsed and occupied and named [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] in [[France]].

[[File:GudhjemMill.JPG|thumb|140px|left|Windmill in Gudhjem, Bornholm]]
Bornholm formed part of the historical [[Lands of Denmark]] when the nation united out of a series of petty chiefdoms. It was originally administratively part of the province of [[Scania]] and was administered by the [[Scanian Law]] after this was codified in the 13th century. Control over the island evolved into a long-raging dispute between the [[Archbishop of Lund|See of Lund]] and the [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish crown]] culminating in several battles. The first fortress on the island was ''[[Gamleborg]]'' which was replaced by ''[[Lilleborg, Bornholm|Lilleborg]]'', built by the king in 1150. In 1149, the king accepted the transfer of three of the island's four [[Hundred (country subdivision)|herreder]] (districts) to the archbishop. In 1250, the archbishop constructed his own fortress, [[Hammershus]]. A campaign launched from it in 1259 conquered the remaining part of the island including Lilleborg. The island's status remained a matter of dispute for an additional 200 years.

Bornholm was pawned to [[Lübeck]] for 50 years starting 1525. Its first militia, [[Bornholms Milits]], was formed in 1624.

Swedish forces conquered the island in 1645, but returned the island to Denmark in the following peace settlement. After the war in 1658, Denmark ceded the island to Sweden under the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] along with the rest of the [[Skåneland]], [[Bohuslän]] and [[Trøndelag]], and it was occupied by Swedish forces.

A revolt broke out the same year, culminating in Villum Clausen's shooting of the Swedish commander [[Johan Printzensköld]] on 8 December 1658.<ref name=Museum/> Following the revolt, a deputation of islanders presented the island as a gift to King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] on the condition that the island would never be ceded again. This status was confirmed in the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]] in 1660.

[[Swedes]], notably from [[Småland]] and Skania, emigrated to the island during the 19th century, seeking work and better conditions. Most of the migrants did not remain.

=== German occupation (1940–1945) ===
Bornholm, as a part of Denmark, was [[Denmark in World War II|captured by Germany]] on April 10, 1940, and served as a lookout post and listening station during the war, as it was a part of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. The island's perfect central position in the [[Baltic Sea]] meant that it was an important "natural fortress" between [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], effectively keeping submarines and destroyers away from Nazi-occupied waters. Several concrete coastal installations were built during the war, and several coastal batteries had tremendous range. However, none of them were ever used, and only a single test shot was fired during the occupation. These remnants of Nazi rule have since fallen into disrepair and are mostly regarded today as historical curiosities. Many tourists visit the ruins each year, however, providing supplemental income to the tourist industry.

On 22 August 1943 a [[V-1 flying bomb]] (numbered V83, probably launched from a [[Heinkel He 111]]) crashed on Bornholm during a test – the warhead was a dummy made of concrete. This was photographed or sketched by the Danish Naval Officer-in-Charge on Bornholm, Lieutenant Commander Hasager Christiansen. This was the first sign British Intelligence saw of Germany's aspirations to develop flying bombs and rockets which were to become known as V-1 and [[V-2]].

=== Soviet occupation (1945–1946) ===
Bornholm was heavily bombarded by the [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet Air Force]] in May 1945. German garrison commander, German Navy Captain [[Gerhard von Kamptz]], refused to surrender to the Soviets, as his orders were to surrender to the Western Allies. The Germans sent several telegrams to Copenhagen requesting that at least one British soldier should be transferred to Bornholm, so that the Germans could surrender to the western allied forces instead of the Russians. When von Kamptz failed to provide a written capitulation as demanded by the Soviet commanders, Soviet aircraft relentlessly bombed and destroyed more than 800 civilian houses in [[Rønne]] and [[Nexø]] and seriously damaged roughly 3,000 more on 7–8 May 1945.

During the Russian bombing of the two main towns on 7 and 8 May, Danish radio was not allowed to broadcast the news because it was thought it would spoil the liberation festivities in Denmark.<ref>En Ø i krig / An island at war by Børge Kure</ref> On 9 May Soviet troops landed on the island, and after a short fight, the German garrison (about 12,000 strong<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.9may.ru/eng_inform/m9004261|title=Soviet Information Bureau report |date=11 May 1945|accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>) surrendered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bornholm.info/Historie/482we.aspx?langId=2|title=Bornholm during World War II|accessdate=2007-09-06|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928023108/http://www.bornholm.info/Historie/482we.aspx?langId=2 |archivedate = 28 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Soviet forces left the island on 5 April 1946.

After the evacuation of their forces from Bornholm, the Soviets took the position that the stationing of foreign troops on Bornholm would be considered a declaration of war against the Soviet Union, and that Denmark should keep troops on it at all times to protect it from such foreign aggression. This policy remained in force after NATO was formed, with Denmark as a founding member. The Soviets accepted the stationing there of Danish troops, which were part of NATO but viewed as militarily inferior elements of the alliance, but they strongly objected to the presence of other NATO troops on Bornholm, in particular of US troops.<ref>[http://stage-wilson.p2technology.com/sites/default/files/ACFB01.pdf Vojtech Mastny, "NATO in the Beholder’s Eye: Soviet Perceptions and Policies, 1949-56"]. Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Retrieved 10 November 2012.</ref>

This situation caused diplomatic problems at least twice: Once when an American helicopter landed outside the town of [[Svaneke]] due to engine problems in a NATO exercise across the [[Baltic Sea]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and once again (circa 2000), when the ''Bornholms Værn'' (Bornholm Guard) was disbanded, becoming part of the [[Guard Hussar Regiment (Denmark)|Guard Hussar Regiment]].{{clarify|date=June 2015}} The Danish government suggested shutting down ''Almegårds Kaserne'', the local barracks, since "the island could quickly be protected by troops from surrounding areas and has no strategic importance after [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Sights and landmarks==
[[File:Bornholm Landsat.jpg|thumb|left|Bornholm.]]

The island's varied geography and seascapes attract visitors to its many beauty spots from the [[Hammeren]] promontory in the northwest to the [[Almindingen]] forest in the centre and the [[Dueodde]] beaches in the southeast. Of special interest are the rocky sea cliffs at [[Jons Kapel]] and [[Helligdomsklipperne]], the varied topography of [[Paradisbakkerne]] and rift valleys such as [[Ekkodalen]] and [[Døndalen]].<ref>[http://www.bornholmnatur.dk/ "Bornholms Natur"], BornholmNatur.dk. {{da icon}} Retrieved 10 November 2012.</ref> Bornholm's [[List of windmills on Bornholm|numerous windmills]] include the [[post mill]] of [[Egeby Mølle|Egeby]] and the well-kept [[Aarsdale Windmill|Dutch mill at Aarsdale]]. The lighthouse at [[Dueodde Lighthouse|Dueodde]] is Denmark's tallest, while [[Hammeren Lighthouse]] stands at a height of {{convert|85|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and [[Rønne Lighthouse]] rises over the waterfront.<ref name=Bornholm>{{cite web|title=Lighthouses of Denmark: Bornholm|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/lighthouse/dnkb.htm|accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref>

The island hosts examples of 19th- and early-20th-century architecture, and about 300 wooden houses in [[Rønne]] and [[Nexø]], donated by [[Sweden]] after [[World War II]], when the island was repairing damage caused by the war.
The island is home to 15 [[list of Bornholm churches|medieval churches]], four of which are [[round church]]es that display unique artwork and architecture. The ancient site of [[Rispebjerg]] has remains of sun temples from the [[Neolithic]] and earthworks from the [[Iron Age]].<ref>[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Naturoplevelser/Beskrivelser/Bornholm/Rispebjerg/ "Rispebjerg"], Naturstyrelsen. {{da icon}} Retrieved 1 November 2012.</ref>

==Famous people==
The Danish painter [[Oluf Høst]] was born in [[Svaneke]] in 1884.

The Danish writer and painter [[Gustaf Munch-Petersen]] moved to Bornholm in 1935 and married Lisbeth Hjorth while living on the island.

At age 8, socialist writer [[Martin Andersen Nexø]] moved to the island, and took his last name after the city of [[Nexø]] on its east coast.

[[M.P. Möller]] (1854–1937), a pipe-organ builder and manufacturer, was born in [[Østermarie]] before moving to the United States.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/H%C3%A5ndv%C3%A6rk/Orgelbygger/M._M%C3%B8ller "M. Møller"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 10 November 2012.</ref>

[[Gertrud Vasegaard]] (1913–2007), a ceramist remembered for her [[stoneware]], was born in [[Rønne]] and established a workshop in [[Gudhjem]].<ref>[http://www.skoletjenesten.dk/Grundskolen/~/media/EducationOffers/Designmuseum%20Danmark/Undervisningsmateriale/05_gertrud_vasegaard.pdf "Gertrud Vasegaards testel 1956"], Skoletjensten Kunstindustrimuseet. (Danish) Retrieved 25 January 2013.</ref>

Bornholm also attracted many famous artists at the beginning of the 20th century, forming a group now known as the [[Bornholm school of painters]]. In addition to Oluf Høst, they include [[Karl Isaksson]] (1878–1922), from Sweden, and the Danes [[Edvard Weie]] (1879-1943), [[Olaf Rude]] (1886–1957), [[Niels Lergaard]] (1893–1982), and [[Kræsten Iversen]] (1886–1955).<ref>[http://www.visitdenmark.com/en-us/bornholm/art/bornholms-culture-and-heritage "Bornholm's culture and heritage"], Visit Denmark. Retrieved 13 November 2012.</ref>

In the mid 1940s Donald (descendant of [[Ben Sayers]]) and Mavis Sayers arrived in Bornholm on a boat from Copenhagen. On their arrival they were greeted by a band and were paraded into the town centre. They were celebrated by the locals as the first English people to visit Bornholm since the end of the war and were treated like royalty during their stay. Following their stay they were frequently invited back as they were seen as a symbol of the restoration of Bornholm.

==Electricity supply==
Bornholm is connected to the Swedish electricity grid by a submarine 60 kV AC cable, which is among the longest AC cables in Europe. This cable is capable of delivering all the electrical energy consumed on Bornholm. However Bornholm also generates its own electricity at small thermal power plants and especially [[wind turbine]]s.

Bornholm is also home to a large internationally funded demonstration project to test the viability of novel energy market mechanisms to regulate energy networks with a high prevalence of renewables (such as wind turbines and photovoltaics). 50% of the project is EU-funded, with the remainder coming mainly from large corporations. See http://www.eu-ecogrid.net/ecogrid-eu for more.

== Sports ==
Bornholm's geography as an island and moderate climate makes Bornholm an ideal location for sailing and other water based sports.

Bornholm has also become an internationally recognised venue for 'match racing', a sailing sport where two identical (or one design) supplied racing yachts are raced in one on one dogfights on the water. The [[Danish Open (yachting)|Danish Open]] event was held in Bornholm in September 2010 at the port town of Rønne on the Western coast of Bornholm. The racing yachts used for the Danish Open event are Danish designed DS37 racing yachts. These highly manoeuvrable and versatile boats are also used in the Match Cup Sweden event.

The five-day Danish Open is a key event in the [[World Match Racing Tour]] calendar which is one of only 3 events awarded 'special event' status by the [[International Sailing Federation]]. The Tour is the world's leading professional 'match racing' series and features a 9 event calendar which crosses 3 continents during the series.

Points accrued during the Danish Open contribute directly to the World Match Racing Tour championship with the winner of the season finale at the Monsoon Cup in Malaysia claiming the ultimate match racing title ISAF World Match Racing Champion.

Match racing unlike other sailing sports is suited to locations like Bornholm due to the racing taking place in close proximity to the shore which provides spectacular heat of the action viewing for the on-shore audience.

There two small stadiums: [[Nexø Stadion]], in [[Nexø]], where [[NB Bornholm]] [[association football]] club play; and the slightly larger multi-use stadium [[Rønne Stadion Nord]] in [[Rønne]], which serves the [[Non-FIFA international football|Bornholm national football team]], multi-section club most well known for [[Athletics(sport)|athletics]] '''IK Viking''', and several local football clubs. The [[DBU Bornholm]] is the local branch governing football on the island.
