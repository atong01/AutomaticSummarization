'''Cajun cuisine''' ({{lang-fr|Cuisine cadienne}}, {{IPA-fr|kɥizin kadjɛn|}}). This style of cooking is named for the French-speaking [[Acadian]] people deported by the British from [[Acadia]] in [[Canada]] to the Acadiana region of [[Louisiana]]. It is what could be called a rustic cuisine; [[local food|locally available ingredients]] predominate and preparation is simple. An authentic Cajun meal is usually a three-pot affair, with one pot dedicated to the main dish, one dedicated to steamed [[rice]], special made sausages, or some seafood dish, and the third containing whatever vegetable is plentiful or available. [[Shrimp]] and [[pork]] [[sausage]] are staple meats used in a variety of dishes.

The aromatic vegetables [[green bell pepper]] (poivron), [[onion]] and [[celery]] are called the holy trinity by Cajun chefs, and with the addition of garlic [[trinity (cuisine)|holy trinity and the pope]] in Cajun and [[Creole cuisine]]s. Roughly diced and combined in cooking, the method is similar to the use of the ''[[Mirepoix (cuisine)|mirepoix]]'' in traditional [[French cuisine]] which blends roughly diced onion, celery and [[carrot]]. Characteristic aromatics for the Creole version may also include [[parsley]], [[bay leaf]], [[scallion|green onions]], dried [[cayenne pepper]] and dried [[black pepper]].

==History==

Around 1755, Acadians were forced out of their settlements by the British, and as a result, they migrated in 1755 in what was called [[Expulsion of the Acadians|le Grand Dérangement]], eventually settling in Southern Louisiana.<ref name="Gutierrez">{{Cite book | last = Gutierrez | first = Paige C. | title = Cajun Foodways | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | date = 1992 | isbn = 0-8780-5563-0}} Retrieved 2014-04.</ref> {{rp|6}} Due to the extreme change in climate, Acadians were unable to cook their original dishes.<ref name="Bienvenu">{{Cite book | author = Bienvenu, Marcelle, Brasseaux, Carl A., Brasseaux, Ryan A. | title = Stir the Pot: The History of Cajun Cuisine | date = 2005 | publisher = Hippocrine Books | date = 2008 | isbn = 0-7818-1212-7}} Retrieved 2014-04.</ref> {{rp|20}} Soon, their former culinary traditions were lost and so, these new meals developed to become what is now considered classic Cajun cuisine traditions <ref name="Bienvenu"/> {{rp|19–20}} (not to be confused with the more modern concept associated with Prudhomme's style).<ref name="Read">{{cite web| url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/434010916?accountid=14612| title= Real Cajun Food, From Swamp to City: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk] | author= Read, Mimi| publisher= New York Times | accessdate =2014-05-05}}</ref> Up through the 20th century, the meals weren't elaborate but instead, rather basic.<ref name="Bienvenu"/> {{rp|23}} The public's false perception of "Cajun" cuisine was based on Prudhomme's style of Cajun cooking, which was spicy, flavorful, and not true to the classic form of the cuisine.<ref name="Read"/> Cajun and Creole label have been mistaken to be the same but the origins of Creole cooking began in New Orleans and Cajun cooking came 40 years after the establishment of New Orleans down south on the bayou.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gonsoulin|first1=Brandy|title=70 Miles of Distinction; Exploring the differences between Cajun and Creole cuisines|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/food/sc-food-0130-creole-vs-cajun-20150127-story.html#page=1|agency=Tribune Newspapers|issue=4pp|publisher=Orland|date=February 5, 2015}}</ref>
Today, most restaurants serve dishes that consist of Cajun styles, which [[Paul Prudhomme]] dubbed "Louisiana cooking".<ref name="Prudhomme">{{cite book | last = Prudhomme | first = Paul | title = Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen | publisher = William and Morrow Company, Inc. | date = 1984 | isbn = 0-6880-2847-0}} Retrieved 2014-04.</ref> {{rp|16}} In home-cooking, these individual styles are still kept separate.<ref name="Prudhomme"/> {{rp|16}} However, there are fewer and fewer people cooking the classic Cajun dishes that would have been eaten by the original settlers.<ref name="Bienvenu"/> {{rp|30}}

==Cajun cooking methods==
*[[Barbecuing]] - similar to "slow and low" Southern barbecue traditions, but with Creole / Cajun seasoning.
**[[Baking]] - direct and indirect dry heat in a furnace or oven, faster than [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]] but slower than grilling.
**[[Grilling]] - direct heat on a shallow surface, fastest of all variants; sub-variants include:
***[[Charbroiling]] - direct dry heat on a solid surface with wide raised ridges.
***[[Gridiron (cooking)|Gridironing]] - direct dry heat on a solid or hollow surface with narrow raised ridges.
***[[Griddle|Griddling]] - direct dry or moist heat along with the use of oils and butter on a flat surface.
**[[Braising]] - combining a direct dry heat charbroil-grill or gridiron-grill with a pot filled with broth for direct moist heat, faster than smoking but slower than regular grilling and baking; time starts fast, slows down, then speeds up again to finish.
*[[Boiling]] - as in boiling of crabs, crawfish, or shrimp, in seasoned liquid.
*[[Deep frying]]
*[[Smothering (food)|Smothering]] - cooking a vegetable or meat with low heat and small amounts of water or stock, similar to [[braising]]. [[Étouffée]] is a popular variant done with [[Crayfish (food)|crawfish]] or shrimp.
*Pan-[[broiling]] or [[pan-frying]].
*Injecting - using a large [[syringe]]-type setup to place seasoning deep inside large cuts of meat. This technique is much newer than the others on this list, but very common in Cajun Country
*[[Stewing]], also known as ''fricassée''.

[[Deep-frying]] of [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]]s or oven-roasted [[turducken]]s entered southern Louisiana cuisine more recently. Also, [[Blackening (cooking)|blackening]] of fish or chicken and barbecuing of shrimp in the shell are excluded because they were not prepared in traditional Cajun cuisine. Blackening was actually an invention by chef [[Paul Prudhomme]] in the 1970s, becoming associated with Cajun cooking, and presented as such by him, but is not a true historical or traditional Cajun cooking process.<ref>[http://www.astray.com/recipes/?show=Blacken%20fish%20and%20recipe%20a%20la%20prudhomme "Blacken fish and recipe a la prudhomme"]-Retrieved 2014-09-21</ref>

==Ingredients==
The following is a partial list of ingredients used in Cajun cuisine and some of the [[Staple food|staple ingredients]] of the Acadian food culture.

===Grains===
*[[Maize|Corn]] 

*[[Rice]] — long, medium, or short grain white; also popcorn rice
:Rice proved to be a valuable commodity in early Cajun Country. With an abundance of water and a hot, humid climate, rice could be grown practically anywhere in the region and grew wild in some areas. Rice became the predominant starch in the diet, easy to grow, store and prepare. The oldest rice mill in operation in the United States, the Conrad Rice Mill, is located in [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]].
*[[Wheat]] (for baking bread)

===Fruits and vegetables===
*[[Bell pepper]]s
*[[Blackberry|Blackberries]]
*[[Cayenne pepper]]s
*[[Celery]]
*[[Collard greens]]
*[[Cucumber]]s
*[[Ficus|Fig]]s
*[[Lime (fruit)|Limes]]
*[[Lemon]]s
*[[Chayote|Mirlitons]] (also called chayotes or vegetable pears)
*[[Muscadine]]s
*[[Okra]]
*[[Onion]]s
*[[Pecan]]s
*[[Satsuma (fruit)|Satsuma oranges]]
*[[Scallion]]s (also known as green onions or onion tops)
*[[Squash (plant)|Squash]]
*[[Garden strawberry|Strawberries]]
*[[Sweet potato]]es
*[[Tabasco pepper]]
*[[Tomato]]es

===Meat and seafood===
Cajun folkways include many ways of preserving meat, some of which are waning due to the availability of refrigeration and [[Mass production|mass-produced]] meat at the grocer. Smoking of meats remains a fairly common practice, but once-common preparations such as turkey or [[duck confit]] (preserved in poultry fat, with spices) are now seen even by Acadians as quaint rarities.

Game (and [[hunting]]) are still uniformly popular in Acadiana.

The recent increase of [[catfish]] [[Aquaculture of catfish|farming]] in the [[Mississippi Delta]] has brought about an increase in its usage in Cajun cuisine in the place of the more traditional wild-caught trout (the saltwater species) and [[red fish]].
<div style="float:left; width:48%;">
'''Seafood'''
*Freshwater <!--Please add more-->
**[[Bass (fish)|Bass]] (Commonly known as green trout in south Louisiana)
**[[Catfish]]
**[[White perch|Sac-au-Lait]] (white perch or crappie)
**[[Yellow perch]]
*Saltwater or brackish water species
**[[Cynoscion nebulosus|Trout]]
**[[Red Drum|Redfish]]
**[[Pompano]]
**[[Sciaenidae|Drumfish]]
**[[Flounder]]
**[[Grouper]]
**[[Perch]] - many varieties
**[[Lutjanidae|Snapper]] - many varieties
*Shellfish
**[[Crayfish (food)|Crawfish]] (ecrevisse)- either wild swamp or farm-raised
**[[Shrimp (food)|Shrimp]], or Crevette ("Chevrette" in Colonial Louisiana French)
**[[Oyster]]s
**[[Callinectes sapidus|Blue Crab]]
Also included in the seafood mix are some so-called [[trash fish]] that would not sell at market because of their high bone to meat ratio or required complicated cooking methods. These were brought home by fishermen to feed the family. Examples are garfish, black drum also called gaspergou or just "goo", croaker, and bream.

'''Poultry'''
*Farm Raised
**[[Turkey (food)|Turkey]] (and turkey confit)
**[[Chicken (food)|Chicken]] (and Guinea Hen)
*Game birds
**[[Dove]]
**[[Goose]]
**[[Quails in cookery|Quail]]
**[[Duck (food)|Duck]] (and duck confit)
</div><div style="float:right; width:48%;">
'''Pork'''
*[[Andouille]] - a spicy dry smoked sausage, characterized by a coarse-ground texture
*[[Boudin]] - a fresh sausage made with green onions, pork, and rice. Pig's blood is sometimes added to produce "boudin rouge". Other versions can contain seafood, such as crawfish.
*Chaurice, similar to the Spanish [[chorizo]]
*[[Chaudin]] or "ponce" - a pig's stomach, stuffed with spiced pork & smoked.
*[[Ham hock]]s
*[[Wild boar]] or Feral Hog
*[[Head cheese]]
*Gratons - hog cracklings or pork rinds; fried, seasoned pork fat & skin, sometimes with small bits of meat attached. Similar to the Spanish [[Chicharrón|chicharrones]].
*Pork sausage (fresh) - not smoked or cured, but highly seasoned. Mostly used in gumbos. The sausage itself does not include rice, separating it from boudin.
*Salt Pork
*[[Tasso ham|Tasso]] - a highly seasoned, smoked pork shoulder of the Choctaw

'''Beef and dairy'''<br>
Though parts of Acadiana are well suited to cattle or dairy farming, beef is not often used in a pre-processed or uniquely Cajun form. It is usually prepared fairly simply as chops, stews, or steaks, taking a cue from Texas to the west. Ground beef is used as is traditional throughout the southern US, although seasoned differently.

Dairy farming is not as prevalent as in the past, but there are still some farms in the business. There are no unique dairy items prepared in Cajun cuisine. Traditional Cajun and New Orleans Creole influenced desserts are common.

'''Other Game Meats'''
*[[Alligator]]
*[[Alligator gar]], or Gator gar
*[[Frog]], usually Bullfrogs (not just the legs, but the entire creature)
*[[Gros bec]] commonly called Night heron
*[[Coypu|Nutria]]
*[[Squirrel]]
*[[Rabbit]]
*[[Skunk]], or mouffette
*[[Turtle]]
*[[Snake]]
*[[Virginia opossum]], or sarigue

'''Blended'''
*"Creole / Cajun spice" blends such as [[Tony Chachere's]] and REX King of Spice are sometimes used in Cajun kitchens, but do not suit every cook's style because Creole / Cajun-style seasoning is often achieved from scratch, even by taste. Cajun seasonings consist of a blend of salt with a variety of spices, most common being cayenne pepper and garlic. The spicy heat comes from the cayenne pepper, while other flavors come from bell pepper, paprika, green onions, parsley and more.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Jenny|title=Louisiana Life|journal=Chachere's Creole Foods|date=July 2014|volume=34|issue=6|page=8}}</ref>
*[[Hot sauce]] that includes [[Tabasco sauce]] that by 1885 was well known in Louisiana and abroad.
*[[Seafood boil]] mix
*Vinegar seasoned with small, pickled, hot green peppers is a common condiment with many Cajun meals.
*[[Persillade]]
*[[Marinade]]s made with [[olive oil]], [[brown sugar]], and [[citrus]] juices
*Various barbecue rubs similar to those in other states.
*[[Worcestershire sauce]]

'''Cooking bases'''
*Dark [[roux]]: The Cajuns inherited the roux from the French. However, unlike the French, it is made with oil or bacon fat and more lately [[olive oil]], however, not normally with butter. It is used as a thickening agent, especially in gumbo and étouffée. Preparation of a dark roux is probably the most involved or complicated procedure in Cajun cuisine,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Les Vingt|first1=Quatre Club|title=First-- you make a roux.|date=1954|publisher=Les Vingt Quatre Club|location=Lafayette, La|page=47}}</ref> involving heating fat and flour very carefully, constantly stirring for about 15–45 minutes (depending on the color of the desired product), until the mixture has darkened in color and developed a nutty flavor. A burnt roux renders a dish unpalatable. The scent of a good roux is so strong that even after leaving one's house the smell of roux is still embedded in one's clothes until they are washed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The scent is so strong and recognizable that others are able to tell if one is making a roux, and often infer that one is making a gumbo.
*Light [[roux]]: The secret to making a good gumbo is pairing the roux with the protein.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} A dark roux, with its strong (dense) nutty flavor will completely overpower a simple seafood gumbo, but is the perfect complement to a gumbo using chicken, sausage, crawfish or alligator.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hand|first1=Edie|title=Cajun and Creole cooking with Miss Edie and the Colonel: The folklore and art of Louisiana cooking|date=2007|publisher=Cumberland House Pub.|location=Nashville, Tenn.|pages=1–281}}</ref> A light roux, on the other hand, is better suited for strictly seafood dishes and unsuitable for meat gumbos for the reason that it does not support the heavier meat flavor as well. Pairing Roux with protein follows the same orthodox philosophy as pairing wine with protein.
*[[Stock (food)|Stocks]]: Cajun stocks are more heavily seasoned than Continental counterparts, and the shellfish stock sometimes made with shrimp and crawfish heads is unique to Cajun cuisine.
**Fish stock and [[Court-bouillon]]
**Shellfish stock
**Chicken stock

==Cajun dishes==
Three popular local dishes in Acadiana are noted in the [[Hank Williams]]'  song ''[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]'', namely "Jambalaya and-a crawfish pie and filé gumbo".

===Primary favorites===
[[File:Smoked Boudin Blanc.jpg|thumb|''Boudin'' that has been [[Smoking (food)|smoked]]]]
[[File:Gumbo3bg 122499.jpg|thumb|Seafood gumbo]]
'''[[Boudin]]''' is a type of [[sausage]] made from pork, pork liver, rice, garlic, [[scallion|green onions]] and other spices. It is widely available by the link or pound from butcher shops. Boudin is usually made daily as it does not keep well for very long, even when frozen. Boudin is typically stuffed in a [[Casing (sausage)|natural casing]] and has a softer consistency than other, better-known sausage varieties. It is usually served with side dishes such as rice dressing, [[maque choux]] or bread. Boudin balls are commonly served in southern Louisiana restaurants and are made by taking the boudin out of the case and frying it in spherical form.

'''Gumbo''' - High on the list of favorites of Cajun cooking are the soups called [[gumbo]]s. Contrary to non-Cajun or Continental beliefs, gumbo does not mean simply "everything in the pot". Gumbo exemplifies the influence of African and [[Native American cuisine|Native American food]] cultures on Cajun cuisine. The name originally meant ''[[okra]]'', a word brought to the region from western [[Africa]]. Okra which can be one of the principal ingredients in gumbo recipes is used as a thickening agent and for its distinct vegetable flavor. Many claim that Gumbo is a "Cajun" dish, but Gumbo was established long before the Acadian arrival by the French Creoles of Louisiana.

A Choctaw filé gumbo is thickened with dried [[sassafras]] leaves after the stew has finished cooking, a practice borrowed from the [[Choctaw]] Indians. The backbone of a gumbo is [[roux]] of which there are two variations: Cajun, a golden brown [[roux]], and Creole, a dark [[roux]], which is made of flour, toasted until well-browned, and [[fat]] or [[cooking oil|oil]]. The classic gumbo is made with [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] and the Cajun sausage called [[andouille]], pronounced {ahn-doo-wee}, but the ingredients vary according to what is available.

'''Jambalaya''' - Another classic Cajun dish is [[jambalaya]]. The only certain thing that can be said about a jambalaya is that it contains [[rice]], some sort of meat (such as chicken or beef), seafood (such as shrimp or crawfish) or almost anything else. Usually, however, one will find green peppers, onions, celery, tomatoes and hot chili peppers. Anything else is optional. This is also a great pre-Acadian dish, established by the native of Louisiana, the French Creoles.

'''Rice and gravy''' - [[Rice and gravy]] dishes are a [[Staple food|staple]] of Cajun cuisine<ref name=LAFTRAVEL>{{cite web |url=http://www.lafayettetravel.com/eat|title= Eat |publisher=Lafayettetravel.com |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>  and is usually a [[brown gravy]] based on pan drippings, which are [[Deglazing (cooking)|deglazed]] and simmered with extra seasonings and served over steamed or boiled rice. The dish is traditionally made from cheaper cuts of meat and cooked in a [[cast iron cookware|cast iron pot]], typically for an extended time period in order to let the tough cuts of meat become tender.<ref name=TAMU>{{cite web| url= http://generalhorticulture.tamu.edu/prof/recipes/smother/smother.html | title= Smothered Meat With Rice and Gravy | author= Reed, David W.| publisher= [[Texas A&M University]] | accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref> Beef,<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.jfolse.com/recipe_week/recipe0711/WAFB_071211%20smothered%20seven%20steak.html | title= Smothered seven steaks | accessdate= 2012-11-26 | publisher= [[WAFB]] }}</ref> pork, chicken or any of a large variety of game meats are used for its preparation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.realcajunrecipes.com/recipes/cajun/rice-gravy/119.rcr | title= Rice and Gravy |publisher= Realcajunrecipes.com |accessdate=2012-11-24 }}</ref> Popular local varieties include [[hamburger steak]], smothered [[rabbit]],<ref>{{cite web| title=Smothered rabbit with mushrooms | url= http://beta.lpb.org/index.php/programs/folse_recipe/smothered_rabbit_with_mushrooms |accessdate= 2012-11-26 |publisher= [[Louisiana Public Broadcasting]] }}</ref> turkey necks,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.jfolse.com/recipes/poultry/turkey05.htm| title= Smothered Turkey Necks in Onion Gravy | accessdate= 2012-11-26 | publisher= Chef John Folse & Company }}</ref> and [[Fricassee|chicken fricassee]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Chicken Fricassee |url = http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chicken-Fricassee/Detail.aspx |publisher=Allrecipes.com |accessdate = 2012-11-28}}</ref>

===Food as an event===

====Crawfish boil====
[[File:Louisiana crawfish.jpg|thumb|Louisiana-style crawfish boil]]
The [[seafood boil|crawfish boil]] is a celebratory event where Cajuns boil crawfish, potatoes, onions and corn in large pots over propane cookers. Lemons and small muslin bags containing a mixture of bay leaves, mustard seeds, cayenne pepper and other spices, commonly known as "crab boil" or "crawfish boil" are added to the water for seasoning. The results are then dumped onto large, newspaper-draped tables and in some areas covered in Creole / Cajun spice blends, such as REX, [[Zatarain's]], Louisiana Fish Fry or Tony Chachere's. Also, [[Cocktail sauce]], mayonnaise and [[hot sauce]] are sometimes used. The seafood is scooped onto large trays or plates and eaten by hand. During times when crawfish are not abundant, shrimp and crabs are prepared and served in the same manner.

Attendees are encouraged to "suck the head" of a crawfish by separating the abdomen of the [[crustacean]] and sucking out the abdominal fat/juices.

Often, newcomers to the crawfish boil or those unfamiliar with the traditions are jokingly warned "not to eat the dead ones". This comes from the common belief that when live crawfish are boiled, their tails curl beneath themselves, but when dead crawfish are boiled, their tails are straight and limp.
Seafood boils with crabs and shrimp are also popular.

====Family Boucherie====
[[File:Lakeview Boucherie5 Piggy goes to pieces HRoe 2013.jpg|thumb|A traditional "boucherie" near [[Eunice, Louisiana|Eunice]]]]
The traditional Cajun outdoor food event hosted by a farmer in the rural areas of the Acadiana. Family and friends of the farmer gather to socialize, play games, dance, drink, and have a copious meal consisting of hog and other dishes.<ref name="Gutierrez"/> {{rp|111}} Men have the task of slaughtering a hog, cutting it into usable parts, and cooking the main pork dishes while women have the task of making [[boudin]].<ref name="Gutierrez"/> {{rp|110}}

====Cochon de Lait====
Similar to a family boucherie, the cochon de lait is a food event that revolves around pork but does not need to be hosted by a farmer. Traditionally, a [[suckling pig]] was purchased for the event, but in modern cochon de lait's, adult pigs are used.<ref name="Gutierrez"/> {{rp|111}} Unlike the family boucherie, a hog is not butchered by the hosts and there are generally not as many guests or activities.<ref name="Gutierrez"/> {{rp|112}} The host and male guests have the task of roasting the pig (see [[pig roast]]) while female guests bring side dishes.

====Rural Mardi Gras====
The traditional Cajun Mardi Gras (see [[Courir de Mardi Gras]]) is a Mardi Gras celebration in rural Cajun Parishes. The tradition originated in the 18th century with the Cajuns of Louisiana but was abandoned in the early 20th century because of unwelcome violence associated with the event. In the early 1950s the tradition was revived in [[Mamou]] in Evangeline Parish.<ref name="Gutierrez"/> {{rp|112}}

The event revolves around male maskers on horseback who ride into the countryside to collect food ingredients for the party later on. They entertain householders with Cajun music, dancing, and festive antics in return for the ingredients. The preferred ingredient is a live chicken—in which the householder throws the chicken to allow the maskers to chase it down (symbolizing a hunt) but other ingredients include rice, sausage, vegetables, or frozen chicken.<ref name="Gutierrez"/> {{rp|112}} Unlike other Cajun events, men take no part in cooking the main course for the party and women prepare the chicken and ingredients for the gumbo.<ref name="Gutierrez"/> {{rp|113}}

Once the festivities begin, the Cajun community members eat and dance to Cajun music until midnight—the beginning of [[Lent]].<ref name="Gutierrez"/> {{rp|113}}
