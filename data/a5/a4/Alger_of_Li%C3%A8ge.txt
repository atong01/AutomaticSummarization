'''Alger of Liège''' (1055–1131), known also as Alger of Cluny and Algerus Magister, was a learned [[clergyman]] from [[Liège (city)|Liège]] author of several notable works.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Alger of Liege}}</ref>

Alger was first [[deacon]] of [[St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|church of St Bartholomew]] in his native [[Liège (city)|Liège]] and was then appointed (c. 1100) to [[St. Lambert's Cathedral, Liège|St. Lambert's Cathedral]].<ref name=EB1911/> He declined offers from German bishops and finally retired to the monastery of [[Cluny]], where he died at a high age, leaving behind a solid reputation for piety and intelligence.<ref name=EB1911/>

His ''History of the Church of Liège'', and many of his other works, are lost. The most important remaining are:
#''De Misericordia et Justitia'' (On Mercy and Justice), a collection of biblical extracts and sayings of Church Fathers with commentary (an important work for the history of church law and discipline), which is to be found in the ''Anecdota'' of [[Edmond Martène|Martène]], vol. v.
#''De Sacramentis Corporis et Sanguinis Domini''; a treatise, in three books, against the [[Berengar of Tours|Berengar]]ian heresy, highly commended by [[Peter of Cluny]] and [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]].
#''De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio''; given in Bernard Pez's ''Anecdota'', vol. iv.
#''De Sacrificio Missae''; given in the ''Collectio Scriptor. Vet.'' of [[Angelo Mai]], vol. ix. p.&nbsp;371.<ref name=EB1911/>
