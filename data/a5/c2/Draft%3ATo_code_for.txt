In [[genetics]], '''''to code for''''' means a [[gene]] contains the instructions on how to build a particular [[protein]], as in ''the gene codes for the protein''.
Note that the [[one gene, one protein]] concept is now known to be simplistic. For example, a single gene may produce multiple products, depending on how its [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] is regulated.
