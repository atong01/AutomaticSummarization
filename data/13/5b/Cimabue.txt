Cimabue is generally regarded as one of the first great Italian painters to break from the Italo-Byzantine style, although he still relied on Byzantine models.<ref>Fred Kleiner (2008). ''Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Global History.'' Vol. 2. Cengage Learning EMEA. p. 502.</ref> The art of this period comprised scenes and forms that appeared relatively flat and highly stylized. Cimabue was a pioneer in the move towards naturalism; his figures were depicted with more lifelike proportions and shading. Even though he was a pioneer in that move, his ''Maestà'' paintings evidence Medieval techniques and characteristics. According to [[Giorgio Vasari]], he was the teacher of [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]],<ref name=vas/> the first great artist of the Italian [[Proto-Renaissance]].

==Life==

Owing to little surviving documentation, not much is known about Cimabue's life. He was born in Florence and died in [[Pisa]]. His career was described in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]''. Although it is one of the few early records about him, its accuracy is uncertain.

He perhaps trained in [[Florence]] under unknown masters culturally connected to [[Byzantine art]]. His first attributed work, the ''Crucifixion'' in the church of [[San Domenico, Arezzo|San Domenico]] in [[Arezzo]] (assigned to him by Italian art historian [[Pietro Toesca]] and dated to around 1270), departed from the Byzantine style. His style was at the time more reminiscent of works such as the ''Christus patiens'' (c. 1250) by [[Giunta Pisano]], although Cimabue's Christ is more bent and the clothes have the golden striations introduced by [[Coppo di Marcovaldo]].

Around 1272 he is documented in [[Rome]]. A little later, he made another ''Crucifixion'' for the Florentine church of [[Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]] (incidentally: damaged by the [[1966 Arno River flood]]). This is a larger and more evolved work than that in Arezzo, with traces of naturalism perhaps inspired by [[Nicola Pisano]]'s works. In the same period (c. 1280) he painted the ''[[Maestà (Cimabue)|Maestà]]'' now at the [[Louvre Museum]], originally in the church of [[San Francesco, Pisa|San Francesco]] at [[Pisa]]. This work established a style which was followed by numerous artists after him, including [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] in his ''[[Rucellai Madonna]]'' (once wrongly attributed to Cimabue), as well as [[Giotto]] himself. Other works dating to this period, in which the influence of his pupil Giotto becomes manifest, include a ''Flagellation'' ([[Frick Collection]]), mosaics for the [[Baptistery of Florence]] (now largely restored), the ''[[Maestà of Santa Maria dei Servi|Maestà]]'' at the [[Basilica di Santa Maria dei Servi|Santa Maria dei Servi]] in [[Bologna]] and the ''Madonna'' in the Pinacoteca of [[Castelfiorentino]]. A workshop painting, perhaps assignable to a slightly later period, is the ''Maestà with Saints Francis and Dominic'' now at the [[Uffizi]].

During the pontificate of [[Pope Nicholas IV]], the first [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] pope, Cimabue worked at [[Assisi]]. His call was perhaps due to the fame he gained in Rome in 1272, although no works from his stay there are known. At Assisi, in the transept of the Lower [[Basilica di San Francesco di Assisi|Basilica of San Francesco]], he frescoed a ''Madonna with Child Enthroned, Four Angels and St. Francis''; the left part of the work is missing, and perhaps showed St. Antony of Padua. The authorship of the painting has been recently disputed for technical and stylistic reasons, however. Cimabue was subsequently commissioned the decoration of the apse and the transept of the Upper Basilica of Assisi, in the same period in which Roman artists were frescoing the nave. The cycle comprises scenes from the Gospels, the life of Mary and of St. Peter and St. Paul, and is today in poor condition due to the oxidation of the brighter colors.

The ''[[Maestà of Santa Trinita]]'', originally painted for the church of [[Santa Trinita, Florence|Santa Trinita]] in Florence dates to c. 1290–1300. It is now at the Uffizi Gallery. The softer expression of the characters suggests that it was influenced by Giotto, who was by then already active as a solo artist. Cimabue spent the period from 1301 to 1302 in Pisa, where, together with collaborators, he executed the apse mosaic for the [[Pisa Cathedral|city's cathedral]]. He died in 1302.

==Character==
According to Italian painter and historian [[Giorgio Vasari]], "Cimabue of Florence was a painter who lived during the author's own time, a nobler man than anyone knew but he was as a result so haughty and proud that if someone pointed out to him any mistake or defect in his work, or if he had noted any himself...he would immediately destroy the work, no matter how precious it might be." <ref name=GV>{{cite book|last=Vasari|first=Giorgio|title=Lives of the Artists, 1550|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-281754-X|page=13}}</ref>

==Legacy==
History has long regarded Cimabue as the last of an era that was overshadowed by the [[Italian Renaissance]]. As early as 1543, the historian [[Vasari]] wrote of Cimabue, "Cimabue was, in one sense, the principal cause of the renewal of painting," with the qualification that, "Giotto truly eclipsed Cimabue's fame just as a great light eclipses a much smaller one."<ref name=GV />

In Canto XI of his [[Purgatorio]], [[Dante]] laments Cimabue's quick loss of public interest in the face of Giotto's revolution in art:<ref>Purgatio XI, cited in the [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03771a.htm Cenni di Petro Cimabue] article in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]</ref>

<blockquote>
O vanity of human powers,<br/>
how briefly lasts the crowning green of glory,<br/>
unless an age of darkness follows!<br/>
In painting Cimabue thought he held the field<br/>
but now it's Giotto has the cry,<br/>
so that the other's fame is dimmed.<br/>
