After years of bad seasons and losing fans to the cross-town rivals<space/><link><target>Chicago Bears</target></link>, by the late 1950s the Cardinals were almost bankrupt, and owner<space/><link><target>Violet Bidwill Wolfner</target></link><space/>became interested in a relocation. Due to the formation of the rival<space/><link><target>American Football League</target></link>, the NFL allowed Bidwill to relocate the team to<space/><link><target>St. Louis, Missouri</target></link>, where they became the<space/><link><target>History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)</target><part>St. Louis Cardinals</part></link><space/>(nicknamed &quot;Football Cardinals&quot; due to sharing a name with<space/><link><target>St. Louis Cardinals</target><part>the city's baseball team</part></link>). During the Cardinals' 28-year stay in St. Louis, they advanced to the playoffs just three times (1974, 1975 &amp; 1982), never hosting or winning in any appearance.

Not long after the<space/><link><target>1987 NFL season</target></link>, Bidwill agreed to move to the<space/><link><target>Phoenix metropolitan area</target></link><space/>on a handshake deal with state and local officials, and the team became the Phoenix Cardinals.

However, the club did not attach a logo to their helmets until they debuted a cardinal-head logo in<space/><template><target>Cardinals NFL season</target><arg>1960</arg></template>, the year the franchise moved from Chicago to St. Louis.</paragraph><paragraph>During their 28 years in St. Louis, the Cardinals frequently wore white at home, especially for games vs. the<space/><link><target>Dallas Cowboys</target></link>, hoping to bring out the &quot;blue jersey jinx&quot; which supposedly follows the Cowboys. The Cardinals wore white at home at least twice in every season since 1964 and for every home game in 1964, 1965 and 1978. They wore white for their 1982 and 1983 home games vs. Dallas, but not at all from 1984 through 1987.</paragraph><paragraph>The Cardinals moved to Arizona in<space/><template><target>Cardinals NFL season</target><arg>1988</arg></template>, and the<space/><link><target>flag of Arizona</target></link><space/>was added to the sleeves the following year. In<space/><template><target>Cardinals NFL season</target><arg>1990</arg></template>, the team began wearing red pants with their white jerseys, as new coach<space/><link><target>Joe Bugel</target></link><space/>wanted to emulate his former employer, the<space/><link><target>Washington Redskins</target></link>, who at the time wore burgundy pants with their white jerseys (the team has since changed to wearing gold pants with all their jerseys).</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><template><target>nfly</target><arg>1994</arg></template>, the Cardinals participated in the NFL's 75th anniversary throwback uniform program. The jerseys were similar to those of the 1920s Chicago Cardinals, with an interlocking &quot;CC&quot; logo and three stripes on each sleeve. The uniform numbers were relocated to the right chest. The pants were khaki to simulate the color and material used in that era. The Cardinals also stripped the logos from their helmets for the two games, at Cleveland (Sept. 18) and home vs. Pittsburgh (Oct. 30).</paragraph><paragraph>The Cardinal head on the helmet was repeated on the white jersey from 1988 to 1995. In 1996, the state flag of Arizona was moved higher on the sleeve after the Cardinal head was eliminated, and black was removed as an accent color, instead replaced with a blue to match the predominant color of the state flag. In 2002, the Cardinals began to wear all-red and all-white combinations, and continued to do so through 2004, prior to the team's makeover.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><template><target>nfly</target><arg>2005</arg></template>, the team unveiled its first major changes in a century. The cardinal-head logo was updated to look sleeker and meaner than its predecessor.

Both the red and white jerseys have the option of red or white pants.</paragraph><paragraph>Hoping to break a six-game losing streak, the Cardinals wore the red pants for the first time on October 29, 2006, in a game at<space/><link><target>Lambeau Field</target></link><space/>against the Green Bay Packers. The Packers won 3114, and the Cards headed into their bye week with a 17 mark. Following the bye week, the Cardinals came out in an all-red combination at home against the Dallas Cowboys and lost, 2710. Arizona did not wear the red pants for the remainder of the season and won four of their last seven games. However, the following season, in<space/><template><target>Cardinals NFL season</target><arg>2007</arg></template>, the Cardinals again wore their red pants for their final 3 home games. They wore red pants with white jerseys in games on the road at the Cincinnati Bengals and Seattle Seahawks. They paired red pants with red jerseys, the all-red combination, for home games against the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, and St. Louis Rams. The red pants were not worn at all in<space/><template><target>Cardinals NFL season</target><arg>2008</arg></template>, but they were used in home games vs. Seattle, Minnesota, and St. Louis in<space/><template><target>Cardinals NFL season</target><arg>2009</arg></template>. The red pants were paired with the white road jersey for the first time in three years during a 2010 game at Carolina, but the white jersey/red pants combination was not used in 2011.</paragraph><paragraph>The Cardinals' first home game in Arizona, in 1988, saw them play in red jerseys. Thereafter, for the next 18 years in Arizona, the Cardinals, like a few other NFL teams in warm climates, wore their white jerseys at home during the first half of the seasonforcing opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys during Arizona autumns that frequently see temperatures over 100&amp;nbsp;F (38&amp;nbsp;C). However, this tradition did not continue when the Cardinals moved from Sun Devil Stadium to University of Phoenix Stadium in 2006, as early-season games (and some home games late in the season) were played with the roof closed. With the temperature inside at a comfortable 70&amp;nbsp;F (21&amp;nbsp;C), the team opted to wear red jerseys at home full-time. The Cardinals wore white jerseys at home for the first time in University of Phoenix Stadium on August 29, 2008, in a preseason game against the<space/><link><target>Denver Broncos</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The Cardinals wore white at home for the first time in a regular season game at University of Phoenix Stadium against the<space/><link><target>Houston Texans</target></link><space/>on October 11,<space/><template><target>NFL Year</target><arg>2009</arg></template>.
