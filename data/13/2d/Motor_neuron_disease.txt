A '''motor neuron disease''' ('''MND''') is any of five [[neurological disorder]]s that selectively affect [[motor neuron]]s, the cells that control [[voluntary muscles]] of the body. These five conditions are [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[primary lateral sclerosis]], [[progressive muscular atrophy]], [[progressive bulbar palsy]] and [[pseudobulbar palsy]].<ref name=NINDS2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/motor_neuron_diseases/detail_motor_neuron_diseases.htm|title=Motor Neuron Diseases Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|publisher=www.ninds.nih.gov|accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> They are [[neurodegenerative]] in nature and cause increasing disability and, eventually, death.<ref name=El2008/>

==Terminology==
<!-- singular is used on purpose per the references, please read before changing -->
Technically the term "motor neuron disease" includes five diseases: [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[primary lateral sclerosis]], [[progressive muscular atrophy]], [[progressive bulbar palsy]] and [[pseudobulbar palsy]].<ref name=NINDS2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/motor_neuron_diseases/detail_motor_neuron_diseases.htm|title=Motor Neuron Diseases Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|publisher=www.ninds.nih.gov|accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> 

In the United States the term is often used interchangeably with ALS.<ref name=NINDS2014/> In the United Kingdom "motor neurone disease" may be used to mean ALS.

While MND refers to a specific subset of similar diseases, there are numerous other diseases of [[motor neuron]]s that are referred to collectively as "motor neuron disorders", for instance disease belonging to [[spinal muscular atrophies]].<ref name=El2008>{{cite book|last1=Ellison|first1=edited by Seth Love, David N. Louis, David W.|title=Greenfield's neuropathology|date=2008|publisher=Hodder Arnold|location=London|isbn=9780340906811|page=947|edition=8th|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=nrEWkAc7W7IC&pg=PA947}}</ref> However, they are not classified as "motor neuron diseases" by the [[ICD-10|tenth International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD-10) which is the definition followed in this article.

== Classification ==

Motor neuron diseases affect either [[upper motor neuron]]s (UMN) or [[lower motor neuron]]s (LMN), or both:

 | [[Pseudobulbar palsy]]                  || Yes, bulbar region  || No
