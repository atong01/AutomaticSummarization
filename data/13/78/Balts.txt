The '''Balts''' or '''Baltic''' people ({{lang-lt|baltai}}, {{lang-lv|balti}}) are an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic]] group who speak the [[Baltic languages]], a branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family, which was originally spoken by tribes living in area east of [[Jutland]] peninsula in the west and [[Moscow River|Moscow]], [[Oka River|Oka]] and [[Volga]] rivers basins in the east. One of the features of Baltic languages is the number of conservative or archaic features retained.<ref>Bojtár page 18.</ref> Among the Baltic peoples are modern [[Lithuanians]], [[Latvians]] (including [[Latgalians (modern)|Latgalians]]) — all Eastern Balts — as well as the [[Old Prussians]], [[Yotvingians]] and [[Galindians]] — the Western Balts — whose people also survived, but their languages and cultures are now extinct.

==Etymology==

[[Adam of Bremen]] in the latter part of the 11th century AD was the first writer to use the term Baltic in its modern sense to mean the sea of that name.<ref name=Bot_9>Bojtár page 9.</ref> Although he must have been familiar with the ancient name, Balcia,<ref>Balcia, Abalcia, Abalus, Basilia, Balisia. The linguistic problem with these names is that Balcia cannot become Baltia by known rule.</ref> meaning a supposed island in the Baltic Sea,<ref name=Bot_9/> and although he may have been aware of the Baltic words containing the stem balt-, "white",<ref>{{lang-lv|balti}}; {{lang-lt|baltai}}; [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]: ''bolti'', lit. ''"white"''.</ref> as "swamp", he reports that he followed the local use of balticus from baelt ("belt") because the sea stretches to the east "in modum baltei" ("in the manner of a belt"). This is the first reference to "the Baltic or Barbarian Sea, a day's journey from [[Hamburg]]."<ref>Bojtár cites ''Bremensis'' I,60 and IV,10.</ref>

The Germanics, however, preferred some form of "East Sea" (in different languages) until after about 1600, when they began to use forms of "Baltic Sea." Around 1840 the German nobles of the [[Governorate of Livonia]] devised the term "Balts" to mean themselves, the German upper classes of Livonia, excluding the Latvian and Estonian lower classes. They spoke an exclusive dialect, Baltic German. For all practical purposes that was the Baltic language until 1919.<ref>Bojtár page 10.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The New Eastern Europe|first=Ralph|last=Butler|year=1919|pages=3, 21, 22, 23, 24|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London}}</ref>

In 1845 [[Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann]] proposed a distinct language group for [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] to be called Baltic.<ref>{{cite journal|first=William R.|last=Schmalstieg|title=A.

[[Estonia]] and [[Finland]] (the states of [[Baltic Finns]]), however, also became counted among the [[Baltic states]] in the geopolitical sense. (Finland was dropped from this definition after [[World War II]], though Estonia remains within the definition.)

==History==

===Origins===
The Balts or Baltic peoples, defined as speakers of one of the Baltic languages, a branch of the Indo-European language family, are descended from a group of Indo-European tribes who settled the area between the lower Vistula and southeast shore of the Baltic Sea and upper Daugava and Dnieper rivers. Because the thousands of lakes and swamps in this area contributed to the Balts' geographical isolation, the Baltic languages retain a number of conservative or archaic features.

It is possible {{according to whom|date=February 2014}} that around 3,500–2,500 B.C., there was massive migration of peoples representing the [[Corded Ware culture]]. They came from the southeast and spread all across Eastern and Central Europe, reaching even southern Finland. It is believed{{by whom|date=February 2014}} that Corded Ware culture peoples were [[Indo-European]] ancestors of many Europeans, including Balts. It is thought{{by whom|date=February 2014}} that those Indo-European newcomers were quite numerous and in the Eastern Baltic assimilated earlier indigenous cultures (Europidic cultures – [[Narva culture]] and [[Neman culture]]). Over time the new people formed the Baltic peoples and they spread in the area from the Baltic sea in the west to the [[Volga]] in the east.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Some of the major authorities on Balts, such as [[Kazimieras Būga|Būga]], [[Max Vasmer|Vasmer]], [[Toporov]] and Trubachov,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} in conducting etymological studies of eastern European river names, were able to identify in certain regions names of specifically Baltic provenance, which most likely indicate where the Balts lived in prehistoric times. This information is summarized and synthesized by [[Marija Gimbutas]] in ''The Balts'' (1963) to obtain a likely proto-Baltic homeland. Its borders are approximately: from a line on the [[Pomerania]]n coast eastward to include or nearly include the present-day sites of [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]], [[Kiev]], and [[Kursk]], northward through [[Moscow]] to the River Berzha, westward in an irregular line to the coast of the Gulf of Riga, north of [[Riga]].

===Proto-history===
A possible early reference to a Baltic people occurs in 98 AD, when [[Tacitus]] names a tribe living near the Baltic Sea (''Mare Svebicum'') as the [[Aesti]] (''Aestiorum gentes'') and describes them as [[amber]] gatherers. However, it is not clear if the Aesti mentioned by Tacitus were: (1) a (now-extinct) Baltic people (possibly synonymous with the [[Old Prussians|Brus/Prūsa]]), or; (2) a [[Finno-Ugric people]] (e.g. modern [[Estonians]]). The Aesti appear to have inhabited the [[Sambia (Baltic)|Sambian]] peninsula (in or near the present [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] {{citation needed|date=September 2014}} .

Over time, the area of Baltic habitation shrank, due to assimilation by other groups, and invasions. According to one of the theories which has gained considerable traction over the years, one of the western Baltic tribes, the [[Galindians]], [[Galindae]], or Goliad, migrated to the Eastern end of Baltic realm around the 4th century AD, and settled around modern day Moscow, Russia.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Finally, according to Slavic chronicles of the time, they warred with [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], and perhaps, were defeated and assimilated some time in the 11th to 13th centuries.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Balts became differentiated into Western and Eastern Balts in the late centuries BCE. The eastern Baltic region was inhabited by ancestors of the Western Balts: [[Old Prussians|Brus/Prūsa]] ("Old Prussians"), [[Sudovians]]/[[Jotvingians]], [[Scalvians]], [[Nadruvians]], and [[Curonians]]. The Eastern Balts, including the hypothesised [[Dniepr Balts]], were living in modern day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.

Subsequent [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and [[Goths|Gothic]] domination in the first half of the first millennium AD in Northern and Eastern Europe, as well as later Slavic expansion, caused large migrations of the Balts — first, the [[Galindae]] or [[Galindians]] towards the east, and later, Eastern Balts towards the west — until, in the 13th and 14th centuries, they reached the general area that the present-day Balts inhabit. Many other Eastern and Southern Balts either assimilated with other Balts, or Slavs in the 4th–7th centuries and were gradually slavicized.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Middle Ages===
In the 12th and the 13th centuries, internal struggles, as well as invasions by [[Ruthenians]] and [[Poles]] and later the expansion of the [[Teutonic Order]] resulted in an almost complete annihilation of the Galindians, Curonians, and Yotvingians.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Gradually Old Prussians became [[Germanization|Germanized]] or some Lithuanized during period from the 15th to the 17th centuries, especially after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in [[Prussia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The cultures of the Lithuanians and Latgalians/Latvians survived and became the ancestors of the populations of the modern countries of [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].

Old Prussian was closely related to the other extinct Western [[Baltic language]]s, [[Curonian language|Curonian]], [[Galindian language|Galindian]] and [[Sudovian language|Sudovian]]. It is more distantly related to the surviving Eastern [[Baltic language]]s, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. Compare the Prussian word ''seme'' (''zemē''),<ref name="Lie">Mikkels Klussis. ''Bāziscas prûsiskai-laîtawiskas wirdeîns per tālaisin laksikis rekreaciônin [http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/Lie.pdf Donelaitis.vdu.lt] (Lithuanian version of [http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/Engl.pdf Donelaitis.vdu.lt).]</ref> the Latvian ''zeme'', the Lithuanian ''žemė'' (''land'' in English).

Old Prussian contained a few borrowings specifically from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] (e.g., Old Prussian ''ylo'' "awl," as with Lithuanian ''ýla'', Latvian ''īlens'') and even [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]].
