{{redirect|BTU}}
The '''British thermal unit''' ('''BTU''' or '''Btu''') is a traditional unit of [[Work (physics)|work]] equal to about 1055 [[joule]]s. It is the amount of work needed to raise the temperature of one [[pound (mass)|pound]] of water by one degree [[Fahrenheit]] (Physical analogue: one four-inch wooden kitchen match consumed completely generates approximately 1 BTU). In science, the joule, the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of energy, has largely replaced the BTU.

The BTU/h is most often used as a measure of power in the [[Electrical power industry|power]], [[steam]] generation, [[heating]], and [[air conditioning]] industries, and also as a measure of agricultural energy production (BTU/kg).{{Verify source|date=October 2011}} It is still used in [[Metric system|metric]] English-speaking countries (such as [[Canada]]), and remains the standard unit of classification for air conditioning units manufactured and sold in many non-English-speaking metric countries.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED148608.pdf | title=Metrication Problems in the Construction Codes and Standards Sector | publisher=Eric.ed.gov | accessdate=5 April 2014}}</ref> In [[North America]], the heat value (energy content) of fuels is expressed in BTUs.

The special notation '''MMBtu''' or '''mmBtu''' is often used to represent one million BTU.

== Definitions ==
A BTU is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 [[avoirdupois]] pound of liquid water by 1 degree Fahrenheit at a constant pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/British-thermal-unit-Btu.html |title=What is British thermal unit (Btu)? definition and meaning |publisher=Businessdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}</ref><As with the [[calorie]], several definitions of the BTU exist, because the temperature response of water to heat energy is non-linear. This means that the change in temperature of a water mass caused by adding a certain amount of heat to it will be a function of the water's initial temperature. Definitions of the BTU based on different water temperatures can therefore vary by up to 0.5%.
A BTU can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden kitchen match<ref>Energy and the Environment. Ristinen, Robert A. c. 2006, pg 13</ref> or as the amount of energy it takes to lift a one-pound weight {{Convert|778|ft|m|0}}.<ref>Energy and the Environment.

The unit '''MBtu''' or '''mBtu''' was defined as one thousand BTU, presumably from the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral system]] where "M" or "m" stands for one thousand (1,000). This notation is easily confused with the SI '''[[Mega-|mega- (M)]]''' prefix, which denotes multiplication by a factor of one million (×10<sup>6</sup>), or with the SI '''[[milli-|milli- (m)]]''' prefix, which denotes division by a factor of one thousand (×10<sup>−3</sup>). To avoid confusion, many companies and engineers use the notation "MMBtu" or "mmBtu" to represent one million BTU (although, confusingly, MM in Roman numerals would traditionally represent 2,000) and in many contexts this form of notation is deprecated and discouraged in favour of the more modern SI prefixes. Alternatively, the term '''[[therm]]''' may be used to represent 100,000 (or 10<sup>5</sup>)&nbsp;BTU, and '''[[quad (energy)|quad]]''' for 10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;BTU. Some companies also use '''BtuE6''' in order to reduce confusion between 10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;BTU and 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;BTU.<ref>{{cite web

== Conversions ==
One BTU is approximately:
* 1.054 to 1.060 kJ (kilo[[joule]]s)
* 0.293071 W·h ([[watt hour]]s)
* 252 to 253&nbsp;cal ([[calorie]]s, or "little calories")
* 0.25 kcal (kilocalories, "large Calories," or "food Calories")
* 25,031 to 25,160&nbsp;ft·pdl ([[foot-poundal]])
* 778 to 782&nbsp;ft·lbf ([[foot-pound (energy)|foot-pounds-force]])
* 5.40395 (lbf/in<sup>2</sup>)·ft<sup>3</sup>

=== For natural gas ===
* In [[natural gas]], by convention 1&nbsp;MMBtu (1 million BTU) = 1.054615&nbsp;GJ.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/about_us/1132.asp | title=Energy Measurements | publisher=Energy.gov.ab.ca | accessdate=5 April 2014}}</ref>
* The energy content (high or low heating value) of a volume of natural gas varies with the composition of the natural gas, which means there is no universal conversion factor for the number of BTU to volume. 1 standard cubic foot of average natural gas yields ≈ 1030&nbsp;BTU (between 1010&nbsp;BTU and 1070&nbsp;BTU, depending on quality, when burned)
* As a coarse approximation, 1000&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup> of natural gas yields ≈ 1&nbsp;MMBTU ≈ 1&nbsp;GJ
* 1&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup> of natural gas yields ≈ 1000 BTU
* For natural gas price conversion 1000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> ≈ 36.906&nbsp;MMBTU and 1&nbsp;MMBTU ≈ 27.096&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>

=== As a unit of power ===
When used as a unit of power for heating and cooling systems, BTU ''per hour'' (BTU/h) is the correct unit, though this is often abbreviated to just "BTU".{{Verify source|date=February 2011}}.
* 1 [[watt]] is approximately 3.41214&nbsp;BTU/h<ref>[<!-- http://knovel.com/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=2554&VerticalID=0 -->http://app.knovel.com/web/toc.v/cid:kpASHRAE22/viewerType:toc/root_slug:ashrae-handbook-fundamentals/url_slug:ashrae-handbook-fundamentals/? 2009 ASHRAE Handbook – Fundamentals (I-P Edition)]. (pp: 38.2). [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]], Inc</ref>
* 1000&nbsp;BTU/h is approximately 293.071&nbsp;W
* 1 [[horsepower]] is approximately 2544&nbsp;BTU/h

== Associated units ==
* 1 ''[[Ton of refrigeration|ton of cooling]]'', a common unit in North American refrigeration and air conditioning applications, is {{convert|12,000|BTU/h|kW|2|abbr=on}}. It is the amount of power needed to freeze {{convert|1|ST|LT t|3}} of water into ice in 24 hours.
* 1 ''[[therm]]'' is defined in the United States and European Union as 100,000&nbsp;BTU—but the U.S. uses the BTU<sub>59&nbsp;°F</sub> while the EU uses the BTU<sub>IT</sub>. The therm is used to price natural gas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/gas/wholesale-market/gb-gas-wholesale-market|publisher=[[OFGEM]]|title=The GB gas wholesale market|quote=The wholesale gas market in Britain has one price for gas irrespective of where the gas comes from. This is called the National Balancing Point (NBP) price of gas and is usually quoted in price per therm of gas.|accessdate=Jan 13, 2013}}</ref>
* 1 ''[[quad (energy)|quad]]'' (short for [[1,000,000,000,000,000|quadrillion]] BTU) is 10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;BTU, which is about one exajoule ({{val|1.055|e=18|u=J}}). Quads are used in the United States for representing the annual energy consumption of large economies: for example, the U.S. economy used 99.75 quads in 2005.<ref>Husher, John Durbin. ''Crises of the 21st Century: Start Drilling-The Year 2020 Is Coming Fast'', iUniverse, 2009. Page 376.</ref> One quad/year is about 33.43 gigawatts.

The BTU should not be confused with the [[Board of Trade Unit]] (B.O.T.U.), which is a much larger quantity of energy ({{convert|1|kW·h|BTU|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

The BTU is often used to express the conversion-efficiency of heat into electrical energy in power plants. Figures are quoted in terms of the quantity of heat in BTU required to generate 1&nbsp;kW·h of electrical energy. A typical coal-fired power plant works at 10,500&nbsp;BTU/kW·h, an efficiency of 32–33%.<ref>[http://www.npc.org/Study_Topic_Papers/4-DTG-ElectricEfficiency.pdf Electric Generation Efficiency, NPC Global Oil & Gas Study, 18 July 2007]</ref>
