'''Abacá''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑː|b|ə|ˈ|k|ɑː}} {{respell|ah-bə|KAH|'}}; {{lang-es|abacá}} {{IPA-es|aβaˈka|}}), binomial name '''''Musa textilis''''', is a species of [[banana]] native to the [[Philippines]],<ref name=GRIN>{{harvnb|Agricultural Research Services Botanists|1995}}</ref> grown as a commercial crop in the Philippines, Ecuador, and Costa Rica. The plant, also known as '''Manila hemp''',<ref name=GRIN/> has great economic importance, being harvested for its [[fiber]], also called [[Manila hemp]], extracted from the leaf-stems.<ref name=bail/> The plant grows to {{convert|13|-|22|ft|m}},<ref name=bail2/> and averages about {{convert|12|ft|m}}. The fiber was originally used for making twines and ropes; now most is pulped and used in a variety of specialized paper products including tea bags, filter paper and banknotes.  It is classified as a hard fiber, along with [[coir]], [[henequin]] and [[sisal]].

==Description==
The abacá plant is stoloniferous, meaning that the plant produces runners or shoots along the ground that then root at each segment.<ref name=bail2/> Cutting and transplanting rooted runners is the primary technique for creating new plants, since seed growth is substantially slower.{{refn|group=nb|A plant grown from a shoot takes three years to maturity; while a plant grown from a seed takes 4 years to maturity.<ref name=wor>{{harvnb|Worcester|1899|p=506}}</ref>}}<ref name=wood>{{harvnb|Wood|Roberts|2005|p=301}}</ref> Abacá has a "false trunk" or pseudostem about {{convert|6|-|15|in|cm}} in diameter.<ref name=bail/> The leaf stalks ([[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]) are expanded at the base to form [[Leaf sheath|sheath]]s that are tightly wrapped together to form the pseudostem. There are from 12 to 25 leaves, dark green on the top and pale green on the underside, sometimes with large brown patches. They are oblong in shape with a deltoid base.<ref name=bail2/> They grow in succession. The petioles grow to at least {{convert|1|ft|cm}} in length.<ref name=bail2/> When the plant is mature, the flower stalk grows up inside the pseudostem. The male flower has 5 petals, each about {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} long.<ref name=bail2/> The leaf sheaths contain the valuable fiber. After harvesting, the coarse fibers range in length from {{convert|6|-|12|ft|cm}} long.<ref name=bail/> They are composed primarily of [[cellulose]], [[lignin]], and [[pectin]].

The fruit, which is inedible<ref name=bail/> and is rarely seen as harvesting occurs before the plant fruits, grows to about {{convert|2|-|3|in|cm}} in length and {{convert|1|in|cm}} in diameter.<ref name=bail2/> It has black turbinate seeds that are {{convert|0.167|in|cm}} in diameter.<ref name=bail2/>

==Systematics==
The abacá plant belongs to the [[banana]] family, [[Musaceae]]; it resembles the closely related wild seeded bananas, ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]''. Its scientific name is ''Musa textilis''. Within the [[genus]] ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'', it is placed in section ''Callimusa'' (now including the former section ''Australimusa''), members of which have a [[diploid]] [[chromosome]] number of 2n = 20.<ref name=Wong02>{{harvnb|Wong|Kiew|Argent|Set|2002|p=234}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Abaca fiber drying in Abaca farm, Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|Abaca fiber drying in abaca farm, [[Costa Rica]]]]
Before synthetic textiles came into use, ''M.&nbsp;textilis'' was a major source of high quality fiber: soft, silky and fine.<ref name=Ploe07>{{harvnb|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=4}}</ref> Europeans first came into contact with it when [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] made land in the Philippines in 1521, as the natives were cultivating it and utilizing it in bulk for textiles already.<ref name=wood/> By 1897, the Philippines were exporting almost 100,000 tons of abacá,<ref name=wor/> and it was one of the three biggest cash crops, along with tobacco and sugar.<ref name=dolan>{{harvnb|Seekins|1993|p=11}}</ref> In fact, from 1850 through the end of the 19th century, sugar or abacá alternated with each other as the biggest export crop of the Philippines.<ref name=dolan/> This 19th century trade was predominantly with the United States and the making of ropes was done mainly in New England, although in time the rope-making was moved back to the Philippines.<ref name=dolan/> Excluding the Philippines, abacá was first cultivated on a large scale in [[Sumatra]] in 1925 under the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], who had observed its cultivation in the Philippines for [[cordage]] since the nineteenth century, followed up by plantings in [[Central America]] in 1929 sponsored by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].<ref name="eb">{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=6}}</ref> It also was transplanted into [[India]] and [[Guam]].<ref name=wood/>  Commercial planting began in 1930 in [[British North Borneo]]; with the commencement of World War II, the supply from the Philippines was eliminated by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].<ref name="eb"/> After the war, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] started production in [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Honduras]], and [[Guatemala]].<ref name=wood/> Today, abacá is produced commercially in only three countries: Philippines, Ecuador, and Costa Rica.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The Philippines produces between 85%<ref name="NIMBB"/> and 95%<ref name=wood/> of the world's abacá, and the production employs 1.5 million people. Production has declined because of virus diseases.<ref name="NIMBB">{{harvnb|Anon|2013a}}</ref>
[[File:Abacá Mat.jpg|thumb|Mats made from woven Abacá fibers from the [[Philippines]]]]

Ancestors of the modern abaca might have originated from the Eastern Philippines where there are lot of rains (no pronounced dry season), in fact wild type of abaca can still be found in the interior forests of Catanduanes Island which is often not cultivated. Today, Catanduanes  has many other modern kinds of abaca which are more competitive. For many years, breeders from various research institutions have made the cultivated varieties of Catanduanes Island even more competitive in local and international markets. This results in the optimum production of the island which had a consistent highest production throughout the archipelago.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Uses==
Due to its strength, it is a sought after product and is the strongest of the natural fibers.<ref name=wood/> It is used by the paper industry for such specialty uses such as teabags, banknotes and decorative papers.<ref name=wood/> It can be used to make handcrafts such as bags, carpets, clothing and furniture.  Abacá rope is very durable, flexible and resistant to salt water damage, allowing its use in [[hawser]]s, ship's lines and [[fishing net]]s.<ref name="eb"/>  A {{convert|1|in|cm}} rope can require {{convert|4|MT|lb}} to break.<ref name="Colliers">{{harvnb|Borneman, Jr.|1997|p=4}}</ref> Abacá fiber was once used primarily for rope, but this application is now of minor significance.  Lupis is the finest quality of abacá.<ref name="bab1">{{harvnb|Gove|1976|p=1347}}</ref> [[Sinamay]] is woven chiefly from abacá.<ref name="bab2">{{harvnb|Gove|1976a|p=2122}}</ref>

===Textiles===
The inner fibers are used in the making of hats, including the "Manila hats," hammocks, matting, [[cordage]], ropes, coarse twines, and types of canvas. It is called [[Manila hemp]] in the market although it is unlike true hemp, and is lso known as Cebu hemp and Davao hemp. Abacá cloth is found in museum collections around the world, like the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Textile Museum of Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Abaca cloth|url = http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/abaca-cloth-73450|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Textile Museum of Canada Collection and Exhibitions {{!}} Textile Museum of Canada Collection and Exhibitions|url = http://collections.textilemuseum.ca/index.cfm?page=collection.browse&sub=Yarn,_Fabric_and_Fabric_Finishing_Material&cat=ArtifactType&id=668|website = collections.textilemuseum.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}</ref>

==Cultivation==
The plant is normally grown in well-drained [[loam]]y soil, using [[rhizomes]] planted at the start of the rainy season.<ref name="eb"/> In addition, new plants can be started by seeds.<ref name=van/> Growers harvest abacá fields every three to eight months after an initial growth period of 12–25 months.<ref name=bail/><ref name="eb"/> Harvesting is done by removing the leaf-stems after flowering but before fruit appears.<ref name=bail/> The plant loses productivity between 15 and 40 years.<ref name=bail>{{harvnb|Bailey|1947|p=171}}</ref> The slopes of volcanoes provide a preferred growing environment.<ref name="Colliers"/> Harvesting generally includes several operations involving the leaf sheaths:
* tuxying (separation of primary and secondary sheath)
* stripping (getting the fibers)
* drying (usually following the tradition of sun-drying).

When the processing is complete, the bundles of fiber are pale and lustrous with a length of {{convert|6|-|12|ft|m}}.<ref name=van>{{harvnb|Considine|Considine|1983|p=1}}</ref>

In Costa Rica, more modern harvest and drying techniques are being developed to accommodate the very high yields obtained there.

More than 80% of modern abaca production comes from the Philippines. Bicol is the top producing region while Catanduanes Island remains the top producing province in the Philippines. The Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) and the Department of Agriculture reported that in 2009-2013, Bicol Region had 39% share of Philippine abaca producution while overwhelming 92% comes from Catanduanes Island. Eastern Visayas, the second largest producer had 24% and the Davao Region, the third largest producer had 11% of the total production.

===Pathogens===
Abacá is vulnerable to a number of pathogens, notably [[abaca bunchy top virus]] and [[abaca bract mosaic virus]].<ref name="NIMBB"/>
