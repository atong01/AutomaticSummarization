There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th Century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the<space/><link><target>English Civil War</target></link>. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by<space/><link><target>Privateer#Bermudian privateers</target><part>Bermudian privateers</part></link>, and Native Americans, primarily from the<space/><link><target>Algonquian peoples</target><part>Algonquian</part></link><space/>and other tribes of the<space/><link><target>Atlantic seaboard</target></link>, but possibly from as far as<space/><link><target>Mexico</target></link>. By the 19th Century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, &quot;coloured&quot; (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as &quot;coloured&quot; are today described as &quot;black&quot;, or &quot;of African heritage&quot;, which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as &quot;coloured&quot; who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of South Asians, particularly, is now growing. The number of persons born in Asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses), blacks have remained in the majority, with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the West Indies.</paragraph><paragraph>Bermuda's modern black population contains more than one demographic group. Although the number of residents born in Africa is very small, it has tripled between 2000 and 2010 (this group also includes non-blacks). The majority of blacks in Bermuda can be termed &quot;Bermudian blacks&quot;, whose ancestry dates back centuries between the 17th Century and the end of slavery in 1834, Bermuda's black population was self-sustaining, with its growth resulting largely from natural expansion. This contrasts to the enslaved blacks of the plantation colonies, who were subjected to conditions so harsh as to drop their birth rate below the death rate, and slaveholders in the United States and the West Indies found it necessary to continue importing more enslaved blacks from Africa until the end of slavery (the same had been true for the Native Americans that the Africans had replaced on the New World plantations. The indigenous populations of many West Indian islands, and much of the South-East of what is now the United States that had survived the 16th and 17th Century epidemics of European-introduced diseases then became the victims of large scale slave raiding, with much of the region completely depopulated. When the supply of indigenous slaves ran out, the slaveholders looked to Africa). The ancestry of Bermuda's black population is distinguished from that of the British West Indian black population in two ways: firstly, the higher degree of European and Native American admixture; secondly, the source of the African ancestry.</paragraph><paragraph>In the British West Indian islands (and also in the United States), the majority of enslaved blacks brought across the Atlantic came from West Africa (roughly between modern Senegal and Ghana). Very little of Bermuda's original black emigration came from this area. The first blacks to arrive in Bermuda in any numbers were free blacks from Spanish-speaking areas of the West Indies, and most of the remainder were recently enslaved Africans captured from the Spanish and Portuguese. As Spain and Portugal sourced most of their slaves from South-West Africa (the Portuguese through ports in modern-day Angola; the Spanish purchased most of their African slaves from Portuguese traders, and from Arabs whose slave trading was centred in Zanzibar). Genetic studies have consequently shown that the African ancestry of black Bermudians (other than those resulting from recent immigration from the British West Indian islands) is largely from the a band across southern Africa, from Angola to Mozambique, which is similar to what is revealed in Latin America, but distinctly different from the blacks of the West Indies and the United States.</paragraph><paragraph>Most of Bermuda's black population trace some of their ancestry to Native Americans, although awareness of this is largely limited to<space/><link><target>St. David's Island, Bermuda</target><part>St David's Islanders</part></link><space/>and most who have such ancestry are unaware of it. During the colonial period, hundreds of Native Americans were shipped to Bermuda. The best-known examples were the<space/><link><target>Algonquian peoples</target></link><space/>who were exiled from the southern<space/><link><target>New England</target></link><space/>colonies and sold into slavery in the 17th century, notably in the aftermaths of the<space/><link><target>Pequot War</target><part>Pequot</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>King Philip's War</target><part>King Philip's</part></link><space/>wars.</paragraph><paragraph>Today several thousand<space/><link><target>expatriate</target></link><space/>workers, principally from Britain, Canada, the West Indies,<space/><link><target>South Africa</target></link><space/>and the US, reside in Bermuda.

Others are employed in various trades, such as hotels, restaurants, construction, and landscaping services. Of the total workforce of 38,947 persons in 2005, government employment figures stated that 11,223 (29%) were non-Bermudians.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Bermuda Sun</italics>, 4 April 2007.</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Culture</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Culture of Bermuda</arg></template><template><target>see also</target><arg>Holidays in Bermuda</arg></template><template><target>refimprove section</target><arg name="date">January 2012</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Bermuda's culture is a mixture of the various sources of its population: Native American, Spanish-Caribbean, English, Irish, and Scots cultures were evident in the 17th century, and became part of the dominant British culture.

Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the<space/><link><target>Azores</target></link>, though also from<space/><link><target>Madeira</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Cape Verde Islands</target></link>), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese.

Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the Company's charter in 1684, and the Company was dissolved.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Maritime economy</heading><paragraph>Bermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (<italics><link><target>Juniperus bermudiana</target></link></italics>, called<space/><italics>Bermuda cedar</italics>) trees that grew thickly over the whole island.

Prior to the war, with no useful landmass or natural resources, Bermuda was largely ignored and left to its own devices by the London government. By being so deeply involved in trade, Bermuda merchants and financiers had played roles out of proportion to the colony's size in relation to the development of the Triangle Trade, and the trans-Atlantic English and British empires.</paragraph><paragraph>Its people were settlers and founders of new colonies, especially in the American South. Its merchant fleet and a web of expatriate Bermudian merchants dominated trade through a number of American<space/><link><target>Atlantic Seaboard</target></link><space/>ports and the West Indies. Bermudians fished for cod on the<space/><link><target>Grand Banks</target></link><space/>off<space/><link><target>Newfoundland (island)</target><part>Newfoundland</part></link>, and were involved in the lumber industry in<space/><link><target>Central America</target></link>.

The close economic, family, and historical ties ensured Bermudians were strongly sympathetic with the rebels at the start of the War. They supplied the rebels illegally with ships, salt and gunpowder. As the war progressed, economic realities caused Bermudians to seize opportunities; they turned to privateering against the Americans.</paragraph><paragraph>The end of the war, however, was to cause profound change in Bermuda, though some of those changes would take decades to crystallise. Following the war, with the buildup of Naval and military forces in Bermuda, the primary leg of the Bermudian economy became defence infrastructure. Even after tourism began later in the 19th century, Bermuda remained, in the eyes of London, a base more than a colony. The Crown strengthened its political and economic ties to Bermuda, and the colony's independence on the world stage was diminished.</paragraph><paragraph>The war had removed Bermuda's primary trading partners, the American colonies, from the empire, and dealt a harsh blow to Bermuda's merchant shipping trade. This also suffered due to the deforestation of Bermuda, as well as the advent of metal ships and steam propulsion, for which it did not have raw materials. During the course of the following<space/><link><target>War of 1812</target></link>, the primary market for Bermuda's salt disappeared as the Americans developed their own sources. Control of the Turks had passed to the<space/><link><target>Bahamas</target></link><space/>in 1819.</paragraph><paragraph>By the end of the 19th century, except for naval and military facilities, Bermuda was considered a quiet, rustic backwater.

These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the<space/><link><target>British empire</target></link>, and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as<space/><link><target>the Football Association</target></link><space/>(FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players.</paragraph><paragraph>The professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including cricket,<space/><link><target>Association football</target><part>football</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Rugby football</target></link>, and even<space/><link><target>Lawn tennis</target><part>tennis</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Rowing (sport)</target><part>rowing</part></link><space/>(rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic.
