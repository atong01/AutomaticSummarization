[[Christopher Columbus]] landed on the island on Dec 5th, 1492, which the [[Taíno]] people had inhabited since the 7th century. It became the site of the first permanent [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlement]] in the Americas; namely [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], the oldest continuously inhabited city and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the [[New World]]. After three centuries of Spanish rule, with French and Haitian interludes, the Dominican Republic became independent in 1821. The ruler, [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], intended that the Dominican Republic be part of the nation of [[Gran Colombia]], but he was quickly removed by the Haitian government and Dominican slave revolts. Victorious in the [[Dominican War of Independence]] against Haitian rule in 1844, the Dominican Republic over the next 72 years, experienced mostly [[civil war|internal strife]] and a brief return to colonial status, the only nation in the hemisphere to do so after gaining its independence, before permanently ousting Spaniard rule during the [[Dominican Restoration War|Dominican War of Restoration]] of 1865.<ref>{{cite web|title=La guerra de la Restauración Dominicana|publisher=https://www.dgii.gov.do/et/nivelBasico/Documents/Guerra%20de%20la%20Restauraci%C3%B3n,%2016%20de%20agosto%201863.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Guerrero|first1=Johnny|title=La Restauración de la República como referente histórico|url=http://eldia.com.do/la-restauracion-de-la-republica-como-referente-historico/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/dominican/conception.htm |title=An Apparent Contradiction?

== Names and etymology ==
For most of its history (up until independence), the country was known as '''Santo Domingo'''<ref name=firstcolony>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– The first colony |accessdate=June 19, 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref>&nbsp;— the name of its present capital and patron saint, [[Saint Dominic]]—and continued to be commonly known as such in English until the early 20th century.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CLpoeD3cbBkC&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false Hand Book of Santo Domingo:] Bulletin, Issue 52. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1892. Digitized 14 August 2012. p. 3. ''"...the Republic of Santo Domingo or República Dominicana (Dominican Republic) as it is officially designated."''</ref>  The residents were called ''Dominicanos'' (Dominicans), which is the adjective form of "Domingo", and the revolutionaries named their newly independent country ''La República Dominicana''. At present, the Dominican Republic is one of only four nations worldwide (along with the Central African Republic, the Czech Republic, and the United Arab Emirates) with only a [[demonym]]-based adjectival name.<ref>
{{cite web |url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/list2.htm |title=Alphabetical List of Countries |publisher=Internet World Statistics }} For example, the French Republic is generally known as France, but the Dominican Republic has no such equivalent, although the name ''Quisqueya'' is used sometimes.
</ref>

In the national anthem of the Dominican Republic ([[Himno Nacional Dominicano|Himno Nacional]]) the term "Dominican" never appears. The author of its lyrics, [[Emilio Prud'Homme]], consistently uses the poetic term ''[[Quisqueyano]]s'', that is, "Quisqueyans". The word "Quisqueya"  derives from a native tongue of the Taino Indians and means, "Mother of all Lands". It is often used in songs as another name for the country. The name of the country is often shortened to "the D.R."<ref name=Kraft>{{cite news |title=Paradise On The Beach Resorst Are Beautiful In Caribbean's Punta Cana, But Poverty Is Outside The Gates |first=Randy |last=Kraft |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2000-08-27/entertainment/3318706_1_punta-cana-caribbean-sea-white-beach |newspaper=[[The Morning Call]]|date=August 27, 2000|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IgYqdHQG |archivedate=August 6, 2012 }}

The Spaniards arrived in 1492. After initially friendly relationships, the Taínos resisted the conquest, led by the female Chief [[Anacaona]] of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief Caonabo of Maguana, as well as Chiefs [[Guacanagaríx]], [[Guamá]], [[Hatuey]], and [[Enriquillo]]. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Within a few years after 1492 the population of Taínos had declined drastically, due to [[smallpox]],<ref>"[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/What-Became-of-the-Taino.html What Became of the Taíno?]".

The first recorded smallpox outbreak in the Americas occurred on Hispaniola in 1507.<ref name="history"/> The last record of pure Taínos in the country was from 1864. Still, Taíno biological heritage survived to an important extent, due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Taino women,<ref>Ferbel, Dr. P. J.

After its conquest of the [[Aztec]]s and [[Inca Empire|Incas]], Spain neglected its Caribbean holdings. English and French [[buccaneer]]s settled in northwestern Hispaniola coast, and after years of struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to France with the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. France created a wealthy colony Saint-Domingue there, while the Spanish colony suffered an economic decline.<ref name="google48">{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=ed.: Franklin W.|title=General history of the Caribbean.|date=1997|publisher=Unesco|location=London|isbn=92-3-103146-5|page=48|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppGJBmQVJjEC&lpg=PR2&pg=PR2#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>

The colony of Santo Domingo saw a spectacular population increase during the 17th century, as it rose from some 6,000 in 1637 to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves.This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present day Haiti)&nbsp;– which had a population that was 90% enslaved and overall four times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo.<ref name="google48"/>

France came to own Hispaniola in 1795 when by the [[Peace of Basel]] Spain ceded Santo Domingo as a consequence of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. At the time, [[Saint-Domingue]]'s slaves led by [[Toussaint Louverture]] were in revolt against France. In 1801 they captured Santo Domingo in the east, thus controlling the entire island. In 1802 an army sent by [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] captured Toussaint Louverture and sent him to France as prisoner. Toussaint Louverture’s lieutenants and [[yellow fever]] succeeded in expelling the French again from Saint-Domingue, which in 1804 the rebels made independent as the Republic of Haiti. Eastwards, France continued to rule Spanish Santo Domingo.

In 1805, Haitian troops of general [[Henri Christophe]] invaded Santo Domingo and sacked the towns of Santiago de los Caballeros and [[Moca, Dominican Republic|Moca]], killing most of their residents and helping to lay the foundation for two centuries of animosity between the two countries.

In 1808, following [[Peninsular War|Napoleon's invasion of Spain]], the ''[[Criollo (people)|criollos]]'' of Santo Domingo revolted against French rule and, with the aid of [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] (Spain's ally) and Haiti,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/4.htm |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– Haiti and Santo Domingo |accessdate=October 17, 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref> returned Santo Domingo to [[España Boba|Spanish control]].<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9117380/Dominican-Republic|title= Dominican Republic|accessdate=June 20, 2007|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref>

=== Independence from Spain (1821) ===
{{Further|Republic of Spanish Haiti}}
After a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], declared the colony's independence from the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]] as [[Republic of Spanish Haiti|Spanish Haiti]], on November 30, 1821. This period is also known as the Ephemeral independence.

{{Further|Unification of Hispaniola}}
[[File:President Jean-Pierre Boyer of Haiti (Hispaniola Unification Regime) Portrait.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Jean-Pierre Boyer]] the mulatto ruler of Haiti.]]

The independence of the Dominican Republic ended two months later with the [[Unification of Hispaniola]] under the Haitian government led by [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]].<ref name="guitar">{{cite web |last = Guitar |first = Lynne |title = History of the Dominican Republic |publisher = Hola.com |url = http://www.hispaniola.com/dominican_republic/info/history.php |accessdate =May 29, 2007}}</ref>

As Toussaint Louverture had done two decades earlier, the Haitians abolished slavery. In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to [[Land reform|redistribute]] land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (''terrenos comuneros''), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and [[Joseph Inginac]]'s ''Code Rural''.<ref>''Terrenos comuneros'' arose because of “scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch.” (Hoetink, ''The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology'' transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982)</ref> In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.

Haiti's constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and the major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. Many emigrated to [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] (these two being [[Spanish Empire|Spanish possessions]] at the time) or [[Gran Colombia]], usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials who acquired their lands. The Haitians associated the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the [[Holy See|Vatican]].

All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid, and had to "forage and sack" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a "heavy tribute" on the Dominican people.<ref name=Matibag/>{{rp|page number needed}}

Many whites fled Santo Domingo for [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Cuba]] (both still under Spanish rule), [[Venezuela]], and elsewhere. In the end the economy faltered and taxation became more onerous. Rebellions occurred even by Dominican freedmen, while Dominicans and Haitians worked together to oust Boyer from power. Anti-Haitian movements of several kinds&nbsp;– pro-independence, pro-Spanish, pro-French, pro-British, pro-United States&nbsp;– gathered force following the overthrow of Boyer in 1843.<ref name=Matibag/>{{rp|page number needed}}

{{See also|Dominican War of Independence}}
[[File:Juan pablo duarte diez.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Juan Pablo Duarte]], founding father of the Dominican Republic.]]
In 1838 [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] founded a secret society called [[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]], which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention.<ref name="pons">{{cite book |first=Frank |last =Moya Pons| authorlink =Frank Moya Pons | title = The Dominican Republic: A National History|edition= August 1, 1998|page= 543 |publisher = Markus Wiener Publishers; 2nd edition| isbn= 1-55876-191-8}}</ref>{{rp|p147–149}} [[Matías Ramón Mella]] and [[Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]], despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence.

On February 27, 1844, the ''Trinitarios'' (the members of La Trinitaria), declared the independence from Haiti. They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher from [[El Seibo]], who became general of the army of the nascent Republic. The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|Constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name="Encarta"/>

The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Threatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions occurring in 1844, 1845–49, 1849–55, and 1855–56.<ref name=Matibag/>{{rp|page number needed}} Haiti did not recognize the Dominican Republic until 1874.<ref name="mirex2000"/>

Meanwhile, archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura Báez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and Báez the United States.

In 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the Dominican nation to colonial status, the only Latin American country to do so. His ostensible aim was to protect the nation from another Haitian annexation.<ref name=Sagas>{{cite web| last=Sagas| first=Ernesto| title=An Apparent Contradiction?&nbsp;– Popular Perceptions of Haiti and the Foreign Policy of the Dominican Republic| work=Sixth Annual Conference of the Haitian Studies Association, Boston, Massachusetts| publisher=[[Webster University]]| date=October 14–15, 1994| url=http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/dominican/conception.htm| accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref> Opponents launched the [[Dominican Restoration War|War of Restoration]] in 1863, led by [[Santiago Rodríguez Masagó|Santiago Rodríguez]], Benito Monción, and [[Gregorio Luperón]], among others.

Báez was toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good in 1878. A new generation was thence in charge, with the passing of Santana (he died in 1864) and Báez from the scene. Relative peace came to the country in the 1880s, which saw the coming to power of General [[Ulises Heureaux]].<ref name=countrystudies>{{cite web |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– Ulises Heureaux, 1882–99 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/8.htm |accessdate=December 23, 2007}}</ref>

"Lilís", as the new president was nicknamed, enjoyed a period of popularity. He was, however, "a consummate dissembler", who put the nation deep into debt while using much of the proceeds for his personal use and to maintain his police state. Heureaux became rampantly despotic and unpopular.<ref name=countrystudies/><ref>{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Lester D.|title=The Banana Wars|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=0-8420-5047-7|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xc1RBfZd3pcC&pg=PA20|year=2002}}</ref> In 1899 he was assassinated.

=== 20th century (1900–30)===
[[File:Alejandro Woss y Gil.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Alejandro Woss y Gil]] taking office in 1903.]]
From 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by [[caudillo]]s in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay Heureaux's debts, faced the threat of military intervention by France and other European creditor powers.<ref name=cs9>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/9.htm |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– Renewed conflict, 1899–1916 |accessdate=October 19, 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref>

United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future [[Panama Canal]], as the canal was already under construction. He made a small [[1916 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic|military intervention]] to ward off the European powers, proclaimed his famous [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], and in 1905 obtained Dominican agreement for U.S. administration of Dominican customs, then the chief source of income for the Dominican government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The United States agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the Dominican Republic, and assumed responsibility for said debt.<ref name=Encarta/><ref name=cs9/>

[[File:Ramon Caceres.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ramón Cáceres]].]]
After six years in power, President [[Ramón Cáceres]] (who had himself assassinated Heureaux)<ref name=countrystudies/> was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great political instability and civil war. U.S. mediation by the [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] administrations achieved only a short respite each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling Dominicans to choose a president or see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899–1902) [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra]] back in power. To achieve a more broadly supported government, Jimenes named opposition individuals to his Cabinet. But this brought no peace and, with his former [[Secretary of War]] Desiderio Arias maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916.<ref name="congress">{{cite web| title=Dominican Republic: Occupation by the United States, 1916–1924| work=Country Studies| publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division| url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/10.htm| accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>

Wilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic. [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] landed on May 16, 1916, and had control of the country two months later. The military government established by the U.S., led by Rear Admiral [[Harry Shepard Knapp]], was widely repudiated by Dominicans, with many factions within the country leading guerrilla campaigns against U.S. forces.<ref name="congress"/> The occupation regime kept most Dominican laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population. The occupying government also revived the Dominican economy, reduced the nation's debt, built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units.<ref name="congress"/>

Vigorous opposition to the occupation continued, nevertheless, and after World War I it increased in the U.S. as well. There, President [[Warren G. Harding]] (1921–23), Wilson's successor, worked to put an end to the occupation, as he had promised to do during his campaign. The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.<ref name="congress"/> [[File:Horacio Vasquez.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Horacio Vásquez|Horacio Vásquez Lajara]]]]
The victor was former president (1902–03) [[Horacio Vásquez|Horacio Vásquez Lajara]], who had cooperated with the U.S. He was inaugurated on July 13, and the last U.S. forces left in September. Vásquez gave the country six years of stable governance, in which political and civil rights were respected and the economy grew strongly, in a relatively peaceful atmosphere.<ref name="congress"/><ref name=locdr11>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/11.htm |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– The era of Trujillo| work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref>

During the government of Horacio Vásquez, [[Rafael Trujillo]] held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and was Chief of Police. This position helped him launch his plans to overthrow the government of Vásquez. Trujillo had the support of Carlos Rosario Peña, who formed the Civic Movement, which had as its main objective to overthrow the government of Vásquez.

In February 1930, when Vásquez attempted to win another term, his opponents rebelled in secret alliance with the commander of the National Army (the former National Guard), General [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina]]. Trujillo secretly cut a deal with rebel leader [[Rafael Estrella Ureña]]; in return for letting Estrella take power, Trujillo would be allowed to run for president in new elections. As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, Vásquez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning "neutrality," Trujillo kept his men in barracks, allowing Estrella's rebels to take the capital virtually uncontested. On March 3, Estrella was proclaimed acting president with Trujillo confirmed as head of the police and the army.

As per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly formed Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: Coalición patriotica de los ciudadanos), with Estrella as his running mate. During the election campaign, Trujillo used the army to unleash his repression, forcing his opponents to withdraw from the race. Trujillo stood to elect himself, and in May he was elected president virtually unopposed after a violent campaign against his opponents, ascending to power on August 16, 1930.

=== Trujillo Era (1930–61)===
There was considerable economic growth during [[Rafael Trujillo]]'s long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals and clinics, schools, and roads and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan. He finally negotiated an undisputed border with Haiti in 1935, and achieved the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, instead of 1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947.<ref name=Encarta/>

This was accompanied by absolute repression and the copious use of murder, torture, and terrorist methods against the opposition. Trujillo renamed [[Santo Domingo]] to "Ciudad Trujillo" (Trujillo City),<ref name=Encarta/> the nation's&nbsp;– and the Caribbean's&nbsp;– highest mountain ''[[Pico Duarte|La Pelona Grande]]'' (Spanish for: The Great Bald) to "Pico Trujillo" (Spanish for: Trujillo Peak), and many towns and a province. Some other places he renamed after members of his family.

On November 25, 1960, Trujillo killed three of the four [[Mirabal sisters]], nicknamed ''Las Mariposas'' (The Butterflies). The victims were Patria Mercedes Mirabal (born on February 27, 1924), Argentina Minerva Mirabal (born on March 12, 1926), and Antonia María Teresa Mirabal (born on October 15, 1935). Along with their husbands, the sisters were conspiring to overthrow Trujillo in a violent revolt. The Mirabals had communist ideological leanings as well as their husbands. The sisters have received many honors posthumously, and have many memorials in various cities in the Dominican Republic. Salcedo, their home province, changed its name to [[Hermanas Mirabal Province|Provincia Hermanas Mirabal]] (Mirabal Sisters Province). The [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]] is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.

For a long time, the U.S. and the Dominican elite supported the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, the massacre of Haitians, and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The U.S. believed Trujillo was the lesser of two or more evils.<ref name="Wucker"/> The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's agents attempted to assassinate the Venezuelan president, [[Rómulo Betancourt]], a fierce critic of Trujillo.<ref name=locdr11/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826562,00.html|title=Trying to Topple Trujillo|work=Time Magazine|date=5 September 1960|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>

=== Post-Trujillo (1961–2000)===
Trujillo was assassinated on May 30, 1961.<ref name=locdr11/> In February 1963, a democratically elected government under leftist [[Juan Bosch]] took office but it was overthrown in September. In April 1965, after 19 months of military rule, a pro-Bosch revolt broke out.<ref>{{cite video|title=Dominican Truce.

Days later U.S. President [[Lyndon Johnson]], concerned that Communists might take over the revolt and create a "second Cuba", sent the Marines followed immediately by the Army's [[82nd Airborne Division]] and other elements of the XVIIIth Airborne Corps in [[Operation Powerpack]]. "We don't propose to sit here in a rocking chair with our hands folded and let the Communist set up any government in the western hemisphere", Johnson said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1965/Dominican-Revolution,-Cuba/12301381029534-4/|title=Dominican Revolution, Cuba&nbsp;– Events of 1965&nbsp;– Year in Review|work=UPI.com|accessdate=24 March 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090519231042/http://www.upi.com:80/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1965/Dominican-Revolution%2C-Cuba/12301381029534-4/|archivedate=19 May 2009}}</ref> The forces were soon joined by comparatively small contingents from the [[Organization of American States]].<ref name="civil war"/>

Balaguer remained in power as president for 12 years. His tenure was a period of repression of human rights and civil liberties, ostensibly to keep pro-Castro or pro-communist parties out of power; 11,000 persons were killed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.listindiario.com/la-republica/2013/3/9/268859/11000-victimas-en-Doce-Anos-de-JB |title= 11,000 víctimas en Doce Años de JB |publisher=Listín Diario |date=10 March 2013 |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last={{Smallcaps|Quiroz}} |first=Fernando|url= http://www.listindiario.com/la-republica/2013/3/9/268858/Comision-de-la-Verdad-por-asesinatos-y-desapariciones |title= Comisión de la Verdad por asesinatos y desapariciones |publisher=Listín Diario |location=Santo Domingo |date=10 March 2013 |language=Spanish}}</ref> His rule was criticized for a growing disparity between rich and poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and the massive [[Columbus Lighthouse]], completed in 1992 during a later tenure.

In 1978, Balaguer was succeeded in the presidency by opposition candidate [[Antonio Guzmán Fernández]], of the [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]] (PRD). Another PRD win in 1982 followed, under [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]]. Under the PRD presidents, the Dominican Republic enjoyed a period of relative freedom and basic human rights.

Balaguer regained the presidency in 1986, and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, this last time just defeating PRD candidate [[José Francisco Peña Gómez]], a former mayor of Santo Domingo.<!--some info needs to be added about Balaguer's performance 1986-96--> The 1994 elections were flawed, bringing on international pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another presidential contest in 1996.<ref name="CIADemo"/>

That year [[Leonel Fernández]] achieved the first-ever win for the [[Dominican Liberation Party]] (PLD), which Bosch had founded in 1973 after leaving the PRD (which he also had founded). Fernández oversaw a fast-growing economy: growth averaged 7.7% per year, unemployment fell, and there were stable exchange and inflation rates.<ref name=coha/>

=== 21st century ===
[[File:DM16Ago.png|thumb|President [[Danilo Medina]] in the swearing in of new government cabinet.]]
In 2000 the PRD's [[Hipólito Mejía]] won the election. This was a time of economic troubles.<ref name=coha/> Mejía was defeated in his re-election effort in 2004.

Leonel Fernández of the PLD was elected president. He was re-elected in 2008.<ref name=ussdnote/> Fernández and the PLD are credited with initiatives that have moved the country forward technologically, such as the construction of the [[Santo Domingo Metro|Metro Railway]] ("El Metro"). On the other hand, his administrations have been accused of corruption.<ref name=coha/>

[[Danilo Medina]] of the PLD was elected president in 2012. He campaigned on a platform of investing more in social programs and education and less in infrastructure.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of the Dominican Republic}}

[[File:Dr-map.gif|thumb|350px|A map of the Dominican Republic.]]
[[File:Dominican Republic relief location map.jpg|thumb|350px|The Dominican Republic's topography.]]
The Dominican Republic is situated on the eastern part of the second-largest island in the [[Greater Antilles]], [[Hispaniola]]. It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with [[Haiti]]. The country's area is reported variously as {{convert|48442|km²|0|abbr=on}} (by the embassy in the United States)<ref name=embassy/> and {{convert|48730|km²|0|abbr=on}},<ref name="CIADemo"/> making it the second largest country in the [[Antilles]], after [[Cuba]]. The Dominican Republic's capital and largest metropolitan area [[Santo Domingo]] is on the southern coast.

There are many small offshore islands and [[cay]]s that are part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are [[Saona Island|Saona]], in the southeast, and Beata, in the southwest. To the north, at distances of {{convert|100|-|200|km|mi|0|}}, are three extensive, largely submerged [[Bank (topography)|banks]], which geographically are a southeast continuation of [[the Bahamas]]: [[Navidad Bank]], [[Silver Bank]], and [[Mouchoir Bank]]. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.

The Dominican Republic has four important mountain ranges. The most northerly is the ''Cordillera Septentrional'' ("Northern Mountain Range"), which extends from the northwestern coastal town of [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]], near the Haitian border, to the Samaná Peninsula in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast. The highest range in the Dominican Republic&nbsp;– indeed, in the whole of the West Indies&nbsp;– is the ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' ("Central Mountain Range"). It gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of [[Azua de Compostela|Azua]], on the Caribbean coast.

In the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: [[Pico Duarte]] ({{convert|3098|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level), La Pelona ({{convert|3094|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), La Rucilla ({{convert|3049|m|0|ft|0|disp=or}}) and Pico Yaque ({{convert|2760|m|ft|0|disp=or}}). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges. The more northerly of the two is the ''Sierra de Neiba'', while in the south the ''Sierra de Bahoruco'' is a continuation of the [[Massif de la Selle]] in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the ''Cordillera Oriental'' ("Eastern Mountain Range"), ''Sierra Martín García'', ''Sierra de Yamasá'' and ''Sierra de Samaná''.

[[File:Dominican landscape (3965528732).jpg|thumb|300px|A rural area of the eastern part of the Dominican Republic.]]

Between the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile [[Cibao]] valley. This major valley is home to the cities of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] and [[Concepción de La Vega|La Vega]], and most of the farming areas in the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land in the [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]] Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], [[Jarabacoa]], [[Villa Altagracia]], and [[Bonao]] valleys.

The ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' ("Caribbean Coastal Plain") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the [[savannah]]s that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to {{convert|10|km|mi}} as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the ''Plena de Azua'' ("Azua Plain"), a very arid region in [[Azua Province]]. A few other small coastal plains are in the northern coast and in the [[Pedernales Province|Pedernales]] Peninsula.

Four major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The [[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]] is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the [[Yuna River]] serves the Vega Real and empties into Samaná Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, [[tributary]] of the [[Yaque del Sur]], which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The [[Artibonite River|Artibonito]] is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.

There are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]], a [[salt lake]] at {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below sea level, the lowest point in the Caribbean. Other important lakes are Laguna de Rincón or Cabral, with [[freshwater]], and Laguna de Oviedo, a lagoon with [[brackish water]].

Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946 it suffered a magnitude 8.1 earthquake off the northeast coast. This triggered a [[tsunami]] that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. The wave was also recorded at Daytona Beach, Florida and Atlantic City, New Jersey. The area remains at risk. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems, and are mapping risk in low-lying areas.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Los Haitises Park.jpeg|thumb|300px|Los Haitises Park National Park.]]
The Dominican Republic is a [[tropical]], [[maritime nation]]. Due to its diverse topography, Dominican Republic's climate shows considerable variation over short distances and is the most varied of all the Antilles. The annual average temperature is {{convert|25|C|F}}. At higher elevations the temperature averages {{convert|18|C|F|1}} while near sea level the average temperature is {{convert|28|C|F|1}}. Low temperatures of {{convert|0|C|F}} are possible in the mountains while high temperatures of {{convert|40|C|F}} are possible in protected valleys. January and February are the coolest months of the year while August is the hottest month. Snowfall can be seen in rare occasions on the summit of [[Pico Duarte]].<ref name="DRcli"/>

The [[wet season]] along the northern coast lasts from November through January. Elsewhere the wet season stretches from May through November, with May being the wettest month. Average annual rainfall is {{convert|1500|mm|in|1}} countrywide, with individual locations in the Valle de Neiba seeing averages as low as {{convert|350|mm|in|1}} while the Cordillera Oriental averages {{convert|2740|mm|in|1}}. The driest part of the country lies in the west.<ref name="DRcli"/>

[[Tropical cyclones]] strike the Dominican Republic every couple of years, with 65% of the impacts along the southern coast. Hurricanes are most likely between August and October.<ref name="DRcli">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/19.htm|title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– Climate|author=[[United States Library of Congress]]|publisher=Country Studies US|date=May 24, 2007|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref> The last time a category 5 hurricane struck the country was [[Hurricane David]] in 1979.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

== Government and politics ==
[[File:National Palace Dominican Republic1.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[National Palace (Dominican Republic)|National Palace in Santo Domingo]].]]
{{Main|Government of the Dominican Republic}}
The Dominican Republic is a [[representative democracy]] or [[Democracy|democratic republic]],<ref name=embassy/><ref name="CIADemo"/><ref name=ussdnote/> with three branches of power: executive, [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[Judiciary|judicial]]. The [[President of the Dominican Republic]] heads the executive branch and executes laws passed by the [[Congress of the Dominican Republic|Congress]], appoints the Cabinet, and is commander in chief of the [[Military of the Dominican Republic|armed forces]]. The president and vice-president run for office on the same ticket and are elected by direct vote for 4-year terms. The national legislature is bicameral, composed of a [[Senate of the Dominican Republic|Senate]], which has 32 members, and the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic|Chamber of Deputies]], with 178 members.<ref name=ussdnote/>

Judicial authority rests with the [[Government of the Dominican Republic#Judicial branch|Supreme Court of Justice]]'s 16 members. They are appointed by a council composed of the President, the leaders of both houses of Congress, the President of the Supreme Court, and an opposition or non–governing-party member. The Court "alone hears actions against the president, designated members of his Cabinet, and members of Congress when the legislature is in session."<ref name=ussdnote/>

The Dominican Republic has a multi-party political system. Elections were held every two years, alternating between the [[Elections in the Dominican Republic|Presidential elections]], which are held in years evenly divisible by four, and the Congressional and municipal elections, which are held in even-numbered years not divisible by four. "International observers have found that presidential and congressional elections since 1996 have been generally free and fair."<ref name=ussdnote/> The Central Elections Board (JCE) of 9 members supervises elections, and its decisions are unappealable.<ref name=ussdnote/> Starting from 2016, elections will be held jointly, after a constitutional reform.<ref>{{cite web|title=FEDOMU aclara confusión sobre elecciones para el año 2016|url=http://www.elnuevodiario.com.do/app/article.aspx?id=289411|website=El Nuevo Diario|accessdate=July 19, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719002254/http://www.elnuevodiario.com.do/app/article.aspx?id=289411|archivedate=July 19, 2014|language=Spanish|date=June 8, 2012}}</ref>

=== Political culture ===
The three major parties are the conservative [[Social Christian Reformist Party]] (Spanish: Partido Reformista Social Cristiano [PRSC]), in power 1966–78 and 1986–96; the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]] (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Dominicano [PRD]), in power in 1963, 1978–86, and 2000–04; and the [[centrism|centrist]] [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[reformist]] [[Dominican Liberation Party]] (Spanish: Partido de la Liberación Dominicana [PLD]), in power 1996–2000 and since 2004.

{{Update|section|date=July 2015}}
The [[Dominican Republic presidential election, 2008|presidential elections of 2008]] were held on May 16, 2008, with incumbent Leonel Fernández winning with 53% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |title=Election propels Dominican president to third term |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/17/us-dominican-election-idUSN1638429020080517 |first=Tom |last=Brown |work=Reuters|date=May 17, 2008}}</ref> He defeated [[Miguel Vargas Maldonado]], of the PRD, who achieved a 40.48% share of the vote. [[Amable Aristy]], of the PRSC, achieved 4.59% of the vote. Other minority candidates, which includes former Attorney General [[Guillermo Moreno]] from the [[Movement for Independence, Unity and Change]] (Movimiento Independencia, Unidad y Cambio [MIUCA]) and PRSC former presidential candidate and defector [[Eduardo Estrella]] obtained less than 1% of the vote.

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Further|Foreign relations of the Dominican Republic}}

The Dominican Republic has a close relationship with the United States and with the other states of the Inter-American system. The Dominican Republic has very strong ties and relations with Puerto Rico, with Puerto Rico being the Dominican Republic's largest trading partner.

The Dominican Republic's [[Dominican Republic–Haiti relations|relationship with neighbouring Haiti]] is strained over mass Haitian migration to the Dominican Republic, with citizens of the Dominican Republic blaming the Haitians for increased crime and other social problems.<ref>[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/que-pasa/dr-haitians-get-lost DR to Haitians: get lost | GlobalPost<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Dominican Republic is a regular member of the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]].

=== Military ===
[[File:Two Commando soldiers of the MEFA provide security.jpg|thumb|300px|Dominican soldiers training in Santo Domingo.]]
{{Main|Military of the Dominican Republic}}
[[Congress of the Dominican Republic|Congress]] authorizes a combined military force of 44,000 active duty personnel. Actual active duty strength is approximately 32,000. Approximately 50% of those are used for non-military activities such as security providers for government-owned non-military facilities, highway toll stations, prisons, forestry work, state enterprises, and private businesses. The Commander in Chief of the military is the President.

The army is larger than the other services combined with approximately 20,000 active duty personnel, consisting of six infantry [[brigade]]s, a combat support brigade, and a combat service support brigade. The air force operates two main bases, one in the southern region near Santo Domingo and one in the northern region near Puerto Plata. The navy operates two major naval bases, one in Santo Domingo and one in Las Calderas on the southwestern coast, and maintains 12 operational vessels. The Dominican Republic has the second largest military in the Caribbean region after Cuba.<ref name=ussdnote/>

The armed forces have organized a Specialized Airport Security Corps (CESA) and a Specialized Port Security Corps (CESEP) to meet international security needs in these areas. The Secretary of the Armed Forces has also announced plans to form a specialized border corps (CESEF). The armed forces provide 75% of personnel to the National Investigations Directorate (DNI) and the Counter-Drug Directorate (DNCD).<ref name=ussdnote/>

The Dominican National Police force contains 32,000 agents. The police are not part of the Dominican armed forces, but share some overlapping security functions. Sixty-three percent of the force serve in areas outside traditional police functions, similar to the situation of their military counterparts.<ref name=ussdnote/>

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Provinces of the Dominican Republic|Municipalities of the Dominican Republic}}
The Dominican Republic is divided into 31 [[Provinces of the Dominican Republic|provinces]]. Santo Domingo, the capital, is designated [[Distrito Nacional]] (National District). The provinces are divided into municipalities (''[[municipio]]s''; singular ''municipio''). They are the second-level political and [[Administrative division|administrative subdivisions]] of the country. The president appoints the governors of the 31 provinces. Mayors and municipal councils administer the 124 municipal districts and the National District (Santo Domingo). They are elected at the same time as congressional representatives.<ref name=ussdnote/>

The Dominican Republic's economy is primarily dependent upon natural resources and government services. Although the service sector has recently overtaken mining and agriculture as the leading employer of Dominicans (due principally to growth in tourism and [[Free Trade Zones]]), agriculture remains the most important sector in terms of domestic consumption and is in second place behind mining in terms of export earnings. The service sector in general has experienced growth in recent years, as has construction. Free Trade Zone earnings and tourism are the fastest-growing export sectors. Real estate tourism alone accounted for $1.5 billion in earnings for 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/economy/2007/7/19/24747/Dominican-real-estate-tourism-boom-US15-billion-in-2007-US30-billion |title=Dominican real estate tourism boom: US$1.5 billion in 2007, US$3.0 billion in 3 years |accessdate=June 10, 2008 |publisher=Dominican Today |date=July 19, 2007}}</ref> [[Remittances]] in Dominican Republic increased to 4571.30 USD Million in 2014 from 3333 USD Million in 2013(according to data reported by the Inter-American Development Bank).

Following economic turmoil in the late 1980s and 1990, during which the gross domestic product (GDP) fell by up to 5% and consumer price inflation reached an unprecedented 100%, the Dominican Republic entered a period of growth and declining inflation until 2002, after which the economy entered a [[recession]].<ref name=ussdnote/>

This recession followed the collapse of the second-largest [[commercial bank]] in the country, [[Banco Intercontinental|Baninter]], linked to a major incident of fraud valued at $3.5 billion. The Baninter fraud had a devastating effect on the Dominican economy, with GDP dropping by 1% in 2003 as inflation ballooned by over 27%.

According to the 2005 Annual Report of the United Nations Subcommittee on Human Development in the Dominican Republic, the country is ranked No. 71 in the world for resource availability, No. 79 for human development, and No. 14 in the world for resource mismanagement. These statistics emphasize national government corruption, foreign economic interference in the country, and the rift between the rich and poor.

The Dominican Republic has a noted problem of child labor in its coffee, rice, sugarcane, and tomato industries.<ref>{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/PDF/2011TVPRA.pdf|title=List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor|work=U.S. Department of Labor|year=2011|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115034958/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/PDF/2011TVPRA.pdf|archive-date=January 15, 2014}}</ref> The labor injustices in the sugarcane industry extend to forced labor according to the US [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]].

=== Currency ===
The [[Dominican peso]] (DOP, or RD$)<ref name=XE/> is the national currency, with the United States dollars (USD), the Canadian dollar (CAD) and euros (EUR) also accepted at most tourist sites. Americans traveling to the Dominican Republic have a very good exchange rate.

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Punta Cana.jpg|thumb|300px|A beach in [[Punta Cana]].]]
Tourism is fueling the Dominican Republic's economic growth. The Dominican Republic is the most popular tourist destination in the Caribbean. With the construction of projects like [[Cap Cana]], San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, and the Moon Palace Resort in [[Punta Cana]], the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.

[[Ecotourism]] has also been a topic increasingly important in this nation, with towns like [[Jarabacoa]] and neighboring [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], and locations like the [[Pico Duarte]], [[Bahia de las Aguilas]] and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries [[Visa policy of the Dominican Republic|are required to get a tourist card]], depending on the country they live in.

The Dominican Republic has Latin America's third best transportation infrastructure.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are [[DR-1]], [[DR-2]], and [[DR-3]], which depart from Santo Domingo towards the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur ([[DR-5]]) or alternate routes ([[DR-4]]).

In addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Samaná Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa&nbsp;– Constanza) and [[DR-12]] (Constanza&nbsp;– Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the [[Santiago light rail]] system is in planning stages and currently on hold.

=== Bus service ===
There are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina Técnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA); and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federación Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opción (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.

There are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Turísticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.

=== Santo Domingo Metro ===
[[File:Stodgo metro.jpg|thumb|300px|A pair of 9000 series are tested on the Santo Domingo Metro.]]
The Dominican government has put effort towards providing efficient public transportation with the construction of the [[Santo Domingo Metro]], the first mass transit system in the country. The metro is currently the largest in the Caribbean region by length and number of stations.

=== Communications ===
{{Main|Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic}}
The Dominican Republic has a well-developed telecommunications infrastructure, with extensive mobile phone and [[landline]] services. [[Cable Internet access|Cable Internet]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] are available in most parts of the country, and many [[Internet service provider]]s offer [[3G]] wireless internet service. The Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service. The reported speeds are from 256 kbit/s / 128 kbit/s for residential services, up to 5 Mbit/s / 1 Mbit/s for residential service.

For commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes [[Cable Internet access|downstream/upstream speed]]; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend [[Wi-Fi]] hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the [[Data transmission|digital spectrum]], via [[HD Radio]] and [[High-definition television|HDTV]] after officially adopting [[Advanced Television Systems Committee standards|ATSC]] as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015. The telecommunications regulator in the country is INDOTEL (''Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones'').

The largest telecommunications company is [[Claro República Dominicana|Claro]]&nbsp;– part of [[Carlos Slim]]'s [[América Móvil]]&nbsp;– which provides wireless, landline, broadband, and [[IPTV]] services. In June 2009 there were more than 8 million phone line subscribers (land and cell users) in the D.R., representing 81% of the country's population and a fivefold increase since the year 2000, when there were 1.6 million. The communications sector generates about 3.0% of the GDP.<ref name=LD2009-06-05/> There were 2,439,997 Internet users in March 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indotel.gob.do/component/option,com_docman/task,cat_view/gid,110/Itemid,757|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226134642/http://www.indotel.gob.do/component/option,com_docman/task,cat_view/gid,110/Itemid,757|archivedate=February 26, 2011|title=Indicadores Telefonicos 2009 |accessdate=June 5, 2009 |work=Indotel}}</ref>

In November 2009, the Dominican Republic became the first Latin American country to pledge to include a "gender perspective" in every information and communications technology (ICT) initiative and policy developed by the government.<ref>[http://elnuevodiario.com.do/app/article.aspx?id=175919 Indotel garantiza igualdad de género en proyectos tecnológicos realiza en todo el país]. elnuevodiario.com.do.

The tool the Dominicans have chosen to design and evaluate all the public policies is the APC [[Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM)]].

=== Electricity ===
{{Main|Electricity sector in the Dominican Republic}}
Electric power service has been unreliable since the Trujillo era, and as much as 75% of the equipment is that old. The country's antiquated power grid causes transmission losses that account for a large share of billed electricity from generators. The privatization of the sector started under a previous administration of Leonel Fernández.<ref name=coha>{{cite web |url=http://www.coha.org/2004/10/president-leonel-fernandez-friend-or-foe-of-reform |title=Council On Hemispheric Affairs COHA |accessdate=October 4, 2004 |work=Leonel Fernández}}</ref> The recent investment in a "Santo Domingo-Santiago Electrical Highway" to carry 345&nbsp;kW power,<ref name=DT2009-04-29/> with reduced losses in transmission, is being heralded as a major capital improvement to the national grid since the mid-1960s.

During the Trujillo regime electrical service was introduced to many cities. Almost 95% of usage was not billed at all. Around half of the Dominican Republic's 2.1 million houses have no meters and most do not pay or pay a fixed monthly rate for their electric service.<ref name=DT2006-06-01/>

Household and general electrical service is delivered at 110 [[volt]]s alternating at 60&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]]. Electrically powered items from the United States work with no modifications. The majority of the Dominican Republic has access to electricity. Tourist areas tend to have more reliable power, as do business, travel, healthcare, and vital infrastructure.<ref>[http://www.cdeee.gov.do/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=791:edesur-agrega-3500-familias-a-24-horas-de-luz&catid=6:noticias&Itemid=2 EDESUR agrega 3,500 familias a 24 Horas de Luz].

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in the Dominican Republic}}
The Dominican Republic has achieved impressive increases in access to [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] over the past two decades. However, the quality of water supply and sanitation services remains poor, despite the country's high economic growth during the 1990s.
Although the coverage of [[improved water source]]s and [[improved sanitation]] is with 86% respectively 83% relatively high, there are substantial regional differences. Poor households exhibit lower levels of access: only 56% of poor households are connected to water house connections as opposed to 80% of non-poor households. Just 20% of poor households have access to sewers, as opposed to 50% for the non-poor.<ref name=CEA>World Bank:[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/06/4935212/dominican-republic-environmental-priorities-strategic-options-country-environmental-analysis Dominican Republic - Environmental priorities and strategic options: Country environmental analysis], 2004</ref>

The Dominican Republic has two patroness saints: ''Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia'' (Our Lady Of High Grace) and ''Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes'' (Our Lady Of Mercy).

The Catholic Church began to lose popularity in the late 19th century. This was due to a lack of funding, of priests, and of support programs. During the same time, the Protestant [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement began to gain support. Religious tension between Catholics and Protestants in the country has been rare.

The Dominican Republic has historically granted extensive religious freedom. In the 1950s restrictions were placed upon churches by the government of Trujillo. Letters of protest were sent against the mass arrests of government adversaries. Trujillo began a campaign against the Catholic Church and planned to arrest priests and bishops who preached against the government. This campaign ended before it was put into place, with his assassination.

During World War II a group of Jews escaping [[Nazi Germany]] fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the city of [[Sosúa]]. It has remained the center of the Jewish population since.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Haggerty|title=Dominican Republic: A Country Study: Religion|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|year=1989|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/33.htm|accessdate=May 21, 2006}}</ref>

Haiti is the neighboring nation to the Dominican Republic, making Hispaniola the only island in the world that houses two sovereign and independent nations. Haiti is considerably poorer and less developed, and is the least developed country in the western hemisphere. In 2003, 80% of all Haitians were poor (54% living in abject poverty) and 47.1% were illiterate. The country of nine million people also has a fast-growing population, but over two-thirds of the labor force lack formal jobs. Haiti's per capita GDP (PPP) was $1,300 in 2008, or less than one-sixth of the Dominican figure.<ref name="CIADemo"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html |title=CIA&nbsp;– The World Factbook&nbsp;– Haiti |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}</ref>

Due to the lack of basic amenities and medical facilities in Haiti a large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil. They deliberately come during their last weeks of pregnancy to obtain medical attention for childbirth, since Dominican public hospitals do not refuse medical services based on nationality or legal status. Statistics from a hospital in Santo Domingo report that over 22% of childbirths are by Haitian mothers.<ref name=LD2008-01-21/>

Haiti also [[Environmental issues in Haiti|suffers from severe environmental degradation]]. Deforestation is rampant in Haiti, today less than 4 percent of Haiti’s forests remain, and in many places the soil has eroded right down to the bedrock.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dirt Poor&nbsp;— Haiti has lost its soil and the means to feed itself.|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/soil/bourne-text}}</ref> Haitians burn wood charcoal for 60% of their domestic energy production. Because of Haiti running out of plant material to burn, Haitians have created an illegal market for coal on the Dominican side.

=== Emigration ===
{{Main|Dominican American|Dominican Republic immigration to Puerto Rico}}
The first of three late-20th century emigration waves began in 1961 after the assassination of dictator Trujillo,<ref name=Wilderotter/> due to fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies and political uncertainty in general.

Preschool education is organized in different cycles and serves the 2-4 age group and the 4-6 age group. Preschool education is not mandatory except for the last year. Basic education is compulsory, and serves the population of the 6-14 age group. Secondary education is not compulsory, although it is the duty of the state to offer it for free. It caters to the 14-18 age group and is organized in a common core of four years and three modes of two years of study are offered in three different options: general or academic, vocational (industrial, agricultural and services) and artistic.

The higher education system comprises institutes and universities. The institutes offer courses of a higher technical level. The universities offer technical careers, undergraduate and graduate; these are regulated by the Ministry Higher Education, Science and Technology.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ley 139-01  de Educación Superior, Ciencia y Tecnología|url=http://www.seescyt.gov.do/baseconocimiento/Leyes%20y%20reglamentos/Ley139-01%20Educaci%C3%B3n%20Superior.pdf}}</ref>

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Yoryi Morel 02.jpg|thumb|200px|Campesino cibaeño, 1941 (Museo de Arte Moderno, Santo Domingo).]]

The culture and people of the Dominican Republic are a mixture of the cultures of the Spaniard colonists, African slaves, and Taíno natives. European, African and Taíno cultural elements are most prominent in food, family structure, religion and music. Many Arawak/Taíno names and words are used in daily conversation and for many foods native to the Dominican Republic.<ref name="CIADemo"/>

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Parque Central Puerto Plata.jpg|thumb|300px|Center of Puerto Plata.]]
The architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the [[Europe]]an colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and [[baroque architecture|baroque]] structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]], which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the [[Americas]], located in the city's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], an area declared as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/526 Colonial City of Santo Domingo&nbsp;– UNESCO World Heritage Centre<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.unesco.org/nac/geoportal.php?country=DO&language=S UNESCO around the World | República Dominicana<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.

The indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The [[Taíno]] people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees give buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island’s surroundings.

Lately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now began to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasized luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implemented new styles, while still offering new takes on the old. This new style is characterized by simplified, angular corners, and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic’s rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Taino hammock in the bedroom balcony.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Cuisine of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Patacones.JPG|thumb|Tostones, a fried plantain dish.]]
Dominican cuisine is predominantly Spanish, Taíno, and African. The typical cuisine is quite similar to what can be found in other Latin American countries, but many of the names of dishes are different. One breakfast dish consists of eggs and ''[[Mangú (dish)|mangú]]'' (mashed, boiled plantain). For heartier versions, ''mangú'' is accompanied by deep-fried meat (Dominican salami, typically) and/or cheese. Similarly to Spain, lunch is generally the largest and most important meal of the day. Lunch usually consists of rice, meat (such as chicken, beef, pork, or fish), beans, and a side portion of salad. "La Bandera" (literally "The Flag") is the most popular lunch dish; it consists of meat and red beans on white rice. ''[[Sancocho]]'' is a stew often made with seven varieties of meat.

Meals are mostly split into three courses throughout the day like in any other country. You have breakfast which can be served between 8-9am. Then you have lunch, which is usually the heaviest meal course of the day which is usually served at noon sharp. The last meal of the day which is dinner is usually served by 5:30-6PM.

Meals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with ''[[sofrito]]'', which is a mix of local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and sautéed to bring out all of a dish's flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, [[bulgur]], or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in [[Tabbouleh|''quipes'' or ''tipili'']] (bulgur salad). Other favorite Dominican foods are ''[[chicharrón]]'', ''[[Cassava|yuca]]'', ''[[Tapioca|casabe]]'', ''[[Cuban pastry|pastelitos]]''<!--really?--> ([[empanada]]s), ''[[Sweet potato|batata]]'', [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], ''[[Pasteles|pasteles en hoja]]'', ''[[chimichurris]]'', ''[[tostones]]''.

Some treats Dominicans enjoy are ''[[Rice pudding|arroz con leche]]'' (or ''arroz con dulce''), ''bizcocho dominicano'' (lit. Dominican cake), ''[[habichuelas con dulce]]'', [[flan]], ''[[Snow cone|frío frío]]'' (snow cones), [[dulce de leche]], and ''caña'' ([[sugarcane]]). The beverages Dominicans enjoy include ''[[Morir Soñando]]'', [[rum]], beer, ''[[Mama Juana]]'', ''batida'' (smoothie), jugos naturales (freshly squeezed fruit juices), ''[[Mauby|mabí]]'', coffee, and ''[[chaca (dessert)|chaca]]'' (also called ''maiz caqueao/casqueado'', ''maiz con dulce'' and ''maiz con leche''), the last item being only found in the southern provinces of the country such as San Juan.

=== Music and dance ===
{{Main|Music of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Merengue dancing.jpg|thumb|150px|Merengue dance.]]
Musically, the Dominican Republic is known for the creation of the musical style and genre called ''[[Merengue music|merengue]]'',<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|376–7}} a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (though it varies) based on musical elements like drums, brass, chorded instruments, and accordion, as well as some elements unique to the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, such as the ''[[tambora (Dominican drum)|tambora]]'' and ''[[güira]]''.

Its [[Syncopation|syncopated beats]] use [[Latin percussion]], [[brass instruments]], bass, and piano or keyboard. Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominicans groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron "Los Reyes del Merengue", Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well-known merengue performers include [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Johnny Ventura]], singer/songwriter [[Los Hermanos Rosario]], [[Juan Luis Guerra]], [[Fernando Villalona]], [[Eddy Herrera]], [[Sergio Vargas]], [[Toño Rosario]], [[Milly Quezada]], and [[Chichí Peralta]].

Merengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], during the 1980s and 1990s,<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|375}} when many Dominican artists, among them Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos, residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. The emergence of ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] groups in New York, [[New Jersey]], and Florida have contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|378}}

[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was ''amargue'' ("bitterness", or "bitter music", or blues music), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the [[Pan-Latinism|pan-Latin]] American romantic style called ''[[bolero]]''. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.

[[Palo music|Palo]] is an [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|Afro-Dominican]] sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies—usually coinciding with saint's religious feast days—as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the [[Congo region]] of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies.<ref>[http://www.iasorecords.com/music/palo-drum-afro-dominican-tradition Palo Drum: Afro-Dominican Tradition]. iasorecords.com</ref>

[[Salsa music]] has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like [[Johnny Pacheco]], creator of the [[Fania All Stars]], played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.

[[Dominican rock]] is also popular. Many, if not the majority, of its performers are based in Santo Domingo and Santiago.

=== Fashion ===
[[File:Oscar de la Renta by foto di matti.jpg|thumb|150px|Dominican native, fashion designer and perfume maker [[Oscar de la Renta]].]]

The Dominican Republic's [[fashion week]] has become the most important event of its kind in all of the Caribbean and one of the fastest-growing fashion events in the entire Latin American fashion world. The country boasts one of the ten most important design schools in the region, La Escuela de Diseño de Altos de Chavón, which is making the country a key player in the world of fashion and design.

World famous fashion designer [[Oscar de la Renta]] was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932, and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]] and then worked with the house of [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]] in Paris. Then by 1963, de la Renta had designs carrying his own label. After establishing himself in the US, de la Renta opened boutiques across the country. His work blends French and Spaniard fashion with American styles.<ref>[http://www.wcax.com/story/7036793/fashion-oscar-de-la-renta-dominican-republic Fashion: Oscar de la Renta (Dominican Republic)] WCAX.com&nbsp;– Retrieved October 31, 2012.</ref><ref name="britannica de la renta">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/764644/Oscar-de-la-Renta Oscar de la Renta]. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Retrieved October 31, 2012.</ref> Although he settled in New York, de la Renta also marketed his work in Latin America, where it became very popular, and remained active in his native Dominican Republic, where his charitable activities and personal achievements earned him the Juan Pablo Duarte Order of Merit and the Order of Cristóbal Colón.<ref name="britannica de la renta"/> De la Renta died of complications from cancer on October 20, 2014.

=== National symbols ===
Some of the important symbols include the [[flag of the Dominican Republic|flag]], [[Coat of arms of the Dominican Republic|the coat of arms]], and the national anthem, titled ''[[National Anthem of the Dominican Republic|Himno Nacional]]''. The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternate interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.<ref>
{{cite web |url=http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113181033/http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archivedate=January 13, 2009 |title=Ejército Nacional de la República Dominicana&nbsp;– Bandera Nacional |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |publisher=National Army of the Dominican Republic |language=Spanish}}
</ref>

In the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a red, white and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible, a gold cross and arrows; the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a palm branch (on the right). The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The Gold Cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, "Dios, Patria, Libertad" (meaning "God, Fatherland, Liberty"). A red ribbon under the shield reads, "República Dominicana" (meaning "Dominican Republic"). Out of all the flags in the world, the depiction of a Bible is unique to the Dominican flag.
