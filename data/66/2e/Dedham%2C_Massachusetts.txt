{{DedhamHistory}}
'''Dedham''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|d|əm}} is a [[New England town|town]] in and the [[county seat]] of [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]].<ref name="GR6"/> The population was 24,729 at the 2010 census.<ref name="2010census"/> It is located on [[Boston]]'s southwest border. On the northwest it is bordered by [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], on the southwest by [[Westwood, Massachusetts|Westwood]] and on the southeast by [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Dedham, Massachusetts, 1635–1792|History of Dedham, Massachusetts, 1793–1999|History of Dedham, Massachusetts, 2000–present|History of Dedham, Massachusetts in television and film}}
Settled in 1635 by people from Roxbury and Watertown, Dedham was incorporated in 1636. It became the [[county seat]] of [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] when the county formed on March 26, 1793. When the Town was originally incorporated, the residents wanted to name it Contentment. The [[Massachusetts General Court]] overruled them and named the town after [[Dedham, Essex]] in England, where some of the original inhabitants were born.

At the first public meeting on August 15, 1636, eighteen men signed the town covenant. They swore that they would "in the fear and reverence of our Almighty God, mutually and severally promise amongst ourselves and each to profess and practice one truth according to that most perfect rule, the foundation whereof is ever lasting love."

They also agreed that "we shall by all means labor to keep off from us all such as are contrary minded, and receive only such unto us as may be probably of one heart with us, [and such] as that we either know or may well and truly be informed to walk in a peaceable conversation with all meekness of spirit, [this] for the edification of each other in the knowledge and faith of the Lord Jesus…" The covenant also stipulated that if differences were to arise between townsmen, they would seek arbitration for resolution and each would pay his fair share for the common good.

In November 1798, [[David Brown (Massachusetts)|David Brown]] led a group in Dedham protesting the federal government; they set up a [[liberty pole]], as people had before the [[American Revolution]]. It carried the words, "No [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], No [[Alien and Sedition Acts|Sedition Act]], No [[Alien and Sedition Acts|Alien Bills]], No Land Tax, downfall to the Tyrants of America; peace and retirement to the President; Long Live the Vice President," referring to then-President [[John Adams]] and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]].{{sfn|Stone|2004|p=64}}{{sfn|Tise|p=420|1998}}{{sfn|Curtis|2000|p=88}} Brown was arrested in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]] but because he could not afford the $4,000 bail, he was taken to [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] for trial.{{sfn|Tise|p=421|1998}} Brown was tried in June 1799.{{sfn|Stone|2004|p=64}} Although he wanted to plead guilty, Justice [[Samuel Chase]] urged him to name those who had helped him or subscribed to his writings in exchange for freedom.{{sfn|Stone|2004|p=64}} Brown refused, was fined $480,{{sfn|Tise|1998}}{{sfn|Simon|2003|p=55}} and sentenced to eighteen months in prison. It was the most severe sentence up to then imposed under the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]].{{sfn|Stone|2004|p=64}}{{sfn|Tise|p=421|1998}}

Dedham is home to the [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]], the oldest surviving timber-frame house in the United States, scientifically dated to 1637. On January 1, 1643, by unanimous vote, Dedham <!--freeman (freemen, surely?) --> authorized the first taxpayer-funded [[Public school (government funded)|public school]], "the seed of American education."<ref name=Sacchetti/> Its first schoolmaster, Rev. [[Ralph Wheelock]], a [[Clare College]] graduate, was paid 20&nbsp;pounds annually to instruct the youth of the community. Descendants of these students would become presidents of [[Dartmouth College]], [[Yale University]] and [[Harvard University]].

The first man-made [[canal]] in North America, [[Mother Brook]], was created in Dedham in 1639. It linked the [[Charles River]] to the [[Neponset River]]. Although both are slow-moving rivers, they are at different elevations. The difference in elevation made the canal's current swift enough to power several local mills.

In 1818, though citizens were still taxed for the support of ministers and other "public teachers of religion", Dedham set a precedent toward the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]]. Residents selected a minister different than that chosen by the church selectmen; their right of selection was confirmed by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Judicial Court]]. The shift in power to the congregation led to the rise of the [[Congregational Church]]es.

The local [[Endicott Estate]] burned to the ground in 1904 after the local volunteer fire department, responding to three separate fires burning simultaneously, reached the Endicott fire last. By the time they arrived, only ashes remained. It is said that the estate's owner, Henry Bradford Endicott (also founder of the [[Endicott Johnson Corporation]]) took the burning of the homestead as a divine command to rebuild (which he did). The rebuilt Endicott Estate is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The estate and surrounding grounds are open to the public, upholding Henry's stepdaughter Katherine's wish to use the house and property for "educational, civic, social and recreational purposes."

In 1921, the historic [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] trial was held in the Norfolk County Courthouse in Dedham.<ref name=Bolton/>

[[Dedham Pottery]] is a cherished class of antiques, characterized by a distinctive crackle glaze, blue-and-white color scheme, and a frequent motif of rabbits and other animals. Dedham is sometimes called the "mother of towns" because 14 present-day communities were included within its original broad borders.

==Geography==
Dedham is located at {{Coord|42|14|40|N|71|9|55|W|type:city}} (42.244609, −71.165531).<ref name="GR1"/> On the northeast corner of High Street and Court Street the U.S. Coast & Geodetic Survey, now the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]], has placed a small medallion into a granite block showing an elevation of {{nowrap|112.288&nbsp;feet}}.

Dedham is made up of a number of neighborhoods:
* In the geographical center of town is '''Oakdale'''. It is roughly confined by East Street to the west, Cedar Street to the south and east, and Whiting Ave to the north.  The houses in the area around Woodleigh Road, which was declared to be one of the best streets in Greater Boston, have many homes designed by [[Henry Bailey Alden]], who also designed the [[Endicott Estate]].<ref name=top/>  Nearby the subdivision consisting of Morse Avenue, Fulton Street, and Edison Avenue, is named Whiting Park.<ref name="whiting park"/>

==Seal and flag==
[[File:Dedham flag.JPG|250px|right|thumb|The Town of Dedham's flag]]
The town's seal was originally designed by a member of the Dedham Historical Society and has several features.<ref name=norfolk/>  In the center is a crest containing the Old [[Avery Oak]].<ref name=norfolk/> When the tree was finally felled the gavel used by the [[Moderator (town official)|Moderator]] at [[Town Meeting]] was carved out of it.<ref name=DHSJan05/> Above the tree are the scales of justice, representing Dedham as the county seat and home to [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]]'s courts.<ref name=norfolk/> On the left of the tree are agricultural instruments and on the right is a factory, showing Dedham's history first as a town of farmers and then a one with a number of mills and factories, particularly along [[Mother Brook]].<ref name=norfolk/> Below the tree is a banner with the word "Contentment," the name of the original plantation.<ref name=norfolk/>

The town flag is red with the seal prominent and in the center. In the lower left corner is part of the [[Avery Oak]] and in the lower right is part of the [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]]. It hangs in the [[selectmen]]'s chambers at town hall and in the Great Hall of the [[Massachusetts State House]].

==Government==
A charter adopted in 1998 lays out the basic structure of the Town government, although it has been amended occasionally over the years.  A seven-member Charter Advisory Committee, appointed in 2012, recommended six substantial changes and numerous minor changes be made to the document.  The Selectmen consolidated them into six articles for Town Meeting's consideration, and five were presented to the Meeting in 2013.  Voters approved four of them in 2014.  A version of the sixth and final proposal was adopted at the Spring 2014 Annual Town Meeting.

===Town Meeting===
According to Dedham's [http://dedham-ma.gov/index.cfm?pid=13072 Charter], the "administration of all the fiscal, prudential, and municipal affairs of the town, with the government thereof, shall be vested in a legislative branch, to consist of a [[representative town meeting]]." Town Meeting is to consist of no less than 270 members, but not more than necessary to achieve an equal number coming from each precinct.  There are currently seven districts, but could be as few as six or as many as nine, with lines drawn by the Board of Selectmen and the Registrars of Voters every ten years.

Votes are by voice unless members call for a standing or [[roll call vote]], either of which can be called for by the Moderator. All Town officers are required to attend Town Meeting and multiple member bodies must send at least one representative who have all the privileges of a Member except the right to vote.  If 5% of Town voters petition the Board of Selectmen within 14 days of Town Meeting any action taken may be submitted to voters. The final result is to be determined by majority vote, but Town Meeting can not be overruled unless 20% of registered voters participate.

Town Meeting sets its own rules and keeps a journal of proceedings.  The Town Meeting may establish various ad-hoc and standing committees on which any Town Meeting Member or voter may serve.

====Town Meeting members====
Currently Town Meeting consists of 273 members, or representatives, with each of the seven districts, or precincts, electing 39. Thirteen are elected from each precinct each year and serve a three-year term. Each precinct elects from its own members a Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Secretary.

To be eligible, candidates must have 10 registered voters from their precinct sign nomination papers. Town Meeting Members can not serve on any other elected board or on the [[Board of Finance|Finance Committee]]. Members who move from the district or are removed by [[redistricting]] may serve until the next Town Election, however any member who moves out of the Town immediately ceases to be a Member.

In case of a vacancy, the remaining term is to be filled at the next town election. If no election is to take place within 120 days of the vacancy then the district chairman is to call together the members of the district and they are to elect a member who will serve until the next town election.

====Warrant====
The Warrant at Town Meeting includes the articles to be voted on. Any elected or appointed board, committee, town officer, or any ten voters may place an article on the warrant. Each article to be voted on is directed by the Board of Selectmen to an appropriate board or committee to hear and provide the original motion at Town Meeting. All articles expending funds are directed to the Finance Committee; articles dealing with planning and zoning to the Planning Board; articles relating to by-laws to the By-Law Committee.  The Finance Committee recommendation has the force of the original motion on all articles except those related to zoning.  The Planning Board makes the original motion for those.

====Mini Town Meeting====
While it is not called for in the Charter, there is a tradition in Dedham for the Chairmen of the several districts to elect from amongst themselves a chairman. This Chairman of the Chairmen hosts what is officially known as the District Chairmen's Warrant Review Meeting but is much more commonly referred to as Mini Town Meeting. The "Mini" is generally one week before the actual Town Meeting. The purpose of the Mini is to air out several of the contentious issues before bringing them to the floor of Town Meeting.

===Board of Selectmen===
The executive branch of the Town Government is "headed" by a Board of Selectmen.  The Board of Selectmen have five members who are elected for three-year terms and are the chief policy making body for the town. They appoint a Town Manager who runs the day-to-day affairs of the Town. They also appoint constables, registrars of voters and other election officers, the board of appeals, conservation commission, historic district commission, and members of several other multiple member boards.

They set policy for all departments below it, but are not involved in the day-to-day affairs of the Town. They issue licenses and can investigate the affairs and the conduct of any town agency.

===Town Clerk===
The Elected Town Clerk serves a three-year term and works full-time for the Town. The Clerk is "the keeper of vital statistics of the town and the custodian of the town seal and all public records, administer[s] the oaths of office to all town officers... [and is] the clerk of the town meeting." In the role as clerk of town meeting he notifies the public and members of the Town Meeting and keeps a verbatim record of proceedings.

===Town Moderator===
Town Meetings are presided over by the Town Moderator, but he has no vote unless all the Members present and voting are equally divided. At the first Town Meeting following the annual town election he is to appoint, subject to Town Meeting's confirmation, a Deputy Moderator from the elected Members. The Deputy serves in case of the Moderator's absence or disability.

===Other boards and committees===
The seven members of the School Committee are elected for three-year terms and appoint a Superintendent of Schools. They also set policy for the School Department.

The three elected members of the Board of Assessors serve three-year terms and annually make a fair cash valuation of all property within the town.

The three elected members of the Board of Health are responsible for the formulation and enforcement of rules and regulations affecting the environment and the public health.

The Board of Library Trustees has five members, each of whom serve three-year terms, and have care of the Town's [http://www.dedhamlibrary.org public library at the Endicott Branch and Main Branch]. They are responsible for all library policy, the library budget, and hiring and firing the library director.

The five elected members of the Planning Board make studies and prepare plans concerning the resources, possibilities and needs of the town. It also prepares the Master Plan.

There are five elected Commissioners of the Trust Funds who manage and control all funds left, given, bequeathed or devised to the town, and distribute the income in accordance with the terms of the respective trusts.

There are five members of the Housing Authority. Four are elected by the Town and one is appointed by the Commonwealth Commissioner of Community Affairs. As a Board they have all of the powers and duties which are given to housing authorities under the constitution and laws of the Commonwealth.
