It is a [[thermosetting plastic|thermosetting]] [[phenol formaldehyde resin]], formed from a [[condensation reaction]] of [[phenol]] with [[formaldehyde]]. It was developed by [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]]-born chemist [[Leo Baekeland]] in [[New York]] in 1907.

One of the first [[plastics]] made from synthetic components, Bakelite was used for its electrical [[nonconductor|nonconductivity]] and heat-resistant properties in electrical [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]], radio and telephone casings, and such diverse products as [[kitchenware]], [[jewelry]], pipe stems, children's [[toy]]s, and [[firearms]].

==History==
Baekeland was already wealthy, due to his invention of Velox photographic paper, when he began to investigate the reactions of phenol and formaldehyde in his home laboratory. Chemists had begun to recognize that many natural resins and fibres were [[polymer]]s.  Baekeland's initial intent was to find a replacement for [[shellac]], a material that was in limited supply because it was made naturally from the excretion of [[lac]] [[Kerria lacca|bugs]]. Baekeland produced a soluble phenol-formaldehyde shellac called "Novolak", but it was not a market success.<ref name="Landmark"/>

Baekeland then began trying to strengthen wood by impregnating it with a synthetic resin, rather than coating it.<ref name="Landmark"/>  By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to [[phenol]] and [[formaldehyde]], Baekeland produced a hard moldable material which he named "Bakelite".<ref name="time" >{{cite news

[[File:First Semi-commercial Bakelizer 1935 Bakelite Review Silver Anniversary p6.tif | thumb|right | The first semi-commercial Bakelizer, from Baekeland's laboratory]]

Baekeland started semi-commercial production of his new material in his home laboratory, marketing it as a material for electrical insulators. By 1910, he was producing enough material to justify expansion.  He formed the General Bakelite Company as a U.S. company to manufacture and market his new industrial material. He also made overseas connections to produce materials in other countries.<ref name="Landmark"/>

Bijker gives a detailed discussion of the development of Bakelite and the Bakelite Company's production of various applications of materials.<ref name="Bijker"/> As of 1911, the company's main focus was laminating varnish, whose sales volume vastly outperformed both molding material and cast resin. By 1912, molding material was gaining ground, but its sales volume for the company did not exceed that of laminating varnish until the 1930s.

As the sales figures also show, the Bakelite Company produced "Transparent" cast resin (which did not include filler) for a small ongoing market during the 1910s and 1920s.<ref name="Bijker"/>{{rp|172–174}}  Blocks or rods of cast resin, also known as "artificial amber", were machined and carved to create items such as pipe stems, cigarette holders and jewelry.<ref name="Bijker"/><ref name=Ellis2>{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Carleton|title=Synthetic resins and their plastics|date=1923|publisher=The Chemical Catalog Co.|location=New York|pages=164–165}}</ref> However, the demand for molded plastics led the Bakelite Company to concentrate on molding, rather than developing market opportunities for cast resins.<ref name="Bijker">{{cite book|chapter=The Fourth Kingdom: The Social Construction of Bakelite|pages=101–198|last1=Bijker|first1=Wiebe E.|title=Of bicycles, bakelites, and bulbs : toward a theory of sociotechnical change|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262522274|edition=1st MIT Press pbk|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsbmwN8-m1cC&pg=PA138|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>{{rp|172–174}}

The first issue of ''Plastics'' magazine, October 1925, featured Bakelite on its cover, and included the article "Bakelite -- What It Is" by Allan Brown.  The range of colors available included "black, brown, red, yellow, green, gray, blue, and blends of two or more of these".<ref name=PlasticsCover>{{cite journal|title=Cover Illustration|journal=Plastics|date=1925|volume=1|issue=1}}</ref> The article emphasized that Bakelite came in various forms. "Bakelite is manufactured in several forms to suit varying requirements.  In all these forms the fundamental basis is the initial Bakelite resin.  This variety includes Clear Material, for jewelry, smokers' articles, etc.; cement, using in sealing electric light bulbs in metal bases; varnishes, for impregnating electric coils, etc.; lacquers, for protecting the surface of hardware; enamels, for giving resistive coating to industrial equipment; Laminated Bakelite, used for silent gears and insulation; and molding material, from which are formed innumerable articles of utility and beauty.  The Molding Material is prepared ordinarily by the impregnation of cellulose substances with the initial 'uncured' resin."<ref name=PlasticsArticle/>{{rp|17}} In a 1925 report, the United States Tariff Commission hailed the commercial manufacture of synthetic phenolic resin as "distinctly an American achievement", and noted that "the publication of figures, however, would be a virtual disclosure of the production of an individual company."<ref name=Tariff>{{cite book|last1=United States Tariff Commission|title=Census of dyes and of other synthetic organic chemicals|date=1925|publisher=U.

In England Bakelite Limited, a merger of three British phenol formaldehyde resin suppliers (Damard Lacquer Company Limited of [[Birmingham]], Mouldensite Limited of Darley Dale and Redmanol Chemical Products Company of [[London]]) was formed in 1926.  A new Bakelite factory opened in [[Tyseley]], Birmingham, England around 1928.<ref name=Travis>{{cite book|editor-last1=Travis|editor-first1=Anthony S.|title=Determinants in the evolution of the European chemical industry : 1900-1939 : new technologies, political frameworks, markets and companies|date=1998|publisher=Kluwer Acad.

A new factory was opened in [[Bound Brook, New Jersey]], in 1931.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|75}} In 1939 the companies were acquired by [[Union Carbide|Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation]].  Union Carbide's phenolic resin business including the Bakelite and Bakelit registered trademarks are owned by [[Momentive Specialty Chemicals]].

In addition to the original Bakelite material, these companies eventually made a wide range of other products, many of which were marketed under the brand name "Bakelite plastics".  These included other types of cast phenolic resins similar to [[Catalin]], and urea-formaldehyde resins, which could be made in brighter colors than polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride.<ref name=CookSlessor/><ref name="Meikle">{{cite book|title=American Plastic: A Cultural History|last1=Meikle|first1=Jeffrey L.|date=1995|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick,NJ|isbn=0-8135-2235-8}}</ref>

Once Baekeland's heat and pressure patents expired in 1927, Bakelite Corporation faced serious competition from other companies. Because molded Bakelite incorporated fillers to give it strength, it tended to be made in concealing dark colors.<ref name="Meikle"/> In 1927, beads, bangles and earrings were produced by the [[Catalin]] Company, through a different process which enabled them to introduce 15 new colors. Translucent jewelry, poker chips and other items made of phenolic resins were introduced in the 1930s or 1940s by the Catalin Company under the Prystal name.<ref name=Leshner>{{cite book|last1=Leshner|first1=Leigh|title=Collecting art plastic jewelry : identification and price guide|date=2005|publisher=KP Books|location=Iola, WI|isbn=978-0873499545|pages=11–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJomBfX6pqkC&pg=PA11|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=Katz>{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Sylvia|title=Plastics : designs and materials.|date=1978|publisher=Studio Vista|location=London, Angleterre|isbn=9780289707838|page=65|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> The creation of marbled phenolic resins may also be attributable to the Catalin Company.

==Synthesis==
Making Bakelite was a multi-stage process. It began with the heating of phenol and formaldehyde in the presence of a catalyst such as [[hydrochloric acid]], [[zinc chloride]], or the base [[ammonia]]. This created a liquid condensation product, referred to as ''Bakelite A'', which was soluble in alcohol, acetone, or additional phenol.  Heated further, the product became partially soluble and could still be softened by heat. Sustained heating resulted in an "insoluble hard gum".  However, the high temperatures required to create this tended to cause violent foaming of the mixture, which resulted in the cooled material being porous and breakable. Baekeland's innovative step was to put his "last condensation product" into an egg-shaped "Bakelizer".  By heating it under pressure, at about 150&nbsp;°C., Baekeland was able to suppress the foaming that would otherwise occur. The resulting substance was extremely hard and both infusable and insoluble.<ref name=CookSlessor/>{{rp|67}} <ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|38–39}}

===Compression molding===
[[File:RotorBakelite-2.jpg|thumb|Bakelite [[distributor]] rotor]]
Molded Bakelite forms in a condensation reaction of phenol and formaldehyde, with [[wood flour]] or [[asbestos]] fiber as a filler, under high pressure and heat in a time frame of a few minutes of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]]. The result is a hard plastic material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/CIIEcompounds/transcripts/bakelite.asp|title=Chemistry in its element – bakelite|website=Royal Society of Chemistry - RSC.org|last=Clegg|first=Brian|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>

Bakelite's molding process had a number of advantages. Bakelite resin could be provided either as powder, or as preformed partially cured slugs, increasing the speed of the casting.  Thermosetting resins such as Bakelite required heat and pressure during the molding cycle, but could be removed from the molding process without being cooled, again making the molding process faster. Also, because of the smooth polished surface that resulted, Bakelite objects required less finishing.<ref name=Metallography>{{cite book|last1=Vander Voort|first1=George F.|title=Metallography, Principles and Practice|date=1984|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=1615032363|pages=75–81|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRQC8zYqtBIC&pg=PA75|accessdate=26 February 2015}}</ref>  Millions of parts could be duplicated quickly and relatively cheaply.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|42–43}}

===Phenolic sheet===
Another market for Bakelite resin was the creation of phenolic sheet materials. Phenolic sheet is a hard, dense material made by applying heat and pressure to layers of paper or glass cloth impregnated with synthetic resin.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|53}} Cellulose [[paper]], [[cotton]] fabrics, [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic yarn]] fabrics, [[Glass (fiber)|glass fabrics]] and unwoven fabrics are all possible materials used in lamination. When heat and pressure are applied, [[polymerization]] transforms the layers into [[Thermosetting plastic|thermosetting]] industrial laminated plastic.<ref name=Nimrod>{{cite web|title=Bakelite|url=http://www.nimrodplastics.com.au/product-bakelite.htm|website=Nimrod Plastics|accessdate=26 February 2015}}</ref>

Bakelite phenolic sheet is produced in dozens of commercial grades and with various additives to meet diverse mechanical, electrical and thermal requirements.

Bakelite has a number of important properties.  It can be molded very quickly, allowing identical units to be mass-produced. Moldings are smooth, retain their shape and are resistant to heat, scratches, and destructive solvents. It is also resistant to electricity, and prized for its low conductivity. It is not flexible.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|44–45}}<ref name=Metallography/><ref name=Wijk2015>{{cite book|last1=van Wijk|first1=A.J.M.|last2=van Wijk|first2=I.|title=3D Printing with Biomaterials: Towards a Sustainable and Circular Economy|date=2015|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=1614994862|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEAoBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA39}}</ref>

In 1947, Dutch art forger [[Han van Meegeren]] was convicted of forgery, after chemist and curator [[Paul B.

Bakelite was sometimes used as a substitute for metal in the magazine, pistol grip, fore grip, hand guard, and butt stock of firearms. Some early [[AK-74]] rifles have been identified as using Bakelite, but most were made with AG-S4, commonly mistaken for Bakelite.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kokalis|first1=Peter|title=Weapons Tests And Evaluations: The Best Of Soldier Of Fortune|date=2001|publisher=Paladin Press|pages=45, 49}}</ref>

By the late 1940s, newer materials were superseding Bakelite in many areas.<ref name=Balinski/> [[Phenolic resin|Phenolics]] are less frequently used in general consumer products today due to their cost and complexity of production and their brittle nature. They still appear in some applications where their specific properties are required, such as small precision-shaped components, molded disc brake cylinders, saucepan handles, electrical plugs, switches and parts for electrical irons.,<ref name=Market/> as well as in the area of inexpensive board and tabletop games produced in China, India and Hong Kong.<ref name=Market>{{cite web|title=Bakelite Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Trends, Analysis, Growth And Forecast, 2012 - 2018|url=http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/bakelite-market.html|website=Transparency Market Research|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref> Items such as [[billiard ball]]s, dominoes and pieces for games like [[chess]], [[checkers]], and [[backgammon]] are constructed of Bakelite for its look, durability, fine polish, weight, and sound. Common dice are sometimes made of Bakelite for weight and sound, but the majority are made of a thermoplastic polymer such as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS).
Bakelite continues to be used for wire insulation, brake pads and related automotive components, and industrial electrical-related applications.  Bakelite stock is still manufactured and produced in sheet, rod and tube form for industrial applications in the [[electronics]], [[power generation]] and [[aerospace]] industries, and under a variety of commercial brand names.<ref name=Balinski/>

Phenolic resins have been commonly used in ablative heat shields.<ref name=Ellis>{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Bryan|last2=Smith|first2=Ray|title=Polymers a property database|date=2009|publisher=CRC Press/Taylor & Francis Group|location=Boca Raton|isbn=1420005707|page=372|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-TKBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA372}}</ref>  Soviet heatshields for ICBM warheads and spacecraft reentry consisted of asbestos textolite, impregnated with Bakelite.<ref>''Roads to Space: an oral history of the Soviet space program''.

==Collectable status==
Bakelite items, particularly jewelry and radios, have become a popular [[collectable]].<ref name=Balinski/> The term ''Bakelite'' is sometimes used in the resale market to indicate various types of early plastics, including [[Catalin]] which may be brightly colored, as well as items made of Bakelite material.<ref name=Radios/><ref name=Cycleback>{{cite web|last1=Cycleback|first1=David|title=Bakelite and catalin: Collectible early plastics|url=https://cycleback.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/bakelite-and-catalin-phenol-formaldehyde-identifying-the-popular-early-plastics/|website=Looking at Art, Artifacts and Ideas|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>

==Patents==
The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] granted Baekeland a patent for a "Method of making insoluble products of phenol and formaldehyde" on December 7, 1909.<ref name="Patent942699"/>  Producing hard, compact, insoluble and infusable condensation products of phenols and formaldehyde marked the beginning of the modern plastics industry.<ref>Baekeland, Leo H (December 7, 1909) "Method of making insoluble products of phenol and formaldehyde" {{US Patent|942699}}</ref>
