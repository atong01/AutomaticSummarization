==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|Characteristics of dyslexia}}
In early childhood, symptoms that correlate with a later diagnosis of dyslexia include [[speech delay|delayed onset]] of speech, difficulty distinguishing left from right, difficulty with direction,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hamada, Hiroshi; Tam, Patrick P.L.|title=Mechanisms of left-right asymmetry and patterning: driver, mediator and responder|journal=F1000  Prime Reports|date=December 2014|url=http://f1000.com/prime/reports/pubmed/25580264|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref> as well as being easily distracted by background noise.<ref name=Handler2011/> The reversal of letters or words and [[mirror writing]] are behaviors sometimes seen in people with dyslexia, but are not considered to be defining characteristics of the disorder.<ref name=Handler2011/>

Problems persist into adolescence and adulthood and may accompany difficulties with summarizing stories, memorization, reading aloud, or learning foreign languages. Adult dyslexics can often read with good comprehension, though they tend to read more slowly than non-dyslexics and perform worse in [[spelling]] tests or when reading nonsense words – a measure of phonological awareness.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jarrad|first1=Lum|title=Procedural learning is impaired in dyslexia: evidence from a meta-analysis of serial reaction time studies|journal=Research of Developmental Disabilities|date=October 2013|pages=3460–76|pmid=23920029|pmc=3784964|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2013.07.017|volume=34|issue=10}}</ref>

It has been found that reinforced collateral training focused on reading and spelling yields longer-lasting gains than oral phonological training alone.<ref name=Lyytinen>{{Cite book

There have been many studies conducted regarding intervention in dyslexia.

==Prognosis==
Dyslexic children require special instruction for word analysis and spelling from an early age.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O’Hare|first1=Anne|title=Dyslexia: what do paediatricians need to know?|journal=Pediatrics and Child health|date=2010|pages=338–343|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751722210000958|accessdate=11 March 2015|doi=10.1016/j.paed.2010.04.004|volume=20|issue=7}}</ref> However, there are fonts that can help dyslexics better understand writing.<ref name=Renske/> The prognosis, generally speaking, is positive for individuals who are identified in childhood and receive support from friends and family.<ref name=ninds1/>

The percentage of people with dyslexia is unknown, but it has been estimated to be as low as 5% and as high as 17% of the population.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Psychiatry, 2 Volume Set|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6Rp0BgAAQBAJ|publisher = John Wiley & Sons|date = 2015-01-29|isbn = 9781118845493|first = Allan|last = Tasman|first2 = Jerald|last2 = Kay|first3 = Jeffrey A.|last3 = Lieberman|first4 = Michael B.|last4 = First|first5 = Michelle|last5 = Riba}}</ref> While it is diagnosed more often in males,<ref name=Lancet2012/> some believe that it affects males and females equally.

There are different definitions of dyslexia used throughout the world, but despite significant differences in writing systems, dyslexia occurs in different populations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Protopapas|first1=Athanassios|title=From temporal processing to developmental language disorders: mind the gap|journal=Philosophical transactions of the Royal Sociey of LondonSeries B, Biological Sciences|date=2013|pmid=24324245|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3866431/|accessdate=14 February 2015|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0090|pmc=3866431|volume=369|issue=1634|pages=20130090}}</ref> Dyslexia is not limited to difficulty in converting letters to sounds, and Chinese dyslexics may have difficulty converting [[Chinese character]]s into their meanings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhao|first1=Jing|title=The visual magnocellular-dorsal dysfunction in Chinese children with developmental dyslexia impedes Chinese character recognition.|journal=Scientific reports|date=November 2014|pmc=4238300|pmid=25412386|doi=10.1038/srep07068|volume=4|pages=7068|bibcode = 2014NatSR...4E7068Z }}</ref><ref name="Marshall2012l">{{cite book|author=Chloe Marshall|title=Current Issues in Developmental Disorders|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5VK_TWsQ3N4C&pg=PA152|year=2012|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-84872-084-8|page=152}}</ref> The Chinese vocabulary uses logographic, monographic, non-alphabet writing where one character can represent an individual phoneme.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Brain, Mind, and Developmental Psychopathology in Childhood|url = http://books.google.com/?id=5ujeVaMa9U0C&pg=PA177&dq=epidemiology+dyslexia+non-alphabetic+languages#v=onepage&q=epidemiology%2520dyslexia%2520non-alphabetic%2520languages&f=false|publisher = Jason Aronson|date = 2012-01-16|isbn = 9780765708663|first = Elena|last = Garralda|first2 = Jean-Philippe|last2 = Raynaud}}</ref> 

The phonological-processing hypothesis attempts to explain why dyslexia occurs in a wide variety of languages. Furthermore, the relationship between phonological capacity and reading appears to be influenced by orthography.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Phonological processing deficits as a universal model for dyslexia: evidence from different orthographies|url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S2317-17822014000600509&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en|journal = CoDAS|pages = 509–519|volume = 26|issue = 6|doi = 10.1590/2317-1782/20142014135|pmid = 25590915|first = Ana Luiza Gomes Pinto|last = Navas|first2 = Érica de Cássia|last2 = Ferraz|first3 = Juliana Postigo Amorina|last3 = Borges|first4 = Ana Luiza Gomes Pinto|last4 = Navas|first5 = Érica de Cássia|last5 = Ferraz|first6 = Juliana Postigo Amorina|last6 = Borges|year = 2014}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of developmental dyslexia}}
Dyslexia was identified by [[Oswald Berkhan]] in 1881,<ref name="Oswald Berkhan ref 1">{{Cite journal |author=Berkhan O |year=1917 |title=Über die Wortblindheit, ein Stammeln im Sprechen und Schreiben, ein Fehl im Lesen |trans_title=About word blindness, adyslalia of speech and writing, a weakness in reading |language=German |journal=Neurologisches Centralblatt |volume=36 |pages=914–27 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=DmEsAQAAIAAJ&dq=editions%3AUCALB3248710&q=Wortblindheit#search_anchor}}</ref> but the term ''dyslexia'' was coined in 1887 by [[Rudolf Berlin]], an [[ophthalmologist]] in [[Stuttgart]].<ref>{{Cite journal |title=''Über Dyslexie'' |trans_title=About dyslexia |year=1884 |journal=Archiv für Psychiatrie |volume=15 |pages=276–278}}</ref> He used the term to refer to the case of a young boy who had a severe impairment in learning to read and write, despite showing typical intelligence and physical abilities in all other respects.<ref>{{cite book|title=Annual of the Universal Medical Sciences and Analytical Index: A Yearly Report of the Progress of the General Sanitary Sciences Throughout the World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5_IhAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA39|year=1888|publisher=F.

As is the case with any disorder, society often makes an assessment based on incomplete information. Before the 1980s, dyslexia was thought to be a consequence of education, rather than a basic disability. As a result, society often misjudges those afflicted with the disorder.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Korne|first1=Gerd|title=The prevention diagnosis and treatment of dyslexia|journal=Deutches International|date=2010|pages=718–727|pmc=2967798|pmid=21046003|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2010.0718|volume=107|issue=41|doi-broken-date=2015-10-31}}</ref> There is also sometimes a workplace stigma and negative attitude towards those with dyslexia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Berr|first1=J|title=Factors influencing work participation of adults with developmental dyslexia|journal=BMC Public Health|date=2014|pmc=3913008|pmid=24460949|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-77|volume=14|pages=77}}</ref> If a dyslexic's instructors lack the necessary training to support a child with the condition, there is often a negative effect on the student's learning participation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Inclusion of Students with Dyslexia in Higher Education: A Systematic Review Using Narrative Synthesis|url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4253321/|journal = Dyslexia (Chichester, England)|date = 2014-11-01|pmc = 4253321|pmid = 25293652|pages = 346–369|volume = 20|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/dys.1484|first = Marco|last = Pino|first2 = Luigina|last2 = Mortari}}</ref> There is no evidence demonstrating that the use of music education is effective in improving dyslexic adolescents' reading skills.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Music education for improving reading skills in children and adolescents with dyslexia|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009133.pub2/abstract|publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|date = 2012-08-15|doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd009133.pub2/abstract|ignore-isbn-error=true|first = Hugo|last = Cogo-Moreira|first2 = Régis B|last2 = Andriolo|first3 = Latife|last3 = Yazigi|first4 = George B|last4 = Ploubidis|first5 = Clara Regina|last5 = Brandão de Ávila|first6 = Jair J|last6 = Mari}}</ref>
