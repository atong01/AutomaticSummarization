Anxiety is distinguished from [[fear]], which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat and is related to the specific behaviors of [[fight-or-flight response]]s, defensive behavior or escape. It occurs in situations only perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable, but not realistically so.<ref>{{cite book |last=Öhman |first=Arne |year=2000 |chapter=Fear and anxiety: Evolutionary, cognitive, and clinical perspectives |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Lewis |editor2-first=Jeannette M. |editor2-last=Haviland-Jones |title=Handbook of emotions |pages=573–93 |location=New York |publisher=The Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-529-8}}</ref> David Barlow defines anxiety as "a future-oriented mood state in which one is ready or prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events,"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.11.1247 |title=Unraveling the mysteries of anxiety and its disorders from the perspective of emotion theory |year=2000 |last1=Barlow |first1=David H. |journal=American Psychologist |volume=55 |issue=11 |pages=1247–63 |pmid=11280938}}</ref> and that it is a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear.

Fear and anxiety can be differentiated in four domains: (1) duration of emotional experience, (2) temporal focus, (3) specificity of the threat, and (4) motivated direction. Fear is defined as short lived, present focused, geared towards a specific threat, and facilitating escape from threat; while anxiety is defined as long acting, future focused, broadly focused towards a diffuse threat, and promoting excessive caution while approaching a potential threat and interferes with constructive coping.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2010.08.004 |title=Differences between trait fear and trait anxiety: Implications for psychopathology |year=2011 |last1=Sylvers |first1=Patrick |last2=Lilienfeld |first2=Scott O. |last3=Laprairie |first3=Jamie L. |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=31 |pages=122–37 |pmid=20817337 |issue=1}}</ref><br /> Anxiety can be experienced with long, drawn out daily symptoms that reduce quality of life, known as chronic (or generalized) anxiety, or it can be experienced in short spurts with sporadic, stressful [[panic attack]]s, known as acute anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rynn MA, Brawman-Mintzer O |title=Generalized anxiety disorder: acute and chronic treatment |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=716–23 |year=2004 |pmid=15448583}}</ref>  Symptoms of anxiety can range in number, intensity, and frequency, depending on the person.

==Types==

===Existential===
{{Further|Angst|Existential crisis|Nihilism}}

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' (1844), described anxiety or dread associated with the "dizziness of freedom" and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self-conscious exercise of responsibility and choosing. In ''Art and Artist'' (1932), the psychologist [[Otto Rank]] wrote that the [[psychological trauma]] of birth was the pre-eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative person's simultaneous fear of – and desire for – separation, individuation and differentiation.

The [[theology|theologian]] [[Paul Tillich]] characterized existential anxiety<ref name="Tillich">{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Tillich |last=Tillich |first=Paul |year=1952 |title=The Courage To Be |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-08471-4|page=76}}</ref> as "the state in which a [[being]] is aware of its possible nonbeing" and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety: ontic (fate and death), [[Morality|moral]] ([[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and condemnation), and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] (emptiness and [[Meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]]). According to Tillich, the last of these three types of existential anxiety, i.e. spiritual anxiety, is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods. Tillich argues that this anxiety can be [[Acceptance#Self acceptance|accepted]] as part of the [[human condition]] or it can be resisted but with negative consequences. In its pathological form, spiritual anxiety may tend to "drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by [[tradition]] and [[authority]]" even though such "undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of [[reality]]".<ref name=Tillich />

According to [[Viktor Frankl]], the author of ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers, the most basic of all human wishes is to find a [[meaning of life]] to combat the "trauma of nonbeing" as death is near.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abulof|first1=Uriel|title=The Mortality and Morality of Nations|date=2015|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107097070|page=26|}}</ref>

===Test and performance===<!-- This section is linked from [[Educational psychology]] -->
{{Main|Test anxiety|Mathematical anxiety|Stage fright|Somatic anxiety}}
According to [[Yerkes-Dodson law]], an optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam, performance, or competitive event. However, when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum, the result is a decline in performance.<ref name="Teigen">{{Cite journal |title=Yerkes-Dodson: A Law for all Seasons |last=Teigen |first=Karl Halvor |journal=Theory Psychology |date=November 1994 |volume=4 |pages=525–47 |doi=10.1177/0959354394044004 |issue=4}}</ref>

Test anxiety is the uneasiness, apprehension, or nervousness felt by students who have a fear of failing an [[Test (student assessment)|exam]]. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of [[Grade (education)|grades]] with [[Self-esteem|personal worth]]; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of [[Social alienation|alienation]] from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on [[fear of negative evaluation]],<ref name="Liebert">{{Cite journal |title=Cognitive and emotional components of test anxiety: A distinction and some initial data |last1=Liebert |first1=Robert M. |last2=Morris |first2=Larry W. |journal=Psychological Reports |year=1967 |volume=20 |pages=975–978 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1967.20.3.975 |issue=3 |pmid=6042522}}</ref> debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder or whether it is a specific type of social phobia.<ref name="Beidel">{{Cite journal |title=Comorbidity of test anxiety and other anxiety disorders in children |last1=Beidel |first1=D.C. |last2=Turner |first2=S.M. |journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology |year=1988 |volume=16 |pages=275–287 |issue=3 |doi=10.1007/BF00913800 |pmid=3403811}}</ref> The DSM-IV classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia.<ref name="Rapee">{{cite journal |title=A cognitive-behavioral model of anxiety in social phobia |last1=Rapee |first1=Ronald M. |last2=Heimberg |first2=Richard G.|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=35 |issue=8 |date=August 1997 |pages=741–56 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7967(97)00022-3 |pmid=9256517}}</ref>

===Stranger, social, and intergroup===
{{Main|Stranger anxiety|Social anxiety}}

Humans generally require social acceptance and thus sometimes dread the disapproval of others. Apprehension of being judged by others may cause anxiety in social environments.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-375096-9.00028-6 |chapter=Introduction: Toward an Understanding of Social Anxiety Disorder |title=Social Anxiety |year=2010 |last=Hofmann |first=Stefan G. |last2=Dibartolo |first2=Patricia M. |isbn=978-0-12-375096-9 |pages=xix–xxvi}}</ref>
 
Anxiety during social interactions, particularly between strangers, is common among young people. It may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia. "[[Stranger anxiety]]" in small children is not considered a phobia. In adults, an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage; it is called [[social anxiety]]. According to Cutting,<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Ben |editor1-last=Thomas |editor2-first=Sally |editor2-last=Hardy |editor3-first=Penny |editor3-last=Cutting |year=1997 |title=Mental Health Nursing: Principles and Practice |publisher=Mosby |location=London |isbn=978-0-7234-2590-8}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref> social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be judged negatively.

[[Social anxiety]] varies in degree and severity. For some people it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact (e.g. embracing, shaking hands, etc.), while in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether. Those suffering from this condition may restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety, minimizing social interaction whenever possible. Social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders, including [[Avoidant Personality Disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10578-012-0307-0 |title=Social Functioning in Youth with Anxiety Disorders: Association with Anxiety Severity and Outcomes from Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy |year=2012 |last1=Settipani |first1=Cara A. |last2=Kendall |first2=Philip C. |journal=Child Psychiatry & Human Development |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |pmid=22581270}}</ref>

To the extent that a person is fearful of social encounters with unfamiliar others, some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, or people who share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.). Depending on the nature of the antecedent relations, cognitions, and situational factors, intergroup contact may be stressful, and lead to feelings of anxiety. This apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Walter G.|last2=Stephan| first2=Cookie W.|title=Intergroup anxiety|journal=Journal of Social Issues|date=1985|volume=41|issue=3|pages=157–175|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134}}</ref>

As is the case the more generalized forms of [[social anxiety]], intergroup anxiety has behavioral, cognitive, and affective effects. For instance, increases in schematic processing and simplified information processing can occur when anxiety is high. Indeed, such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in implicit memory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Richeson|first=Jennifer A.| last2=Trawalter| first2=Sophie|title=The threat of appearing prejudiced and race-based attentional biases|journal=Psychological Science|date=2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=98–102|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02052.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=Andrew|last2=Mogg|first2=Karin|last3=May|first3=Jon|last4=Eysenck|first4=Michael|title=Implicit and explicit memory bias in anxiety|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1989|volume=98|issue=3|pages=236–240|doi=10.1037/0021-843x.98.3.236}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Anne|last2=French|first2= Christopher C.|title=Effects of encoding and anxiety on implicit and explicit memory performance|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=1991|volume=12|issue=2|pages=131–139|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(91)90096-t}}</ref> Additionally recent research has found that implicit racial evaluations (i.e. automatic prejudiced attitudes) can be amplified during intergroup interaction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Amodio|first=David M.|last2=Hamilton |first2= Holly K.|title=Intergroup anxiety effects on implicit racial evaluation and stereotyping|journal=Emotion|date=2012|volume=12|issue=6|pages=1273–1280|doi=10.1037/a0029016}}</ref> Negative experiences have been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations, but also avoidant, or  antagonistic, behavior such as hostility.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Plant|first=Ashby  E.|last2= Devine| first2=Patricia G.|title=The antecedents and Implications of Interracial Anxiety|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=2003|volume=29|pages=790–801|doi=10.1177/0146167203029006011}}</ref> Furthermore, when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort (e.g., impression management and self-presentation) in intragroup contexts, levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation.

===Trait===
Anxiety can be either a short term 'state' or a long term "trait". Trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency to respond with state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html|title = Anxiety|last = Schwarzer|first = R.|date = December 1997|accessdate = 2008-01-12|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070920115547/http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate = 2007-09-20}}</ref> It is closely related to the personality trait of [[neuroticism]].<ref name="Ormel" /> Such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Giddey |first1=M. |last2=Wright |first2=H. |title=Mental Health Nursing: From first principles to professional practice |publisher=Stanley Thornes}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref>

===Choice or decision===
Anxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is increasingly being recognized as a problem for individuals and for organizations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/fashion/trends/article85734.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Premium choice anxiety |date=April 27, 2008 |accessdate=2010-04-25 |first1=Jonathan |last1=Downey}}</ref> In 2004, [[Capgemini]] wrote: "Today we're all faced with greater choice, more competition and less time to consider our options or seek out the right advice."<ref>[http://www.uk.capgemini.com/news-centre/news/pr1487/ Is choice anxiety costing british 'blue chip' business?], [[Capgemini]], Aug 16, 2004</ref>

The first form refers to a choice in which there are multiple potential outcomes with known or calculable probabilities. The second form refers to the uncertainty and ambiguity related to a decision context in which there are multiple possible outcomes with unknown probabilities.<ref name="Hartley"/>

===Psychiatric===
Anxiety disorders are a group of [[mental disorder]]s characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear,<ref name="DSM5"/> where anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events.<ref name= DSM5/> These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a racing heart and shakiness.<ref name= DSM5/> There are various forms of anxiety disorders, including [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[phobic disorder]], and [[panic disorder]].

Anxiety disorders are partly genetic but may also be due to drug use including alcohol and [[caffeine]], as well as withdrawal from certain drugs. They often occur with other mental disorders, particularly [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], certain [[personality disorder]]s, and [[eating disorder]]s. The term anxiety covers four aspects of experiences that an individual may have: mental apprehension, physical tension, physical symptoms and dissociative anxiety.<ref>David Healy, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ikTJViYMPIEC&lpg=PP1&dq=Psychiatric%20drugs%2C%20Healey&pg=PA135#v=onepage&q&f=falsePsychiatric Drugs Explained, Section 5: Management of Anxiety]'', Elsevier Health Sciences, 2008, pp. 136–137</ref> The emotions present in anxiety disorders range from simple nervousness to bouts of terror.<ref name="Barker2003">{{cite book|author=Phil Barker|title=Psychiatric and mental health nursing: the craft of caring|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6qdoQgAACAAJ|accessdate=2010-12-17|date=7 October 2003|publisher=Arnold|location=London| isbn = 978-0-340-81026-2 }}</ref> There are other psychiatric and medical problems that may [[differential diagnosis|mimic the symptoms]] of an anxiety disorder, such as [[hyperthyroidism]].

Research upon adolescents who as infants had been highly apprehensive, vigilant, and fearful finds that their [[nucleus accumbens]] is more sensitive than that in other people when deciding to make an action that determined whether they received a reward.<ref name="Bar-Haim">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02401.x |title=Neural Correlates of Reward Processing in Adolescents with a History of Inhibited Temperament |year=2009 |last1=Bar-Haim |first1=Yair |last2=Fox |first2=Nathan A. |last3=Benson |first3=Brenda |last4=Guyer |first4=Amanda E. |last5=Williams |first5=Amber |last6=Nelson |first6=Eric E. |last7=Perez-Edgar |first7=Koraly |last8=Pine |first8=Daniel S. |last9=Ernst |first9=Monique |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=1009–18 |pmid=19594857 |pmc=2785902}}</ref> This suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people. As researchers note, "a sense of 'responsibility', or self agency, in a context of uncertainty (probabilistic outcomes) drives the neural system underlying appetitive motivation (i.e., nucleus accumbens) more strongly in temperamentally inhibited than noninhibited adolescents".<ref name="Bar-Haim"/> Anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the person's own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2010.00997.x |title=Anxiety and feedback negativity |year=2010 |last1=Gu |first1=Ruolei |last2=Huang |first2=Yu-Xia |last3=Luo |first3=Yue-Jia |journal=Psychophysiology}}{{primary source-inline|date=May 2013}}</ref> Temperament and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) have been found to be risk factors for anxiety.<ref name="Bienvenu Ginsburg 2007"/>

People who suffer from anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala.<ref>Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2013). (Ab)normal Psychology (6th edition). McGraw Hill.</ref> Although genetics may predispose an individual for an increased risk of an anxiety disorder, it is often the case that external stimuli will trigger its onset. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Social issues - gender===
Contextual factors that are thought to contribute to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences.<ref>[http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/anticipatory_anxiety_patterns_for_male_and_female_public_speakers.pdf Anticipatory Anxiety Patterns for Male and Female Public Speakers], Ralph Behnke and Chris Sawyer, 1999</ref>{{mcn|date=June 2015}} Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. Interestingly enough, the difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312450004 |title=Understanding Gender Differences in Anxiety: The Mediating Effects of Instrumentality and Mastery |year=2012 |last1=Zalta |first1=Alyson K. |last2=Chambless |first2=Dianne L. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=488–9}}</ref>{{mcn|date=June 2015}}

===Evolutionary psychology===
An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased [[vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] regarding potential  threats in the environment as well as increased tendency to take proactive actions regarding such possible threats. This may cause [[false positive]] reactions but an individual suffering from anxiety may also avoid real threats. This may explain why anxious people are less likely to die due to accidents.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0016242 |title=The bright side of being blue: Depression as an adaptation for analyzing complex problems |year=2009 |last1=Andrews |first1=Paul W. |last2=Thomson Jr |first2=J.

This might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors.{{or|date=May 2013}}

===Genes===
Although single genes have little effect on complex traits and interact heavily both [[epistasis|between themselves]] and with the external factors, research is under-way to unravel possible molecular mechanisms underlying anxiety and comorbid conditions. One candidate gene with [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s that influence anxiety is [[PLXNA2]].<ref name="pmid17339520">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.64.3.318 |title=Anxiety and Comorbid Measures Associated with PLXNA2 |year=2007 |last1=Wray |first1=Naomi R. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=318–26 |pmid=17339520 |last2=James |first2=Michael R. |last3=Mah |first3=Steven P. |last4=Nelson |first4=Matthew |last5=Andrews |first5=Gavin |last6=Sullivan |first6=Patrick F. |last7=Montgomery |first7=Grant W. |last8=Birley |first8=Andrew J. |last9=Braun |first9=Andreas |last10=Martin |first10=NG}}{{primary source-inline|date=May 2013}}</ref>
