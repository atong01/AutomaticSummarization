It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. Although only one-third of the country is located in the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range, its largest city and principal economic centers are in the [[Altiplano]].

Before Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was a part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. The Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunción]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During most of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]], Bolivia was known as ''[[Upper Peru]]'' and administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas|Royal Court of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in great part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]]. After the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Simón Bolívar]], on 6 August 1825. Since independence, Bolivia has endured periods of political and economic instability, including the loss of various peripheral territories to its neighbors, such as [[Acre (state)|Acre]] and parts of the [[Gran Chaco]]. It has been landlocked since it lost its [[Pacific]] coast territory to Chile in the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–84), but agreements with neighbouring countries have granted it indirect access to the Pacific and [[Atlantic]] oceans.

The country's population, estimated at 10&nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. The racial and social [[segregation]] that arose from Spanish colonialism has continued to the modern era. Before the [[revolution]] of 1952, native Bolivians were not permitted even to enter the principal plaza of [[La Paz]], which contains the presidential palace and the congress. Many indigenous Bolivians today still seek to “[[passing (racial identity)|pass]]” as [[mixed-race]] mestizos, whose [[social status]] is regarded as somewhat higher. The main language spoken is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], although the [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]] are also common, and all four, as well as 34 other [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s, are official.

Modern Bolivia is [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] a [[democratic republic]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the Andes in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is a [[developing country]], with a medium ranking in the [[Human Development Index]] and a poverty level of 53 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eldeber.com.bo/2011/2011-11-30/vernotaahora.php?id=111129221401 |title=Bolivia baja sus índices de pobreza en 8 años |trans_title=Bolivia lowers its poverty levels |publisher=El Deber |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> Its main economic activities include [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[fishing]], [[mining]], and [[manufacturing]] goods such as textiles, clothing, refined metals, and [[refinery|refined petroleum]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Bolivia}}

=== Pre-colonial ===
[[File:Huari-with-tiahuanaco.png|thumb|Tiwanaku at its largest territorial extent, AD 950.]]
The region now known as Bolivia had been occupied for over 2,000 years when the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] arrived. Present-day Aymara associate themselves with an advanced civilization situated at [[Tiwanaku]], in Western Bolivia. The capital city of Tiwanaku dates from as early as 1500 BC when it was a small, agriculturally based village.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fagan|2001|p={{page needed|date=July 2013}}}}</ref>

The community grew to urban proportions between AD 600 and AD 800, becoming an important regional power in the southern [[Andes]]. According to early estimates,{{When|date=February 2014}} the city covered approximately {{convert|6.5|sqkm|abbr=yes}} at its maximum extent and had between 15,000 to 30,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kolata|1993|p=145}}</ref> In 1996 [[satellite imaging]] was used to map the extent of fossilized suka kollus (flooded raised fields) across the three primary valleys of Tiwanaku, arriving at population-carrying capacity estimates of anywhere between 285,000 and 1,482,000 people.<ref name="Valley of the Spirits">{{Harvnb|Kolata|1996|p={{page needed|date=July 2013}}}}</ref>

Around AD 400, Tiwanaku went from being a locally dominant force to a predatory state. Tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the Yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many respects. In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.<ref name="McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997">{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=Timothy L.|author2=Albarracin-Jordan, Juan |author3=Bermann, Marc |title=Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=67–83|doi=10.2307/530562}}</ref>

The empire continued to grow with no end in sight. William H. Isbell states "Tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between AD 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Isbell|first=William H.|title=Wari and Tiwanaku: International Identities in the Central Andean Middle Horizon|journal=The Handbook of South American Archaeology|year=2008|pages=731–751|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-74907-5_37}}</ref> Tiwanaku continued to absorb cultures rather than eradicate them. Archaeologists note a dramatic adoption of Tiwanaku ceramics into the cultures which became part of the Tiwanaku empire. Tiwanaku's power was further solidified through the trade it implemented among the cities within its empire.<ref name="McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997"/>

Tiwanaku's elites gained their status through the surplus food they controlled, collected from outlying regions and then redistributed to the general populace. Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites. Through this control and manipulation of surplus resources, the elite's power continued to grow until about AD 950. At this time a dramatic shift in climate occurred,<ref name="Kolata, Alan L. 1993">{{cite book|last=Kolata|first=Alan L. |title=The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization|date=8 December 1993|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-55786-183-2}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2013}} causing a significant drop in precipitation in the Titicaca Basin, believed by archaeologists to have been on the scale of a major drought.

As the rainfall decreased, many of the cities further away from Lake Titicaca began to tender less foodstuffs to the elites. As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the power elite's control, dried up. The area remained uninhabited for centuries thereafter.<ref name="Kolata, Alan L. 1993"/>

[[File:Inca-expansion.png|thumb|Inca Expansion (1438–1527).]]

Between 1438 and 1527, the Inca empire, during its last great expansion, gained control over much of what is now western Bolivia. The Incas would not maintain control of the region for long, as the rapidly expanding Inca Empire was internally weak.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Colonial period ===
The Spanish conquest of the [[Inca empire]] began in 1524, and was mostly completed by 1533. The territory now called Bolivia was known as "Upper Peru", and was under the authority of the Viceroy of [[Lima]]. Local government came from the [[Real Audiencia of Charcas|Audiencia de Charcas]] located in Chuquisaca (La Plata—modern [[Sucre]]). Founded in 1545 as a mining town, [[Potosí]] soon produced fabulous wealth, becoming the largest city in the New World with a population exceeding 150,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/potosi/ |title=The High Place: Potosi |author=Demos, John  |publisher=Common-place.org |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>

=== Independence and subsequent wars ===

{{Main|History of Bolivia (1809–1920)}}

[[File:Boliviacurrencyold.png|thumb|One of the first coins produced in Bolivia after the Declaration of Independence in 1825.]]

The [[Bolivian War of Independence|struggle for independence]] started in the city of [[Sucre]] on 25 May 1809, with the first cry of Freedom in Latin America, the [[Chuquisaca Revolution]] (Chuquisaca was then the name of the city). That revolution, which created a local government junta, was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]], during which Bolivia actually declared independence. Both revolutions were short-lived, and defeated by the Spanish authorities, but the following year the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] raged across the continent. Bolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]]. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by [[Antonio José de Sucre]], with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of [[Simón Bolívar]]. After 16 years of war the Republic was [[Bolivian Declaration of Independence|proclaimed]] on 6 August 1825.

[[File:Coat of arms of Bolivia (1825).svg|thumb|The first coat of arms of Bolivia, formerly named as the Republic of Bolívar in honor of [[Simón Bolívar]].]]

In 1836, Bolivia, under the rule of [[Marshal]] [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]], invaded Peru to reinstall the deposed president, [[General]] [[Luis José de Orbegoso]]. Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina, Chile's ally, declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]].

On the same field, the Chilean and Peruvian rebel army surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. In Chile, public outrage over the treaty forced the government to reject it. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.

Following the independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agustín Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. The Peruvian army was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Ingavi]] on 20 November 1841 where Gamarra was killed. The Bolivian army under General [[José Ballivián]] then mounted a counter-offensive, capturing the Peruvian port of [[Arica Province (Peru)|Arica]]. Later, both sides signed a [[peace treaty]] in 1842, putting a final end to the war.

A period of political and economic instability in the early-to-mid-19th century weakened Bolivia. In addition, during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–83), [[Chile]]  occupied vast territories rich in [[natural resources]] south west of Bolivia, including the Bolivian [[coast]]. Chile took control of today's [[Chuquicamata]] area, the adjoining rich ''salitre'' ([[Sodium nitrate|saltpeter]]) fields, and the port of [[Antofagasta]] among other Bolivian territories.

Thus, since independence, Bolivia has lost over half of its territory to neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=McGurn Centellas |first=Katherine |date=June 2008 |title=For Love of Land and Laboratory: Nation-building and Bioscience in Bolivia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXD4SlJQYDgC&pg=PA97|location=Chicago  }}</ref> It also lost the [[Acre (state)|state of Acre]], in the Acre War, important because this region was known for its production of rubber. Peasants and the Bolivian army fought briefly but after a few victories, and facing the prospect of a total war against Brazil, it was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Petrópolis]] in 1903, in which Bolivia lost this rich territory. Popular myth has it that Bolivian president Mariano Melgarejo (1864–71) traded the land for what he called "a magnificent white horse" and Acre was subsequently flooded by Brazilians, which ultimately led to confrontation and fear of war with Brazil.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the late 19th century, an increase in the world price of silver brought Bolivia relative prosperity and political stability.

=== Early 20th century ===

{{Main|History of Bolivia (1920–64)}}
[[File:Map Bolivia territorial loss-en.svg|thumb|Bolivia's territorial losses (1867–1938)]]
During the early 20th century, [[tin]] replaced silver as the country's most important source of wealth. A succession of governments controlled by the economic and social elite followed [[laissez-faire]] capitalist policies through the first thirty years of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rabanus, David |url=http://www.bolivien-liest.de/en/country_en.html |title=Background note: Bolivia. |publisher=Bolivien-liest.de |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>

Living conditions of the native people, who constitute most of the population, remained deplorable. With work opportunities limited to primitive conditions in the mines and in large estates having nearly feudal status, they had no access to education, economic opportunity, and [[Participation (decision making)|political participation]]. Bolivia's defeat by Paraguay in the [[Chaco War]] (1932–35), where Bolivia lost a great part of the [[Gran Chaco]] region in dispute, marked a turning-point.<ref>{{cite book |author=Osborne, Harold |title=Bolivia: A Land Divided |publisher=London: Royal Institute of International Affairs |year=1954}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=History World |title=History of Bolivia |publisher=National Grid for Learning |year=2004 |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ac11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Forero, Juan |title=History Helps Explain Bolivia's New Boldness |work=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/weekinreview/07forero.html | date=7 May 2006 | accessdate=26 April 2010}} [http://www.geography.wisc.edu/archiveNews/2006/pdf/NYT-History%20Geography%20Bolivia.pdf (PDF)], University of Wisconsin–Madison, Department of Geography</ref>

The [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (MNR), the most historic political party, emerged as a broad-based party. Denied its victory in the 1951 presidential elections, the MNR led a successful revolution in 1952. Under President [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]], the MNR, having strong popular pressure, introduced [[universal suffrage]] into his political platform and carried out a sweeping land-reform promoting rural education and nationalization of the country's largest tin mines.

{{Main|History of Bolivia (1964–82)}}

12 years of tumultuous rule left the MNR divided. In 1964, a military [[military dictatorship|junta]] overthrew President Estenssoro at the outset of his third term. The 1969 death of President [[René Barrientos Ortuño]], a former member of the junta who was elected president in 1966, led to a succession of weak governments. Alarmed by the rising Popular Assembly and the increase in the popularity of President Juan José Torres, the military, the MNR, and others installed Colonel (later General) [[Hugo Banzer Suárez]] as president in 1971. He returned to the presidency in 1985–1989, 1993–1997, and 2002–2003.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The United States' [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) had been active in providing finances and training to the Bolivian military dictatorship in the 1960s. The revolutionary leader [[Che Guevara]] was killed by a team of CIA officers and members of the Bolivian Army on 9 October 1967, in Bolivia. [[Félix Rodríguez (Central Intelligence Agency)|Félix Rodríguez]] was a CIA officer on the team with the Bolivian Army that captured and shot Guevara.<ref name=BBC-2007-10-8>{{Cite journal| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7027619.stm| title= CIA man recounts Che Guevara's death| last= Grant |first=Will| date= 8 October 2007| journal= BBC News| accessdate = 2 January 2010}}</ref> Rodriguez said that after he received a Bolivian presidential execution order, he told "the soldier who pulled the trigger to aim carefully, to remain consistent with the Bolivian government's story that Che had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army." Rodriguez said the US government had wanted Che in Panama, and "I could have tried to falsify the command to the troops, and got Che to Panama as the US government said they had wanted", but that he had chosen to "let history run its course" as desired by Bolivia.<ref name=XXXI-172>{{Cite journal |title = Statements by Ernesto "Che" Guevara Prior to His Execution in Bolivia |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/johnsonlb/xxxi/36271.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206144244/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/johnsonlb/xxxi/36271.htm |archivedate=6 February 2009 |journal=Foreign Relations of the United States, Volume XXXI, South and Central America; Mexico |id=XXXI: 172 |date=13 October 1967 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}</ref>

Elections in 1979 and 1981 were inconclusive and marked by fraud. There were coups d'état, counter-coups, and caretaker governments. In 1980, General [[Luis García Meza Tejada]] carried out a ruthless and violent coup d'état that did not have popular support. He pacified the people by promising to remain in power only for one year. At the end of the year, he staged a televised rally to claim popular support and announced, "''Bueno, me quedo''", or, "All right; I'll stay [in office]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2006/0120/1137626790492.html |title=Astroturfing all the way to No 1 |author=Boyd, Brian |date=20 January 2006 |work=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=7 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110513223444/http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2006/0120/1137626790492.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 }}</ref> After a military rebellion forced out Meza in 1981, three other military governments in 14 months struggled with Bolivia's growing problems. Unrest forced the military to convoke the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], elected in 1980, and allow it to choose a new chief executive. In October 1982, [[Hernán Siles Zuazo]] again became president, 22 years after the end of his first term of office (1956–60).

=== Democratic transition ===
{{main|History of Bolivia (1982–present)}}

[[File:Gonzálo Sánchez de Lozada-Agencia BrasilAntonio Cruz.jpg|thumb|left|Former President, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]]

[[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] pursued an aggressive economic and social reform agenda. The most dramatic reform was the "capitalization" program, under which investors, typically foreign, acquired 50% ownership and management control of public enterprises in return for agreed upon capital investments.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1993, [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] ran for [[President of Bolivia|president]] in alliance with the [[Revolutionary Liberation Movement Tupaq Katari|Tupac Katari Revolutionary Liberation Movement]], which inspired indigenous-sensitive and multicultural-aware policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact94/wf950032.txt|title=1994 CIA World FactBook|accessdate=4 March 2010}}</ref> In 1993, Sanchez de Lozada introduced the ''Plan de Todos'', which led to the decentralization of government, introduction of [[intercultural bilingual education]], implementation of [[Agriculture|agrarian]] [[legislation]], and [[privatization]] of state owned businesses. The plan explicitly stated that Bolivian citizens would own a minimum of 51% of enterprises; under the plan, most [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs), though not mines, were sold.<ref name="cia"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Historia de la República de Bolivia|url=http://www.mirabolivia.com/edu/historia.htm|accessdate=4 March 2010}}</ref> This privatization of SOEs led [[neoliberal]] structuring that acknowledged a diverse population within Bolivia.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.temple.edu/gus/kohl/documents/kohlplancitizenshipIJURR603.pdf |doi=10.1111/1468-2427.00451|title=Restructuring Citizenship in Bolivia: El Plan de Todos|last=Kohl|first=Benjamin|year=2003|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=27|issue=2|page=337}}</ref>

The Law of Popular Participation gave municipalities the responsibility of maintaining various infrastructures (and offering services): health, education, systems of irrigation, which stripped the responsibility away from the state.{{when|date=October 2014}}{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain segments of society, which instigated frequent and sometimes violent protests, particularly in La Paz and the Chapare [[coca]]-growing region, from 1994 through 1996. During this time, the umbrella labor-organization of Bolivia, the [[Central Obrera Boliviana]] (COB), became increasingly unable to effectively challenge government policy. A teachers' strike in 1995 was defeated because the COB could not marshal the support of many of its members, including construction and factory workers.

In the 1997 elections, General [[Hugo Banzer]], leader of the [[Nationalist Democratic Action]] party (ADN) and former dictator (1971–78), won 22% of the vote, while the MNR candidate won 18%. At the outset of his government, President Banzer launched a policy of using special police-units to physically eradicate the illegal coca of the Chapare region. The MIR of Jaime Paz Zamora remained a coalition-partner throughout the Banzer government, supporting this policy (called the Dignity Plan).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chakana.nl/files/pub/AssiesSalman_2005_Ethnicity-and-Politics-in-Bolivia.pdf |title=Ethnicity and Politics in Bolivia |publisher=Ethnopolitics 4(3):269–297 |format=PDF |date=September 2005 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> The Banzer government basically continued the free-market and privatization-policies of its predecessor. The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil, lower world prices for export commodities, and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the Bolivian economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.

Between January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests]] erupted in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia's third largest city, in response to the privatisation of water resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices. On 6 August 2001, Banzer resigned from office after being diagnosed with cancer. He died less than a year later. Vice President [[Jorge Quiroga|Jorge Fernando Quiroga Ramírez]] completed the final year of his term.

[[File:Evo_Morales_in_Ecuador_(cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Current President, [[Evo Morales]]]]
In the June 2002 national elections, former President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada (MNR) placed first with 22.5% of the vote, followed by coca-advocate and native peasant-leader [[Evo Morales]] ([[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement Toward Socialism]], MAS) with 20.9%. A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of Sánchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time. The MNR platform featured three overarching objectives: economic reactivation (and job creation), anti-[[political corruption|corruption]], and social inclusion.

In 2003 the [[Bolivian gas conflict]] broke out. On 12 October 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes. Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, Sanchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.
[[File:Evomorales 20050122 posesion01.jpg|thumb|Evo Morales' inauguration as President.]]
The country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June. The chief justice of the Supreme Court, [[Eduardo Rodríguez]], was sworn as interim president to succeed the outgoing Carlos Mesa.

The indigenous population of the [[Andes|Andean]] region was not able to benefit from government reforms.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lucero|first=José Antonio|editor=John Burdick; Philip Oxhorn; Kenneth M.

[[Evo Morales]] won the [[Bolivian presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential election]] with 53.7% of the votes, an [[absolute majority]], unusual in Bolivian elections. On 1 May 2006, Morales caused controversy when he announced his intent to [[Bolivian gas conflict|re-nationalize Bolivian hydrocarbon assets]]. Fulfilling a campaign promise, on 6 August 2006, Morales opened the [[Bolivian Constituent Assembly]] to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5251306.stm |title=Push for new Bolivia constitution |publisher=BBC News |date=6 August 2006 |accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref>

In August 2007, more conflicts arose in Sucre, as the city demanded the discussion of the seat of government inside the assembly, hoping the executive and legislative branches could return to the city, but the assembly and the government said this demand was overwhelmingly impractical and politically undesirable. In May 2008, Evo Morales was a signatory to the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the [[Union of South American Nations]]. In the 2009 national general elections, Evo Morales was re-elected with 64.22% of the vote. His party, [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]], also won a two-thirds majority in both houses of the [[National Congress of Bolivia|National Congress]].

[[File:Satellite image of Bolivia in June 2002.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Bolivia]]
[[File:Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia2.jpg|thumb|[[Salar de Uyuni]]]]

Bolivia is located in the central zone of [[South America]], between 57°26'–69°38'W and 9°38'–22°53'S. With an area of {{convert|1098581|km2|sqmi}}, Bolivia is the world's 28th-largest country, and the fifth largest country in South America,<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html | title=Country Comparison :: Area | work=[[The World Factbook]] | publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] | accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref> extending from the [[Andes|Central Andes]] through part of the ''[[Gran Chaco]]'' as far as the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. The geographic center of the country is the so-called ''Puerto Estrella'' ("Star Port") on the [[Río Grande (Bolivia)|Río Grande]], in [[Ñuflo de Chávez Province]], [[Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia|Santa Cruz Department]].

The geography of the country exhibits a great variety of terrains and climates. Bolivia has a high level of [[biodiversity]], considered one of the greatest in the world, as well as several [[ecoregion]]s with ecological sub-units such as the ''[[Altiplano]]'', [[tropical rainforest]]s (including [[Amazon rainforest]]), dry [[valley]]s, and the ''[[Chiquitania]]'', which is a [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savanna]]. These areas feature enormous variations in altitude, from an elevation of {{convert|6542|m|ft}} above sea level in [[Nevado Sajama]] to nearly {{convert|70|m|ft}} along the [[Paraguay River]]. Although a country of great geographic diversity, Bolivia has remained a [[landlocked country]] since the [[War of the Pacific]].

Bolivia can be divided into three [[Physical geography|physiographic]] regions:

*'''The Andean region''' in the southwest spans 28% of the national territory, extending over {{convert|307603|km²|sqmi}}. This area is located above {{convert|3000|m|ft}} altitude and is located between two big Andean chains, the ''[[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Occidental]]'' ("Western Range") and the ''[[Cordillera Central (Bolivia)|Cordillera Central]]'' ("Central Range"), with some of the highest spots in the [[Americas]] such as the [[Nevado Sajama]], with an altitude of {{convert|6542|m|ft}}, and the [[Illimani]], at {{convert|6462|m|ft}}. Also located in the Cordillera Central is [[Lake Titicaca]], the highest commercially navigable lake in the world and the largest lake in South America;<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5080/ | title=Lake Titicaca | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | date=17 June 2005 | accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref> the lake is shared with [[Peru]]. Also in this region are the ''[[Altiplano]]'' and the ''[[Salar de Uyuni]]'', which is the largest [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]] in the world and an important source of [[lithium]].
*The '''Sub-Andean region''' in the center and south of the country is an intermediate region between the ''[[Altiplano]]'' and the eastern ''[[Plain|llanos]]'' (plain); this region comprises 13% of the territory of Bolivia, extending over {{convert|142815|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and encompassing the Bolivian valleys and the Yungas region. It is distinguished by its farming activities and its temperate climate.
*The '''Llanos region''' in the northeast comprises 59% of the territory, with {{convert|648163|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is located to the north of the [[Cordillera Central (Bolivia)|Cordillera Central]] and extends from the Andean foothills to the [[Paraguay River]]. It is a region of flat land and small plateaus, all covered by extensive rain forests containing enormous biodiversity. The region is below {{convert|400|m|ft}} above sea level.

Bolivia has three [[drainage basin]]s:

*The first is the [[Amazon River|Amazon Basin]], also called the North Basin ({{convert|724000|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}/66% of the territory). The rivers of this basin generally have big [[meander]]s which form lakes such as [[Murillo Lake]] in [[Pando Department]]. The main Bolivian [[tributary]] to the Amazon basin is the [[Mamoré River]], with a length of {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} running north to the confluence with the [[Beni River]], {{convert|1113|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length and the second most important river of the country. The Beni River, along with the [[Madeira River]], forms the main tributary of the [[Amazon River]]. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers, such as the [[Madre de Dios River]], the [[Orthon River]], the [[Abuna River]], the [[Yata River]], and the [[Guaporé River]]. The most important lakes are [[Rogaguado Lake]], [[Rogagua Lake]], and [[Jara Lake]].
*The second is the [[Rio de la Plata Basin]], also called the South Basin ({{convert|229500|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}/21% of the territory). The tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon Basin. The Rio de la Plata Basin is mainly formed by the [[Paraguay River]], [[Pilcomayo River]], and [[Bermejo River]]. The most important lakes are [[Uberaba Lake]] and [[Mandioré Lake]], both located in the Bolivian marshland.
*The third basin is the '''Central Basin''', which is an [[endorheic basin]] ({{convert|145081|km²|sqmi}}/13% of the territory). The ''[[Altiplano]]'' has large numbers of lakes and rivers that do not run into any ocean because they are enclosed by the Andean mountains. The most important river is the [[Desaguadero River (Bolivia)|Desaguadero River]], with a length of {{convert|436|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the longest river of the ''Altiplano''; it begins in [[Lake Titicaca]] and then runs in a southeast direction to [[Poopó Lake]]. The basin is then formed by Lake Titicaca, Lake Poopó, the Desaguadero River, and great salt flats, including the ''[[Salar de Uyuni]]'' and [[Coipasa Lake]].

===Sustaining water supplies===

Deforestation in upper river basins has caused environmental problems, including soil erosion and declining water quality. An innovative project to try and remedy this situation involves landholders in upstream areas being paid by downstream water users to conserve forests. The landholders receive $20 to conserve the trees, avoid polluting livestock practices, and enhance the biodiversity and forest carbon on their land. They receive $30, which purchases a beehive, to compensate for conservation for two hectares of water-sustaining forest for five years. Honey revenue per hectare of forest is $5 per year, so within five years, the landholder has sold $50 of honey.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://cdkn.org/2013/12/payments-for-watershed-services-a-driver-of-climate-compatible-development/?loclang=en_gb | title=Payments for Watershed Services – A Drive of Climate Compatible Development | publisher=[[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]] | date=30 December 2013 | accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref> The project is being conducted by [[Fundación Natura Bolivia]] and Rare Conservation, with support from the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]].

===Geology===
The [[geology of Bolivia]] comprises a variety of different [[lithology|lithologies]] as well as [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] and sedimentary environments. On a synoptic scale, geological units coincide with topographical units. Most elementally, the country is divided into a mountainous western area affected by the [[subduction]] processes in the Pacific and an eastern lowlands of stable [[platform (geology)|platforms]] and [[shield (geology)|shields]].

=== Climate ===
[[File:Los Yungas La Paz - Bolivia.jpg|thumb|Los Yungas, [[La Paz]].]]

The climate of Bolivia varies drastically from one eco-region to the other, from the tropics in the eastern ''[[Plain|llanos]]'' to a [[polar climate]] in the western Andes. The summers are warm, humid in the east and dry in the west, with rains that often modify temperatures, humidity, winds, [[atmospheric pressure]] and evaporation, yielding very different climates in different areas. When the climatological phenomenon known as ''[[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itdg.org.pe/archivos/desastres/reportemarzo.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308110026/http://www.itdg.org.pe/archivos/desastres/reportemarzo.pdf |archivedate=8 March 2005 |title=Fortalecimiento de las Capacidades locales para enfrentar El Fenómeno del Niño en Perú y Bolivia |publisher=itdg.org.pe |format=PDF |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=48449&docTipo=1&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001813/http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=48449&docTipo=1&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Deja 56 muertos "El Niño" en Bolivia |publisher=elfinanciero.com.mx |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> takes place, it causes great alterations in the weather. Winters are very cold in the west, and it snows in the mountain ranges, while in the western regions, windy days are more common. The autumn is dry in the non-tropical regions.
*''Llanos''. A [[Humidity|humid]] [[tropical climate]] with an average temperature of {{convert|30|°C|F}}. The wind coming from the [[Amazon rainforest]] causes significant rainfall. In May, there is low precipitation because of dry winds, and most days have clear skies. Even so, winds from the south, called ''surazos'', can bring cooler temperatures lasting several days.
*''[[Altiplano]]''. [[Desert climate|Desert]]-[[Polar climate|Polar]] climates, with strong and cold winds. The average temperature ranges from 15 to 20&nbsp;°C. At night, temperatures descend drastically to slightly above 0&nbsp;°C, while during the day, the weather is dry and [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] is high. [[Ground frost]]s occur every month, and snow is frequent.
*Valleys and ''Yungas''. [[Temperateness|Temperate]] climate. The humid northeastern winds are pushed to the mountains, making this region very humid and rainy. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations. Snow occurs at altitudes of {{convert|2000|m|ft}}.
*''[[Gran Chaco|Chaco]]''. [[Subtropics|Subtropical]] [[semi-arid climate]]. Rainy and humid in January and the rest of the year, with warm days and cool nights.

=== Biodiversity ===
Bolivia, with an enormous variety of [[organism]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, is part of the "[[Megadiverse countries#Cancún initiative and declaration of like-minded megadiverse countries|Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pe.biosafetyclearinghouse.net/actividades/2009/grouplmmc.pdf|title=LIKE MINDED MEGADIVERSE COUNTRIES|accessdate=6 January 2014}}</ref>

Bolivia's variable altitudes, ranging from {{convert|90|-|6542|m|ft}} above sea level, allow for a vast biologic diversity. The territory of Bolivia comprises four types of [[biome]]s, 32 ecological regions, and 199 ecosystems. Within this geographic area there are several natural parks and reserves such as the [[Noel Kempff Mercado National Park]], the [[Madidi National Park]], the [[Tunari National Park]], the [[Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve]], and the [[Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area]], among others.

Bolivia boasts over 17,000 species of seed plants, including over 1,200 species of [[fern]], 1,500 species of ''[[marchantiophyta]]'' and [[moss]], and at least 800 species of [[fungus]]. In addition, there are more than 3,000 species of [[medicinal plant]]s. Bolivia is considered the place of origin for such species as [[Capsicum pubescens|peppers]] and [[Capsicum|chili peppers]], [[peanut]]s, the [[Phaseolus vulgaris|common bean]]s, [[Cassava|yucca]], and several species of palm. Bolivia also naturally produces over 4,000 kinds of [[potato]]es.

Bolivia has more than 2,900 animal species, including 398 mammals, over 1,400 birds (about 14% of birds known in the world, being the sixth most diverse country in terms of bird species)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bolivia.com/noticias/Autonoticias/DetalleNoticia40938.asp | title=Bolivia es el Sexto País con la Mayor Cantidad de Especies de Aves en el Mundo | trans_title=Bolivia is the Sixth Country with the Highest Number of Bird Species in the World | language=Spanish | publisher=Bolivia.com | date=10 June 2009 | accessdate=21 February 2014}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2014}}, 204 [[amphibian]]s, 277 [[reptile]]s, and 635 fish, all [[fresh water]] fish as Bolivia is a [[landlocked country]].

Bolivia has gained global attention for its '[[Law of the Rights of Mother Earth]]', which accords nature the same rights as humans.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Solon | first=Olivia | date=11 April 2011 | url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-04/11/bolivia-law-of-mother-nature | title=Bolivia Grants Nature Same Rights as Humans | newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref>

== Politics and government ==
{{Main|Politics of Bolivia|Foreign relations of Bolivia}}

[[File:LaPaz Plaza Pedro Di Murillo 10.2004.jpg|thumb|The government building of the [[National Congress of Bolivia]] at the Plaza Murillo in central [[La Paz]].]]

Bolivia has been governed by democratically elected governments since 1982, when a long string of military coups came to an end. Presidents [[Hernán Siles Zuazo]] (1982–85) and [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]] (1985–89) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] in 2003 and [[Carlos Mesa]] in 2005. Bolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]], [[Nationalist Democratic Action]], and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] predominated from 1985 to 2005. The current president is [[Evo Morales]], the first indigenous Bolivian to serve as head of state. Morales' [[Movement for Socialism – Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples]] party was the first to win an outright presidential majority in four decades, doing so both in 2005 and 2009.

The [[Constitution of Bolivia|constitution]], drafted in 2006–07 and approved in 2009, provides for balanced executive, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers, as well as several levels of autonomy. The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.

The executive branch is headed by a President and Vice President, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. The president is elected to a five-year term by [[popular vote]], and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, ''Palacio Quemado'') in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second-place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.<ref name="presidencia.gob.bo"/>

The ''Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional'' ([[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] or National Congress) has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]]. The ''Cámara de Diputados'' (Chamber of Deputies) has 130 members elected to five-year terms, seventy from single-member districts (''circunscripciones''), sixty by proportional representation, and seven by the minority indigenous peoples of seven departments.<!-- 70 + 60 + 7 = 137. Can someone clarify how National Congress has 130 members while, appearently, 137 is elected --> The ''Cámara de Senadores'' (Chamber of Senators) has 36 members (four per department). Members of the Assembly are elected to five-year terms. The body has its headquarters on the Plaza Murillo in La Paz, but also holds honorary sessions elsewhere in Bolivia. The Vice President serves as titular head of the combined Assembly.

[[File:Supremecourtbolivia.jpg|thumb|The Supreme Court Building in the capital of Bolivia, [[Sucre]].]]

The judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]], the Constitutional Tribunal, the Judiciary Council, Agrarian and Environmental Tribunal, and District (departmental) and lower courts. In October 2011, Bolivia held its first judicial elections to choose members of the national courts by popular vote, a reform brought about by Evo Morales.

The [[Plurinational Electoral Organ]] is an independent branch of government which replaced the [[National Electoral Court of Bolivia|National Electoral Court]] in 2010. The branch consists of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the nine Departmental Electoral Tribunals, Electoral Judges, the anonymously selected Juries at Election Tables, and Electoral Notaries.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Posesionan a cuatro Vocales del Tribunal Supremo Electoral | work = La Jornada | accessdate =28 April 2011 | date = 16 August 2010 | url = http://www.jornadanet.com/n.php?a=51574-1 }}</ref> Wilfredo Ovando presides over the seven-member Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Its operations are mandated by the Constitution and regulated by the Electoral Regime Law (Law 026, passed 2010). The Organ's first elections were the country's first [[Bolivian judicial election, 2011|judicial election]] in October 2011, and five municipal special elections held in 2011.

=== Capital ===
Bolivia has its constitutionally recognized capital in Sucre, while La Paz is the seat of government. La Plata (now Sucre) was proclaimed provisional capital of the newly independent Alto Perú (later, Bolivia) on 1 July 1826.<ref name=DicGeo>{{Cite book | publisher = Impr. "Bolívar" de M. Pizarro | last="Sucre." | first = Sociedad Geográfica | title = Diccionario geográfico del Departamento de Chuquisaca: contiene datos geográficos, históricos y estadisticos | year = 1903 | pages = 296–97 }}</ref> On 12 July 1839, President [[José Miguel de Velasco]] proclaimed a law naming the city as the capital of Bolivia, and renaming it in honor of the revolutionary leader [[Antonio José de Sucre]].<ref name=DicGeo /> The Bolivian seat of government moved to [[La Paz]] at the turn of the twentieth century, as a consequence of Sucre's relative remoteness from economic activity after the decline of [[Potosí]] and its silver industry and of the Liberal Party in the War of 1899.

The [[Constitution of Bolivia|2009 Constitution]] assigns the role of national capital to Sucre, not referring to La Paz in the text.<ref name="presidencia.gob.bo">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidencia.gob.bo/download/constitucion.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619201729/http://www.presidencia.gob.bo/download/constitucion.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2009 |work=Nueva Constitución Política del Estado |page=4 |quote=I.

Nonetheless, the [[Palacio Quemado]] (the Presidential Palace and seat of Bolivian [[Executive (government)|executive power]]) is located in La Paz, as are the National Congress and Plurinational Electoral Organ. La Paz thus continues to be the seat of government.

=== Law and crime ===
There are 53 [[prisons in Bolivia]] which incarcerate around 8,700 people as of 2010. The prisons are managed by the Penitentiary Regime Directorate ({{lang-es|Dirección de Régimen Penintenciario|links=no}}). There are 17 prisons in [[Departments of Bolivia|departmental]] capital cities and 36 provincial prisons.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

=== Foreign relations ===
Despite losing its maritime coast, the so-called ''Littoral Department'', after the [[War of the Pacific]], Bolivia has historically maintained, as a state policy, a maritime claim to [[Chile]]; the claim asks for sovereign access to the [[Pacific Ocean]] and its maritime space. The issue has also been presented before the [[Organization of American States]]; in 1979, the OAS passed the ''426 Resolution'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/columbus/Bolivia.asp |title=Bolivia |publisher=Oas.org |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> which declared that the Bolivian problem is a hemispheric problem. On 4 April 1884, a truce was signed with Chile, whereby Chile gave facilities of access to Bolivian products through [[Antofagasta]], and freed the payment of export rights in the port of [[Arica]]. In October 1904, the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904)|Treaty of Peace and Friendship]] was signed, and Chile agreed to build a [[Arica–La Paz railway|railway between Arica and La Paz]], to improve access of Bolivian products to the ports. The ''Special Economical Zone for Bolivia in Ilo'' (ZEEBI) is a special economic area of 5&nbsp;km of maritime coast, and a total extension of 358 [[hectare]]s, called Mar Bolivia ("Sea Bolivia"), where Bolivia may maintain a free port near [[Ilo]], [[Peru]] under its administration and operation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikimapia.org/#lat=-17.739531&lon=-71.258011&z=14&l=3&m=a&v=2|title=Satellite view in Wikimapia of ''Bolivia Mar'', near the Peruvian town of Ilo|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=July 2013}} for a period of 99 years starting in 1992; once that time has passed, all the construction and territory revert to the Peruvian government. Since 1964, Bolivia has had its own port facilities in the ''Bolivian Free Port'' in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario, Argentina]]. This port is located on the [[Paraná River]], which is directly connected to the Atlantic Ocean.

=== Military ===
[[File:T-33 LA PAZ.jpg|thumb|Two [[Lockheed T-33]]s in formation – Bolivian Air Force.]]

The [[Military of Bolivia|Bolivian military]] comprises three branches: [[Bolivian Army|Ejército (Army)]], [[Bolivian Naval Force|Naval (Navy)]] and [[Bolivian Air Force|Fuerza Aérea (Air Force)]]. The legal age for voluntary admissions is 18; however, when the numbers are small the government recruits anyone as young as 14.<ref name="cia" /> The [[tour of duty]] is generally 12 months. The Bolivian government annually spends $130&nbsp;million on defense.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bolivia Military Profile 2006|year=2006 |publisher=Index Mundi |url=http://indexmundi.com/bolivia/military_profile.html}}</ref>

The Bolivian army has around 31,500 men. There are six military regions (''regiones militares''—RMs) in the army. The army is organized into ten divisions.

Though it is landlocked Bolivia keeps a navy. The [[Bolivian Naval Force]] (''Fuerza Naval Boliviana'' in Spanish) is a naval force about 5,000 strong in 2008.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/28/bolivia | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Bolivia's landlocked sailors pine for the high seas | first=Rory | last=Carroll | date=28 August 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref>

The [[Bolivian Air Force]] ('Fuerza Aérea Boliviana' or 'FAB') has nine air bases, located at La Paz, Cochabamba, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]], [[Puerto Suárez]], [[Tarija, Bolivia|Tarija]], [[Villamontes]], [[Cobija]], [[Riberalta]], and [[Roboré]].

== Administrative divisions ==

{{Main|Departments of Bolivia|Provinces of Bolivia|Municipalities of Bolivia|Cantons of Bolivia|Native Community Lands}}

Bolivia has nine departments—[[Pando Department|Pando]], [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]], [[Beni Department|Beni]], [[Oruro Department|Oruro]], [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]], [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], [[Potosí Department|Potosí]], [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]], [[Tarija Department|Tarija]].

According to what is established by the Bolivian Political Constitution, the Law of Autonomies and Decentralization regulates de procedure for the elaboration of Statutes of Autonomy, the transfer and distribution of direct competences between the central government and the autonomous entities.<ref>Political Constitution of Bolivia, Article 271</ref>

There are four levels of decentralization: Departmental government, constituted by the ''Departmental Assembly'', with rights over the legislation of the department. The [[governor]] is chosen by [[universal suffrage]]. Municipal government, constituted by a ''Municipal Council'', with rights over the legislation of the municipality. The [[mayor]] is chosen by universal suffrage. Regional government, formed by several provinces or municipalities of geographical continuity within a department. It is constituted by a ''Regional Assembly''. Original indigenous government, [[self-governance]] of original indigenous people on the ancient territories where they live.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Bolivia}}

[[File:Tree map export 2009 Bolivia.jpeg|thumb|Graphical depiction of Bolivia's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]

Bolivia’s estimated 2012 gross domestic product (GDP) totaled $27.43 billion at official exchange rate and $56.14 billion at purchasing power parity. Economic growth was estimated to be at about 5.2%, and inflation was estimated at about 6.9%.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Bolivia was rated "Repressed" by the 2010 [[Index of Economic Freedom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/Ranking.aspx |title=Country Rankings |work=2013 Index of Economic Freedom |publisher=Heritage.org |accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref> Despite a series of mostly political setbacks, between 2006 and 2009 the Morales administration has spurred growth higher than at any point in the preceding 30 years. The growth was accompanied by a moderate decrease in inequality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/bolivian-economy-during-morales-administration/|title=Bolivia: The Economy During the Morales Administration|date=December 2009|author=Weisbrot, Mark; Ray, Rebecca and Johnston, Jake |publisher=CEPR – Center for Economic and Policy Research}}</ref> A surplus budget of 1.7% (GDP) was obtained by 2012, the government runs surpluses since Morales administration reflecting a prudent economic management.

A major blow to the Bolivian economy came with a drastic fall in the price of tin during the early 1980s, which impacted one of Bolivia's main sources of income and one of its major mining industries.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Crabtree | first=J. |author2=Buffy, G. |author3=Pearce, J. | title=The Great Tin Crash: Bolivia and the World Tin Market | journal=Bulletin of Latin American Research | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=174–175 |year=1988 | doi=10.2307/3338459 | publisher=Bulletin of Latin American Research, Vol. 7, No. 1 | jstor=3338459}}</ref> Since 1985, the government of Bolivia has implemented a far-reaching program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform aimed at maintaining price stability, creating conditions for sustained growth, and alleviating scarcity. A major reform of the customs service has significantly improved transparency in this area. Parallel legislative reforms have locked into place market-liberal policies, especially in the hydrocarbon and telecommunication sectors, that have encouraged private investment. Foreign investors are accorded national treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35751.htm#econ |title=Economy of Bolivia |publisher=US State Government |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Miners at Work Potosi (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|Young miners at work in [[Potosí]]]]

In April 2000, Hugo Banzer, the former President of Bolivia, signed a contract with Aguas del Tunari, a private consortium, to operate and improve the water supply in Bolivia's third-largest city, [[Cochabamba]]. Shortly thereafter, the company tripled the water rates in that city, an action which resulted in [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests and rioting]] among those who could no longer afford clean water.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hattam|first=Jennifer|title=Who Owns Water?|journal=Sierra|date=September 2001|volume=86|issue=5|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200109/lol1.asp|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/bolivia/ |title=Leasing the Rain |publisher=PBS Frontline/World |date=June 2002 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> Amidst Bolivia's nationwide economic collapse and growing national unrest over the state of the economy, the Bolivian government was forced to withdraw the water contract.

Bolivia has the second largest [[natural gas]] reserves in South America.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7607158.stm |title=Anti-Morales protests hit Bolivia |publisher=BBC News |date=10 September 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref> The government has a long-term sales agreement to sell natural gas to Brazil through 2019. The government held a binding referendum in 2005 on the Hydrocarbon Law.

The US Geological Service estimates that Bolivia has 5.4 million [[cubic ton]]nes of [[lithium]], which represent 50%–70% of world reserves. However, to mine for it would involve disturbing the country's salt flats (called [[Salar de Uyuni]]), an important natural feature which boosts tourism in the region. The government does not want to destroy this unique natural landscape to meet the rising world demand for lithium.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7607624.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Bolivia's lithium mining dilemma | date=10 September 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> On the other hand, sustainable extraction of Li is attempted by the government. This project is carried out by the public company "Recursos Evaporíticos" subsidiary of COMIBOL.

Once Bolivia's government depended heavily on foreign assistance to finance development projects and to pay the public stuff. At the end of 2002, the government owed $4.5 billion to its foreign [[creditor]]s, with $1.6 billion of this amount owed to other governments and most of the balance owed to multilateral development banks. Most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the [[Paris Club]] mechanism. External creditors have been willing to do this because the Bolivian government has generally achieved the monetary and fiscal targets set by IMF programs since 1987, though economic crises have undercut Bolivia's normally good record. However, by 2013 the foreign assistance is just a fraction of the government budget thanks to tax collection mainly from the profitable exports to Brazil and Argentina of natural gas.

The income from tourism has become increasingly important. [[Tourism in Bolivia|Bolivia's tourist industry]] has grown gradually since about 1990.

=== Foreign-exchange reserves ===
The amount in reserve currencies and gold hold by Bolivian's Central Bank advanced from 1.085 billion of US dollars in 2000, under [[Hugo Banzer Suarez]]'s government to 15.282 billion of US dollars in 2014 under [[Evo Morales]]'s government.

=== Transport ===

====Air traffic====
{{See also|List of airlines of Bolivia|List of airports in Bolivia}}

The General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics (Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil—DGAC) formerly part of the FAB, administers a civil aeronautics school called the National Institute of Civil Aeronautics (Instituto Nacional de Aeronáutica Civil—INAC), and two commercial air transport services TAM and TAB.

[[TAM – Transporte Aéreo Militar]] (the Bolivian Military Airline) is an airline based in La Paz, Bolivia. It is the civilian wing of the 'Fuerza Aérea Boliviana' (the Bolivian Air Force), operating passenger services to remote towns and communities in the North and Northeast of Bolivia. TAM (a.k.a. TAM Group 71) has been a part of the FAB since 1945.

A similar airline serving the [[Beni Department]] with small planes is [[Línea Aérea Amaszonas]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amaszonas.com |title=Amaszonas |publisher=Amaszonas |accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref> using smaller planes than TAM.

Although a civil transport airline, [[TAB – Transportes Aéreos Bolivianos]], was created as a subsidiary company of the FAB in 1977. It is subordinate to the Air Transport Management (Gerencia de Transportes Aéreos) and is headed by an FAB general. TAB, a charter heavy cargo airline, links Bolivia with most countries of the [[Western Hemisphere]]; its inventory includes a fleet of Hercules C130 aircraft. TAB is headquartered adjacent to [[El Alto International Airport]]. TAB flies to Miami and [[Houston]], with a stop in [[Panama]].

The three largest, and main international airports in Bolivia are [[El Alto International Airport]] in La Paz, [[Viru Viru International Airport]] in Santa Cruz, and [[Jorge Wilstermann International Airport]] in Cochabamba.

====Railways====

Bolivia possessed an extensive but aged rail system, all in 1000 mm gauge, consisting of two disconnected nets.

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Bolivia}}
Bolivias’s drinking water and [[Sanitation]] coverage has greatly improved since 1990 due to a considerable increase
in sectoral investment. However, the country has the continent’s lowest coverage levels and services are of low 
quality. Political and institutional instability have 
contributed to the weakening of the sector’s institutions at the 
national and local levels. Two concessions to foreign private companies 
in two of the three largest cities &#x2014; [[Cochabamba]] and [[La Paz]]/[[El Alto]] <span>—</span> were prematurely ended in 2000 and 2006 respectively. The country’s second largest city, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], relatively successfully manages its own water and sanitation system by way of cooperatives. The government of [[Evo Morales]]
intends to strengthen citizen participation within the sector. 
Increasing coverage requires a substantial increase of investment 
financing.

According to the government the main problems in the sector
are low access to sanitation throughout the country; low access to 
water in rural areas; insufficient and ineffective investments; a low 
visibility of community service providers; a lack of respect of 
indigenous customs; "technical and institutional difficulties in the 
design and implementation of projects"; a lack of capacity to operate 
and maintain infrastructure; an institutional framework that is "not 
consistent with the political change in the country"; "ambiguities in 
the social participation schemes"; a reduction in the quantity and 
quality of water due to climate change; pollution and a lack of 
integrated water resources management; and the lack of policies and 
programs for the reuse of wastewater.<ref name="PNSB">Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia:[http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf Plan Nacional de Saneamiento Basico 2008-2015], retrieved on September 30, 2010 </ref>

Access to [[improved sanitation]] has only 27% of the population, access to [[Improved water source|improved water sources]] 80 to 88%. Coverage in urban areas is bigger than in rural ones.<ref name="JMP">[http://www.wssinfo.org/about-the-jmp/introduction/ JMP 2010 Estimates for Bolivia]. The estimates are based on the Household Survey (2005), the Bolivia Democratic and Health Survey (2008) and other surveys.</ref>

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Bolivia}}

[[File:Centro de La Paz en Bolivia.JPG|thumb|People in La Paz city centre.]]
[[File:Mujeres aymara con siku y caja - flickr-photos-micahmacallen-85524669 (CC-BY-SA).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Festival in [[Sucre]].]]

According to the last two censuses carried out by the Bolivian National Statistics Institute ''(Instituto Nacional de Estadística'', INE), the population increased from 8,274,325 (from which 4,123,850 were men and 4,150,475 were women) in 2001 to 10,027,254 in 2012.<ref name=Cen2012>{{cite web | url=http://www.ine.gob.bo:8081/censo2012/PDF/resultadosCPV2012.pdf | title=Principales resultados del censo nacional de población y vivienda 2012 (CNPV 2012) – Estado plurinacional de Bolivia | publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) | date=July 2013 | accessdate=8 August 2013}}</ref>

In the last fifty years the Bolivian population has tripled; reaching a population growth rate of 2.25%. The growth of the population in the inter-census periods (1950–1976 and 1976–1992) was approximately 2.05%, while between the last period, 1992–2001, it reached 2.74% annually.

Some 62.43% of Bolivians live in urban areas, while the remaining 37.57% in rural areas. The most part of the population (70%) is concentrated in the departments of [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]], [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]] and [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]]. In the [[Andes|Andean]] [[Altiplano]] region the departments of La Paz and [[Oruro Department|Oruro]] hold the largest percentage of population, in the valley region the largest percentage is held by the departments of Cochabamba and [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]], while in the Llanos region by Santa Cruz and [[Beni Department|Beni]]. At national level, the population density is 8,49, with variations marked between 0,8 ([[Pando Department]]) and 26,2 (Cochabamba Department).

The largest population center is located in the so-called "central axis" and in the Llanos region. Bolivia has a young population. According to the 2011 census, 59% of the population is between 15 and 59 years old, 39% is less than 15 years old. Almost 60% of the population is younger than 25 years of age.

=== Ethnicity ===
[[File:Macheteros.JPG|thumb|[[Macheteros]].]]

The ethnic composition of Bolivia is diverse. There are approximately three dozen native groups totaling 60% of the Bolivian population – the largest proportion of indigenous people in Latin America. The largest of these are the [[Quechuas]] (2.5&nbsp;million), [[Aymara people|Aymaras]] (2&nbsp;million), then Chiquitano (180,000), and [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] (125,000). So the full [[Amerindian]] population is at 60%; the remaining 30% are [[mestizo]] (mixed Amerindian and white), and around 10% are white.<ref name="cia"/>

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]], also called ''"originarios"'' ("native" or "original") and less frequently, ''Amerindians'', could be [[Andes|Andean]], as the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]] and [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] (which formed the ancient [[Inca Empire]]), which concentrate in the western departments of [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|La Paz]], [[Potosí Department|Potosí]], [[Oruro Department|Oruro]], [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]] and [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]]. There also is an important oriental ethnic population, composed by the [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] and [[Moxo people|Moxos]], among others, and that inhabit the departments of [[Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia|Santa Cruz]], [[Beni Department|Beni]], [[Tarija Department|Tarija]] and [[Pando Department|Pando]].

[[Mestizo]]s are distributed throughout the entire country and compose the 26% of the Bolivian population. Most people assume their ''mestizo'' identity while at the same time identifying themselves with one or more indigenous cultures.

[[White people|Whites]] comprise 15% of the popular and are usually concentrated in the largest cities: [[La Paz]], [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] and [[Cochabamba]], but as well in some minor cities like [[Tarija]]. In the [[Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia|Santa Cruz Department]] there are several dozen colonies of German-speaking [[Mennonite]]s totaling around 40,000 inhabitants (as of 2012).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/world/americas/21bolivia.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title=Bolivian Reforms Raise Anxiety on Mennonite Frontier |publisher=New York Times |date=21 December 2006 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>

[[Afro Bolivian]]s, descendents of [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] which arrived in the times of the [[Spanish Empire]], inhabit the [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|department of La Paz]], and located mainly in the provinces of [[Nor Yungas Province|Nor Yungas]] and [[Sud Yungas Province|Sud Yungas]]. Slavery was abolished in Bolivia in 1831.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fogel|first1=Robert William |last2=Engerman|first2=Stanley L. |title=Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery|year=1995|publisher=W W Norton & Company Incorporated|isbn=978-0-393-31218-8|pages=33–34}}</ref>

Bolivians of [[Asian people|Asian origin]] are a small but economically vibrant minority made up mainly of [[Japan]]ese (14,000), [[China|Chinese]] (4,600), [[Korea]]ns and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]].

There are small numbers of European citizens of [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Portugal]], as well as coming from other American countries, as [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Ecuador]], [[United States]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Mexico]] and [[Venezuela]], among others. There are important [[Peru]]vian colonies in [[La Paz]], [[El Alto]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]].

==== Indigenous peoples ====
The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] peoples of Bolivia can be divided into two categories of ethnic groups: the Andeans, which are located in the [[Andes|Andean]] [[Altiplano]] and the valley region; and the lowland groups, who inhabit the warm regions of central and eastern Bolivia, including the valleys of Cochabamba Department, the Amazon Basin areas of northern La Paz Department, and the lowland departments of Beni, Pando, Santa Cruz, and Tarija (including the [[Gran Chaco]] region in the southeast of the country). Large numbers of Andean peoples have also migrated to form Quechua, Aymara, and intercultural communities in the lowlands.

Bolivian culture has been heavily influenced by the Quechua, the Aymara, as well as the popular cultures of Latin America as a whole.

The cultural development is divided into three distinct periods: precolumbian, colonial, and republican. Important [[archaeology|archaeological]] ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, [[ceramic]]s, and [[weaving]]s remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major ruins include [[Tiwanaku]], [[El Fuerte de Samaipata]], [[Inkallaqta]] and [[Iskanawaya]]. The country abounds in other sites that are difficult to reach and have seen little archaeological exploration.<ref name="BackgroundNote">{{cite web |title=Background Note: Bolivia |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35751.htm |accessdate=17 October 2006}}</ref>

The Spanish brought their own tradition of religious art which, in the hands of local native and mestizo builders and [[artisan]]s, developed into a rich and distinctive style of architecture, painting, and sculpture known as "Mestizo Baroque". The colonial period produced not only the paintings of Pérez de Holguín, Flores, Bitti, and others but also the works of skilled but unknown stonecutters, woodcarvers, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. An important body of Native Baroque religious music of the colonial period was recovered and has been performed internationally to wide acclaim since 1994.<ref name="BackgroundNote"/>

Bolivian artists of stature in the 20th century include [[María Luisa Pacheco]], [[Roberto Mamani Mamani]], [[Alejandro Mario Yllanes]], [[Alfredo Da Silva]], and [[Marina Núñez del Prado]].

Bolivia has a rich [[folklore]]. Its regional [[folk music]] is distinctive and varied. The "devil dances" at the annual carnival of Oruro are one of the great folkloric events of South America, as is the lesser known carnival at [[Tarabuco]].<ref name="BackgroundNote"/>
The best known of the various festivals found in the country is the "[[Carnaval de Oruro]]", which was among the first 19 "Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity", as proclaimed by UNESCO in May 2001.

Entertainment includes [[association football|football]].
