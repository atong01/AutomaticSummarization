A conventional current describes the direction in which positive electronic charges move. Electrons have a negative charge, so the movement of electrons is opposite to the conventional current flow.

Previously, as related in the first reference cited above, Faraday had used the more straightforward term &quot;exode&quot; (the doorway where the current exits). His motivation for changing it to something meaning 'the West electrode' (other candidates had been &quot;westode&quot;, &quot;occiode&quot; and &quot;dysiode&quot;) was to make it immune to a possible later change in the direction convention for<space/><link><target>electric current</target><part>current</part></link>, whose exact nature was not known at the time. The reference he used to this effect was the Earth's magnetic field direction, which at that time was believed to be invariant. He fundamentally defined his arbitrary orientation for the cell as being that in which the internal current would run parallel to and in the same direction as a hypothetical<space/><link><target>solenoid</target><part>magnetizing current loop</part></link><space/>around the local line of latitude which would induce a magnetic<space/><link><target>dipole</target></link><space/>field oriented like the Earth's. This made the internal current East to West as previously mentioned, but in the event of a later convention change it would have become West to East, so that the West electrode would not have been the 'way out' any more. Therefore, &quot;exode&quot; would have become inappropriate, whereas &quot;cathode&quot; meaning 'West electrode' would have remained correct with respect to the unchanged direction of the actual phenomenon underlying the current, then unknown but, he thought, unambiguously defined by the magnetic reference. In retrospect the name change was unfortunate, not only because the Greek roots alone do not reveal the cathode's function any more, but more importantly because, as we now know, the Earth's magnetic field direction on which the &quot;cathode&quot; term is based is subject to<space/><link><target>Geomagnetic reversal</target><part>reversals</part></link><space/>whereas the<space/><link><target>electric current</target><part>current</part></link><space/>direction convention on which the &quot;exode&quot; term was based has no reason to change in the future.</paragraph><paragraph>Since the later discovery of the<space/><link><target>electron</target></link>, an easier to remember, and more durably technically correct (although historically false), etymology has been suggested: cathode, from the Greek<space/><italics>kathodos</italics>, 'way down', 'the way (down) into the cell (or other device) for electrons'.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Flow of electrons</heading><paragraph>The flow of electrons is almost always from anode to cathode outside of the cell or device, regardless of the cell or device type and operating mode.

In the anode, the converse applies: It features a high density of free &quot;holes&quot; and consequently fixed negative dopants which have captured an electron (hence the origin of the holes).</paragraph><paragraph>When P and N-doped layers are created adjacent to each other, diffusion ensures that electrons flow from high to low density areas: That is, from the N to the P side. They leave behind the fixed positively charged dopants near the junction. Similarly, holes diffuse from P to N leaving behind fixed negative ionised dopants near the junction. These layers of fixed positive and negative charges are collectively known as the depletion layer because they are depleted of free electrons and holes. The depletion layer at the junction is at the origin of the diode's rectifying properties. This is due to the resulting internal field and corresponding potential barrier which inhibit current flow in reverse applied bias which increases the internal depletion layer field. Conversely, they allow it in forwards applied bias where the applied bias reduces the built in potential barrier.</paragraph><paragraph>Electrons which diffuse from the cathode into the P-doped layer, or anode, become what are termed &quot;minority carriers&quot; and tend to recombine there with the majority carriers, which are holes, on a timescale characteristic of the material which is the p-type minority carrier lifetime. Similarly, holes diffusing into the N-doped layer become minority carriers and tend to recombine with electrons. In equilibrium, with no applied bias, thermally assisted diffusion of electrons and holes in opposite directions across the depletion layer ensure a zero net current with electrons flowing from cathode to anode and recombining, and holes flowing from anode to cathode across the junction or depletion layer and recombining.</paragraph><paragraph>Like a typical diode, there is a fixed anode and cathode in a Zener diode, but it will conduct current in the reverse direction (electrons flow from anode to cathode) if its breakdown voltage or &quot;Zener voltage&quot; is exceeded.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><paragraph><template><target>Div col</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Battery (electricity)</target><part>Battery</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Cathode bias</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Electrolysis</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Electrolytic cell</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Gas-filled tube</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Oxidation-reduction</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)</target><part>PEDOT</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Vacuum tube</target></link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Div col end</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.crtsite.com'>The Cathode Ray Tube site</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.av8n.com/physics/anode-cathode.htm'>How to define anode and cathode</link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Galvanic cells</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Category:Electrodes</target></link></paragraph></article>
