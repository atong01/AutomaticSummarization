In contrast to usage in the United States, there is a strong distinction between &quot;college&quot; and &quot;university&quot; in Canada.

Some borrow the money via loans, and some students fund their educations with cash, scholarships, or grants, or some combination of any two or more of those payment methods. In 2011, the state or federal government subsidized $8,000 to $100,000 for each undergraduate degree. For state-owned schools (called &quot;public&quot; universities), the subsidy was given to the college, with the student benefiting from lower tuition.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.air.org/focus-area/education/index.cfm?fa=viewContent&amp;amp;content_id=1288&amp;amp;id=6'></link></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.nber.org/digest/dec03/w9720.html'></link></extension><space/>The state subsidized on average 50% of public university tuition.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/131372'></link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Colleges vary in terms of size, degree, and length of stay.

A university typically has as its core and its largest internal division an undergraduate college teaching a<space/><link><target>liberal arts</target></link><space/>curriculum, also culminating in a<space/><link><target>bachelor's degree</target></link>. What often distinguishes a university is having, in addition, one or more graduate schools engaged in both teaching graduate classes and in research. Often these would be called a School of Law or School of Medicine, (but may also be called a college of law, or a faculty of law). An exception is<space/><link><target>Vincennes University</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Indiana</target></link>, which is styled and chartered as a &quot;university&quot; even though almost all of its academic programs lead only to two-year associate degrees. Some institutions, such as<space/><link><target>Dartmouth College</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>The College of William &amp; Mary</target></link>, have retained the term &quot;college&quot; in their names for historical reasons. In one unique case,<space/><link><target>Boston College</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Boston University</target></link>, both located in Boston, Massachusetts, are completely separate institutions.</paragraph><paragraph>Usage of the terms varies among the states.

Other options include &quot;institute&quot; (<link><target>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</target></link>), &quot;academy&quot; (<link><target>United States Military Academy</target></link>), &quot;union&quot; (<link><target>Cooper Union</target></link>), &quot;conservatory&quot; (<link><target>New England Conservatory</target></link>), and &quot;school&quot; (<link><target>Juilliard School</target></link>). In colloquial use, they are still referred to as &quot;college&quot; when referring to their undergraduate studies.</paragraph><paragraph>The term<space/><italics>college</italics><space/>is also, as in the United Kingdom, used for a constituent semi-autonomous part of a larger university but generally organized on academic rather than residential lines.

Furthermore, they were not composed of several small colleges. Instead, the new institutions felt like the Oxford and Cambridge colleges they were used to small communities, housing and feeding their students, with instruction from residential tutors (as in the United Kingdom, described above). When the first students graduated, these &quot;colleges&quot; assumed the right to confer degrees upon them, usually with authorityfor example,<space/><link><target>The College of William &amp; Mary</target></link><space/>has a<space/><link><target>Royal Charter</target></link><space/>from the British monarchy allowing it to confer degrees while<space/><link><target>Dartmouth College</target></link><space/>has a charter permitting it to award degrees &quot;as are usually granted in either of the universities, or any other college in our realm of Great Britain.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>The leaders of<space/><link><target>Harvard College</target></link><space/>(which granted America's first degrees in 1642) might have thought of their college as the first of many residential colleges that would grow up into a New Cambridge university.

Eventually, it changed its title to university, but the term &quot;college&quot; had stuck and &quot;colleges&quot; have arisen across the United States.</paragraph><paragraph>In U.S. usage, the word &quot;college&quot; embodies not only a particular type of school, but has historically been used to refer to the general concept of higher education when it is not necessary to specify a school, as in &quot;going to college&quot; or &quot;college savings accounts&quot; offered by banks.</paragraph><paragraph>In a survey of more than 2,000 college students in 33 states and 156 different campuses, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group found the average student spends as much as $1,200 each year on textbooks and supplies alone.
