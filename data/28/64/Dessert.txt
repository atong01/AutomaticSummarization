'''Dessert''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɨ|ˈ|z|ɜr|t}}) is a [[Course (food)|course]] that concludes a main meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods and beverages, but may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items. In some parts of the world there is no tradition of dessert to conclude a meal.

The term dessert can apply to many foods, such as [[cake]]s, [[tart]]s,  [[cookie]]s, [[biscuit]]s, [[gelatin]]s, [[pastry|pastries]], [[ice cream]]s, [[pie]]s, [[pudding]]s, [[custard]]s, and [[Tong sui|sweet soups]]. [[Fruit]] is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness.  Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts.

== Etymology ==
The word "dessert" originated from the French word ''desservir,'' meaning "to clear the table."<ref name=Merriam-Webster>{{cite web|title=Dessert|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dessert|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster Incorporated|accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref> Its first known use was in 1600, in a health education manual entitled ''Naturall and artificial Directions for Health'', which was written by [[William Vaughan (writer)|William Vaughan]].<ref>{{OED|dessert}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Charlton|first1=Anne|title=An example of health education in the early 17th century: Naturall and artificial Directions for Health by William Vaughan|journal=Health Education Research|date=2005|volume=20|issue=6|pages=656–664|doi=10.1093/her/cyh030|accessdate=24 July 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> In his ''A History of Dessert'' (2013), Michael Krondl explains it refers to the fact dessert was served after the table had been cleared of other dishes.<ref name="Book Review" /> The term dates from the 14th century but attained its current meaning around the beginning of the 20th century when "[[service à la française]]" (setting a variety of dishes on the table at the same time) was replaced with "[[service à la russe]]" (presenting a meal in courses.)"<ref name="Book Review" />

== Usage ==
The word dessert is most commonly used for this course in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Alternatives such as "sweets" or "afters" or, informally, "pudding" are also used in the United Kingdom<ref>{{cite web|title=Eating and Drinking|url=http://septicscompanion.com/showcat.php?cat=food|publisher=The Septic's Companion|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref> and some other Commonwealth countries, including Hong Kong, and India.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== History ==
Sweets were fed to the gods in ancient Mesopotamia<ref name="kondl">{{cite book | title=Sweet Invention: A History of Dessert | publisher=Chicago Review Press | author=Kondl, Michael | year=2011 | location=Chicago IL | isbn=978-1-55652-954-2}}</ref>{{rp|6}} and India<ref name=kondl />{{rp|16}} and other ancient civilizations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lessons From History: Fruit is a Dessert|url=http://www.thenourishinggourmet.com/2009/06/lessons-from-history-fruit-is-a-dessert.html|publisher=Nourishing Gourmet|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}</ref> Dried fruit and honey were likely the first sweeteners used in most of the world, but the spread of [[sugarcane]] around the world was essential to the development of dessert.<ref name=kondl />{{rp|13}}
[[File:Spread sugarcane.JPG|thumb|The spread of sugarcane]]
Sugarcane was grown and refined in India before 500 BCE<ref name=kondl />{{rp|26}} and was crystallized, making it easy to transport, by 500 CE. Sugar and sugarcane were traded, making sugar available to Macedonia by 300 BCE and China by 600 CE.  In South Asia, the Middle East and China, sugar has been a staple of cooking and desserts for over a thousand years. Sugarcane and sugar were little known and rare in Europe until the twelfth century or later, when the [[Crusades]] and then [[colonialization]] spread its use.

Europeans began to manufacture [[sugar]] in the [[Middle Ages]], and more sweet desserts became available.<ref>Adamson (2004), p. 89.</ref>  Even then sugar was so expensive usually only the wealthy could indulge on special occasions.  The first [[apple pie]] recipe was published in 1381.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Newcomb|first1=Tim|title=Happy Pi Day! 8 Notable Pi(e)s in History|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/14/happy-pi-day-8-notable-pies-in-history/slide/as-american-as-apple-pie/|work=Time|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}</ref> The earliest documentation of the term ''cupcake'' was in "Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats" in 1828 in [[Eliza Leslie]]'s ''Receipts'' [[cookbook]].<ref name="first">{{cite web |url=http://www.crazyaboutcupcakes.com/learning.htm#history |title=Cupcake History |publisher=Crazy About Cupcakes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20141202125111/http://www.crazyaboutcupcakes.com/learning.htm#history |archivedate=December 2, 2014}}</ref>

The [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[United States|America]] and [[Europe]] caused desserts (and food in general) to be mass-produced, processed, preserved, canned, and packaged.  Frozen foods became very popular starting in the 1920s when freezing emerged.  These processed foods became a large part of diets in many industrialized nations.  Many countries have desserts and foods distinctive to their nations or region.<ref name="Food in America">{{cite web|last=Mintz|first=Steven|title=Food in America|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/food.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512074313/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/food.cfm|publisher=Digital History|accessdate=18 October 2012|archivedate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>

== Ingredients ==
Sweet desserts usually contain [[cane sugar]], [[palm sugar]], [[honey]] or some type of syrup such as [[molasses]], [[maple syrup]], [[treacle]], or [[corn syrup]]. Other common ingredients in Western-style desserts are [[flour]] or other starches, [[Cooking fat|fats]] such as [[butter]] or [[lard]], [[dairy]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], salt, acidic ingredients such as lemon juice, and [[spice]]s and other flavoring agents such as [[chocolate]], [[peanut butter]], [[fruit]]s, and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. The proportions of these ingredients, along with the preparation methods, play a major part in the consistency, texture, and flavor of the end product.

Sugars contribute moisture and tenderness to baked goods. Flour or starch components serves as a protein and gives the dessert structure. Fats contribute moisture and can enable the development of flaky layers in pastries and pie crusts.  The dairy products in baked goods keep the desserts moist. Many desserts also contain eggs, in order to form custard or to aid in the rising and thickening of a cake-like substance. Egg yolks specifically contribute to the richness of desserts.  Egg whites can act as a leavening agent<ref name="Flour Facts">{{cite web|title=Baking Flour Facts|url=http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/tools-and-techniques/baking-flour-facts.htm|work=TLC|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> or provide structure.  Desserts can contain many spices and extracts to add a variety of flavors. Salt and acids are added to desserts to balance sweet flavors and create a contrast in flavors.

Some desserts are made with [[coffee bean|coffee]], such as tiramisu, or a coffee-flavoured version of a dessert can be made, for example an iced coffee [[soufflé]] or coffee biscuits.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brien|first1=Donna Lee|title=Powdered, Essence or Brewed?: Making and Cooking with Coffee in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s|journal=M/C Journal|date=May 2012|volume=15|issue=2|url=http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/viewarticle/475|accessdate=25 July 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322225610/http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/viewArticle/475 |archivedate=22 March 2015 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Alcohol can also be used as an ingredient, to make alcoholic desserts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Emoff|first1=Katherine|title=Alcoholic Sweet Treats Turning Dessert Into a Party|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/alcoholic-sweet-treats-turning-dessert-party/story?id=26353631|website=ABC News|accessdate=25 July 2015|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150318075804/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/alcoholic-sweet-treats-turning-dessert-party/story?id=26353631|archivedate=18 March 2015|date=21 October 2014}}</ref>

== Varieties ==
{{See also|List of desserts}}

Dessert consist of variations of flavors, textures, and appearances.  Desserts can be defined as a usually sweeter course that concludes a meal.<ref name=Merriam-Webster />  This definition includes a range of courses ranging from fruits or dried nuts to multi-ingredient cakes and pies.  Many cultures have different variations of dessert. In modern times the variations of desserts have usually been passed down or come from geographical regions.  This is one cause for the variation of desserts.  These are some major categories in which desserts can be placed.<ref name="Book Review">{{cite news|last=Drzal|first=Dawn|title=How We Got to Dessert|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/how-we-got-to-dessert.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>

=== Cakes ===
[[File:German Chocolate Cake.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[German chocolate cake]], a layered cake filled and topped with a coconut-pecan frosting]]
{{Main|Cake}}
Cakes are sweet tender breads made with sugar and delicate flour.  Cakes can vary from light, airy sponge cakes to dense cakes with less flour. Common flavourings include [[Dried fruit|dried]], [[candied fruit|candied]] or fresh [[fruit]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[cocoa powder|cocoa]] or [[extract]]s. They may be filled with [[fruit preserves]] or dessert sauces (like [[custard|pastry cream]]), iced with [[buttercream]] or other icings, and decorated with [[marzipan]], piped borders, or candied fruit. Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, for example [[wedding cake|weddings]], [[Anniversary|anniversaries]], and [[birthday cake|birthdays]]. Small-sized cakes have become popular, in the form of [[cupcake]]s and [[petits four]]s.

=== Chocolates and candies ===
[[File:Valentines Day Chocolates from 2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Valentine's Day]] chocolates]]
{{Main|Chocolate|Candy}}
Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown, food preparation of ''[[Theobroma cacao]]'' seeds, roasted, ground, and often flavored. Pure, unsweetened chocolate contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate currently consumed is in the form of sweet chocolate, combining chocolate with sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids. Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture, with no milk or much less than milk chocolate.
{{See also|Types of chocolate}}

[[Candy]], also called sweets or lollies, is a [[confection]] that features [[sugar]] as a principal ingredient. Many candies involve the crystallization of sugar which varies the texture of sugar crystals.  Candies comprise many forms including [[caramel]], [[marshmallows]], and [[Taffy (candy)|taffy]].

=== Cookies or biscuits ===
{{Main|Cookie}}
Cookies, (from the Dutch word ''koekje'' meaning little cake),<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of cookie|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/cookie|work=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> also known as "biscuits" in many English-speaking countries, are flattish bite-sized or larger short pastries generally intended to be eaten out of the hand.

[[File:Ginger Milk Pudding.jpg|thumb|[[Ginger milk curd]], a type of Asian custard]]
{{Main|Custard|Pudding}}
These kinds of desserts usually include a thickened dairy base.  Custards are cooked and thickened with eggs.  Baked custards include [[crème brûlée]] and [[flan]].  [[Puddings]] are thickened with starches such as [[cornstarch]] or [[tapioca pudding|tapioca]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Carole|title=The essential baker : the comprehensive guide to baking with fruits, nuts, spices, chocolate, and other ingredients|date=2006|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-7645-7645-4|pages=672|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyR9VsqMvJsC&pg=PA12}}</ref>  Custards and puddings are often used as ingredients in other desserts, for instance as a filling for pastries or pies.

=== Deep-fried desserts ===
{{See also|List of doughnut varieties}}
Many cuisines include a dessert made of deep-fried starch-based batter or dough.  In many countries a [[doughnut]] is a flour-based batter that has been deep-fried. It is sometimes filled with custard or jelly.  [[Fritter]]s are fruit pieces in a thick batter that have been deep fried.  [[Gulab jamun]] is an Indian dessert made of milk solids kneaded into a dough, deep-fried, and soaked in honey.

=== Frozen desserts ===
[[File:Punjabi Kulfi.JPG|thumb|Punjabi [[Kulfi]], a type of ice cream]]
{{Main|Ice cream|Gelato|Sorbet|Shave ice}}
Ice cream, gelato, sorbet and shaved-ice desserts fit into this category.  Ice cream is a cream base that is churned as it is frozen to create a creamy consistency.  Gelato uses a milk base and has less air whipped in than ice cream, making it denser. Sorbet is made from churned fruit and is not dairy based. Shaved-ice desserts are made by shaving a block of ice and adding flavored syrup or juice to the ice shavings.

=== Jellied desserts ===
{{See also|Gelatin desserts}}
Jellied deserts are made with a sweetened liquid thickened with gelatin or another thickening agent.  They are traditional in many cultures.  [[Grass jelly]] and [[annin tofu]] are Chinese jellied desserts. [[Yōkan]] is a Japanese jellied dessert.  In English-speaking countries, many dessert recipes are [[gelatin dessert|based on gelatin]] with fruit and/or whipped cream added.

=== Pastries ===
{{Main|Pastry}}
Pastries are sweet baked pastry products. Pastries can either take the form of light and flaky bread with an airy texture, such as a [[croissant]] or unleavened dough with a high fat content and crispy texture, such as [[shortbread]].  Pastries are often flavored or filled with fruits, chocolate, nuts, and spices. Pastries are sometimes eaten with tea or coffee as a breakfast food.

=== Pies, cobblers, and clafoutis ===
{{Main|Pie|Cobbler (food)|Clafouti}}
Pies and cobblers are a crust with a filling.  The crust can be either made from either a pastry or crumbs.  Pie fillings range from fruits to puddings; cobbler fillings are generally fruit-based.  Clafoutis are a batter with fruit-based filling poured over the top before baking.

=== Sweet soups ===
[[File:Eggtongsui.jpg|thumb|[[Egg tong sui]]]]
{{Main|Tong sui}}
Tong sui, literally translated as "sugar water" and also known as tim tong, is a collective term for any sweet, warm [[soup]] or [[custard]] served as a [[dessert]] at the end of a meal in [[Cantonese cuisine]]. ''Tong sui'' are a Cantonese specialty and are rarely found in other [[Chinese cuisine|regional cuisines of China]].  Outside of Cantonese-speaking communities, soupy desserts generally are not recognized as a distinct category, and the term ''tong sui'' is not used.

== Market ==
The market for desserts has grown over the last few decades, which was greatly increased by the commercialism of baking desserts and the rise of food productions. Desserts are present in most restaurants as the popularity has increased.  Many commercial stores have been established as solely desserts stores. [[Ice cream parlor]]s have been around since before 1800.<ref name="ice cream">{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=History of Ice Cream|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/foodrelatedinventions/a/ice_cream.htm|publisher=About.com Inventors|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Many businesses started advertising campaigns focusing solely on desserts.  The tactics used to market desserts are very different depending on the audience for example desserts can be advertised with popular movie characters to target children.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Story|first=Mary|title=Food Advertising and Marketing Directed at Children and Adolescents in the US|pmc=416565|work=PMC|publisher=US National Library of Medicine|pmid=15171786|doi=10.1186/1479-5868-1-3|volume=1|date=Feb 2004|pages=3}}</ref>  The rise of companies like [[Food Network]] has marketed many shows which feature dessert and their creation.
