In many cases, nomination for office is mediated through<space/><link><target>preselection</target></link><space/>processes in organized political parties.<extension extension_name='ref'>Reuven Hazan, 'Candidate Selection', in Lawrence LeDuc, Richard Niemi and Pippa Norris (eds),<space/><italics>Comparing Democracies 2</italics>, Sage Publications, London, 2002</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Non-partisan systems tend to differ from partisan systems as concerns nominations. In a<space/><link><target>direct democracy</target></link>, one type of<space/><link><target>non-partisan democracy</target></link>, any eligible person can be nominated. In some non-partisan representative systems no nominations (or campaigning,<space/><link type='external' href='http://obatayam.com/wujudkan-pilkada-magetan-2013-yang-damai-dan-bersih/'>electioneering</link>, etc.) take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of votingwith some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirementin the jurisdiction. In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i.e., among the elected delegates).</paragraph><paragraph>As far as partisan systems, in some countries, only members of a particular<space/><link><target>political party</target></link><space/>can be nominated. Or, an eligible person can be nominated through a<space/><link><target>petition</target></link>; thus allowing him or her to be listed.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Electoral systems</heading><paragraph>Electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and<space/><link><target>voting system</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>that convert the vote into a political decision. The first step is to tally the votes, for which various<space/><link><target>vote counting systems</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>ballot</target></link><space/>types are used. Voting systems then determine the result on the basis of the tally. Most systems can be categorized as either<space/><link><target>Proportional representation</target><part>proportional</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>majoritarian</target></link>. Among the former are<space/><link><target>party-list proportional representation</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>additional member system</target></link>. Among the latter are<space/><link><target>First Past the Post electoral system</target><part>First Past the Post (FPP)</part></link><space/>(relative majority) and<space/><link><target>absolute majority</target></link>. Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as<space/><link><target>approval voting</target></link>,<space/><link><target>single transferable vote</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Instant-runoff voting</target><part>instant runoff voting</part></link><space/>or a<space/><link><target>Condorcet method</target></link>; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods.</paragraph><paragraph>While openness and<space/><link><target>accountability</target></link><space/>are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter's ballot are usually an important exception. The<space/><link><target>secret ballot</target></link><space/>is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Scheduling</heading><paragraph>The nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people, and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their<space/><link><target>mandate (politics)</target><part>mandate</part></link><space/>to continue in office. For that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals. In the United States, elections are held between every three and six years in most states, with exceptions such as the U.S.<space/><link><target>United States House of Representatives</target><part>House of Representatives</part></link>, which stands for election every two years. There is a variety of schedules, for example presidents: the<space/><link><target>President of Ireland</target></link><space/>is elected every seven years, the<space/><link><target>President of Russia</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>President of Finland</target></link><space/>every six years, the<space/><link><target>President of France</target></link><space/>every five years,<space/><link><target>President of the United States</target></link><space/>every four years.</paragraph><paragraph>Pre-determined or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability. However, they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns, and make<space/><link><target>dissolution of parliament</target><part>dissolving the legislature</part></link><space/>(parliamentary system) more problematic if the date should happen to fall at time when dissolution is inconvenient (e.g. when war breaks out). Other states (e.g., the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom</target></link>) only set maximum time in office, and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls. In practice, this means the government remains in power for close to its full term, and choose an election date it calculates to be in its best interests (unless something special happens, such as a<space/><link><target>motion of no-confidence</target></link>). This calculation depends on a number of variables, such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority.</paragraph><paragraph>Elections are usually held on one day. There are also<space/><link><target>advance poll</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>absentee voting</target></link>, which have a more flexible schedule. In Europe, a substantial proportion of votes are cast in advance voting.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Election campaigns</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Political campaign</arg></template>When elections are called, politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns.
