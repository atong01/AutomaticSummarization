In the 1930s, Carrel and<space/><link><target>Charles Lindbergh</target></link><space/>became close friends not only because of the years they worked together but also because they shared personal, political, and social views.

When Lindbergh saw the crudeness of Carrel's machinery, he offered to build new equipment for the scientist. Eventually they built the first perfusion pump, an invention instrumental to the development of organ transplantation and open heart surgery.

His large abdominal veins had been severed, and surgeons who treated the president felt that such veins were too large to be successfully reconnected. This left a deep impression on Carrel, and he set about developing new techniques for suturing blood vessels. The technique of &quot;triangulation&quot;, which was inspired by sewing lessons he took from an embroideress, is still used today. Julius Comroe wrote: &quot;Between 1901 and 1910, Alexis Carrel, using experimental animals, performed every feat and developed every technique known to vascular surgery today.&quot; He had great success in reconnecting arteries and veins, and performing surgical grafts, and this led to his Nobel Prize in 1912.<extension extension_name='ref' name="simmons"><template><target>Cite journal</target><arg name="title"><space/>Doctors and discoveries: lives that created today's medicine<space/></arg><arg name="author1">John G.

After the first six months, Carrel's colleague Albert Ebeling had actually taken charge of the cultures and published several papers about their development, until they were eventually discarded in 1946. Witkowski, in &quot;Dr. Carrel's immortal cells&quot;, op. cit., quotes Buchbaum's account. At the end Buchbaum writes that &quot;I told this story, of my visit to Carrel's laboratory, to various people. Dr. Bloom (<italics>Buchbaum's director of research in Chicago</italics>)refused to believe it. Others chuckled gleefully. Dr. Carrel was to blame only in that he did not keep on top of what was really going on in the laboratory (mostly, he wrote the papers). Dr. Parker and Dr. Ebeling probably suspected something, hence the &quot;retirement&quot;. In the interest of truth and science, the incident should have been thoroughly investigated. If it had been, some heads might have rolled, sacrificed to devotion to a wrong hypothesis - immortality of cell strains.&quot;. Witkowski also reports Dr. Margaret Murray, an early tissue culturist, telling him that &quot;one of Carrel's technicians of that time was passionately anti-fascist and detested Carrel's political and social ideas&quot; and expressing her belief that &quot;this technician would willingly have discredited Carrel scientifically if possible.&quot;.</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Honors</heading><paragraph>In 1972, the Swedish Post Office honored Carrel with a stamp that was part of its Nobel stamp series.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://nobelprize.org/nobel/stamps/1972.html'>The Nobel Stamps of 1972</link></extension><space/>In 1979, the<space/><link><target>lunar crater</target></link><space/><link><target>Carrel (crater)</target><part>Carrel</part></link><space/>was named after him as a tribute to his scientific breakthroughs.</paragraph><paragraph>In February 2002, as part of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh's birth, the Medical University of South Carolina at Charleston established the Lindbergh-Carrel Prize,<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://research.musc.edu/lindbergh/prize.htm'>Charles Lindbergh Symposium</link></extension><space/>given to major contributors to &quot;development of perfusion and bioreactor technologies for organ preservation and growth&quot;.<space/><link><target>Michael DeBakey</target></link><space/>and nine other scientists<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://research.musc.edu/lindbergh/laureates.htm'>Charles Lindbergh Symposium</link></extension><space/>received the prize, a bronze statuette<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.fondazionecarrel.org/carrel/1.htm'></link><space/>created for the event by the Italian artist C.
