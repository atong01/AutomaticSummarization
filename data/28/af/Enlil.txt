'''Enlil''' (nlin), íÇóíá∏ ([[EN (cuneiform)|EN = Lord]] + L√çL = Wind, "Lord (of the) Storm")<ref>Halloran, John A.; "Sumerian Lexicon: Version 3.0"; December 10th, 2006 at http://sumerian.org/sumerlex.htm</ref> is the god of breath, wind, loft and breadth (height and distance).<ref>[http://earth-history.com/Sumer/Clay-tablets.htm Clay Tablets from Sumer, Babylon and Assyria], Earth-history.com.  Neo-Sumerian inscriptions clay, Babylonia, 1900‚Äì1700 BC, image with translations on display.</ref> It was the name of a chief deity listed and written about in  [[Sumerian religion]], and later in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ([[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n), [[History of the Hittites|Hittite]], [[Canaan]]ite and other Mesopotamian clay and stone tablets. The name is perhaps pronounced and sometimes rendered in translations as "Ellil" in later Akkadian, Hittite, and Canaanite literature. In later Akkadian, Enlil is the son of [[Anshar]] and [[Kishar]].

==Origins==
The myth of [[Enlil and Ninlil]] discusses when Enlil was a young god, he was banished from [[Ekur]] in [[Nippur]], home of the gods, to [[Kur]], the underworld for seducing a goddess named [[Ninlil]]. Ninlil followed him to the underworld where she bore his first child, the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] (Sumerian Nanna/Suen). After fathering three more underworld-deities (substitutes for Sin), Enlil was allowed to return to the Ekur.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr121.htm | title = Enlil and Ninlil: translation | accessdate = 2013-12-21 | work = [[Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature]] | publisher = [[Oxford University]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Sumerian Mythology: A Review Article | journal = [[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]] | date = Apr 1946 | first = Thorkild | last = Jacobsen |authorlink = Thorkild Jacobsen |volume = 5 | issue = 2| id = | jstor = 542374 |pages=128‚Äì152 | accessdate = 2013-12-21 | doi=10.1086/370777}}</ref>

Enlil was known as the inventor of the [[mattock]] (a key agricultural pick, hoe, ax or digging tool of the Sumerians) and helped plants to grow.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Hooke | first1 = S.

==Cosmological role==
Enlil, along with [[Anu]]/An, [[Enki]] and [[Ninhursag]] were gods of the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]]s.<ref>[[Samuel Noah Kramer|Kramer, Samuel Noah]],  "The Sumerian Deluge Myth: Reviewed and Revised", [[Anatolian Studies]], Vol. 33, (1983), pp. 115-121.  {{jstor|3642699}}</ref>

By his wife [[Ninlil]] or Sud, Enlil was father of the moon god [[Nanna (Sumerian deity)|Nanna]]/[[Suen]] (in Akkadian, [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]]) and of [[Ninurta]] (also called Ningirsu). Enlil is the father of [[Nisaba]] the goddess of grain, of [[Pabilsag]] who is sometimes equated with Ninurta, and sometimes of [[Enbilulu]]. By [[Ereshkigal]] Enlil was father of [[Namtar]].

In one myth, Enlil gives advice to his son, the god [[Ninurta]], advising him on a strategy to slay the [[utukku|demon]] [[Asag]]. This advice is relayed to Ninurta by way of [[Sharur (mythological weapon)|Sharur]], his enchanted talking mace, which had been sent by Ninurta to the [[Dilmun|realm of the gods]] to seek counsel from Enlil directly.

==Cultural histories==
Enlil is associated with the ancient city of [[Nippur]], sometimes referred to as the cult city of Enlil.<ref>William W. Hallo, "Review: Enki and the Theology of Eridu", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', 116:2 (Apr.‚ÄìJun. 1996), p. 231‚Äì234</ref> His temple was named Ekur, "House of the Mountain."<ref>''Reallexikon der Assyriologie II'', p. 385.</ref> Such was the sanctity acquired by this edifice that Babylonian and [[Assyria]]n rulers, down to the latest days, vied with one another to embellish and restore Enlil's seat of worship. Eventually, the name Ekur became the designation of a temple in general.

Grouped around the main sanctuary, there arose temples and chapels to the gods and goddesses who formed his court, so that Ekur became the name for an entire sacred precinct in the city of Nippur. The name "mountain house" suggests a lofty structure and was perhaps the designation originally of the [[ziggurat|staged tower]] at Nippur, built in imitation of a mountain, with the sacred shrine of the god on the top.

Enlil was also known as the god of weather. According to the Sumerians, Enlil requested the creation of a slave race, but then got tired of their noise and tried to kill them by sending a flood. A mortal known as [[Utnapishtim]] survived the flood through the help of another god, [[Ea (god)|Ea]], and he was made immortal by Enlil after Enlil's initial fury had subsided.

As Enlil was the only god who could reach [[An (god)|An]], the god of heaven, he held sway over the other gods who were assigned tasks by his agent and would travel to Nippur to draw in his power. He is thus seen as the model for [[kingship]].<ref>Kingship in the Mediterranean world, p. 5162a Grottanelli and Mander,   Encyclopaedia of Religion, second edition 2005. Thomson Gale.</ref> Enlil was assimilated to the north "Pole of the Ecliptic".<ref>Jeremias, Alfred 1913. ''Handbuch der altorientalischen Geisteskultur''. Leipzig. p. 74.</ref> His sacred number name was 50.<ref>''Reallexikon der Assyriologie III''. G√∂tterzahlen. p. 500.</ref>

At a very early period prior to 3000 BC, Nippur had become the centre of a political district of considerable extent. Inscriptions found at Nippur, where extensive excavations were carried on during 1888‚Äì1900 by John P. Peters and [[John Henry Haynes]], under the auspices of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], show that Enlil was the head of an extensive [[Babylonian mythology|pantheon]]. Among the titles accorded to him are "king of lands", "king of heaven and earth", and "father of the gods".
