'''DDT''' ('''dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane''') is a colorless, [[Crystallinity|crystalline]], tasteless and almost odorless [[organochloride]] known for its [[Insecticide|insecticidal]] properties. DDT has been formulated in almost every conceivable form, including [[solution]]s in [[xylene]] or [[petroleum]] [[Distillation|distillates]], [[Emulsion|emulsifiable]] [[concentrate]]s, water-[[wettable powder]]s, granules, [[aerosol]]s, [[Smoke bomb|smoke candles]] and charges for vaporizers and lotions.<ref name=EHC83>{{EHC-ref | id = 83 | name = DDT and Its Derivatives: Environmental Aspects | date = 1989 | isbn = 92-4-154283-7 }}</ref>

First synthesized in 1874, DDT's insecticidal action was discovered by the Swiss chemist [[Paul Hermann Müller]] in 1939. It was then used in the second half of [[World War II]] to control [[malaria]] and [[typhus]] among civilians and troops. After the war, DDT was made available for use as an agricultural insecticide and its production and use duly increased.<ref name=EHC009>{{EHC-ref | id = 009 | name=DDT and its derivatives | date = 1979 | isbn = 92-4-154069-9 }}</ref> Müller was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods" in 1948.<ref name=nobel>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1948/ NobelPrize.org: The Nobel Prize in Physiology of Medicine 1948], accessed July 26, 2007.</ref>

In 1962, the book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] was published. It cataloged the environmental impacts of indiscriminate DDT [[Aerial application|spraying]] in the United States and questioned the logic of releasing large amounts of potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment without a sufficient understanding of their effects on [[ecology]] or human health. The book claimed that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause [[cancer]] and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the [[Environmentalism|environmental movement]] and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on the agricultural use of DDT in the United States.<ref name="Lear">{{cite book|author=Linda Lear|title=Rachel Carson: Witness for Nature|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=36euz6DjmwUC|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=978-0-547-23823-4}}</ref> A worldwide ban on its agricultural use was later formalized under the [[Stockholm Convention]], but its limited use in [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vector]] [[Vector control|control]] continues to this day and remains controversial,<ref name="Larson">{{cite journal |last=Larson |first=Kim |date=December 1, 2007 |title=Bad Blood |journal=On Earth |issue=Winter 2008 |url=http://www.onearth.org/article/bad-blood? |accessdate=June 5, 2008}}</ref><ref name=moyers>{{cite web |last=Moyers |first=Bill |author-link=Bill Moyers |title=Rachel Carson and DDT |date=September 21, 2007 |url=http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/09212007/profile2.html |accessdate=March 5, 2011 }}</ref> because of its effectiveness in reducing deaths due to malaria, which is countered by environmental and health concerns.

Along with the passage of the [[Endangered Species Act]], the US ban on DDT is cited by scientists as a major factor in the comeback of the [[bald eagle]] (the [[national bird of the United States]]) and the [[peregrine falcon]] from near-[[local extinction|extirpation]] in the [[contiguous United States]].<ref name="pmid17588911">{{cite journal | author = Stokstad E | title = Species conservation.

==Properties and chemistry==

DDT is similar in structure to the insecticide [[methoxychlor]] and the [[acaricide]] [[dicofol]]. Being highly [[hydrophobic]], it is nearly [[Solubility|insoluble]] in [[Water (molecule)|water]] but has good solubility in most [[Organic chemistry|organic]] [[solvent]]s, [[fat]]s and [[Oil (liquid)|oils]]. DDT does not occur naturally, but is produced by the reaction of [[trichloroethanal|chloral]] ({{chem|CCl|3|CHO}}) with [[chlorobenzene]] ({{chem|C|6|H|5|Cl}}) in the presence of [[sulfuric acid]] as a [[catalyst]]. Trade names that DDT has been marketed under include Anofex, Cezarex, Chlorophenothane, Clofenotane, Dicophane, Dinocide, Gesarol, Guesapon, Guesarol, Gyron, Ixodex, Neocid, Neocidol and Zerdane.<ref name=EHC009/>

===Isomers and related compounds===
[[File:o,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane.svg|thumb|''o,p' ''-DDT, a minor component in commercial DDT.]]
Commercial DDT is a mixture of several closely–related compounds. The major component (77%) is the ''[[Arene substitution patterns|p]]'',''p' '' [[isomer]] which is pictured at the top of this article. The ''o'',''p' '' isomer (pictured to the right) is also present in significant amounts (15%). [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene]] (DDE) and [[dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane]] (DDD) make up the balance. DDE and DDD are also the major [[metabolite]]s and breakdown products in the environment.<ref name=EHC009/> The term "'''total DDT'''" is often used to refer to the sum of all DDT related compounds (''p,p'-''DDT, ''o,p'-''DDT, DDE, and DDD) in a sample.

===Mechanism of insecticide action===
In insects it opens [[Sodium channel|sodium ion channels]] in [[neuron]]s, causing them to fire spontaneously, which leads to spasms and eventual death. Insects with certain [[mutation]]s in their sodium channel [[gene]] are resistant to DDT and other similar insecticides. DDT resistance is also conferred by up-regulation of genes expressing [[cytochrome P450]] in some insect species,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Denholm I, Devine GJ, Williamson MS | title = Evolutionary genetics.

DDT was first synthesized in 1874 by [[Othmar Zeidler]] under the supervision of [[Adolf von Baeyer]].<ref name=EHC009/><ref name="augustin">{{cite book |last=Augustin |first=Frank |title=Zur Geschichte des Insektizids Dichlordiphenyltrichloräthan (DDT) unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Leistung des Chemikers Paul Müller (1899–1965) url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hY5btwAACAAJ |year=1993 |publisher=Medizinische Fakultät der Universität Leipzig |location=Leipzig |pages=1–77}}</ref><!--Augustin claims that Baeyer synthesized it already in 1872--> It was further described in 1929 in a dissertation by W.

===Use in the 1940s and 1950s===
DDT is the best-known of several [[chlorine]]-containing pesticides used in the 1940s and 1950s. With [[pyrethrum]] in short supply, DDT was used extensively during [[World War II]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to control the insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of [[typhus]] – nearly eliminating the disease in many parts of [[Europe]]. In the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], it was sprayed aerially for malaria and dengue fever control with spectacular effects. While DDT's chemical and insecticidal properties were important factors in these victories, advances in application equipment coupled with a high degree of organization and sufficient manpower were also crucial to the success of these programs.<ref name="Dunlap">{{cite book|author=Thomas Dunlap|title=DDT: Scientists, Citizens, and Public Policy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PLL_AwAAQBAJ|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5385-4}}</ref>

In 1945, DDT was made available to farmers as an agricultural insecticide,<ref name=EHC009/> and it played a role in the final elimination of malaria in Europe and [[North America]].<ref name="Larson"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=de Zulueta J |title=The end of malaria in Europe: an eradication of the disease by control measures |journal=Parassitologia |volume=40 |issue=1-2 |pages=245–6 |date=June 1998  |pmid=9653750 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/elimination_us.html |title=CDC - Malaria - About Malaria - History - Elimination of Malaria in the United States (1947-1951) |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

In 1955, the [[World Health Organization]] commenced a program to eradicate malaria in countries with low to moderate transmission rates worldwide, relying largely on DDT for mosquito control and rapid diagnosis and treatment to reduce transmission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mendis K, Rietveld A, Warsame M, Bosman A, Greenwood B, Wernsdorfer WH |title=From malaria control to eradication: The WHO perspective |journal=Trop.

However, failure to sustain the program, increasing resistance of mosquito to DDT, and increasing parasite resistance led to a resurgence. In many areas early victories partially or completely reversed, and in some cases rates of transmission even increased.<ref name="pmid7278974">{{cite journal | author = Chapin G, Wasserstrom R | title = Agricultural production and malaria resurgence in Central America and India | journal = Nature | volume = 293 | issue = 5829 | pages = 181–5 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7278974 | doi = 10.1038/293181a0 }}</ref> The program was successful in eliminating malaria only in areas with "high socio-economic status, well-organized healthcare systems, and relatively less intensive or seasonal malaria transmission".<ref name="AmJTrop">{{cite journal | author = Sadasivaiah S, Tozan Y, Breman JG | title = Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) for Indoor Residual Spraying in Africa: How Can It Be Used for Malaria Control? | journal = Am.

DDT was less effective in tropical regions due to the continuous life cycle of mosquitoes and poor infrastructure. It was not applied at all in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] due to these perceived difficulties. Mortality rates in that area never declined to the same dramatic extent, and now constitute the bulk of malarial deaths worldwide, especially following the disease's resurgence as a result of resistance to drug treatments and the spread of the deadly malarial variant caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The goal of eradication was abandoned in 1969 and attention was instead focused on controlling and treating the disease. Spraying programs (especially using DDT) were curtailed due to concerns over safety and environmental effects, as well as problems in administrative, managerial and financial implementation.<ref name="pmid7278974"/> Efforts shifted from spraying to the use of [[Mosquito net|bednets]] impregnated with insecticides and other interventions.<ref name="AmJTrop"/><ref name="pmid16125595">{{cite journal | author = Rogan WJ, Chen A | title = Health risks and benefits of bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) | journal = Lancet | volume = 366 | issue = 9487 | pages = 763–73 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16125595 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67182-6 }}</ref>

===U.S. ban===
As early as the 1940s, scientists in the U.S. had begun expressing concern over possible hazards associated with DDT, and in the 1950s the government began tightening some of the regulations governing its use.<ref name=EPA1975/> However, these early events received little attention, and it was not until 1957, when the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported an unsuccessful struggle to restrict DDT use in [[Nassau County, New York]], that the issue came to the attention of the popular naturalist-author, [[Rachel Carson]]. [[William Shawn]], editor of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', urged her to write a piece on the subject, which developed into her famous book ''[[Silent Spring]]'', published in 1962. The book argued that [[pesticide]]s, including DDT, were poisoning both wildlife and the environment and were also endangering human health.<ref name="Lear"/> ''Silent Spring'' was a best seller, and public reaction to it launched the modern [[environmentalism|environmental movement]] in the United States. The year after it appeared, [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] ordered his Science Advisory Committee to investigate Carson's claims. The report the committee issued "add[ed] up to a fairly thorough-going vindication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring thesis," in the words of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'',<ref name="pmid17810673">{{cite journal|author=Greenberg DS |title=Pesticides: White House Advisory Body Issues Report Recommending Steps to Reduce Hazard to Public |journal=Science |volume=140 |issue=3569 |pages=878–9 |date=May 1963 |pmid=17810673 |doi=10.1126/science.140.3569.878 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17810673 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090628043549/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17810673 |archivedate=28 June 2009 }}</ref> and recommended a phaseout of "persistent toxic pesticides".<ref name="Michaels2008">{{cite book |last=Michaels |first=David |title=[[Doubt is Their Product]]: How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-530067-3}}</ref> DDT became a prime target of the growing anti-chemical and anti-pesticide movements, and in 1967 a group of scientists and lawyers founded the [[Environmental Defense|Environmental Defense Fund]] (EDF) with the specific goal of winning a ban on DDT. [[Victor Yannacone]], Charles Wurster, [[Art Cooley]] and others associated with inception of EDF had all witnessed bird kills or declines in bird populations and suspected that DDT was the cause. In their campaign against the chemical, EDF petitioned the government for a ban and filed a series of lawsuits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sue the Bastards |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910111-2,00.html |work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]] |date=October 18, 1971 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKxR0D6f |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Around this time, [[toxicologist]] [[David Peakall]] was measuring [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] levels in the eggs of [[peregrine falcons]] and [[California condor]]s and finding that increased levels corresponded with thinner shells.

In response to an EDF suit, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in 1971 ordered the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] to begin the de-registration procedure for DDT. After an initial six-month review process, [[William Ruckelshaus]], the Agency's first [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] rejected an immediate suspension of DDT's registration, citing studies from the EPA's internal staff stating that DDT was not an imminent danger to human health and wildlife.<ref name=EPA1975/> However, the findings of these staff members were criticized, as they were performed mostly by [[economic entomologist]]s inherited from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], who many environmentalists felt were biased towards agribusiness and tended to minimize concerns about human health and wildlife. The decision not to ban thus created public controversy.<ref name=Dunlap/>

The EPA then held seven months of hearings in 1971–1972, with scientists giving evidence both for and against the use of DDT. In the summer of 1972, Ruckelshaus announced the cancellation of most uses of DDT – an exemption allowed for public health uses under some conditions.<ref name=EPA1975/> Immediately after the cancellation was announced, both the EDF and the DDT manufacturers filed suit against the EPA, with the industry seeking to overturn the ban, and EDF seeking a comprehensive ban. The cases were consolidated, and in 1973 the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] ruled that the EPA had acted properly in banning DDT.<ref name=EPA1975/>

Some uses of DDT continued under the public health exemption.

In the 1970s and 1980s, agricultural use was banned in most developed countries, beginning with [[Hungary]] in 1968<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fvm.hu/main.php?folderID=1564&articleID=6169&ctag=articlelist&iid=1&part=2 |title=Selected passages from the history of the Hungarian plant protection administration on the 50th anniversary of establishing the county plant protection stations}}</ref> then in [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] in 1970, [[Germany]] and the United States in 1972, but not in the [[United Kingdom]] until 1984. By 1991 total bans on the use of DDT, including in disease control, were in place in at least 26 countries; for example Cuba in 1970, Singapore in 1984, Chile in 1985 and the Republic of Korea in 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pic.int/Portals/5/DGDs/DGD_DDT_EN.pdf |title=DDT, Decision Guidance Document, Joint FAO/UNEP Programme for the operation of Prior Informed Consent, UNEP/FAO, Rome, Italy, 1991.}}</ref>

The [[Stockholm Convention]], which took effect in 2004, outlawed several [[persistent organic pollutant]]s, and restricted DDT use to [[vector control]]. The Convention has been ratified by more than 170 countries and is endorsed by most environmental groups. Recognizing that total elimination in many malaria-prone countries is currently unfeasible because there are few affordable or effective alternatives, the convention exempts public health use within World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines from the ban.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/convention_text/UNEP-POPS-COP-CONVTEXT-FULL.English.PDF |title=Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.}}</ref> Resolution 60.18 of the World Health Assembly commits the World Health Organization to the Stockholm Convention's aim of reducing and ultimately eliminating the use of DDT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ipcs/capacity_building/ddt_statement/en/ |title=WHO.

==Environmental impact==
[[File:DDT to DDD and DDE.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Degradation of DDT to form DDE (by elimination of HCl, left) and DDD (by reductive dechlorination, right)]]

DDT is a [[persistent organic pollutant]] that is readily adsorbed to [[soil]]s and [[sediment]]s, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure contributing to terrestrial organisms.<ref name=EHC83/> Depending on conditions, its soil [[half life]] can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, [[photolysis]] and [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] [[biodegradation]]. Due to [[hydrophobic]] properties, in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water itself. Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also highly persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties.<ref name="ATSDRc5"/> DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer regions of the world to the [[Arctic]] by the phenomenon of [[global distillation]], where they then accumulate in the region's [[food web]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Grasshopper Effect and Tracking Hazardous Air Pollutants |journal=The Science and the Environment Bulletin |publisher=Environment Canada |issue=May/June 1998 |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/science/sandemay/PrintVersion/print2_e.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20040928235911/http://www.ec.gc.ca:80/science/sandemay/printversion/print2_e.html |archivedate=28 September 2004 }}</ref>

===Chronic toxicity===

DDT and DDE, like other organochlorines, have been shown to have [[estrogen|xenoestrogenic]] activity, meaning they are chemically similar enough to estrogens to trigger hormonal responses in animals. This [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupting]] activity has been observed in [[mouse|mice]] and [[rat]] toxicological studies, and available [[epidemiological]] evidence indicates that these effects may be occurring in humans as a result of DDT exposure. The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] states that DDT exposure damages the reproductive system and reduces reproductive success. These effects may cause developmental and reproductive toxicity:
* A review article in ''[[The Lancet]]'' states, "research has shown that exposure to DDT at amounts that would be needed in malaria control might cause preterm birth and early weaning ... toxicological evidence shows [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting]] properties; human data also indicate possible disruption in semen quality, menstruation, gestational length, and duration of lactation."<ref name="pmid16125595"/>

===Carcinogenicity===
In 2002, the Centers for Disease Control reported that "Overall, in spite of some positive associations for some cancers within certain subgroups of people, there is no clear evidence that exposure to DDT/DDE causes cancer in humans."<ref name="ATSDRc5"/> The NTP classifies it as "reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen," the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] classifies it as "probably carcinogenic to humans",<ref>http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr236_E.pdf</ref> and the EPA classifies DDT, DDE, and DDD as class B2 "probable" [[carcinogen]]s. These evaluations are based mainly on the results of animal studies.<ref name="ATSDRc5"/><ref name="pmid16125595"/>
 	
A 2005 Lancet review stated that occupational DDT exposure was associated with increased [[pancreatic cancer]] risk in 2 case control studies, but another study showed no DDE dose-effect association. Results regarding a possible association with [[liver cancer]] and biliary tract cancer are conflicting:  workers who did not have direct occupational DDT contact showed increased risk. White men had an increased risk, but not white women or black men.
Results about an association with  multiple myeloma, prostate and testicular cancer, endometrial cancer and colorectal cancer have been inconclusive or generally do not support an association.<ref name="pmid16125595"/>

A 2007 case control study using archived blood samples found that breast cancer risk was increased 5-fold among women who were born prior to 1931 and who had high serum DDT levels in 1963.

Its use in this context has been called everything from a "miracle weapon [that is] like [[Kryptonite]] to the mosquitoes,"<ref name=salon/> to "toxic colonialism."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Paull | first = John |title=Toxic Colonialism |journal=New Scientist |issue=2628 |page=25 |date=November 3, 2007 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626280.400-toxic-colonialism.html/}}</ref>

Before DDT, eliminating mosquito breeding grounds by drainage or poisoning with [[Paris green]] or [[pyrethrum]] was sometimes successful in fighting malaria. In parts of the world with rising living standards, the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation.<ref name="Gladwell"/> Today, a variety of usually simultaneous interventions is the norm. These include [[antimalarial drugs]] to prevent or treat infection; improvements in public health infrastructure to quickly diagnose, sequester, and treat infected individuals;  [[mosquito net|bednets]] and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans; and [[vector control]] strategies<ref name=wmr09/> such as [[larvacide|larvaciding]] with insecticides, ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae, and [[indoor residual spraying]] (IRS) with insecticides, possibly including DDT. IRS involves the treatment of all interior walls and ceilings with insecticides, and is particularly effective against mosquitoes, since many species rest on an indoor wall before or after feeding. DDT is one of 12 WHO–approved IRS insecticides.

WHO's anti-malaria campaign of the 1950s and 1960s relied heavily on DDT and the results were promising, though temporary. Experts tie the resurgence of malaria to multiple factors, including poor leadership, management and funding of malaria control programs; poverty; civil unrest; and increased [[irrigation]]. The evolution of resistance to first-generation drugs (e.g. [[chloroquine]]) and to insecticides exacerbated the situation.<ref name="DDTBP.1/2"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Feachem RG, Sabot OJ | title = Global malaria control in the 21st century: a historic but fleeting opportunity | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 20 | pages = 2281–4 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17519417 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.20.2281 | last2 = Sabot }}</ref> Resistance was largely fueled by often unrestricted agricultural use. Resistance and the harm both to humans and the environment led many governments to restrict or curtail the use of DDT in vector control as well as agriculture.<ref name="pmid7278974"/> In 2006 the WHO reversed a longstanding policy against DDT by recommending that it be used as an indoor pesticide in regions where malaria is a major problem.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/15/AR2006091501012.html |title=WHO Urges Use of DDT in Africa |date=September 16, 2006 |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

Once the mainstay of anti-malaria campaigns, as of 2008 only 12 countries used DDT, including India and some southern African states,<ref name=wmr09/> though the number is expected to rise.<ref name="DDTBP.1/2"/>

===Initial effectiveness of DDT against malaria===
When it was first introduced in World War II, DDT was very effective in reducing malaria [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name=Dunlap/> The WHO's anti-malaria campaign, which consisted mostly of spraying DDT and rapid treatment and diagnosis to break the transmission cycle, was initially very successful as well. For example, in [[Sri Lanka]], the program reduced cases from about one million per year before spraying to just 18 in 1963<ref>{{cite book |title=The Coming Plague |publisher=Virago Press |year=1994 |isbn=1-86049-211-8 |page=51 | last = Garrett | first = Laurie }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/health/28global.html Malaria: A Disease Close to Eradication Grows, Aided by Political Tumult in Sri Lanka], Donald G. McNeil Jr, ''The New York Times'', December 27, 2010.</ref> and 29 in 1964. Thereafter the program was halted to save money and malaria rebounded to 600,000 cases in 1968 and the first quarter of 1969. The country resumed DDT vector control but the mosquitoes had evolved resistance in the interim, presumably because of continued agricultural use. The program switched to [[malathion]], but despite initial successes, malaria continued its resurgence into the 1980s.<ref name="Gordon">{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Gordon A|title=Mosquitoes, Malaria, and Man: A History of the Hostilities Since 1880|publisher=Dutton|year=1978|isbn=978-0-525-16025-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Karunaweera ND, Galappaththy GN, Wirth DF |title=On the road to eliminate malaria in Sri Lanka: lessons from history, challenges, gaps in knowledge and research needs |journal=Malar.

Today, DDT remains on the WHO's list of insecticides recommended for IRS. Since the appointment of [[Arata Kochi]] as head of its anti-malaria division, WHO's policy has shifted from recommending IRS only in areas of seasonal or episodic transmission of malaria, to also advocating it in areas of continuous, intense transmission.<ref>
[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/index.html WHO |WHO gives indoor use of DDT a clean bill of health for controlling malaria]</ref> The WHO has reaffirmed its commitment to eventually phasing out DDT, aiming "to achieve a 30% cut in the application of DDT world-wide by 2014 and its total phase-out by the early 2020s if not sooner" while simultaneously combating malaria. The WHO plans to implement alternatives to DDT to achieve this goal.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/malaria_ddt_20090506/en/index.html Countries move toward more sustainable ways to roll back malaria]</ref>

South Africa is one country that continues to use DDT under WHO guidelines. In 1996, the country switched to alternative insecticides and malaria incidence increased dramatically. Returning to DDT and introducing new drugs brought malaria back under control.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yamey G | title = Roll Back Malaria: a failing global health campaign | journal = BMJ | volume = 328 | issue = 7448 | pages = 1086–1087 | date = May 8, 2004 | pmid = 15130956 | pmc = 406307 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.328.7448.1086 }}</ref> Malaria cases increased in [[South America]] after countries in that continent stopped using DDT.

===Mosquito resistance===
In some areas resistance has greatly reduced DDT's effectiveness. WHO guidelines require that absence of resistance must be confirmed before using the chemical.<ref name="IRS-WHO">

Resistance was noted early in spray campaigns. Paul Russell, a former head of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] Anti-Malaria campaign, observed in 1956 that "resistance has appeared after six or seven years."<ref name="Gladwell"/> Resistance has been detected in Sri Lanka, [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]] and [[Central America]], and it has largely been replaced by [[organophosphate]] or [[carbamate]] insecticides, ''e.g.'' malathion or [[bendiocarb]].<ref name="Curtis">C.F. Curtis, [http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/curtiscf.htm Control of Malaria Vectors in Africa and Asia]</ref>

In many parts of [[India]], DDT has also largely lost its effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sharma VP | title = Current scenario of malaria in India | journal = Parassitologia | volume = 41 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 349–53 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10697882 }}</ref> Agricultural uses were banned in 1989 and its anti-malarial use has been declining.

Studies of malaria-vector mosquitoes in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province]], [[South Africa]] found susceptibility to 4% DDT (the WHO susceptibility standard), in 63% of the samples, compared to the average of 86.5% in the same species caught in the open. The authors concluded that "Finding DDT resistance in the vector ''An. arabiensis'', close to the area where we previously reported pyrethroid-resistance in the vector ''An. funestus'' Giles, indicates an urgent need to develop a strategy of insecticide resistance management for the malaria control programmes of southern Africa."<ref name="Hargreaves">{{cite journal | author = Hargreaves K, Hunt RH, Brooke BD, Mthembu J, Weeto MM, Awolola TS, Coetzee M | title = Anopheles arabiensis and An. quadriannulatus resistance to DDT in South Africa | journal = Med.

DDT can still be effective against resistant mosquitoes,<ref name=PLoS1/> and the avoidance of DDT-sprayed walls by mosquitoes is an additional benefit of the chemical.<ref name="mrc"/> For example, a 2007 study reported that resistant mosquitoes avoided treated huts. The researchers argued that DDT was the best pesticide for use in IRS (even though it did not afford the most protection from mosquitoes out of the three test chemicals) because the others pesticides worked primarily by killing or irritating mosquitoes – encouraging the development of resistance to these agents.<ref name="PLoS1">{{cite journal | author = Grieco JP, Achee NL, Chareonviriyaphap T, Suwonkerd W, Chauhan K, Sardelis MR, Roberts DR | title = A new classification system for the actions of IRS chemicals traditionally used for malaria control | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = e716 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17684562 | pmc = 1934935 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000716 | editor1-last = Krishna | editor1-first = Sanjeev | last2 = Achee | last3 = Chareonviriyaphap | last4 = Suwonkerd | last5 = Chauhan | last6 = Sardelis | last7 = Roberts }} {{open access}}</ref> Others argue that the avoidance behavior slows the eradication of the disease.<ref name="Musawenkosi"/> Unlike other insecticides such as pyrethroids, DDT requires long exposure to accumulate a lethal dose; however its irritant property shortens contact periods. "For these reasons, when comparisons have been made, better malaria control has generally been achieved with pyrethroids than with DDT."<ref name="Curtis"/> In India, with its outdoor sleeping habits and frequent night duties, "the excito-repellent effect of DDT, often reported useful in other countries, actually promotes outdoor transmission."<ref>{{cite journal |title=DDT: The fallen angel | first=V.

===Residents' concerns===
{{main|Indoor residual spraying#Residents' opposition to IRS}}
IRS is effective if at least 80% of homes and barns in a residential area are sprayed.<ref name="IRS-WHO"/> Lower coverage rates can jeopardize program effectiveness.

===Human exposure===
A 1994 study found that compared to contemporaries living where DDT is not used, [[South Africa]]ns living in sprayed homes have levels that are several orders of magnitude greater.<ref name="PineRiver"/> [[Breast milk]] from South African mothers contains high levels of DDT and DDE.<ref name="PineRiver"/> It is unclear to what extent these levels arise from home spraying vs. residues in food. There is some evidence that these levels are associated with neurological abnormalities in babies.<ref name="Curtis"/>

Most studies of DDT's human health effects have been conducted in developed countries where DDT is not used and exposure is relatively low. Many experts urge that alternatives be used instead of IRS.<ref name="pmid16125595"/><ref name="PineRiver"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090504122058.htm |title=Unprecedented Use Of DDT Concerns Experts |last=Science Daily |date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=ScienceDaily.com |accessdate=May 30, 2009}}</ref>

Illegal diversion to agriculture is also a concern as it is almost impossible to prevent and its subsequent use on crops is uncontrolled.

===Criticism of restrictions on DDT use===

Criticisms of a DDT "ban" often specifically reference the 1972 US ban (with the erroneous implication that this constituted a worldwide ban and prohibited use of DDT in vector control). Reference is often made to [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''Silent Spring,'' even though she never pushed for a ban on DDT specifically.

It has also been alleged that donor governments and agencies have refused to fund DDT spraying, or made aid contingent upon not using DDT. According to a report in the ''British Medical Journal'', use of DDT in [[Mozambique]] "was stopped several decades ago, because 80% of the country's health budget came from donor funds, and donors refused to allow the use of DDT."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sidley P | title = Malaria epidemic expected in Mozambique | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7236 | page = 669 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10710569 | pmc = 1117705 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7236.669 }}</ref> Roger Bate asserts, "many countries have been coming under pressure from international health and environment agencies to give up DDT or face losing aid grants: Belize and Bolivia are on record admitting they gave in to pressure on this issue from [USAID]."<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidinthenews/articles/nr_051401.html |date=May 14, 2001 |journal=National Review|volume=LIII |issue=9 |first=Roger |last=Bate |title=A Case of the DDTs: The war against the war against malaria|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKxmunGp |archivedate=November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) has been the focus of much criticism. While the agency is currently funding the use of DDT in some African countries,<ref name="USAID">{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/id/malaria/techareas/irs.html |title=USAID Health: Infectious Diseases, Malaria, Technical Areas, Prevention and Control, Indoor Residual Spraying |publisher=USAID |accessdate=October 14, 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKxoMqlg |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref> in the past it did not. When [[John Stossel]] accused USAID of not funding DDT because it wasn't "politically correct," Anne Peterson, the agency's assistant administrator for global health, replied that "I believe that the strategies we are using are as effective as spraying with DDT ...

===Alternatives===

====Other insecticides====
{{main|Indoor residual spraying}}

[[Organophosphate]] and [[carbamate]]  insecticides, ''e.g.'' [[malathion]] and [[bendiocarb]], respectively, are more expensive than DDT per kilogram and are applied at roughly the same dosage. [[Pyrethroid]]s such as [[deltamethrin]] are also more expensive than DDT, but are applied more sparingly (0.02–0.3&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup> vs 1–2&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>), so the net cost per house is about the same over 6 months.<ref name="AmJTrop"/>

====Non-chemical vector control====
Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or curtailed in several tropical areas by removing or poisoning mosquito breeding grounds and larva habitats, for example by filling or applying oil to standing water. These methods have seen little application in Africa for more than half a century.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Killeen GF, Fillinger U, Kiche I, Gouagna LC, Knols BG | title = Eradication of Anopheles gambiae from Brazil: lessons for malaria control in Africa? | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = 618–27 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12383612 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(02)00397-3 | last2 = Fillinger | last3 = Kiche | last4 = Gouagna | last5 = Knols }}</ref> According to the United States CDC, such methods are not practical in Africa because "Anopheles gambiae, one of the primary vectors of malaria in Africa, breeds in numerous small pools of water that form due to rainfall.... It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict when and where the breeding sites will form, and to find and treat them before the adults emerge."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/vector_control.html |title=CDC - Malaria - Malaria Worldwide - How Can Malaria Cases and Deaths Be Reduced? - Larval Control and Other Vector Control Interventions |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The relative effectiveness of IRS (with DDT or alternative insecticides) versus other malaria control techniques (e.g. bednets or prompt access to anti-malarial drugs) varies greatly and is highly dependent on local conditions.<ref name="AmJTrop"/>

A WHO study released in January 2008 found that mass distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and [[artemisinin]]–based drugs cut malaria deaths in half in Rwanda and Ethiopia, countries with high malaria burdens. IRS with DDT did not play an important role in mortality reduction in these countries.<ref>[http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/ReportGFImpactMalaria.pdf Impact of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs) and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) measured using surveillance data in four African countries.] World Health Organization, January 31, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/01/MN4EUPS3D.DTL&type=health Malaria deaths halved in Rwanda and Ethiopia Better drugs, mosquito nets are the crucial tools], David Brown (Washington Post), ''SF Chronicle'', A-February 12, 1, 2008.</ref>

[[Vietnam]] has enjoyed declining malaria cases and a 97% mortality reduction after switching in 1991 from a poorly funded DDT-based campaign to a program based on prompt treatment, bednets, and pyrethroid group insecticides.<ref>[http://www.afronets.org/files/malaria.pdf World Health Organization, "A story to be shared: The successful fight against malaria in Vietnam," November 6, 2000.]</ref>

In Mexico, effective and affordable chemical and non-chemical strategies against malaria have been so successful that the Mexican DDT manufacturing plant ceased production due to lack of demand.<ref name="PMC1119118">{{cite web |url=http://www.ipen.org/ipenweb/documents/work%20documents/ddt_ipenreport_english.pdf |title=DDT & Malaria |accessdate=March 11, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5pt5PazSh |archivedate=May 21, 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

A review of fourteen studies on the subject in sub-Saharan Africa, covering insecticide-treated nets, residual spraying, chemoprophylaxis for children, chemoprophylaxis or intermittent treatment for pregnant women, a hypothetical vaccine, and changing front–line drug treatment, found decision making limited by the gross lack of information on the costs and effects of many interventions, the very small number of cost-effectiveness analyses available, the lack of evidence on the costs and effects of packages of measures, and the problems in generalizing or comparing studies that relate to specific settings and use different methodologies and outcome measures. The two cost-effectiveness estimates of DDT residual spraying examined were not found to provide an accurate estimate of the cost-effectiveness of DDT spraying; furthermore, the resulting estimates may not be good predictors of cost-effectiveness in current programs.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goodman CA, Mills AJ | title = The evidence base on the cost-effectiveness of malaria control measures in Africa | journal = Health Policy and Planning | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–312 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10787646 | doi = 10.1093/heapol/14.4.301 | url = http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/14/4/301.pdf | format = PDF | last2 = Mills }}</ref>

However, a study in Thailand found the cost per malaria case prevented of DDT spraying ($1.87 US) to be 21% greater than the cost per case prevented of [[lambda-cyhalothrin]]–treated nets ($1.54 US),<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kamolratanakul P, Butraporn P, Prasittisuk M, Prasittisuk C, Indaratna K | title = Cost-effectiveness and sustainability of lambdacyhalothrin-treated mosquito nets in comparison to DDT spraying for malaria control in western Thailand | journal = American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 279–84 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11693869 | last2 = Butraporn | last3 = Prasittisuk | last4 = Prasittisuk | last5 = Indaratna }}</ref> at very least casting some doubt on the unexamined assumption that DDT was the most cost-effective measure to use in all cases. The director of Mexico's malaria control program finds similar results, declaring that it is 25% cheaper for Mexico to spray a house with synthetic pyrethroids than with DDT.<ref name="PMC1119118"/> However, another study in South Africa found generally lower costs for DDT spraying than for impregnated nets.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goodman CA, Mnzava AE, Dlamini SS, Sharp BL, Mthembu DJ, Gumede JK | title = Comparison of the cost and cost-effectiveness of insecticide-treated bednets and residual house-spraying in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa | journal = Trop.

A more comprehensive approach to measuring cost-effectiveness or efficacy of malarial control would not only measure the cost in dollars of the project, as well as the number of people saved, but would also consider ecological damage and negative aspects of insecticide use on human health. One preliminary study regarding the effect of DDT found that it is likely the detriment to human health approaches or exceeds the beneficial reductions in malarial cases, except perhaps in malarial epidemic situations. It is similar to the earlier mentioned study regarding estimated theoretical infant mortality caused by DDT and subject to the criticism also mentioned earlier.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.jcu.edu.au/jrtph/vol/v04corin.pdf |format=PDF |last1=Corin |first1=S.E. |last2=Weaver |first2=S.A. |year=2005 |title=A risk analysis model with an ecological perspective on DDT and malaria control in South Africa |journal=Journal of Rural and Tropical Public Health |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=21–32}}</ref>

A study in the [[Solomon Islands]] found that "although impregnated bed nets cannot entirely replace DDT spraying without substantial increase in incidence, their use permits reduced DDT spraying."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Over M, Bakote'e B, Velayudhan R, Wilikai P, Graves PM | title = Impregnated nets or DDT residual spraying?

A comparison of four successful programs against malaria in Brazil, India, Eritrea, and Vietnam does not endorse any single strategy but instead states, "Common success factors included conducive country conditions, a targeted technical approach using a package of effective tools, data-driven decision-making, active leadership at all levels of government, involvement of communities, decentralized implementation and control of finances, skilled technical and managerial capacity at national and sub-national levels, hands-on technical and programmatic support from partner agencies, and sufficient and flexible financing."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Barat LM | title = Four malaria success stories: how malaria burden was successfully reduced in Brazil, Eritrea, India, and Vietnam | journal = Am.

DDT resistant mosquitoes have generally proved susceptible to pyrethroids. Thus far, pyrethroid resistance in ''Anopheles'' has not been a major problem.<ref name="Curtis"/>
