While his drumming style was a significant element in the band's success, Grohl saw himself as just another in a long line of drummers. Though Grohl had been writing songs for several years, he declined to introduce most of his songs to the band as he was in awe of Cobain's songs and did not want to pollute Cobain's writing process. Instead, he compiled and recorded them himself, releasing a cassette called<space/><italics><link><target>Pocketwatch (album)</target><part>Pocketwatch</part></link></italics><space/>in 1992 on indie label Simple Machines. Rather than using his own name, Grohl released the cassette under the pseudonym &quot;Late!&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters {{!}} Extended interview â€“ Lollapalooza 2011</arg><arg name="url">http://timeoutchicago.com/music-nightlife/14873935/dave-grohl-of-foo-fighters-extended-interview-lollapalooza-2011</arg><arg name="work">[[Time Out Chicago]]</arg><arg name="publisher">Time Out Group</arg><arg name="accessdate">March 26, 2013</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In the later years of Nirvana, Grohl's songwriting contributions increased. In Grohl's initial months in Seattle, Cobain overheard him working on a song called &quot;Color Pictures of a Marigold&quot;, and the two subsequently worked on it together. Grohl would later record the song for the<space/><italics>Pocketwatch</italics><space/>cassette. Grohl stated in a 2014 episode of<space/><italics><link><target>Sonic Highways</target></link></italics><space/>that Cobain reacted by kissing him upon first hearing a demo of &quot;<link><target>Alone + Easy Target</target></link>&quot; that Grohl had recently recorded. During the sessions for<space/><italics><link><target>In Utero (album)</target><part>In Utero</part></link></italics>, Nirvana decided to re-record &quot;Color Pictures of a Marigold&quot; released this version as a B-side on the &quot;<link><target>Heart-Shaped Box</target></link>&quot; single, titled simply &quot;Marigold&quot;. Grohl also contributed the main guitar riff for &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot;. Cobain admitted in a late 1993 MTV interview that he initially thought the riff was &quot;kind of boneheaded&quot;, but was gratified at how the song developed (a process captured in part in a demo on the Nirvana box set<space/><italics><link><target>With the Lights Out</target></link></italics>). Cobain noted that he was excited at the possibility of having Novoselic and Grohl contribute more to the band's songwriting.</paragraph><paragraph>Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at<space/><link><target>Robert Lang Studios</target></link><space/>in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. The duo completed several of Grohl's songs, including future<space/><link><target>Foo Fighters</target></link><space/>songs &quot;Exhausted&quot;, &quot;<link><target>Big Me</target></link>&quot;, &quot;February Stars&quot;, and &quot;Butterflies&quot;.
