== Early life ==
David Eric Grohl was born in [[Warren, Ohio]], the son of Virginia Jean (née Hanlon), a teacher, and James Harper Grohl, at the time a newswriter.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ks1JAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HYUMAAAAIBAJ&dq=virginia-hanlon-teacher-troth-told-is-bride-of-news&pg=5088%2C3102676 |title=Virginia Hanlon, Teacher, is Bride of News Writer |newspaper=[[The Vindicator]] |location=[[Youngstown, Ohio]]|date=January 28, 1961|volume=LXXII|number=151|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref> He has [[Slovak American|Slovak]], [[Germans|German]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Apter|first=Jeff|title=The Dave Grohl Story|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gbnpNc_TZt0C&pg=PT21|accessdate=May 27, 2014|date=November 5, 2009|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-021-2|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Brannigan|first=Paul|title=This Is a Call: The Life and Times of Dave Grohl|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fPEo7gRnlSQC&pg=PT12|accessdate=May 27, 2014|date=September 29, 2011|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0-00-739124-0|page=12}}</ref> When he was a child, Grohl's family moved from Warren, to [[Springfield, Virginia]].

At the age of twelve, Grohl began learning to play guitar. He grew tired of lessons and instead taught himself, and he eventually began playing in bands with friends.<ref name="Grohl-  drummerworld" /><ref name=azerrad148>{{cite book|last=Azzerrad|first=Michael|title=Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana.|publisher=Doubleday|year=1993|page=148|isbn=0-385-47199-8}}</ref> A year later, Grohl and his sister spent the summer in [[Evanston, Illinois]], at their cousin Tracy's house. Tracy introduced them to [[punk rock]] by taking the pair to shows by a variety of punk bands. His first concert was [[Naked Raygun]] at [[The Cubby Bear]] in Chicago in 1982 when he was 13 years old.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ganz|first=Jacob|title=Dave Grohl: How To Make An Arena Feel Like A Punk Club|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/04/07/133965436/dave-grohl-how-to-make-an-arena-feel-like-a-punk-club?|work=The Record|publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref> "From then on we were totally punk", Grohl recalled. "We went home and bought ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' and tried to figure it all out".<ref name=azerrad148/>

In Virginia, Grohl attended [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] as a freshman. He was elected vice president of his freshman class and in that capacity would manage to play bits of songs by punk bands like [[Circle Jerks]] and [[Bad Brains]] over the school intercom before his morning announcements. Grohl's mother decided that he should transfer to [[Bishop Ireton High School]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] because his cannabis use was affecting his grades. He stayed there two years, beginning with a repeat of first year. After his second year, he transferred yet again, to [[Annandale High School]].<ref name=azerrad148 />

While in high school, Grohl played in several local bands, including a stint as guitarist in a band called Freak Baby. It was during this period that Grohl taught himself to play drums.<ref name="Grohl-  drummerworld" /> When Freak Baby kicked out its bass player, Grohl decided to switch to drums, and the reconstituted band renamed themselves Mission Impossible.<ref name=azerrad148/> During his developing years as a drummer, Grohl cited [[John Bonham]] as his greatest influence, and eventually had Bonham's [[:Image:Zoso John Bonham sigil three intersecting circles.svg|three-circle logo]] tattooed on his wrist.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dave-grohl-reveals-tales-behind-his-trio-of-led-zeppelin-tattoos-20091116 |title=Dave Grohl Reveals Tales Behind His Trio of Led Zeppelin Tattoos |journal=Rolling Stone |date=November 16, 2009 |accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref> Mission Impossible later rebranded themselves Fast before breaking up, after which Grohl joined the [[post-punk]]-influenced [[hardcore punk]] band [[Dain Bramage]].<ref>Azerrad, p. 149</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~gravityboy/bramage/history.html|title=Dain Bramage ... The Band|publisher=Dain Bramage|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>

Many of Grohl's early influences were gained at the [[9:30 club]], a live music venue in [[Washington D.C.]]: "I went to the 9:30 club hundreds of times. I was always so excited to get there, and I was always bummed when it closed. I spent my teenage years at the club and saw some shows that changed my life".<ref name=freedom>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/16/AR2010041602110.html|title=Welcome to the Club: An oral history of D.C.'s 9:30 club on its 30th anniversary|date=April 18, 2010|work=[[The Washington Post|Washington Post Magazine]]|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>

Grohl in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', "They don't understand that when I was 15 and had ''[[Zen Arcade]]'', that's when I decided that I loved this music. For me to do anything else for the sole reason of doing something different would be so contrived".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/21/foo-fighters-dave-grohl-rocks-backpages-nirvana-1995-everett-true|title=The Guardian: Foo Fighters Dave Grohl: 'The fuck I'm going to become a drummer-for-hire'|date=May 21, 2014|accessdate=February 8, 2015|website=|publisher=|last=True|first=Everett}}</ref>

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2013}}
=== Scream (1986–1990) ===
[[File:Dave Grohl 1991.jpg|thumb|left|Dave Grohl with Scream, 1990]]
{{Main|Scream (band)}}
At the age of seventeen, Grohl auditioned with local DC favorites [[Scream (band)|Scream]] to fill the vacancy left by the departure of drummer [[Kent Stax]]. In order to be considered for the position, Grohl lied about his age, claiming he was 20.<ref>Lynskey, Dorian. "[http://www.fooarchive.com/features/arena2002.htm The Man Who Fell To Earth]". ''Arena''. December 2002.</ref> To Grohl's surprise, the band asked him to join. After waffling for a brief period, Grohl accepted the offer. Grohl dropped out of high school in his junior year; he said, "I was seventeen and extremely anxious to see the world, so I did it."<ref>Azerrad, p. 150</ref> Over the next four years, Grohl toured extensively with the band, recording a couple of live albums (their show of May 4, 1990 in Alzey, Germany being released by Tobby Holzinger as [[Your Choice Live Series Vol.10]]) and two studio albums, ''[[No More Censorship]]'' and ''[[Fumble (album)|Fumble]]'', on which Grohl penned and sang vocals on the song "Gods Look Down".

While playing in Scream, Grohl became a fan of [[Melvins]] and eventually befriended the band. During a 1990 tour stop on the West Coast, Melvins' [[Buzz Osborne]] took a couple of his friends, [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Krist Novoselic]], to see the band.<ref>Levin, Hannah [http://www.houstonpress.com/events/the-melvins-1334315/ "The Melvins"]. houstonpress.com. August 27, 2009.</ref>

=== Nirvana (1990–1994) ===
{{Main|Nirvana (band)}}
A few months later, Scream unexpectedly disbanded mid-tour following the departure of its bassist Ben Pape, who left to join [[The Four Horsemen (band)|The Four Horsemen]]. Grohl called Osborne for advice; Osborne informed him that Nirvana were looking for a drummer and gave Grohl the phone numbers of Cobain and Novoselic, who subsequently invited Grohl to Seattle to audition for Nirvana. Grohl soon joined the band full-time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sproul|first=Kris|author2=Ziegler, Mike|title=Nirvana Live Guide – 1990|work=Nirvana Live Guide|url=http://www.nirvanaguide.com/1990.php|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref>

At the time that Grohl joined Nirvana, the band had already recorded several demos for the follow-up to their debut album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', having spent time recording with producer [[Butch Vig]] in [[Wisconsin]]. Initially, the plan was to release the album on [[Sub Pop]], but the band received a great deal of interest based on the demos. Grohl spent the initial months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]]. In the spring of 1991, the band entered [[Sound City Studios]] in Los Angeles to record ''[[Nevermind (album)|Nevermind]]'' (as seen in Grohl's 2013 documentary ''[[Sound City (film)|Sound City]]'').

Upon its release, ''[[Nevermind]]'' exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Drummer: 100 Years of Rhythmic Power and Invention|p=253|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2010|isbn=978-1-476-85589-9}}</ref> At the same time, Grohl was struggling with his status in the band. While his drumming style was a significant element in the band's success, Grohl saw himself as just another in a long line of drummers. Though Grohl had been writing songs for several years, he declined to introduce most of his songs to the band as he was in awe of Cobain's songs and did not want to pollute Cobain's writing process. Instead, he compiled and recorded them himself, releasing a cassette called ''[[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]]'' in 1992 on indie label Simple Machines. Rather than using his own name, Grohl released the cassette under the pseudonym "Late!".<ref>{{cite web|title=Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters {{!}} Extended interview – Lollapalooza 2011|url=http://timeoutchicago.com/music-nightlife/14873935/dave-grohl-of-foo-fighters-extended-interview-lollapalooza-2011|work=[[Time Out Chicago]]|publisher=Time Out Group|accessdate=March 26, 2013}}</ref>

In the later years of Nirvana, Grohl's songwriting contributions increased. In Grohl's initial months in Seattle, Cobain overheard him working on a song called "Color Pictures of a Marigold", and the two subsequently worked on it together. Grohl would later record the song for the ''Pocketwatch'' cassette. Grohl stated in a 2014 episode of ''[[Sonic Highways]]'' that Cobain reacted by kissing him upon first hearing a demo of "[[Alone + Easy Target]]" that Grohl had recently recorded. During the sessions for ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'', Nirvana decided to re-record "Color Pictures of a Marigold" released this version as a B-side on the "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]" single, titled simply "Marigold". Grohl also contributed the main guitar riff for "Scentless Apprentice". Cobain admitted in a late 1993 MTV interview that he initially thought the riff was "kind of boneheaded", but was gratified at how the song developed (a process captured in part in a demo on the Nirvana box set ''[[With the Lights Out]]''). Cobain noted that he was excited at the possibility of having Novoselic and Grohl contribute more to the band's songwriting.

Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. The duo completed several of Grohl's songs, including future [[Foo Fighters]] songs "Exhausted", "[[Big Me]]", "February Stars", and "Butterflies". On the third day of the session, Cobain finally arrived, and the band recorded a demo of a song later named "[[You Know You're Right]]". It was the band's final studio recording.

Nirvana (Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl) were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on April 10, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockhall.com/blog/post/2014-rock-hall-induction-ceremony-special-guests/ |title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Announces Special Guests for the 29th Annual Induction Ceremony at Barclays Center &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref>

=== Foo Fighters (1994–present) ===
{{Main|Foo Fighters}}
Following Cobain's death in April 1994, Grohl retreated, unsure of where to go and what to do with himself. In October 1994, Grohl scheduled studio time, again at Robert Lang Studios, and quickly recorded a fifteen-track demo. With the exception of a single guitar part on "X-Static" played by [[Greg Dulli]] of the [[Afghan Whigs]], Grohl performed all of the instruments himself.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=David|title=Dave Grohl: From Antsy Student to Nirvana to Foo Fighters|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/this-is-a-call-the-life-and-times-of-dave-grohl-by-paul-brannigan-book-review.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 20, 2012}}</ref>

At the same time, Grohl wondered if his future might be in drumming for other bands. In November, Grohl took a brief turn with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], including a performance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Petty asked him to join permanently, but Grohl declined.<ref name="Brannigan2011">{{cite book|author=Paul Brannigan|title=This Is a Call: The Life and Times of Dave Grohl|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-iAW8G_IND0C&pg=PA236|accessdate=March 26, 2013|year=2011|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81956-8|pages=236}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dave Grohl's Classic Rock Credentials|url=http://news.radio.com/2013/03/14/dave-grohl-classic-rock-credentials/|work=SnT Radio.com|accessdate=March 26, 2013}}</ref> He was also rumored as a possible replacement for [[Pearl Jam]] drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]] and even performed with the band for a song or two at three shows during Pearl Jam's March 1995 Australian tour. However, by then, Pearl Jam had already settled on ex- [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Jack Irons]], and Grohl had other solo plans in the works.<ref name="Jam2011">{{cite book|author=Pearl Jam|title=Pearl Jam Twenty|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M89kbBxGK4MC&pg=PA148|accessdate=March 26, 2013|date=September 13, 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-6940-7|pages=148}}</ref><ref name="Cross2012">{{cite book|author=Alan Cross|title=Pearl Jam: the secret history|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ordeqqbm378C&pg=PT28|accessdate=March 26, 2013|date=June 26, 2012|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-1-927002-19-3|pages=28}}</ref>

After passing the demo around, Grohl found himself with considerable major label interest. Nirvana's [[A&R]] rep Gary Gersh had subsequently taken over as president of [[Capitol Records]] and lured Grohl to sign with the label. Grohl did not want the effort to be considered the start of a solo career, so he recruited other band members: former Germs and touring Nirvana guitarist [[Pat Smear]] and two members of the recently disbanded [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[William Goldsmith]] (drums) and [[Nate Mendel]] (bass). Rather than re-record the album, Grohl's demo was given a professional mix by [[Rob Schnapf]] and [[Tom Rothrock]] and was released in July 1995 as Foo Fighters' [[Foo Fighters (album)|debut album]].

During a break between tours, the band entered the studio and recorded a cover of [[Gary Numan]]'s "[[Down in the Park]]". In February 1996, Grohl and his then-wife [[Jennifer Youngblood]] made a brief [[cameo appearance]] on  ''[[The X-Files]]'' third season episode "[[Pusher (The X-Files)|Pusher]]".

After touring for the self-titled album for more than a year, Grohl returned home and began work on the soundtrack to the 1997 movie ''[[Touch (1997 film)|Touch]]''. Grohl performed all of the instruments and vocals himself, save for vocals from [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]] singer [[Louise Post]] on the title track, keyboards by Barrett Jones (who also co-produced the record) on one track, and vocals and guitar by [[X (U.S. band)|X's]] [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] on "This Loving Thing (Lynn's Song)". Grohl completed the recording in two weeks, and immediately joined Foo Fighters to work on their follow-up.

In the midst of the initial sessions for Foo Fighters' second album, tension emerged between Grohl and Goldsmith. According to Goldsmith, "Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one. [...] It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else". Goldsmith also believed that Capitol and producer Gil Norton wanted Grohl to drum on the album.<ref name="roberts">Roberts, Michael. "[http://bestof.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day Bring Back that Sunny Day]". ''Miami New Times''. December 3, 1998.</ref> With the album seemingly complete, Grohl headed home to Virginia with a copy of the rough mixes, and found himself unhappy with the results. Grohl penned a few new songs, recording one of them, "[[Walking After You]]", by himself at a studio in Washington, DC. Inspired by the session, Grohl opted to move the band, without Goldsmith's knowledge,<ref name="roberts" /> to Los Angeles to re-record most of the album with Grohl behind the kit. After the sessions were complete, Goldsmith officially announced his departure from the band.

Speaking in 2011 about the tension surrounding the departure of Goldsmith, Grohl explained that "there were a lot of reasons it didn't work out, but there was also a part of me that was like, you know, I don't know if I'm finished playing the drums yet". He also stated that "I wish that I would have handled things differently".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWhsYINKcKM#t=2m56s|title=Oxegen 2011 – Foo Fighters Dave Grohl|publisher=YouTube|date=July 10, 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Dave Grohl in London.jpg|thumb|upright|Dave Grohl on stage, 2006]]
The effort was released in May 1997 as the band's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'', which eventually cemented Foo Fighters as a staple of rock radio. The album spawned several hits, including "[[Everlong]]", "[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]", and "[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]". Just prior to the album's release, former [[Alanis Morissette]] drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band on drums. The following September, Smear (a close friend of [[Jennifer Youngblood]]) left the band,<ref name="guardian" /> citing a need to settle down following a lifetime of touring. Smear was subsequently replaced by Grohl's former [[Scream (band)|Scream]] bandmate [[Franz Stahl]]. Stahl departed the band prior to recording of Foo Fighters' third album<ref name="guardian" /> and was replaced by touring guitarist [[Chris Shiflett]], who later became a full-fledged member during the recording of ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.

Grohl's life of non-stop touring and travel continued with Foo Fighters' popularity. During his infrequent pauses he lived in [[Seattle]] and Los Angeles before returning to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. It was there that he turned his basement into a recording studio where the 1999 album ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' was recorded.<ref name=back>{{cite video|author=[[James Moll|Moll, James]] (director)|title=[[Back and Forth (documentary)|Back and Forth]]|year=2011|medium=documentary|publisher=RCA}}</ref>

In 2000, the band recruited [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] to add some guitar flourish to a cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Have a Cigar]]", a song which Foo Fighters previously recorded as a b-side. The friendship between the two bands resulted in Grohl and Taylor Hawkins being asked to induct Queen into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dave Grohl and Taylor Hawkins induct Queen|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/queen/transcript/dave-grohl-and-taylor-hawkins-/|work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}</ref> Grohl and Hawkins joined May and Queen drummer [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] to perform "[[Tie Your Mother Down]]", with Grohl<!-- Grohl sang at the 2001 induction&nbsp;— Hawkins did not sing the song until later performances. --> standing in on vocals for [[Freddie Mercury]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Foo Fighters joined by Queen legends|url=http://www.nme.com/news/nme/23362|work=[[NME]]|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}</ref> May later contributed guitar work for the song "Tired of You" on the ensuing Foo Fighters album, as well as on an unreleased Foo Fighters song called "Knucklehead".

Near the end of 2001, Foo Fighters returned to the studio to work on their fourth album. After four months in the studio, with the sessions finished, Grohl accepted an invitation to join [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and helped them to record their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. (Grohl can be seen drumming for the band in the video for the song "[[No One Knows]]".) After a brief tour through North America, Britain and Japan with the band<ref name="guardian" /> and feeling rejuvenated by the effort, Grohl recalled the other band members to completely re-record their album at his studio in Virginia. The effort became their fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''. While initially pleased with the results, in another 2005 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Dave Grohl admitted to not liking the record: "Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it".<ref>Scaggs, Austin. [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7281787/foos_reclaim_their_honor "Foos Reclaim Their Honor"]. Rolling Stone. April 29, 2005.</ref>

On November 23, 2002, Grohl achieved a historical milestone by replacing himself on the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Modern Rock]] chart, when "[[You Know You're Right]]" by Nirvana was replaced by "[[All My Life (Foo Fighters song)|All My Life]]" by Foo Fighters. When "All My Life" ended its run, after a one-week respite, "[[No One Knows]]" by Queens of the Stone Age took the number one spot. Between October 26, 2002 and March 1, 2003 Grohl was in the number one spot on the Modern Rock charts for 17 of 18 successive weeks, as a member of three different groups.

Grohl and Foo Fighters released their fifth album ''[[In Your Honor]]'' on June 14, 2005. Prior to starting work on the album, the band spent almost a year relocating Grohl's home-based Virginia studio to a brand new facility, dubbed [[Studio 606]], located in a warehouse near Los Angeles. Featuring collaborations with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Josh Homme]] of [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and [[Norah Jones]], the album was a departure from previous efforts, and included one rock and one acoustic disc.

Foo Fighters's sixth studio album ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'' was released on September 25, 2007. It was recorded during a three-month period between March 2007 and June 2007, and its release was preceded by the first single "[[The Pretender (Foo Fighters song)|The Pretender]]" on September 17. The second single, "[[Long Road to Ruin]]", was released on December 3, 2007, followed by the third single, "[[Let It Die (song)|Let It Die]]", June 24, 2008.

== Additional projects and contributions ==
Apart from his main bands, Grohl has been involved in other music projects. In 1992, he played drums on [[Buzz Osborne]]'s [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]-styled solo-EP ''[[King Buzzo (album)|King Buzzo]]'', where he was credited as ''Dale Nixon'', a pseudonym that [[Greg Ginn]] adopted to play bass on [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag's]] ''[[My War]]''. He also released the music cassette [[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]] under the pseudonym ''Late!'' on the now defunct indie label, [[Simple Machines]].

In 1993, Grohl was recruited to help recreate the music of [[The Beatles]]' early years for the movie ''[[Backbeat (film)|Backbeat]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Cast and Credits for Backbeat (1994)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106339/fullcredits|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=March 18, 2010}}</ref> he played drums in an "all-star" lineup that included [[Greg Dulli]] of the [[Afghan Whigs]], indie producer [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]], [[Mike Mills]] of [[R.E.M.]], [[Thurston Moore]] of [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Dave Pirner]] of [[Soul Asylum]]. A music video was filmed for the song "[[Money (That's What I Want)|Money]]" while Grohl was with Nirvana on their 1994 European tour, footage of Grohl was filmed later and included.

Later in 1994, Grohl played drums on two tracks for [[Mike Watt]]'s ''[[Ball-Hog or Tugboat?]]''. In early 1995, Grohl and Foo Fighters played their first US tour opening for Watt, and helped make up Watt's supporting band. Nicknamed the "Ringspiel" tour, Watt's band featured Grohl and William Goldsmith on drums, [[Eddie Vedder]] and Pat Smear on guitar, and Watt on bass.

During the early 2000s, Grohl spent time in his basement studio writing and recording a number of songs for a [[Heavy metal music|metal]] project. Over the span of several years, he recruited his favorite metal vocalists from the 1980s, including [[Lemmy]] of [[Motörhead]], [[Conrad Lant|Conrad "Cronos" Lant]] from [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[King Diamond]], [[Scott Weinrich]], Snake of [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]] and [[Max Cavalera]] of [[Sepultura]], to perform the vocals for the songs. The project was released in 2004 under the [[moniker]] [[Probot (band)|Probot]].<ref>D'Angelo, Joe .

Grohl has been vocal in his views on drug misuse, contributing to a 2009 anti-drug video for the [[BBC]]. "I have never done cocaine, ever in my life. I have never done heroin, I have never done speed," he said in a 2008 interview, adding that he had stopped smoking [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and taking [[LSD]] at the age of 20. In the BBC video he said, "I've seen people die. It ain't easy being young, but that stuff doesn't make it any easier".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8634675/Foo-Fighters-Dave-Grohl-kicks-brawler-out-of-Roundhouse-concert.html|title=Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl kicks brawler out of Roundhouse concert|accessdate=July 29, 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=July 13, 2011|location=London|first=James|last=Lachno}}</ref>

In May 2006, Grohl sent a note of support to the two trapped miners in the [[Beaconsfield mine collapse]] in [[Tasmania]], Australia. In the initial days following the collapse, one of the men requested an [[iPod]] with Foo Fighters album ''[[In Your Honor]]'', to be sent down to them through a small hole. Grohl's note read, in part, "Though I'm halfway around the world right now, my heart is with you both, and I want you to know that when you come home, there's two tickets to any Foos show, anywhere, and two cold beers waiting for yo<!-- Grohl's written statement included the word "yous".
