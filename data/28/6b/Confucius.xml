Virtuous action towards others begins with virtuous and sincere thought, which begins with knowledge. A virtuous disposition without knowledge is susceptible to corruption and virtuous action without sincerity is not true righteousness. Cultivating knowledge and sincerity is also important for one's own sake; the superior person loves learning for the sake of learning and righteousness for the sake of righteousness.</paragraph><paragraph>The Confucian theory of ethics as exemplified in<space/><italics><link><target>Li (Confucian)</target><part>L</part></link></italics><space/>(<template><target>lang</target><arg>zh</arg><arg>禮</arg></template>) is based on three important conceptual aspects of life: (a) ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types, (b) social and political institutions, and (c) the etiquette of daily behavior. It was believed by some that<space/><italics>l</italics><space/>originated from the heavens, but Confucius stressed the development of<space/><italics>l</italics><space/>through the actions of sage leaders in human history. His discussions of<space/><italics>l</italics><space/>seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society, rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony.</paragraph><paragraph>In the early Confucian tradition,<space/><italics>l</italics><space/>was doing the proper thing at the proper time, balancing between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an ethical social fabric, and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good. Training in the<space/><italics>l</italics><space/>of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when<space/><italics>l</italics><space/>must be adapted in light of situational contexts.</paragraph><paragraph>In Confucianism, the concept of<space/><italics>li</italics><space/>is closely related to<space/><italics>y</italics><space/>(<template><target>lang</target><arg>zh</arg><arg>義</arg></template>), which is based upon the idea of reciprocity.<space/><italics>Y</italics><space/>can be translated as<space/><link><target>righteousness</target></link>, though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context.

He explained that this is one of the most important analects: &quot;If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good.&quot; (Translated by<space/><link><target>James Legge</target></link>) in the<space/><link><target>Great Learning</target></link><space/>(<template><target>lang</target><arg>zh</arg><arg>大學</arg></template>). This &quot;sense of shame&quot; is an internalisation of<space/><link><target>duty</target></link>, where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in<space/><link><target>Legalism (philosophy)</target><part>Legalism</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Confucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days, and urged the Chinese, particularly those with political power, to model themselves on earlier examples.

Because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as a revival of the ordered society of earlier times, Confucius is often considered a great proponent of<space/><link><target>conservatism</target></link>, but a closer look at what he proposes often shows that he used (and perhaps twisted) past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own: a revival of a unified royal state, whose rulers would succeed to power on the basis of their moral merits instead of lineage. These would be rulers devoted to their people, striving for personal and social<space/><link><target>perfection</target></link>, and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules.</paragraph><paragraph>Confucius did not believe in the concept of &quot;<link><target>democracy</target></link>&quot;, which is itself an<space/><link><target>Athens</target><part>Athenian</part></link><space/>concept unknown in ancient China, but could be interpreted by Confucius' principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them, or that anyone is capable of self-government.

In discussing the relationship between a king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must give advice to their superiors if the superiors were considered to be taking the course of action that was wrong.

This tradition was interrupted for several decades in mainland China, where the official stance of the Communist Party and the State was that Confucius and Confucianism represented reactionary<space/><link><target>Feudalism</target><part>feudalist</part></link><space/>beliefs which held that the subservience of the people to the<space/><link><target>Aristocracy (class)</target><part>aristocracy</part></link><space/>is a part of the natural order.

Kong Zhu refused, and gave up the title, so the northern branch of the family kept the title of Duke Yansheng. The southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day.
