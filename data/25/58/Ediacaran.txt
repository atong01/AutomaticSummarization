The '''Ediacaran''' Period {{IPAc-en|iː|d|i|ˈ|æ|k|ər|ə|n}}, named after the [[Ediacara Hills]] of [[South Australia]], is the last geological [[period (geology)|period]] of the [[Neoproterozoic]] Era and of the [[Proterozoic]] Eon, immediately preceding the [[Cambrian]] Period, the first period of the [[Paleozoic]] Era and of the [[Phanerozoic]] Eon.

The Ediacaran Period's status as an official geological period was ratified in 2004 by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS), making it the first new geological period declared in 120 years.<ref name=Knoll2004a/><ref name=Knoll2004>{{cite journal

==Ediacaran and Vendian==

The Ediacaran Period overlaps, but is shorter than the '''Vendian''' Period, a name that was earlier, in 1952, proposed by Russian geologist and [[paleontologist]] [[Boris Sergeyevich Sokolov|Boris Sokolov]]. The Vendian concept was formed stratigraphically top-down, and the lower boundary of the Cambrian became the upper boundary of the Vendian.<ref name= Sokolov1952>{{cite journal

The Vendian in its type area consists of large subdivisions such as Laplandian, [[Redkino]], [[Kotlin Island|Kotlin]] and [[Rovno]] Regional stages with the globally traceable subdivisions and their boundaries, including its lower one.

The Redkino, Kotlin and Rovno regional stages have been substantiated in the type area of the Vendian on the basis of the abundant organic-walled [[microfossil]]s, megascopic algae, [[metazoan]] body fossils and [[ichnofossil]]s.<ref name=Sokolov1997/><ref name=SokolovFedonkin1984>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1134/S0869593808060014| title = The Yudomian of Siberia, Vendian and Ediacaran systems of the International stratigraphic scale| year = 2008| last1 = Khomentovsky | first1 = V.

The lower boundary of the Vendian could have a [[biostratigraphic]] substantiation as well taking into consideration the worldwide occurrence of the [[Pertatataka Formation|Pertatataka]] assemblage of giant acanthomorph [[acritarch]]s.<ref name=Fedonkin2007/>

==Boundaries of the Ediacaran==

The Ediacaran Period (ca. 635-542 Mya) represents the time from the end of global [[Marinoan glaciation]] to the first appearance worldwide of somewhat complicated trace fossils (''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' (Seilacher, 1955)).<ref name=Knoll2004a>A. Knoll, M. Walter, G. Narbonne, and N. Christie-Blick (2004) "[http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/ediacaran/Knoll_et_al_2004a.pdf The Ediacaran Period: A New Addition to the Geologic Time Scale.]" Submitted on Behalf of the Terminal Proterozoic Subcommission of the International Commission on Stratigraphy.</ref>

Although the Ediacaran Period does contain soft-bodied [[fossil]]s, it is unusual in comparison to later periods because its beginning is not defined by a change in the fossil record. Rather, the beginning is defined at the base of a chemically distinctive [[carbonate]] layer that is referred to as a "[[cap carbonate]]," because it caps glacial deposits.

This bed is characterized by an unusual depletion of <sup>13</sup>[[Carbon|C]] that indicates a sudden climatic change at the end of the [[Marinoan]] [[ice age]]. The lower boundary [[GSSP]] of the Ediacaran is at the base of the cap carbonate (Nuccaleena Formation), immediately above the Elatina [[diamictite]] in the Enorama Creek section, Brachina Gorge, Flinders Ranges, South Australia.

The [[GSSP]] of the upper boundary of the Ediacaran is the lower boundary of the Cambrian on the SE coast of Newfoundland approved by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as a preferred alternative to the base of the [[Tommotian]] Stage in [[Siberia]] which was selected on the basis of the ichnofossil ''Treptichnus pedum'' (Seilacher, 1955). In the history of stratigraphy it was the first case of usage of bioturbations for the System boundary definition.

Nevertheless, the definitions of the lower and upper boundaries of the Ediacaran on the basis of chemostratigraphy and [[ichnofossil]]s are disputable.<ref name=Fedonkin2007/><ref name=Comments2004>Comments By B. S. Sokolov, M. A. Semikhatov, And M. A. Fedonkin.

Cap carbonates generally have a restricted geographic distribution (due to specific conditions of their precipitation){{vague|date=June 2013}} and usually siliciclastic sediments replace laterally the cap carbonates in a rather short distance and cap carbonates do not occur above every tillite elsewhere{{clarify|reason=location not specified|date=May 2013}} in the world.

The C-isotope chemostratigraphic characteristics obtained for contemporaneous cap carbonates in different parts of the world may be variable in a wide range owing to different degrees of secondary alteration of carbonates, dissimilar criteria used for selection of the least altered samples, and, as far as the C-isotope data are concerned, due to primary lateral variations of δ <sup>l3</sup>C<sub>carb</sub> in the upper layer of the ocean.<ref name=Fedonkin2007/><ref name= Bristow2008>{{cite journal

As to the ''Treptichnus pedum'', a reference ichnofossil for the lower boundary of the Cambrian, its usage for the stratigraphic detection of this boundary is always risky, because of the occurrence of very similar trace fossils belonging to the Treptichnids group well below the level of ''T. pedum'' in [[Namibia]], [[Spain]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and possibly, in the [[western United States]]. The stratigraphic range of ''T. pedum'' overlaps the range of the Ediacaran fossils in Namibia, and probably in Spain.<ref name=Fedonkin2007/><ref name= Ragozina2007>A. Ragozina, D. Dorjnamjaa, A.

==Absolute dating==
No [[Absolute dating|dating]] has been possible at the type section of the Ediacaran Period in South Australia.  Therefore, the age range of 635 to 542 million years before the present is based on correlations to other countries where dating has been possible. The base age of approximately 635 million years ago is based on U-Pb ([[uranium]]-[[lead]]) [[isochron dating]] from [[Namibia]]<ref name=Hoffmann2004>{{cite journal

Applying this age to the base of the Ediacaran assumes that individual cap carbonates are synchronous around the world and that the correct cap carbonate layers have been correlated between Australian and Namibia. This is controversial because an age of about 580 million years has been obtained in association with glacial rocks in [[Tasmania]] which some scientists tentatively correlate with those just beneath the Ediacaran rocks of the Flinders Ranges.<ref name=Calver2004>{{cite journal

==Biota==
{{main|Ediacara biota}}

The fossil record from this period is sparse, as more easily fossilized hard-shelled animals had yet to evolve. The Ediacaran biota include the oldest definite [[multicellular organism]]s with tissues, and the most common types resemble segmented worms, fronds, disks, or immobile bags.

Ediacara biota bear little resemblance to modern lifeforms, and their [[biological classification|relationship]] even with the later lifeforms of the [[Cambrian explosion]] is rather difficult to interpret. More than 100 [[List of Ediacaran genera|genera]] have been described, and well known forms include ''[[Arkarua]]'', ''[[Charnia]]'', ''[[Dickinsonia]]'', ''[[Ediacaria]]'', ''[[Marywadea]]'', ''[[Onega (fossil)|Onega]]'', ''[[Pteridinium]]'', and ''[[Yorgia]]''.

There is evidence that Earth's first mass extinction happened during this period when early animals changed the environment.<ref>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150902123456.htm Science Daily</ref>

== Documentaries ==
A few English language documentaries have featured the Ediacaran era and biota:
* [[The Time Traveller's Guide To Australia]] (2012, ABC Network Australia; Part 1 of 4).
* The Geological History of Canada, as part of [[The Nature of Things]] series, CBC-SRC; 2011; Eastern Canada.
* The first episode of a BBC documentary titled [[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]], with [[David Attenborough]] as narrator.
* Another documentary narrated by [[David Attenborough]] titled [[First Life (TV series)|First Life]] featuring ''[[Charnia]]'', ''[[Dickinsonia]]'', ''[[Spriggina]]'', ''[[Funisia]]'', and ''[[Kimberella]]'' animated in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].
