Compiled and drafted by scribes and clergymen, these accounts were written in Latin and served as written collections of the deeds and miracles attributed to the saint, both during his or her life or after death. The canonization of a saint, especially one who had lived on the fringes of the medieval Christian world like Saint Columba, required a well-written hagiography to be submitted to Rome, but popular belief and local cults of sainthood often led to the veneration of these men and women without official approval from the Catholic Church.</paragraph><paragraph>Writing a century after the death of Saint Columba, the author<space/><link><target>Adomnn</target></link><space/>(also known as Eunan), served as the ninth Abbot of Iona until his death in 704 A.D.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01135c.htm'>CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Adamnan (Eunan)</link>.

Most of the short chapters begin with Saint Columba informing his fellow monks that a person will soon arrive on the island or an event will immanently occur.</paragraph><paragraph>In one notable instance, Columba appears in a dream to King Oswald of Northumbria, and announces the king's incoming victory against the King Catlon (Cadwallon of Wales) in the Battle of Heavenfield. The people of Britain promise to convert to Christianity and receive baptism after the conclusion of the war. This victory signals the re-Christianization of pagan England, and establishes King Oswald as ruler of the entirety of Britain.</paragraph><paragraph>Columba's other prophecies can be considered vindictive at times, as when he sends a man named Batain off to perform his penance, but then Columba turns to his friends and says Batain will instead return to Scotia and be killed by his enemies. Several of Saint Columba's prophecies reflect the scribal culture in which he was immersed, such his miraculous knowledge of the missing letter &quot;I from Baithene's psalter or when he prophecies that an eager man will knock over his inkhorn and spill its contents.<extension extension_name='ref'>Book one, Chapter 17</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Book two (Of his Miraculous Powers)</heading><paragraph>In the second book, Columba performs various miracles such as healing people with diseases, expelling malignant spirits, subduing wild beasts, calming storms, and even returning the dead to life.</paragraph><paragraph>He also performs agricultural miracles that would hold a special significance to the common people of Ireland and the British Isles, such as when he casts a demon out of a pail and restores the spilt milk to its container.</paragraph><paragraph>The Vita contains a story that has been interpreted as the first reference to the Loch Ness Monster. According to Adomnn, Columba came across a group of Picts burying a man who had been killed by the monster. Columba saves a swimmer from the monster with the sign of the Cross and the imprecation, &quot;Thou shalt go no further, nor touch the man; go back with all speed.&quot; The beast flees, terrified, to the amazement of the assembled Picts who glorified Columba's God. Whether or not this incident is true, Adomnan's text specifically states that the monster was swimming in the River Ness the river flowing from the loch rather than in Loch Ness itself.<extension extension_name='ref'>Book two, Chapter 28</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Book three (The Apparitions of Angels)</heading><paragraph>In book three, Adomnn describes different apparitions of the Saint, both that Columba receives and those that are seen by others regarding him. He mentions that, &quot;For indeed after the lapse of many years, ... St. Columba was excommunicated by a certain synod for some pardonable and very trifling reasons, and indeed unjustly&quot; (P.79- 80).</paragraph><paragraph>In one of the accounts, Saint Columba, in this period of excommunication, goes to a meeting held against him in Teilte. Saint Brendan, despite of all the negative reactions among the seniors toward Columba, kisses him reverently and assures that Columba is the man of God and that he sees Holy Angels accompanying Columba on his journey through the plain.<extension extension_name='ref'>Book three, Chapter 3</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In the last Chapter, Columba foresees his own death when speaking to his attendant:<space/><extension extension_name='blockquote'>This day in the Holy Scriptures is called the Sabbath, which means rest. And this day is indeed a Sabbath to me, for it is the last day of my present laborious life, and on it I rest after the fatigues of my labours; and this night at midnight, which commenceth the solemn Lord's Day, I shall, according to the sayings of Scripture, go the way of our fathers. For already my Lord Jesus Christ deigneth to invite me; and to Him, I say, in the middle of this night shall I depart, at His invitation. For so it hath been revealed to me by the Lord himself.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>And when the bell strikes midnight, Columba goes to the church and kneels beside the altar. His attendant witnesses heavenly light in the direction of Columba, and Holy angels join the saint in his passage to the Lord:<space/><extension extension_name='blockquote'>And having given them his holy benediction in this way, he immediately breathed his last. After his soul had left the tabernacle of the body, his face still continued ruddy, and brightened in a wonderful way by his vision of the angels, and that to such a degree that he had the appearance, not so much of one dead, as of one alive and sleeping.<extension extension_name='ref'>Book three, Chapter 23</extension></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Other early sources of Columba's life</heading><paragraph>Both the<space/><italics>Vita Columbae</italics><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Bede</target><part>Venerable Bede</part></link><space/>(672/673-735) record Columba's visit to<space/><link><target>Bridei I of the Picts</target><part>Bridei</part></link>.
