In addition, he was a songwriter and music producer, usually as Ellas McDaniel, and had cameo appearances in movies.

Night after night in New York he sat in the Apollo transfixed by the pounding rhythms, the dancing and prancing, the sexual spectacle of rhythm-and-blues masters like Bo Diddley...In 1955, Elvis's stage presence was still rudimentary. But watching Bo Diddley charge up the Apollo crowd undoubtedly had a profound effect on him. When he returned to New York a few months later for his first national television appearance, on Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey's "Stage Show," he again spent hours at the Apollo after rehearsals. On the Dorsey show Elvis shocked the entire country with his outrageous hip-shaking performance, and the furor that followed made him an American sensation.</arg></template></extension><space/><link><target>Buddy Holly</target></link>,<space/><link><target>the Beatles</target></link>,<extension extension_name='ref' name="independent_bo"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="last">Brown</arg><arg name="first">Jonathan</arg><arg name="title">Bo Diddley, guitarist who inspired the Beatles and the Stones, dies aged 79</arg><arg name="url">http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bo-diddley-guitarist-who-inspired-the-beatles-and-the-stones-dies-aged-79-838868.html</arg><arg name="accessdate">April 26, 2012</arg><arg name="newspaper">[[The Independent]]</arg><arg name="date">June 3, 2008</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name='Rock Hall'></extension><space/><link><target>the Rolling Stones</target></link>,<space/><link><target>the Yardbirds</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Eric Clapton</target></link>,<extension extension_name='ref' name="Mick"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://showbizspy.com/news/06032008/mick-jagger-leads-tribute-for-diddley<space/></arg><arg name="title">Mick Jagger Leads Tribute For Diddley<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">October 27, 2008<space/></arg><arg name="last">WENN<space/></arg><arg name="date">June 3, 2008<space/></arg><arg name="work">showbizspy.com</arg></template></extension><space/><link><target>the Who</target></link>,<space/><link><target>the Animals</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Pink Floyd</target></link>,<space/><link><target>the Velvet Underground</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Jimi Hendrix</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Parliament Funkadelic</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>the Jesus and Mary Chain</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>He instigated<space/><link><target>Bo Diddley beat</target><part>a constant driving rhythm</part></link><space/>and biting electric guitar sound which he applied to a wide range of songs.

Here is the count as a one-bar phrase:<space/><bold>One</bold><space/>e and<space/><bold>ah</bold>, two e<space/><bold>and</bold><space/>ah, three e<space/><bold>and</bold><space/>ah,<space/><bold>four</bold><space/>e and ah.

(Bo Diddley song)</target><part>Who Do You Love?</part></link>&quot;) often have no<space/><link><target>chord (music)</target><part>chord</part></link><space/>changes; that is, the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece, so that the rhythms create the excitement, rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic<space/><link><target>tension (music)</target><part>tension and release</part></link>. In his other recordings, Bo Diddley used a variety of rhythms, from straight<space/><link><target>beat (music)</target><part>back beat</part></link><space/>to<space/><link><target>Popular music</target><part>pop</part></link><space/><link><target>ballad</target></link><space/>style to<space/><link><target>doo-wop</target></link>, frequently with maracas by Jerome Green.</paragraph><paragraph>Also an influential guitar player, he developed many special effects and other innovations in tone and attack. Bo Diddley's trademark instrument was the rectangular-bodied<space/><link><target>Gretsch</target></link><space/>nicknamed the &quot;Twang Machine&quot; (referred to as &quot;cigar-box shaped&quot; by music promoter<space/><link><target>Dick Clark</target></link>). Although he had other odd-shaped guitars custom-made for him by other manufacturers throughout the years, most notably the &quot;Cadillac&quot; and the rectangular &quot;Turbo 5-speed&quot; (with built-in envelope filter, flanger and delay) designs made by Tom Holmes (who also made guitars for ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, among others), Diddley fashioned the square guitar himself around 1958 and wielded it in thousands of concerts over the years. In a 2005 interview on<space/><link><target>Triple J</target><part>JJJ</part></link><space/>radio in Australia, Bo implied that the design sprang from an embarrassing moment. During an early gig, while jumping around on stage with a<space/><link><target>Gibson L5</target></link><space/>guitar, he landed awkwardly hurting his groin.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/boone_m1035862.mp3<space/></arg><arg name="title">Mp3 file : Jay and the Doctor<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Abc.net.au<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2015-03-13</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/bodidleytw_m1035870.mp3<space/></arg><arg name="title">Mp3 file : Jay and the Doctor<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Abc.net.au<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2015-03-13</arg></template></extension><space/>He then went about designing a smaller, less restrictive guitar that allowed him to keep jumping around on stage while still playing his guitar.

The song &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; was based on the African American clapping rhyme &quot;<link><target>Juba dance</target><part>Hambone</part></link>&quot; (which in turn was based on the<space/><link><target>lullaby</target></link><space/>&quot;<link><target>Hush Little Baby</target></link>&quot;).

The<space/><link><target>roots of hip hop</target><part>rap</part></link>-style boasting of &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;, a wordplay on<space/><link><target>hoodoo (folk magic)</target><part>hoodoo</part></link>, used many striking lyrics from the African-American tradition of<space/><link><target>Deejay (Jamaican)</target><part>toasts</part></link><space/>and boasts. His &quot;Say Man&quot; and &quot;Say Man, Back Again,&quot; both of which were later cited as progenerators of hip-hop music, share a strong connection to the insult game known as &quot;<link><target>the dozens</target></link>&quot;.
