'''Bo Diddley''' (December 30, 1928 – June 2, 2008), born '''Ellas Otha Bates''' but changed as a child to '''Ellas McDaniel''', was an American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Chicago Blues]] vocalist and guitarist. In addition, he was a songwriter and music producer, usually as Ellas McDaniel, and had cameo appearances in movies.  He was nicknamed '''The Originator''' because of his key role in the transition from the [[blues]] to [[rock and roll]], and [[rock music|rock]], and influenced a host of acts, including [[Elvis Presley]],<ref>{{Cite book|last= Fox |first= Ted |title= Showtime at the Apollo |publisher= Da Capo |year= 1983 |isbn= 978-0-306-80503-5 |pages=5 & 92 |quote=Elvis Presley, a young, still raw hayseed, was making his first trip to the Big Apple to see his new record company, and the Apollo was where he wanted to be. Night after night in New York he sat in the Apollo transfixed by the pounding rhythms, the dancing and prancing, the sexual spectacle of rhythm-and-blues masters like Bo Diddley...In 1955, Elvis's stage presence was still rudimentary. But watching Bo Diddley charge up the Apollo crowd undoubtedly had a profound effect on him. When he returned to New York a few months later for his first national television appearance, on Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey's "Stage Show," he again spent hours at the Apollo after rehearsals. On the Dorsey show Elvis shocked the entire country with his outrageous hip-shaking performance, and the furor that followed made him an American sensation.}}</ref> [[Buddy Holly]], [[the Beatles]],<ref name="independent_bo">{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|title=Bo Diddley, guitarist who inspired the Beatles and the Stones, dies aged 79|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bo-diddley-guitarist-who-inspired-the-beatles-and-the-stones-dies-aged-79-838868.html|accessdate=April 26, 2012|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=June 3, 2008}}</ref><ref name='Rock Hall'/> [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Yardbirds]], [[Eric Clapton]],<ref name="Mick">{{cite web |url=http://showbizspy.com/news/06032008/mick-jagger-leads-tribute-for-diddley |title=Mick Jagger Leads Tribute For Diddley |accessdate=October 27, 2008 |last=WENN |date=June 3, 2008 |work=showbizspy.com}}</ref> [[the Who]], [[the Animals]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[the Velvet Underground]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Parliament Funkadelic]], and [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]].

==Life==

===Early life and career===
Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]], as Ellas Otha Bates,<ref>Some sources give his name as Otha Ellas Bates.</ref> he was adopted and raised by his mother's cousin, Gussie McDaniel, whose surname he assumed. In 1934, the McDaniel family moved to the largely black [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] area of Chicago, where the young Ellas dropped the name Otha and became simply Ellas McDaniel.   In Chicago, he was an active member of the local Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he studied the [[trombone]] and the violin, becoming proficient enough on the violin for the musical director to invite him to join the orchestra, with which he performed until the age of 18. However, he was more taken by the pulsating, rhythmic music he heard at a local [[Pentecostal Church]], and became interested in the guitar.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2066171/Bo-Diddley.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Bo Diddley Bo Diddley, who has died aged 79, was one of the most important influences in the development of popular music, even though for much of his career he was seldom in the charts or in the recording studio. | date=June 2, 2008 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsimon.com/diddley.htm |title=Bo Diddley Page |publisher=Tsimon.com |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

Inspired by a [[John Lee Hooker]] performance,<ref name='Rock Hall'/> he supplemented his work as a carpenter and mechanic by [[busking|playing on street corners]] with friends, including Jerome Green (c. 1934–1973),<ref>{{cite web|author=David Blakey |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Originator_2/jerome.html |title=Jerome Green |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}</ref> in the '''Hipsters''' band, later renamed the '''Langley Avenue Jive Cats'''. Green would become a near-constant member of McDaniel's backing band, the two often trading joking insults with each other during live shows.<ref name="SoundsShow">{{cite news |title= The R&B Show |first= Martin |last= Hayman |newspaper=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]] |publisher= Spotlight Publications |date= August 28, 1971|page= 13}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}  During the summer of 1943–1944, he played at the [[Maxwell Street]] market in a band with [[Earl Hooker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cowdery.home.netcom.com/maxwell/bo.html |title=1997 Interview |publisher=Cowdery.home.netcom.com |date= |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}</ref> By 1951 he was playing on the street with backing from Roosevelt Jackson on [[washtub bass]], and [[Jody Williams (blues musician)|Jody Williams]], whom he had taught to play the guitar.<ref name="Dahl, Bill 2002">Dahl, Bill (2002).

In 1951 he landed a regular spot at the 708 Club on Chicago's [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]],<ref name="SoundsShow"/> with a repertoire influenced by [[Louis Jordan]], John Lee Hooker, and [[Muddy Waters]].   In late 1954, he teamed up with harmonica player [[Billy Boy Arnold]], drummer Clifton James and [[Bassist|bass player]] Roosevelt Jackson, and recorded [[Demo (music)|demos]] of "[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)|I'm A Man]]" and "[[Bo Diddley (song)|Bo Diddley]]". They re-recorded the songs at [[Chess Records|Chess Studios]] with a backing [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] comprising [[Otis Spann]] (piano), [[Lester Davenport]] (harmonica), Frank Kirkland (drums), and Jerome Green (maracas). The record was released in March 1955, and the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]], "Bo Diddley", became a number one R&B hit.<ref>Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories That Shaped Our Culture

===Origins of stage name===
The origin of the Bo Diddley stage name is unclear.   McDaniel claimed that his peers gave him the name, which he suspected to be an insult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19748/m1/ |title=Show 3 – The Tribal Drum: The rise of rhythm and blues. [Part 1&#93; : UNT Digital Library  |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}</ref> He also said that the name first belonged to a singer his adoptive mother knew, but harmonicist [[Billy Boy Arnold]] said that it was a local comedian's name, which [[Leonard Chess]] adopted as McDaniel's stage name and also for the title of his first single. Guitar craftsman Ed Roman stated that it was McDaniel's nickname as a Golden Gloves boxer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.celebrityrockstarguitars.com/rock/diddley_bo.htm |title=Ed Roman on Bo' Diddley RIP |author=Ed Roman |year=2005 |work=Celebrity Rock Star Guitars |accessdate=May 2, 2012}}</ref>

A "[[diddley bow]]" is a homemade, American single-string instrument played mainly by workers in the southern fields. It probably has influences from the [[West African]] coast.<ref>Chris Morris, ''I'm A Man: The Chess Masters, 1955–1958'' liner notes, [[Geffen Records]], February 2007</ref> In the American slang term, ''bo diddly'', ''bo'' is an intensifier<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edroman.com/guitars/abstract/cadillac.htm |title=Abstract Cadillac Guitar |author=Ed Roman |year=2010 |work=Ed Roman Guitars website |accessdate=May 2, 2012}}</ref> and ''diddly'' is a truncation of ''diddly squat'', which means ''absolutely nothing''.<ref>{{cite book |last = Spears |first = Richard A. |title = McGraw-Hill's Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions |publisher = McGraw-Hill |edition = 4th |year = 2005 |page = 425 |isbn = 978-0-07-146107-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1 = Lighter |first1 = J.

===Success in the 1950s and 1960s===
On November 20, 1955, Bo Diddley appeared on the hugely popular ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan TV show]]''.  The show asked him to sing "[[Sixteen Tons]]", but instead he sang "Bo Diddley". Ed Sullivan was infuriated and banned Bo Diddley from his show. He also said that Bo Diddley wouldn't last six months. The request came about because the show's staff heard Bo Diddley casually singing "Sixteen Tons" in the dressing room. Bo Diddley was a great storyteller but the slant tended to vary. He said that when he saw "Bo Diddley" on the cue-card, he thought he was to perform two songs: "Bo Diddley" and "Sixteen Tons".<ref>TV-a-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol.

ISBN 1-55652-572-9, ISBN 978-1-55652-572-8</ref> Chess included Diddley's "Sixteen Tons" on the 1960 album ''[[Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001XAQSW#moreAboutThisProduct |title=Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger: Bo Diddley: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dustygroove.com/item.php?id=sx6fryfrvp&ref=browse.php&refQ=cat%3D11%26amp%3Bpage%3D5 |title=Dusty Groove – Bo Diddley: Bo Diddley Is A Gunslinger |publisher=[[Dusty Groove]]|date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

Bo Diddley's single hits continued in the 1950s and 1960s: "Pretty Thing" (1956), "Say Man" (1959), and "[[You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover]]" (1962). He also released a string of albums: ''Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger'' and ''Have Guitar, Will Travel''. These bolstered his self-invented legend.<ref name="SoundsShow"/> Between 1958 and 1963, [[Checker Records]] released eleven full-length Bo Diddley albums. Although, in the 1960s, he broke through as a crossover artist with white audiences, appearing at the [[Alan Freed]] concerts for example,<ref name="SoundsShow"/> he rarely aimed his compositions at teenagers. The album title ''Surfing with Bo Diddley'' boasted his influence on [[surf music|surf]] guitarists rather than surfing per se.

In 1963, Bo Diddley starred in a UK concert tour with the [[Everly Brothers]] and [[Little Richard]]. The up-and-coming [[Rolling Stones]], were billed as a supporting act.

Bo Diddley wrote many songs for himself, but he also wrote for others. In 1956 he and guitarist Jody Williams co-wrote the pioneering [[pop music|pop song]] "[[Love Is Strange]]", a hit for [[Mickey & Sylvia]] in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Blakey |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Originator_2/career50s.html |title=BO DIDDLEY – The Originator |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> He also wrote "Mama (Can I Go Out)" which would become a minor hit for pioneering Rockabilly singer [[Jo Ann Campbell]] who performed the song in the 1959 Rock & Roll film [[Go Johnny Go]].

Bo Diddley included women in his band:  [[Norma-Jean Wofford]], also known as "The Duchess"; Gloria Jolivet; [[Peggy Jones (musician)|Peggy Jones]], also known as "Lady Bo", was a rare, for the time, female lead guitarist; Cornelia Redmond, also known as Cookie; Debby Hastings, who led his band for the final 25 years. After moving from [[Chicago]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], he set up one of the first [[home recording]] studios where he not only recorded the album ''Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger'' but produced and recorded his valet, [[Marvin Gaye]]. The Bo Diddley-penned, "Wyatt Earp" was Gaye's first single. It was released on [[Okeh Records]], after Chess turned it down. During this time, [[Moonglows]]' founder [[Harvey Fuqua]] sang backing vocals on many of Diddley's home recordings. Gaye later joined the Moonglows and followed them to Motown.<ref name='Rock Hall'/>

===Later years===
[[File:Bo-Diddley.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bo Diddley touring Japan with Japanese band Bo Gumbos]]
Over the decades, Bo Diddley's performing venues ranged from intimate clubs to stadiums. On March 25, 1972, he played with [[the Grateful Dead]] at the [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]] in [[New York City]]. The Grateful Dead released part of this concert as Volume 30 of the band's ''[[Dick's Picks]]'' concert album series. Also in the early 1970s, the soundtrack for the ground-breaking animated film ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'' contained his song "Bo Diddley", in which a crow idly [[Fingerstyle guitar|finger-pops]] along to the track.

Bo Diddley spent some years in [[New Mexico]], living in [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]] from 1971 to 1978, while continuing his musical career. He served for two and a half years as Deputy Sheriff in the [[Valencia County, New Mexico|Valencia County]] Citizens' Patrol; during that time he purchased and donated three highway-patrol pursuit-cars.<ref name="nmmc">[http://www.newmexicomusic.org/noteable.php?select=5] {{wayback|url=http://www.newmexicomusic.org/noteable.php?select=5 |date=20080815163720 }}</ref> In the late 1970s, Diddley left Los Lunas and moved to [[Hawthorne, Florida]] where he lived on a large estate in a custom-made log-cabin home, which he helped to build. For the remainder of his life he spent time between [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and Florida, living the last 13 years of his life in [[Archer, Florida]], a small farming town near [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]].

In 1979, he appeared as an opening act for [[the Clash]] on their US tour; and in ''Legends of Guitar'' (filmed live in Spain, 1991) with [[B.B. King]], [[Les Paul]], [[Albert Collins]], [[George Benson]], among others. He joined [[the Rolling Stones]] as a guest on their 1994 concert broadcast of ''[[Voodoo Lounge]]'', performing "[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]" with the band. [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[Robert Cray]] also appeared on the pay-per-view special.

Diddley's final vocal performance on a studio album was with the band Munkeez Strikin' Matchiz, on their 2005 album BananAtomic Mass.  He co-wrote the song "Wreck it", and was joined by Parliament-Funkadelic keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]] and rapper [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]].

His final guitar performance on a studio album was with the [[New York Dolls]] on their 2006 album ''[[One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This]]''. Bo contributed guitar work to the song "Seventeen", which was included as a Bonus Track on the limited-edition version of the disc.

====Legal battle====
Bo Diddley fought sportswear brand [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in his later years over alleged copyright infringement, specifically over the use of his likeness and the slogan "YOU DON'T KNOW DIDDLEY." In 1989, Bo had worked with Nike on a commercial in the "[[Bo Knows]]" campaign, and had entered a licensing agreement with the company. However, the agreement ended in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://richlabonte.net/exonews/xtra4/diddley_sues.htm |title=Diddley Sues Nike For Using His Image}}</ref> When Nike began selling the apparel again in 1999, Diddley did not feel that Nike should continue to use the slogan or his likeness. Despite the fact that lawyers for both parties could not come to a renewed legal arrangement, Nike allegedly continued marketing the apparel, and ignored cease and desist orders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,617695,00.html |title=Bo Diddley Sues Nike}}</ref> The lawsuit was filed by Diddley's attorney, John Rosenberg, in Manhattan Federal Court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/bo-sues-nike-diddly-article-1.873023 |title=BO SUES NIKE, SAYS HE GOT DIDDLY}}</ref>

===Illness===
On May 13, 2007, Diddley was admitted to [[intensive care]] in [[Creighton University Medical Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], following a stroke after a concert the previous day in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]].<ref>[http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=60a08a4d-9f34-45ac-b395-c284d9a5ef50&entry=index] {{wayback|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=60a08a4d-9f34-45ac-b395-c284d9a5ef50&entry=index |date=20150402171103 }}</ref> Starting the show, he had complained that he did not feel well. He referred to smoke from the wildfires that were ravaging South Georgia and blowing south to the area near his home in Archer, Florida. Nonetheless, he delivered an energetic performance to an enthusiastic crowd. The next day, as Diddley was heading back home, he seemed dazed and confused at the airport. His manager, Margo Lewis, called 911 and airport security and Diddley was immediately taken by ambulance to Creighton University Medical Center and admitted to the [[Intensive-care unit]], where he stayed for several days. After tests, it was confirmed that he had suffered a stroke.<ref>[http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=5c8535ca-4223-4537-834e-ecb19af35ddf] {{wayback|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=5c8535ca-4223-4537-834e-ecb19af35ddf |date=20150403100744 }}</ref> Diddley had a history of [[hypertension]] and [[diabetes]], and the stroke affected the left side of his brain, causing receptive and expressive [[aphasia]] (speech impairment).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/entertainment/13334586/detail.html |title=Publicist: Bo Diddley Hospitalized After Stroke – Entertainment News Story – WTAE Pittsburgh |publisher=Thepittsburghchannel.com |date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> The stroke was followed by a heart attack, which he suffered in Gainesville, Florida, on August 28, 2007.<ref name="Ratliff">Ben Ratliff, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/arts/music/03diddley.html?_r=1&scp=3&sq=bo+diddley&st=nyt&oref=slogin "Bo Diddley, Who Gave Rock His Beat, Dies at 79"]. ''New York Times'', June 3, 2008, p. A1</ref>

While recovering from the stroke and heart attack, Diddley came back to his home town of McComb, Mississippi, in early November 2007, for the unveiling of a plaque devoted to him on the Mississippi Blues Trail. This marked his achievements and noted that he was "acclaimed as a founder of rock-and-roll." He was not supposed to perform, but as he listened to the music of local musician Jesse Robinson, who sang a song written for this occasion, Robinson sensed that Bo wanted to perform and handed him a microphone. That was the first and last time that Bo Diddley performed publicly after suffering a stroke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wlbt.com/Global/story.asp?S=7305146&nav=menu119_3 |title=WLBT 3 – Jackson, MS: Bo Diddley Honored In Hometown |publisher=Wlbt.com |date=January 1, 2010 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

His funeral, a four-hour "homegoing" service, took place on June 7, 2008 at Showers of Blessings Church in Gainesville, Florida, and kept in tune with the vibrant spirit of Bo Diddley's life and career. The many in attendance chanted "Hey Bo Diddley" as a gospel band played the legend's music.

After the funeral service, a tribute concert was held at the Martin Luther King Center, also in Gainesville, and featured performances by his son and daughter, Anthony McDaniel and Evelyn Cooper, as well as long-time background vocalist Gloria Jolivet; co-producer and guitarist Scott "Skyntyte" Free; Bo's touring band the Debby Hastings Band; and guest-artist [[Eric Burdon]].

In the days following his death, tributes were paid to Diddley by then-President [[George W. Bush]], the [[United States House of Representatives]], and an uncounted number of musicians and performers, including [[Eric Burdon]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Ronnie Hawkins]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[B. B. King]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], George Thorogood, [[Robert Randolph and the Family Band]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Ronnie Wood]]. He was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded a [[Doctor of Fine Arts]] degree by the [[University of Florida]] for his influence on American popular music. In its "People in America" radio series about influential people in American history, the [[Voice of America]] radio service paid tribute to him, describing how "his influence was so widespread that it is hard to imagine what rock and roll would have sounded like without him." [[Mick Jagger]] stated that, "he was a wonderful, original musician who was an enormous force in music and was a big influence on [[the Rolling Stones]]. He was very generous to us in our early years and we learned a lot from him".

In 2005, Bo Diddley celebrated his 50th anniversary in music with successful tours of [[Australia]] and [[Europe]], and with coast-to-coast shows across [[North America]]. He performed his song "Bo Diddley" with [[Eric Clapton]], [[Robbie Robertson]] and longtime bassist and musical director Debby Hastings at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s 20th annual induction ceremony. In the [[UK]], ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine included his 1957 debut album "Bo Diddley" in its listing of the '100 Music, Movie & TV Moments That Have Changed The World'.

In 2006, Bo Diddley participated as the headliner of a [[grassroots]] organized fundraiser concert, to benefit the town of [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], which had been devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The "Florida Keys for Katrina Relief" had originally been set for October 23, 2005, when [[Hurricane Wilma]] barreled through the [[Florida Keys]] on October 24, causing flooding and economic mayhem. In January 2006, the Florida Keys had recovered enough to host the fundraising concert to benefit the more hard-hit community of Ocean Springs. When asked about the fundraiser Bo Diddley stated, "This is the United States of America. We believe in helping one another".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridakeysforkatrinarelief.com/musical_performers.htm |title=Musical Performers |publisher=Floridakeysforkatrinarelief.com |date=January 8, 2006 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> In an interview with Holger Petersen, on ''[[Saturday Night Blues]]'' on [[CBC Radio]] in the fall of 2006<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/snb/latestshow.html]  {{wayback|url=http://www.cbc.ca/snb/latestshow.html |date=20090928074108 }}</ref> Bo Diddley commented about the racism that existed in the music industry establishment during the early part of his career, that saw him deprived of [[royalties]] from the most successful part of his career.

Bo Diddley is well known for the ''Bo Diddley beat'', which is essentially the [[clave rhythm]], and one of the most common [[bell pattern]]s found in [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]].<ref>Peñalosa, David (2010: 244). ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins''. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. ISBN 1-886502-80-3.</ref> Tamlyn found this rhythm in 13 rhythm and blues recordings made in the years 1944–55, including two by [[Johnny Otis]] from 1948.<ref>The Big Beat: Orgigins and Development of Snare Backbeat and other Accompanimental Rhythms in Rock'n'Roll. Garry Neville Tamlym. PhD thesis. March 1998. Table 4.16. page 284</ref>

Bo Diddley has given different accounts regarding how he began to use this rhythm. Sublette asserts: "In the context of the time, and especially those maracas [heard on the record], 'Bo Diddley' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only 'Rhumba' on the track sheets."<ref>Sublette, Ned (2007: 83). "The Kingsmen and the Cha-cha-chá." Ed. Eric Weisbard. ''Listen Again: A Momentary History of Pop Music''. Duke University Press. ISBN 0822340410</ref> The Bo Diddley beat is similar to "[[Juba dance|hambone]]", a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms, legs, chest, and cheeks while chanting rhymes.<ref>Roscetti, Ed (2008). ''Stuff! Good Drummers Should Know'', p. 16. Hal Leonard Corporation. ISBN 1-4234-2848-X.</ref> Somewhat resembling [[Shave and a Haircut|"shave and a haircut, two bits"]] rhythm, Diddley came across it while trying to play [[Gene Autry]]'s "(I've Got Spurs That) [[Jingle, Jangle, Jingle]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/multi/feature/ID/298/Blues+Reflections:+2003 |title=Blues Reflections |publisher=Afropop.org |date=April 3, 1970 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> Three years before Bo's "Bo Diddley", a song similar syncopation "Hambone", was cut by [[Red Saunders (musician)|Red Saunders]]' Orchestra with The Hambone Kids. In 1944, "[[Rum and Coca Cola]]", containing the Bo Diddley beat, was recorded by [[the Andrews Sisters]] and later [[Buddy Holly]]'s "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]" (1957) and [[Them (band)|Them's]] "[[Mystic Eyes]]" (1965) used the beat.<ref name="Sixties">Hicks, Michaël (2000). ''Sixties Rock'', p.36. ISBN 978-0-252-06915-4.</ref>
[[File:Bo Diddley beat.png|thumb|280px|right|"Bo Diddley beat"<ref name="Sixties"/>/[[Son clave]] {{audio|Bo Diddley beat.mid|Play}}.]]  In its simplest form, the Bo Diddley beat can be counted out as either a one-bar, or a two-bar phrase. Here is the count as a one-bar phrase: '''One''' e and '''ah''', two e '''and''' ah, three e '''and''' ah, '''four''' e and ah. The '''bolded''' counts are the [[Clave (rhythm)|clave]] rhythm.

Many songs (for example, "[[Hey Bo Diddley]]" and "[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]") often have no [[chord (music)|chord]] changes; that is, the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece, so that the rhythms create the excitement, rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic [[tension (music)|tension and release]]. In his other recordings, Bo Diddley used a variety of rhythms, from straight [[beat (music)|back beat]] to [[Popular music|pop]] [[ballad]] style to [[doo-wop]], frequently with maracas by Jerome Green.

Also an influential guitar player, he developed many special effects and other innovations in tone and attack. Bo Diddley's trademark instrument was the rectangular-bodied [[Gretsch]] nicknamed the "Twang Machine" (referred to as "cigar-box shaped" by music promoter [[Dick Clark]]). Although he had other odd-shaped guitars custom-made for him by other manufacturers throughout the years, most notably the "Cadillac" and the rectangular "Turbo 5-speed" (with built-in envelope filter, flanger and delay) designs made by Tom Holmes (who also made guitars for ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, among others), Diddley fashioned the square guitar himself around 1958 and wielded it in thousands of concerts over the years. In a 2005 interview on [[Triple J|JJJ]] radio in Australia, Bo implied that the design sprang from an embarrassing moment. During an early gig, while jumping around on stage with a [[Gibson L5]] guitar, he landed awkwardly hurting his groin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/boone_m1035862.mp3 |title=Mp3 file : Jay and the Doctor |publisher=Abc.net.au |accessdate=2015-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/bodidleytw_m1035870.mp3 |title=Mp3 file : Jay and the Doctor |publisher=Abc.net.au |accessdate=2015-03-13}}</ref> He then went about designing a smaller, less restrictive guitar that allowed him to keep jumping around on stage while still playing his guitar. He also played the violin, which is featured on his mournful [[instrumental rock|instrumental]] "The Clock Strikes Twelve", a [[twelve-bar blues]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/buyersguides/gr/diddleymasters.htm |title=Bo Diddley – I'm a Man: The Chess Masters, 1955–1958 – CD review |publisher=Oldies.about.com |date=February 25, 2008 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

He often created lyrics as witty and humorous adaptations of [[folk music]] themes. The song "Bo Diddley" was based on the African American clapping rhyme "[[Juba dance|Hambone]]" (which in turn was based on the [[lullaby]] "[[Hush Little Baby]]"). Likewise, "Hey Bo Diddley" is based on the song "[[Old MacDonald]]". The [[roots of hip hop|rap]]-style boasting of "Who Do You Love?", a wordplay on [[hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]], used many striking lyrics from the African-American tradition of [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasts]] and boasts. His "Say Man" and "Say Man, Back Again," both of which were later cited as progenerators of hip-hop music, share a strong connection to the insult game known as "[[the dozens]]". For example: "You got the nerve to call somebody ugly. Why you so ugly, the stork that brought you into the world ought to be arrested".<ref>"Say Man" (McDaniels) 1958</ref>
