'''Down syndrome''' ('''DS''' or '''DNS''') or '''Down's syndrome''', also known as '''trisomy 21''', is a [[genetic disorder]] caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of [[chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome 21]].<ref name=Patt2009>{{cite journal|last=Patterson|first=D|title=Molecular genetic analysis of Down syndrome.|journal=Human Genetics|date=Jul 2009|volume=126|issue=1|pages=195–214|pmid=19526251|doi=10.1007/s00439-009-0696-8}}</ref> It is typically associated with [[child development|physical growth]] delays, characteristic [[dysmorphic feature|facial features]], and mild to moderate [[intellectual disability]].<ref name=Wei2010>{{cite journal|last=Weijerman|first=ME|author2=de Winter, JP|title=Clinical practice.

===Translocation===
The extra chromosome 21 material may also occur due to a [[Robertsonian translocation]] in 2–4% cases.<ref name=Nel2010/><ref name=AK2013/> In this situation, the long arm of chromosome 21 is attached to another chromosome, often [[Chromosome 14 (human)|chromosome 14]].<ref name=Mich2013/> In a male affected with Down syndrome, it results in a karyotype of 46XY,t(14q21q).<ref name=Mich2013>{{cite book|title=Human Heredity: Principles and Issues|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-285-52847-2|page=138|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=KSwLAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA138|author=Michael Cummings|edition=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Yen and Jaffe's reproductive endocrinology : physiology, pathophysiology, and clinical management|year=2009|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4160-4907-4|page=791|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=NudwnhxY8kYC&pg=PA791|author=Jerome Frank Strauss, Robert L.

==Mechanism==
The extra genetic material present in DS results in overexpression of a portion of the 310 genes located on chromosome 21.<ref name=Lana2011/> This overexpression has been estimated at around 50%.<ref name=Nel2010/> Some research has suggested the Down syndrome critical region is located at bands 21q22.1–q22.3,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/943216-overview |title=Genetics of Down syndrome|accessdate = 2011-05-29}}</ref> with this area including genes for amyloid, [[superoxide dismutase]], and likely the [[ETS-2 proto oncogene]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Current diagnosis & treatment psychiatry|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=0-07-142292-7|pages=Chapter 3|edition=2nd|editor=Michael H.

The dementia which occurs in Down syndrome is due to an excess of [[amyloid beta peptide]] produced in the brain and is similar to [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name=Wek2013/> This peptide is processed from [[amyloid precursor protein]], the gene for which is located on chromosome 21.<ref name=Wek2013>{{cite journal|last=Weksler|first=ME|author2=Szabo, P |author3=Relkin, NR |author4=Reidenberg, MM |author5=Weksler, BB |author6= Coppus, AM |title=Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome: treating two paths to dementia.|journal=Autoimmunity reviews|date=Apr 2013|volume=12|issue=6|pages=670–3|pmid=23201920|doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2012.10.013}}</ref> [[Senile plaques]] and [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s are present in nearly all by 35&nbsp;years of age, though dementia may not be present.<ref name=Steph2010/> Those with DS also lack a normal number of [[lymphocytes]] and produce less [[antibody|antibodies]] which contributes to their increased risk of infection.<ref name=Hick2012/>

===Epigenetics===
Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of many chronic diseases that are typically associated with older age such as Alzheimer's disease. The accelerated aging suggest that trisomy 21 increases the biological age of tissues, but molecular evidence for this hypothesis is sparse. According to a biomarker of tissue age known as [[Biological clock (aging)|epigenetic clock]], trisomy 21 increases the age of blood and brain tissue (on average by 6.6 years).<ref name="Horvath2015DownSyndrome">{{Cite journal| title = Accelerated epigenetic aging in Down syndrome.| journal = [[Aging Cell]]| volume =14  | issue = 3| year = 2015| url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12325/epdf | pmid = 25678027  |pmc= |author = Horvath S, Garagnani P, Bacalini MG, Pirazzini C, Salvioli S, Gentilini D, Di Blasio AM, Giuliani C, Tung S, Vinters HV, Franceschi C}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

===Before birth===
When screening tests predict a high risk of Down syndrome, a more invasive diagnostic test ([[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]]) is needed to confirm the diagnosis.<ref name=ACOG2007/> If Down syndrome occurs in one in 500 pregnancies and the test used has a 5% false-positive rate, this means, of 28 women who test positive on screening, only one will have Down syndrome confirmed.<ref name=Can2012>{{cite journal|last=Canick|first=J|title=Prenatal screening for trisomy 21: recent advances and guidelines.|journal=Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine : CCLM / FESCC|date=Jun 2012|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1003–8|pmid=21790505|doi=10.1515/cclm.2011.671}}</ref> If the screening test has a 2% false-positive rate, this means one of 10 who test positive on screening have a fetus with DS.<ref name=Can2012/> Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are more reliable tests, but they increase the risk of [[miscarriage]] between 0.5 and 1%.<ref name=Tab2010>{{cite journal|last=Tabor|first=A|author2=Alfirevic, Z|title=Update on procedure-related risks for prenatal diagnosis techniques.|journal=Fetal diagnosis and therapy|year=2010|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–7|pmid=20051662|doi=10.1159/000271995}}</ref> The risk of limb problems is increased in the offspring due to the procedure.<ref name=Tab2010/> The risk from the procedure is greater the earlier it is performed, thus amniocentesis is not recommended before 15 weeks gestational age and chorionic villus sampling before 10 weeks gestational age.<ref name=Tab2010/>
