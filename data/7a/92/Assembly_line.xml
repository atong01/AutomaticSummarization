Regardless of earlier uses of some of these principles, the direct line of succession of mass production and its intensification into automation stems directly from what we worked out at Ford Motor Company between 1908 and 1913. Henry Ford is generally regarded as the father of mass production. He was not.

Decreased costs of production allowed the cost of the Model T to fall within the budget of the American middle class. In 1908, the price of a Model T was around $825, and by 1912 it had decreased to around $575. This price reduction is comparable to a reduction from $15,000 to $10,000 in dollar terms from the year 2000. In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.<extension extension_name='ref' name="xovodv"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Ford's complex safety proceduresespecially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam aboutdramatically reduced the rate of<space/><link><target>injury</target></link>. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called &quot;<link><target>Fordism</target></link>&quot;, and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the take-off of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.</paragraph><paragraph>Ford at one point considered suing other car companies because they used the assembly line in their production, but decided against it, realizing it was essential to creation and expansion of the industry as a whole.<space/><template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">January 2010</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>automotive industry</target></link>, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide.
