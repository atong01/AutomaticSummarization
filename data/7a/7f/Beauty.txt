'''Beauty''' is the quality of being pleasing, especially to look at, or someone or something that gives great pleasure, especially when looking at it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/beauty}}</ref>

The conception for beauty is used or studied in [[art]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], and culture. An "ideal beauty" is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.

The experience of "beauty" often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and [[harmony]] with [[nature]], which may lead to feelings of [[sexual attraction|attraction]] and [[emotional well-being]]. Because this can be a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] experience, it is often said that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."<ref name="phrase">{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html|title=Beauty is in the eye of the beholder|accessdate=December 4, 2007|publisher=The Phrase Finder|year=2007|author=Gary Martin| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071130023507/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html| archivedate= November 30, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

There is evidence that perceptions of beauty are evolutionarily determined, that things, aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human's genes.<ref>The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics</ref><ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html Denis Dutton: A Darwinian theory of beauty | Video on TED.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Name ==
Unlike other [[Germanic languages]], the word beauty is with Latin origin as in present [[Romance languages]]. The word derives from the [[Vulgar Latin]] bellitatem (nominative bellitas) "state of being handsome" from Latin bellus "pretty, handsome, charming," in classical Latin used especially of women and children, or insultingly of men. The newly introduced Latin term replace the replaced the [[Old English]] wlite, a concrete meaning "a beautiful woman", that was first recorded in the late 14c.<ref>{{cite web|title=Etymonline|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=beauty}}</ref>

== Ancient Egypt==
[[File:Берлин. Нефертити.jpg|180px|left|Queen [[Nefertiti]], her name meaning "coming beauty"]]
In [[Ancient Egypt]] the beautiful [[face]] and female [[body shape]] were honoured. Special attention they took on [[clothes]], [[hairstyle]] and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]].

Egyptians invented the [[makeup]]. Egyptian were bathing with oils of pleasant smell, wearing light clothes, almost transparent and using [[cosmetics]] of natural products. They used natural products, made of [[almond]], [[lettuce]], [[lily]], [[cumin]], to deodorize their skin, daubing it with oils of [[lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[cedrus|cedar]]. To make the skin softer they used [[honey]]. They started using [[soap]] around 1500 BC, made up of fats of animals, vegetables and salt. Egyptian women also used to dye their hair with [[henna]] and [[wigs]] on their short hair. They used a [[lipstick]], an extract of a red paint that was mixture of [[iodine]], [[bromine]]  and paints od plants.

[[Nefertiti]] (left) gave the meaning of beauty to the Egyptians, her name itself means "coming beauty".

==Ancient Greek==
The [[Beauty (ancient thought)|earliest Western theory of beauty]] can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the [[pre-Socratic]] period, such as [[Pythagoras]]. The Pythagorean school saw a strong connection between [[mathematics]] and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the [[golden ratio]] seemed more attractive.<ref>Seife, Charles (2000). ''[[Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea]]''. Penguin. ISBN 0-14-029647-6. p. 32</ref> [[Ancient Greek architecture]] is based on this view of symmetry and [[ratio|proportion]].

Plato considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas.<ref>Phaedrus</ref> Aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful (''to kalon'') and virtue, arguing that "Virtue aims at the beautiful."<ref>Nicomachean Ethics</ref>

[[Classical philosophy]] and sculptures of men and women produced according to the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in [[Renaissance]] Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a "classical ideal". In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose [[human physical appearance|appearance]] conforms to these tenets is still called a "classical beauty" or said to possess a "classical beauty", whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty in western civilization.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later, the [[Renaissance]] and [[Humanism]] rejected this view, and considered beauty as a product of rational order and harmony of proportions. Renaissance artists and architect (such as [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his "lives of artists") criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view over [[Gothic art]] lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century.

==The Age of Reason==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', by [[Sandro Botticelli]]. The goddess Venus is the classical personification of beauty.]]

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] argued that beauty is "unity in variety and variety in unity".<ref>An Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue; In Two Treatises</ref> The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of beauty, with [[John Keats]] arguing in "Ode on a Grecian Urn" that

:  Beauty is truth, truth beauty, —that is all.
:  Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

==The Romantic period==
In the Romantic period, [[Edmund Burke]] postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==The 20th century and after==
The 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in [[postmodernism]]'s anti-aesthetics.<ref>The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture by Hal Foster</ref> This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.<ref>The Will to Power</ref>

In the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher [[Guy Sircello]] proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept.<ref>A New Theory of Beauty. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.</ref><ref>Love and Beauty. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.</ref> Elaine Scarry also argues that beauty is related to justice.<ref>On Beauty and Being Just</ref>

==Human beauty==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}

The characterization of a person as “beautiful”, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of ''inner beauty'', which includes psychological factors such as [[Personality type|personality]], [[intelligence]], [[wiktionary:Grace|grace]], [[politeness]], [[charisma]], [[integrity]], [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] and [[elegance]], and ''outer beauty'' (i.e. [[physical attractiveness]]) which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis.

Standards of beauty have changed over time, based on changing cultural values. Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.

A feature of beautiful women that has been explored by researchers is a [[waist–hip ratio]] of approximately 0.70. Physiologists have shown that women with [[Female body shape|hourglass figures]] are more fertile than other women due to higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-300862/Born-mothers-curvy-hips.html |title=Born mothers have curvy hips &#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=2010-05-31 | location=London | first=Tim | last=Utton| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100626015506/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-300862/Born-mothers-curvy-hips.html| archivedate= June 26, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The concept of beauty in men is known as '[[bishōnen]]' in Japan. Bishōnen refers to males with distinctly [[Femininity|feminine]] features, physical characteristics establishing the standard of beauty in Japan and typically exhibited in their [[pop culture]] [[Japanese idol|idols]]. A multi-billion-dollar industry of [[Japanese Aesthetic Salons]] exists for this reason.

Beauty presents a standard of [[social comparison theory|comparison]], and it can cause resentment and dissatisfaction when not achieved. People who do not fit the "beauty ideal" may be ostracized within their communities. The television sitcom ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' portrays the life of a girl faced with hardships due to society's unwelcoming attitudes toward those they deem unattractive. However, a person may also be targeted for harassment because of their beauty. In ''[[Malèna]]'', a strikingly beautiful Italian woman is forced into poverty by the women of the community who refuse to give her work for fear that she may "woo" their husbands. The documentary ''[[Beauty in the Eyes of the Beheld]]'' explores both the societal blessings and curses of female beauty through interviews of women considered beautiful.

How much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty.

==Ugliness==
'''Ugliness''' is a property of a person or thing that is unpleasant to look upon and results in a highly unfavorable evaluation.

For some people, ugliness is a central aspect of their persona. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] had a lazy eye and a bloated, asymmetrical face, and he attributed many of his philosophical ideas to his lifelong struggle to come to terms with his self-described ugliness.<ref name="nyt ugly">{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/the-phenomenology-of-ugly/|title=The Phenomenology of Ugly|last=Martin|first=Andy|date=August 10, 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 24, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100815234258/http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/the-phenomenology-of-ugly/?| archivedate= August 15, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Socrates]] also used his ugliness as a philosophical touch point, concluding that philosophy can save us from our outward ugliness.<ref name="nyt ugly" /> Famous in his own time for his perceived ugliness, [[Abraham Lincoln]] was described by a contemporary: "to say that he is ugly is nothing; to add that his figure is grotesque, is to convey no adequate impression." However, his looks proved to be an asset in his personal and political relationships, as his law partner [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]] wrote, "He was not a pretty man by any means, nor was he an ugly one; he was a homely man, careless of his looks, plain-looking and plain-acting. He had no pomp, display, or dignity, so-called. He appeared simple in his carriage and bearing. He was a sad-looking man; his melancholy dripped from him as he walked. His apparent gloom impressed his friends, and created sympathy for him—one means of his great success."<ref name="carpenter lincoln">{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=F.
