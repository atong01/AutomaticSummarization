'''Dance''' is a [[performance art]] [[art form|form]] consisting of purposefully selected sequences of [[kinesiology|human movement]]. This movement has [[aesthetic]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular [[culture]].{{refn|group=nb|Many definitions of dance have been proposed. This definition is based on the following:<br><br>
"Dance is human movement created and expressed for an aesthetic purpose."<ref name="Fraleigh1987">{{cite book|author=Sondra Horton Fraleigh|title=Dance and the Lived Body: A Descriptive Aesthetics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4FN1lOcR-wC&pg=PA43|year=1987|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=978-0-8229-7170-2|page=49}}</ref><br><br>
"Dance is a transient mode of expression performed in a given form and style by the human body moving in space. Dance occurs through purposefully selected and controlled rhythmic movements; the resulting phenomenon is recognized as dance both by the performer and the observing members of a given group."<ref>{{cite book|author1=Joann Kealinohomoku|editor1-last=Copeland|editor1-first=Roger|editor2-last=Cohen|editor2-first=Marshall|title=An Anthropologist Looks at Ballet as a Form of Ethnic Dance|work=What is Dance?

"Dance is human behaviour composed (from the dancer’s perspective, which is usually shared by the audience members of the dancer’s culture) of purposeful (individual choice and social learning play a role), intentionally rhythmical, and culturally patterned sequences of nonverbal body movement mostly other than those performed in ordinary motor activities. The motion (in time, space, and with effort) has an inherent and aesthetic value (the notion of appropriateness and competency as viewed by the dancer’s culture) and symbolic potential."<ref>{{cite book|author=Judith Lynne Hanna|title=The performer-audience connection: emotion to metaphor in dance and society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ze8TAQAAIAAJ|year=1983|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-76478-1}}</ref>}} Dance can be categorized and described by its [[choreography]], by its repertoire of movements, or by its [[History of dance|historical period]] or [[List of ethnic, regional, and folk dances by origin|place of origin]].

An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of [[Concert dance|theatrical]] and [[Participation dance|participatory]] dance,<ref>[http://www.artsalive.ca/en/dan/dance101/forms.asp Canadian National Arts Centre - Dance Forms: An Introduction]</ref> although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether [[Social dance|social]], [[ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], [[competitive dance|competitive]], [[erotic dance|erotic]], [[war dance|martial]], or [[sacred dance|sacred]]/[[liturgical dance|liturgical]].  Others disciplines of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including [[martial arts]], [[gymnastics]], [[figure skating]], [[synchronized swimming]] and many other forms of athletics.

==Performance and participation==
[[File:GDC onlywayaround.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Members of American jazz dance company [[Giordano Dance Chicago]] perform a formal group routine in a concert dance setting]]

Theatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a [[performance]] upon a [[Stage (theater)|stage]] by [[virtuoso]] dancers. It often tells a [[narrative|story]], perhaps using [[Mime artist|mime]], [[Dance costumes|costume]] and [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], or else it may simply [[Interpretive dance|interpret the musical accompaniment]], which is often specially composed. Examples are western [[ballet]] and [[modern dance]], [[Classical Indian dance]] and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas. Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in [[opera]] and other forms of [[musical theatre]].

Participatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a [[folk dance]], a [[social dance]], a [[group dance]] such as a [[Line dance|line]], [[Circle dance|circle]], [[Medieval dance#Other Chain Dances|chain]] or [[square dance]], or a [[partner dance]] such as is common in western [[Ballroom dance|Western ballroom dancing]], is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as [[social interaction]] or [[exercise]], of participants rather than onlookers. Such dance seldom has any narrative. A group dance and a ''[[corps de ballet]]'', a social partner dance and a ''[[pas de deux]]'', differ profoundly. Even a [[solo dance]] may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the [[rave culture]] of [[electronic dance music]], vast crowds may engage in [[free dance]], uncoordinated with those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women and children may or must participate.

==Origins==
[[File:Bronze Statuette of a Veiled and Masked Dancer 1.jpg|thumb|left|175 px|Greek bronze statuette of a veiled and masked dancer, 3rd-2nd century BC, Alexandria, Egypt.]]

[[archeology|Archeological]] evidence for early dance includes 9,000-year-old paintings in [[India]] at the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 BC.  It has been proposed that before the invention of written languages, dance was an important part of the oral and performance methods of passing stories down from generation to generation.<ref name="lecomte">Nathalie Comte. "Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World". Ed. Jonathan Dewald. Vol. 2. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. pp&nbsp;94–108.</ref> The use of dance in [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] [[altered state of consciousness|trance states]] and healing rituals (as observed today in many contemporary "primitive" cultures, from the Brazilian [[rainforest]] to the [[Kalahari Desert]]) is thought to have been another early factor in the social development of dance.<ref name='guenther'>Guenther, Mathias Georg. 'The San Trance Dance: Ritual and Revitalization Among the Farm Bushmen of the Ghanzi District, Republic of Botswana.' Journal, South West Africa Scientific Society, v30, 1975–76.</ref>

References to dance can be found in very early written history; [[Greek dance]] (''[[horos]]'') is referred to by [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Lucian]].<ref>Raftis, Alkis, ''The World of Greek Dance'' Finedawn, Athens (1987) p25.</ref> The [[Bible]] and [[Talmud]] refer to many events related to dance, and contain over 30 different dance terms.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/835838?uid=3738240&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21103250884863 Yemenite Dances and their influence on the new Jewish folk dances]</ref> In [[History of Chinese classical dance|Chinese]] pottery as early as the [[Neolithic]] period, groups of people are depicted dancing in a line holding hands,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://114.255.205.171/english/tabid/549/Default.aspx?AntiqueLanguageID=3002 |title= Basin with design of dancers |work= National Museum of China }} Pottery from the [[Majiayao culture]] ( 3100 BC to 2700 BC)</ref> and the earliest Chinese word for "dance" is found written in the [[oracle bones]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of Chinese Dance |author= Wang Kefen|publisher= China Books & Periodicals |page=7 |year= 1985 |isbn=978-0835111867}}</ref> Dance is further described in  the ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]''.<ref name="aesthetic tradition">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d1eZuB2xwYwC&pg=PA5&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Chinese Aesthetic Tradition |author= Zehou Li |page=5 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |others=translated by Maija Bell Samei |year= 2009 |isbn=978-0824833077 }}</ref><ref>[http://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&id=23281  Lü Shi Chun Qiu] Original text: 昔葛天氏之樂，三人操牛尾，投足以歌八闋</ref>  Primitive dance in ancient China was associated with sorcery and shamanic rituals.

During the first millennium [[common era|BCE]] in India, many texts were composed which attempted to codify aspects of daily life. [[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natyashastra]]'' (literally ''"the text of dramaturgy"'') is one of the earlier texts. It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture. It categorizes dance into four types - secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive - and into four regional varieties. The text elaborates various hand-gestures (''[[mudras]]'') and classifies movements of the various limbs, steps and so on.  A strong continuous tradition of dance has since continued in India, through to modern times, where it continues to play a role in culture, ritual, and, notably, the [[Bollywood]] entertainment industry.  Many other contemporary dance forms can likewise be traced back to [[Historical dance|historical]], [[Traditional dance|traditional]], [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], and [[List of dances sorted by ethnicity|ethnic]] dance.

==Dancing and music==
{{main|Dance music}}

Dance is generally, though not exclusively, performed with the accompaniment of music and may or may not be performed ''in [[time signature|time]]'' to such music.  Some dance (such as [[tap dance]]) may provide its own audible accompaniment in place of (or in addition to) music.  Many early forms of music and dance were created for each other and are frequently performed together. Notable examples of traditional dance/music couplings include the [[jig]], [[waltz]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[disco]], and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]]. Some [[musical genre]]s have a parallel dance form such as [[baroque music]] and [[baroque dance]]; other varieties of dance and music may share nomenclature but developed separately, such as [[Classical music era|classical music]] and [[classical ballet]].

Dance in Africa is deeply integrated into society and major events in a community are frequently reflected in dances: dances are performed for births and funerals, weddings and wars.<ref name="WelshHanley2010">{{cite book|author1=Kariamu Welsh|author2=Elizabeth A.

Thousands of dances are performed around the continent. These may be divided into traditional, neotraditional, and classical styles: [[folklore|folkloric]] dances of a particular society, dances created more recently in imitation of traditional styles, and dances transmitted more formally in schools or private lessons.<ref name="WelshHanley2010" />{{rp|18}} African dance has been altered by many forces, such as European [[missionaries]] and [[colonialist]] governments, who often suppressed local dance traditions as licentious or distracting.<ref name="Hanna1973" /> Dance in contemporary African cultures still serves its traditional functions in new contexts;  dance may celebrate the inauguration of a hospital, build community for rural migrants in unfamiliar cities, and be incorporated into Christian church ceremonies.<ref name="Hanna1973" />

===Asia===

All [[Classical Indian dance|Indian classical dances]] are to varying degrees rooted in the ''[[Natyashastra]]'' and therefore share common features: for example, the ''mudra''s (hand positions), some body positions, and the inclusion of dramatic or expressive acting or [[abhinaya]].  Indian classical music provides accompaniment and dancers of nearly all the styles wear bells around their ankles to counterpoint and complement the percussion.

There are now many regional varieties of [[Indian classical dance]]. Dances like ''"Odra Magadhi"'', which after decades long debate, has been traced to present day Mithila, [[Odisha]] region's dance form of [[Odissi]] (Orissi), indicate influence of dances in cultural interactions between different regions.<ref>[http://www.exoticindiaart.com/article/dance Exoticindiaart.com], Dance: The Living Spirit of Indian Arts, by Prof. P. C. Jain and Dr. Daljeet.</ref>

The [[Punjab region|Punjab]] area overlapping India and [[Pakistan]] is the place of origin of [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]]. It is widely known both as a style of music and a dance. It is mostly related to ancient harvest celebrations, love, patriotism or social issues. Its music is coordinated by a musical instrument called the 'Dhol'. Bhangra is not just music but a dance, a celebration of the harvest where people beat the dhol (drum), sing Boliyaan (lyrics) and dance.It developed further with the Vaisakhi festival of the [[Sikh]]s.

The [[dances of Sri Lanka]] include the devil dances (''yakun natima''), a carefully crafted ritual reaching far back into Sri Lanka's pre-Buddhist past that combines ancient "[[Ayurvedic]]" concepts of disease causation with psychological manipulation and combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmology. Their influence can be seen on the [[classical dances of Sri Lanka]].<ref>[http://www.lankalibrary.com/rit/yakun%20natuma.htm Lankalibrary.com], "The yakun natima&nbsp;— devil dance ritual of Sri Lanka"</ref>

The [[Middle Eastern dance|dances of the Middle East]] are usually the traditional forms of [[circle dance|circle dancing]] which are modernized to an extent. They would include [[dabke]], [[tamzara]], [[Assyrian folk dance]], [[Kurdish dance]], [[Armenian dance]] and [[Turkish dance]], among others.<ref>Badley, Bill and Zein al Jundi.

===Latin America===
Dance is central to [[Latin America]]n social life and culture. Brazilian [[Samba]], Argentinian [[tango]], and Cuban [[salsa (dance)|salsa]] are internationally popular partner dances, and other national dances&mdash;[[merengue (dance)|merengue]], [[cueca]], [[plena]], [[jarabe]], [[joropo]], [[marinera]], [[cumbia]], and others&mdash;are important components of their respective countries' cultures.<ref name="Chasteen2004">{{cite book|author=John Charles Chasteen|title=National Rhythms, African Roots: The Deep History of Latin American Popular Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBvvvrydCNwC&pg=PR8|date=1 January 2004|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-2941-7|pages=8–14}}</ref> Traditional [[Carnival]] festivals incorporate these and other dances in enormous celebrations.<ref name="MusmonHanley2010">{{cite book|author1=Margaret Musmon|author2=Elizabeth A.

Dance has played an important role in forging a collective identity among the many cultural and ethnic groups of [[Latin America]].<ref name="DelgadoMuñoz1997">{{cite book|author1=Celeste Fraser Delgado|author2=José Esteban Muñoz|title=Everynight Life: Culture and Dance in Latin/o America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gefjk07Y9kEC&pg=PA3|year=1997|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-1919-5|pages=9–41}}</ref> Dance served to unite the many African, European, and indigenous peoples of the region.<ref name="Chasteen2004"/> Certain dance genres, such as [[capoeira]], and body movements, especially the characteristic ''quebrada'' or [[pelvis]] swing, have been variously banned and celebrated throughout Latin American history.<ref name="DelgadoMuñoz1997"/>

===Europe and North America===
{{Main|Concert dance}}
[[File:NutcrackerSnowPas.JPG|thumb|left|Two classical ballet dancers perform a sequence of [[The Nutcracker]], one of the best known works of classical dance]]
[[Ballet]] developed first in Italy and then in France from lavish court spectacles that combined music, drama, poetry, song, costumes and dance. Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Académie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the Academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.<ref name="lecomte"/>

[[20th century concert dance]] brought an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as [[modern dance]] include [[Loie Fuller]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Mary Wigman]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]]. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for [[Eurhythmics]], devised by [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]], which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as [[Marie Rambert]]. [[Eurythmy]], developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Doris Humphrey]] began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see [[Modern dance]].

[[African American dance]] developed in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. [[Tap dance]], [[disco]], [[jazz dance]], [[swing dance]], [[hip hop dance]], the [[lindy hop]] with its relationship to [[rock and roll|rock and roll music]] and [[rock and roll (dance)|rock and roll dance]] have had a global influence.

==Dance education==

Dance studies are offered through the [[The Arts|arts]] and [[humanities]] programs of many higher education institutions. Some universities offer [[Bachelor of Arts]] and higher [[academic degree]]s in Dance. A dance study curriculum may encompass a diverse range of courses and topics, including dance practice and performance, choreography, [[ethnochoreology]], [[kinesiology]], [[dance notation]], and [[dance therapy]].

[[File:Gibney Dance.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A dancer practices in a [[dance studio]], the primary setting for training in classical dance and many other styles]]

==Occupations==
{{Main|List of dance occupations}}

Professional dancers are usually employed on contract or for particular performances or productions. The professional life of a dancer is generally one of constantly changing work situations, strong competitive pressure and low pay. Consequently, professional dancers often must supplement their incomes to achieve financial stability. In the U.S. many professional dancers belong to unions (such as the [[American Guild of Musical Artists]], [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[Actors' Equity Association]]) that establish working conditions and minimum salaries for their members.

Dance teachers typically focus on teaching dance performance, or coaching competitive dancers, or both. They typically have performance experience in the types of dance they teach or coach. For example, [[dancesport]] teachers and coaches are often tournament dancers or former dancesport performers. Dance teachers may be self-employed, or employed by [[dance school]]s or general education institutions with dance programs. Some work for university programs or other schools that are associated with professional classical dance (e.g., ballet) or modern dance companies. Others are employed by smaller, privately owned dance schools that offer dance training and performance coaching for various types of dance.

[[Choreography (dance)|Choreographers]] are often university trained and are typically employed for particular projects or, more rarely may work on contract as the resident choreographer for a specific dance company.

==Competitions==
[[File:MIT 2006 Standard Prechamp Final 2.jpg|thumb|right|320px|An amateur dancesport competition, featuring the [[Viennese Waltz]]]]

A '''dance competition''' is an organized event in which contestants perform dances before a judge or judges for awards, and in some cases, monetary prizes. There are several major types of dance competitions, distinguished primarily by the style or styles of dances performed. Major types of dance competitions include:
*'''[[Competitive dance]]''', in which a variety of theater dance styles, such as [[acro dance|acro]], [[ballet]], [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[hip-hop]], [[lyrical dance|lyrical]], and [[tap dance|tap]], are permitted.
*'''Open''' competitions, that permit a wide variety of dance styles. An example of this is the TV program ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]''.
*'''[[Dancesport]]''', which is focused exclusively on [[ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[latin dance]]. Examples of this are TV programs ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''.
*'''Single-style''' competitions, such as; [[Scottish highland dance|highland dance]], [[dance squad|dance team]], and [[Irish dance]], that only permit a single dance style.

In addition, there are numerous dance competitions shows [[Dance on television|presented on television]] and other mass media.
