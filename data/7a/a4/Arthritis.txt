'''Arthritis''' (from Greek ''arthro-'', joint + ''-itis'', inflammation; plural: arthritides) is a form of [[arthropathy|joint disorder]] that involves [[inflammation]] of one or more joints.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/arthritis thefreedictionary.com > arthritis] in turn citing:
*The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright 2000
*The American Heritage Science Dictionary Copyright 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/arthritis arthritis]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary&nbsp;– Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 24, 2012.</ref>
There are over 100 different forms of arthritis.<ref>[http://www.healthline.com/adamcontent/arthritis Healthline]</ref><ref>[http://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/guide/arthritis-basics Web MD]</ref> The most common form of arthritis is [[osteoarthritis]] (degenerative joint disease), a result of trauma to the joint, infection of the joint, or age. Other arthritis forms are [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], and related [[autoimmune disorder|autoimmune diseases]]. [[Septic arthritis]] is caused by joint [[infection]].

The major complaint by individuals who have arthritis is [[joint pain]]. Pain is often a constant and may be localized to the joint affected.
The pain from arthritis is due to [[inflammation]] that occurs around the joint, damage to the joint from disease, daily wear and tear of joint, muscle [[strain (injury)|strains]] caused by forceful movements against stiff painful joints and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].

==Classification==
There are several diseases where joint pain is primary, and is considered the main feature. Generally when a person has "arthritis" it means that they have one of these diseases, which include:
* [[Osteoarthritis]]
* [[Rheumatoid arthritis]]
* [[Gout]] and [[Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease|pseudo-gout]]
* [[Septic arthritis]]
* [[Ankylosing spondylitis]]
* [[Juvenile idiopathic arthritis]]
* [[Adult-onset Still's disease|Still's disease]]

Joint pain can also be a symptom of other diseases. In this case, the arthritis is considered to be secondary to the main disease; these include:
* [[Psoriasis]] ([[Psoriatic arthritis]])
* [[Reactive arthritis]]
* [[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]]
* [[Haemochromatosis]]
* [[Hepatitis]]
* [[Lyme disease]]
* [[Sjogren's disease]]
* [[Hashimoto's Thyroiditis]]
* [[Inflammatory bowel disease]] (including [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]])
* [[Henoch-Schönlein purpura]]
* [[Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with recurrent fever]]
* [[Sarcoidosis]]
* [[Whipple's disease]]
* [[TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome]]
* [[Granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] (and many other [[vasculitis]] syndromes)
* [[Familial Mediterranean fever]]
* [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]]

{{anchor|undifferentiated}}
An ''undifferentiated arthritis'' is an arthritis that does not fit into well-known clinical disease categories, possibly being an early stage of a definite [[rheumatic disease]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wollenhaupt J, Zeidler H | title = Undifferentiated arthritis and reactive arthritis | journal = Current opinion in rheumatology | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 306–313 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9725091 | doi = 10.1097/00002281-199807000-00005 }}</ref>

Pain, which can vary in severity, is a common symptom in virtually all types of arthritis. Other symptoms include [[swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[joint stiffness]] and aching around the joint(s). Arthritic disorders like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can affect other organs in the body, leading to a variety of symptoms.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/AAG/arthritis.htm Arthritis: The Nation’s Most Common Cause of Disability] Centers for disease prevention and health promotion. Retrieved on 2010-01-24</ref> Symptoms may include:

* Inability to use the [[hand]] or [[walking|walk]]
* Stiffness, which may be worse in the morning, or after use
* [[Malaise]] and fatigue
* [[Weight loss]]
* Poor [[sleep]]
* [[myalgia|Muscle aches]] and pains
* [[Tenderness (medicine)|Tenderness]]
* Difficulty moving the joint

It is common in advanced arthritis for significant secondary changes to occur. For example, arthritic symptoms might make it difficult for a person to move around and/or exercise, which can lead to secondary effects, such as:
* Muscle [[weakness]]
* Loss of [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]]
* Decreased [[aerobic exercise|aerobic fitness]]
These changes, in addition to the primary symptoms, can have a huge impact on quality of life.

===Disability===

Arthritis is the most common cause of [[disability]] in the USA. More than 20 million individuals with arthritis have severe limitations in function on a daily basis.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/aag/arthritis.htm Arthritis: The Nation's Most Common Cause of Disability] The Center for Disease Control. Retrieved on 2015-01-04</ref> [[Absenteeism]] and frequent visits to the [[physician]] are common in individuals who have arthritis. Arthritis can make it very difficult for individuals to be physically active and some become home bound.

It is estimated that the total cost of arthritis cases is close to $100 billion of which almost 50% is from lost earnings. Each year, arthritis results in nearly 1 million hospitalizations and close to 45 million outpatient visits to [[health care]] centers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CDC - Arthritis - Data and Statistics - FAQs (Data Related) - Cost Analysis|url = http://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/data_statistics/faqs/cost_analysis.htm|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}</ref>

Decreased mobility, in combination with the above symptoms, can make it difficult for an individual to remain physically active, contributing to an increased risk of obesity, high [[cholesterol]] or vulnerability to [[heart disease]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Rheumatoid Arthritis and Heart Disease Risk: Atherosclerosis, Heart Attacks, and More|url = http://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/heart-disease-rheumatoid-arthritis|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}</ref> People with arthritis are also at increased risk of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], which may be a response to numerous factors, including fear of worsening symptoms.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Coping With Depression and Rheumatoid Arthritis|url = http://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/features/ra-depression|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional, and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests, depending on the type of suspected arthritis.<ref>{{Cite web|title = How is arthritis diagnosed? {{!}} Arthritis Research UK|url = http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/arthritis-information/conditions/arthritis/diagnosis.aspx|website = www.arthritisresearchuk.org|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}</ref> All arthritides potentially feature [[pain]]. Pain patterns may differ depending on the arthritides and the location. [[Rheumatoid arthritis]] is generally worse in the morning and associated with stiffness; in the early stages, patients often have no symptoms after a morning shower. [[Osteoarthritis]], on the other hand, tends to be worse after exercise. In the aged and children, pain might not be the main presenting feature; the aged patient simply moves less, the infantile patient refuses to use the affected limb.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Elements of the history of the disorder guide diagnosis. Important features are speed and time of onset, pattern of joint involvement, symmetry of symptoms, early morning stiffness, tenderness, gelling or locking with inactivity, aggravating and relieving factors, and other systemic symptoms. Physical examination may confirm the diagnosis, or may indicate systemic disease. Radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity.

[[Blood test]]s and [[X-ray]]s of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis. Screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected. These might include: [[rheumatoid factor]], [[antinuclear factor]] (ANF), [[extractable nuclear antigen]], and specific antibodies.

===Osteoarthritis===
[[Osteoarthritis]] is the most common form of arthritis.<ref name=Van2010>{{cite journal | author = VanItallie TB | title = Gout: epitome of painful arthritis | journal = Metab. Clin. Exp. | volume = 59 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S32–6 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20837191 | doi = 10.1016/j.metabol.2010.07.009 }}</ref> It can affect both the larger and the smaller joints of the body, including the hands, [[wrist osteoarthritis|wrists]], feet, back, hip, and knee. The disease is essentially one acquired from daily wear and tear of the joint; however, osteoarthritis can also occur as a result of injury. In recent years, some joint or limb deformities, such as knock-knee or acetabular overcoverage or dysplasia, have also been considered as a predisposing factor for knee or hip osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage and eventually causes the two opposing bones to erode into each other. The condition starts with minor pain during physical activity, but soon the pain can be continuous and even occur while in a state of rest. The pain can be debilitating and prevent one from doing some activities. Osteoarthritis typically affects the weight-bearing joints, such as the back, spine, and pelvis. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is most commonly a disease of the elderly. More than 30 percent of women have some degree of osteoarthritis by age 65. Risk factors for osteoarthritis include prior joint trauma, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle.

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
{{main|Rheumatoid arthritis}}
Rheumatoid arthritis is a disorder in which the body's own immune system starts to attack body [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. The attack is not only directed at the joint but to many other parts of the body. In rheumatoid arthritis, most damage occurs to the joint lining and [[cartilage]] which eventually results in erosion of two opposing bones. Rheumatoid arthritis often affects joints in the fingers, wrists, knees and elbows. The disease is symmetrical (appears on both sides of the body) and can lead to severe [[deformity]] in a few years if not treated. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs mostly in people aged 20 and above. In children, the disorder can present with a skin [[rash]], [[fever]], [[pain]], disability, and limitations in daily activities. Often, it is not clear why the rheumatoid arthritis occurred. With earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment, many individuals can lead a decent quality of life. The drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis range from [[corticosteroid]]s to [[monoclonal antibodies]] given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. The latest drugs like [[infliximab|Remicade]] can significantly improve quality of life in the short term. In rare cases, surgery may be required to replace joints but there is no cure for the illness.<ref>[http://www.aihw.gov.au/cdarf/diseases_pages/index.cfm Chronic Diseases] Australian Institute Of Health And Welfare.

Bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis. Bone continuously undergoes remodeling by actions of bone resorbing osteoclasts and bone forming osteoblasts. One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the synovium, caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts.<ref name="Chabaud_2000"/> Osteoclast activity can be directly induced by osteoblasts through the RANK/RANKL mechanism.<ref name="pmid21464945">{{cite journal | author = Won HY, Lee JA, Park ZS, Song JS, Kim HY, Jang SM, Yoo SE, Rhee Y, Hwang ES, Bae MA | title = Prominent bone loss mediated by RANKL and IL-17 produced by CD4+ T cells in TallyHo/JngJ mice | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = e18168 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21464945 | pmc = 3064589 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0018168 }}</ref>

===Gout===
[[Gout]] is caused by deposition of [[uric acid]] crystals in the joint, causing inflammation. There is also an uncommon form of gouty arthritis caused by the formation of rhomboid crystals of calcium pyrophosphate known as [[Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease|pseudogout]]. In the early stages, the gouty arthritis usually occurs in one joint, but with time, it can occur in many joints and be quite crippling. The joints in gout can often become swollen and lose function. Gouty arthritis can become particularly painful and potentially debilitating when gout cannot successfully be treated.<ref name=Becker>{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Michael A.|title=Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A textbook of Rheumatology edition 15|year=2005|publisher=Lippincot Williams & Wilkins|pages=2303–2339}}</ref> When uric acid levels and gout symptoms cannot be controlled with standard gout medicines that decrease the production of uric acid (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat) or increase uric acid elimination from the body through the kidneys (e.g., probenecid), this can be referred to as refractory chronic gout or RCG.<ref name=Ali>{{cite journal | author = Ali S, Lally EV | title = Treatment failure gout | journal = Medicine and health, Rhode Island | volume = 92 | issue = 11 | pages = 369–71 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19999896 }}</ref>

===Other===
[[Infectious arthritis]] is another severe form of arthritis. It presents with sudden onset of chills, fever and joint pain. The condition is caused by bacteria elsewhere in the body. Infectious arthritis must be rapidly diagnosed and treated promptly to prevent irreversible joint damage.<ref>[http://www.arthritis.org/ Severe Arthritis Disease Facts] Retrieved on 2010-02-05</ref>

[[Psoriasis]] can develop into psoriatic arthritis. With psoriatic arthritis, most individuals develop the skin problem first and then the arthritis. The typical features are of continuous joint pains, stiffness and swelling. The disease does recur with periods of [[remission (medicine)|remission]] but there is no cure for the disorder. A small percentage develop a severe painful and destructive form of arthritis which destroys the small joints in the hands and can lead to permanent disability and loss of hand function.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/psoriatic-arthritis/DS00476/DSECTION=symptoms Psoriatic Arthritis] Mayo Clinic. Retrieved on 2010-02-05</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no known cure for either rheumatoid or osteoarthritis. Treatment options vary depending on the type of arthritis and include [[physical therapy]], lifestyle changes (including exercise and weight control), [[Brace (orthopaedic)|orthopedic bracing]], and medications. [[Joint replacement surgery]] may be required in eroding forms of arthritis. Medications can help reduce inflammation in the joint which decreases pain. Moreover, by decreasing inflammation, the joint damage may be slowed.

===Physical therapy===
In general, studies have shown that physical exercise of the affected joint can have noticeable improvement in terms of long-term pain relief. Furthermore, exercise of the arthritic joint is encouraged to maintain the health of the particular joint and the overall body of the person.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ettinger WH, Burns R, Messier SP, Applegate W, Rejeski WJ, Morgan T, Shumaker S, Berry MJ, O'Toole M, Monu J, Craven T | title = A randomized trial comparing aerobic exercise and resistance exercise with a health education program in older adults with knee osteoarthritis.

Individuals with arthritis can benefit from both physical and [[occupational therapy]]. In arthritis the joints become stiff and the range of movement can be limited. Physical therapy has been shown to significantly improve function, decrease pain, and delay need for surgical intervention in advanced cases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fransen M, Crosbie J, Edmonds J | title = Physical therapy is effective for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: a randomized controlled clinical trial | journal = J. Rheumatol. | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 156–64 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11196518 | url = http://www.jrheum.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11196518 }}</ref> Exercise prescribed by a physical therapist has been shown to be more effective than medications in treating osteoarthritis of the knee. Exercise often focuses on improving muscle strength, endurance and flexibility. In some cases, exercises may be designed to train balance. Occupational therapy can provide assistance with activities as well as equipment.

===Medications===
There are several types of medications that are used for the treatment of arthritis. Treatment typically begins with medications that have the fewest side effects with further medications being added if insufficiently effective.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.arthritistoday.org/treatments/drug-guide/index.php|title=Arthritis Drugs|work=arthritistoday.org|accessdate=July 5, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100722013235/http://www.arthritistoday.org/treatments/drug-guide/index.php| archivedate= 22 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Depending on the type of arthritis, the medications that are given may be different. For example, the first-line treatment for [[osteoarthritis]] is [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) while for [[inflammatory arthritis]] it involves [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) like [[ibuprofen]]. [[Opioid]]s and NSAIDs are less well tolerated.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reid MC, Shengelia R, Parker SJ | title = Pharmacologic management of osteoarthritis-related pain in older adults | journal = The American journal of nursing | volume = 112 | issue = 3 Suppl 1 | pages = S38–43 | date = Mar 2012 | pmid = 22373746 | pmc = 3733545 | doi=10.1097/01.NAJ.0000412650.02926.e3}}</ref>

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is [[autoimmune]] so in addition to using pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs, this type uses another category of drug called disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ([[DMARDS]]). An example of this type of drug is [[Methotrexate]]. These types of drugs act on the [[immune system]] and slow down the progression of RA.

More natural medicines are being put to the test in well-designed clinical trials. Here are nine supplements that are backed by science and shown to be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and arthritis-related conditions:  [http://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/treatments/natural/supplements-herbs/9-supplements-arthritis.php   9 Supplements for Arthritis]

==Epidemiology==
Arthritis is predominantly a disease of the elderly, but children can also be affected by the disease. More than 70% of individuals in North America affected by arthritis are over the age of 65.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Arthritis is more common in women than men at all ages and affects all races, [[ethnic group]]s and cultures. In the United States a CDC survey based on data from 2007–2009 showed 22.2% (49.9 million) of adults aged ≥18 years had self-reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis, and 9.4% (21.1 million or 42.4% of those with arthritis) had arthritis-attributable activity limitation (AAAL). With an aging population, this number is expected to increase.<ref>{{cite web |author=Walsh  |title=One in Five Adults Has Arthritis |date=7 October 2010 |publisher=MedPage Today |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Rheumatology/Arthritis/22612?}}<br/>based on {{cite journal | author = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | title = Prevalence of doctor-diagnosed arthritis and arthritis-attributable activity limitation&nbsp;– United States, 2007–2009 | journal = MMWR Morb.
