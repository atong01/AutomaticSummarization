Nicknamed "the city of a thousand [[minaret]]s" for its preponderance of [[Islamic architecture]], Cairo has long been a center of the region's political and cultural life. Cairo was founded by Jawhar al-Siqilli "The Sicilian", of the [[Fatimids|Fatimid dynasty]], in the 10th century CE, but the land composing the present-day city was the site of national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of [[Old Cairo]]. Cairo is also associated with [[Ancient Egypt]] as it is close to the ancient cities of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], [[Giza]] and [[Fustat]] which are near the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]] and the [[Giza Necropolis|pyramids of Giza]].

Egyptians today often refer to Cairo as ''{{transl|arz|Maṣr}}'' ({{IPA-arz|mɑsˤɾ|}}, {{lang|ar|مصر}}), the [[Egyptian Arabic]] pronunciation of the name for Egypt itself, emphasizing the city's continued role in Egyptian influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Behrens-Abouseif|1992|p=8}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Golia|2004|p=152}}</ref> Its official name is {{lang|ar|القاهرة}} ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|al-Qāhirah&#x202f;}}'', means literally: "the Defeater", in reference to the fact that the planet Mars ("Al Najm Al Qahir") was rising at the time when the city was founded{{cn|date=October 2015}} as well as, "the Vanquisher"; "the Conqueror"; {{IPA-arz|elqɑ(ː)ˈheɾɑ}}, "the Defeater" or, " "the Victorious" (al-Qahira) in reference to the much awaited<ref>[[Cairo#Foundation and expansion]]</ref> Caliph al-Mu'izz li Din Allah who arrived from the old Fatimid [[Ifriqiya]]n capital of [[Mahdia]] in 973 to the city.

Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industries in the Arab world, as well as the world's second-oldest institution of higher learning, [[al-Azhar University]].

=== Initial settlements ===

The area around present-day Cairo, especially [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], had long been a focal point of [[Ancient Egypt]] due to its strategic location just upstream from the [[Nile Delta]]. However, the origins of the modern city are generally traced back to a series of settlements in the first millennium. Around the turn of the 4th century,<ref>{{harvnb|Hawass|Brock|2003|p=456}}</ref> as Memphis was continuing to decline in importance,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2009 |title=Memphis (Egypt) |encyclopedia=Encarta |publisher=Microsoft |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573551/memphis_(egypt).html |accessdate=24 July 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQXIiNw|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes |ref=harv}}</ref> the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] established a fortress town along the east bank of the [[Nile]]. This fortress, known as [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]], remains the oldest structure in the city. It is also situated at the nucleus of the [[Coptic Orthodox]] community, which separated from the Roman and Byzantine church in the late 4th century. Many of Cairo's oldest Coptic churches, including the [[Hanging Church]], are located along the fortress walls in a section of the city known as [[Coptic Cairo]].  

===Foundation and expansion===
{{Further|Egypt in the Middle Ages}}
[[File:Cairo map1847 Baur-Szultz.jpg|thumb|left|Cairo map 1847]]
In 968, the [[Fatimid]]s were led by General [[Gawhar al-Siqilli]] with his [[Kutama]] army,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akdn.org/hcp/egypt.asp|title=Egypt - Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref> to establish a new capital for the [[Fatimid|Fatimid dynasty]]. Egypt was conquered from their base in [[Ifriqiya]] and a new fortified city northeast of [[Fustat]] was established. It took four years for Gawhar to build the city, initially known as al-Manṣūriyyah,<ref name="glsm96">{{harvnb|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=96}}</ref> which was to serve as the new capital of the caliphate. During that time, Jawhar also commissioned the construction of [[al-Azhar Mosque]], which developed into the third-oldest university in the world. Cairo would eventually become a centre of learning, with the library of Cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books.<ref>{{harvnb|Meri|Bacharach|2006|p=451}}</ref> When Caliph [[Al-Muizz Lideenillah|al-Mu'izz li Din Allah]] finally arrived from the old Fatimid capital of [[Mahdia]] in [[Tunisia]] in 973, he gave the city its present name, ''al-Qahira'' ("The Victorious").<ref name="glsm96"/>

For nearly 200 years after Cairo was established, the administrative centre of Egypt remained in [[Fustat]]. However, in 1168 the Fatimids under the leadership of [[Vizier]] [[Shawar]] set fire to Fustat to prevent Cairo's capture by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]].<ref>{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|p=213}}</ref> Egypt's capital was permanently moved to Cairo, which was eventually expanded to include the ruins of Fustat and the previous capitals of [[al-Askar]] and [[al-Qatta'i]]. While the Fustat fire successfully protected the city of Cairo, a continuing power struggle between Shawar, [[List of Kings of Jerusalem|King]] [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]], and the [[Zengid]] general [[Shirkuh]] led to the downfall of the Fatimid establishment.<ref>{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|pp=213–5}}</ref>

In 1169 [[Saladin]] was appointed as the new vizier of Egypt by the Fatimids and two years later he would seize power from the family of the last Fatimid caliph, [[al-'Āḍid]].<ref>{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|p=215}}</ref> As the first [[Sultan of Egypt]], Saladin established the [[Ayyubid dynasty]], based in Cairo, and aligned Egypt with the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], who were based in [[Baghdad]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=438}}</ref> During his reign, Saladin also constructed the [[Cairo Citadel]], which served as the seat of the Egyptian government until the mid-19th century.
[[File:Cairo-citadel-1800s.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Cairo Citadel]], seen above in the late 19th century, was commissioned by [[Saladin]] between 1176 and 1183|alt=A multi-domed mosque dominates the walled Citadel, with ruined tombs and a lone minaret in front.]]

In 1250 slave soldiers, known as the [[Mamluk]]s, seized control of Egypt and like many of their predecessors established Cairo as the capital of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|their new dynasty]]. Continuing a practice started by the Ayyubids, much of the land occupied by former Fatimid palaces was sold and replaced by newer buildings.<ref>{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=122}}</ref> Construction projects initiated by the Mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=120–8}}</ref> Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of [[Islamic studies|Islamic scholarship]] and a crossroads on the [[spice trade]] route among the civilisations in [[Afro-Eurasia]]. By 1340, Cairo had a population of close to half a million, making it the largest city west of [[Yuan Dynasty|China]].<ref name="sh199">{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=199}}</ref>

Although Cairo avoided [[Europe]]'s stagnation during the [[Late Middle Ages]], it could not escape the [[Black Death]], which struck the city more than fifty times between 1348 and 1517.<ref>{{harvnb|Shoshan|2002|p=4}}</ref> During its initial, and most deadly waves, approximately 200,000 people were killed by the plague,<ref>{{harvnb|Bryne|2004|pp=104–5}}</ref> and, by the 15th century, Cairo's population had been reduced to between 150,000 and 300,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Shoshan|2002|p=1}}</ref> The city's status was further diminished after [[Vasco da Gama]] discovered a sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] between 1497 and 1499, thereby allowing spice traders to avoid Cairo.<ref name="sh199"/>
Cairo's political influence diminished significantly after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] supplanted [[Mamluk]] power over [[Egypt]] in 1517. Ruling from [[Constantinople]], [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Selim I]] relegated Egypt to a mere [[Eyalet|province]], with Cairo as its capital.<ref name="sh447">{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=447}}</ref> For this reason, the history of Cairo during Ottoman times is often described as inconsequential, especially in comparison to other time periods.<ref name="sh199"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://menic.utexas.edu/cairo/history/ottoman/ottoman.html |publisher=The University of Texas Centre for Middle Eastern Studies |title=Ottoman Cairo |year=1995 |last=Rose |first=Christopher |author2=Linda Boxberger |work=Cairo: Living Past, Living Future |accessdate=30 July 2009}}</ref><ref name="wi225">{{harvnb|Winter|1992|p=225}}</ref> However, during the 16th and 17th centuries, Cairo remained an important economic and cultural centre. Although no longer on the spice route, the city facilitated the transportation of [[Yemen]]i [[coffee]] and [[India]]n [[textile]]s, primarily to [[Anatolia]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Balkans]]. Cairene merchants were instrumental in bringing goods to the barren [[Hejaz]], especially during the annual [[hajj]] to [[Mecca]].<ref name="wi225"/><ref>{{harvnb|İnalcık|Faroqhi|Quataert|McGowan|1997|pp=507–9}}</ref> It was during this same period that al-Azhar University reached the predominance among Islamic schools that it continues to hold today;<ref>{{harvnb|Winter|2004|p=115}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|pp=94–5}}</ref> pilgrims on their way to hajj often attested to the superiority of the institution, which had become associated with Egypt's body of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]].<ref>{{harvnb|Winter|2004|pp=115–7}}</ref> By the 16th century, Cairo also had [[Tower block|high-rise]] [[apartment|apartment buildings]] where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were [[renting|rented]] out to [[Leasehold estate|tenants]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Traditional Islamic principles of built environment|first=Hisham|last=Mortada|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2003|isbn=0-7007-1700-5|page=viii|ref=harv}}</ref>

Under the Ottomans, Cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the [[Cairo Citadel|Citadel]].<ref>{{harvnb|Winter|1992|p=226}}</ref> The city was the second-largest in the empire, behind only Constantinople, and, although migration was not the primary source of Cairo's growth, twenty percent of its population at the end of the 18th century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].<ref name="wi2267">{{harvnb|Winter|1992|pp=226–7}}</ref> Still, when [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] arrived in Cairo in 1798, the city's population was less than 300,000, forty percent lower than it was at the height of Mamluk—and Cairene—influence in the mid-14th century.<ref name="sh199"/><ref name="wi2267"/>

The [[Campaign of Egypt|French occupation]] was short-lived as [[British Empire|British]] and Ottoman forces, including a sizable [[Albanians|Albanian]] contingent, recaptured the country in 1801.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicker|2001|p=103}}</ref> The British vacated Egypt two years later, leaving the Ottomans, the Albanians, and the long-weakened [[Mamluk]]s jostling for control of the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicker|2001|p=104}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Afaf Lutfi Sayyid-Marsot|1984|p=39}}</ref> Continued civil war allowed an Albanian named [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] to ascend to the role of [[commander]] and eventually, with the approval of the [[ulema|religious establishment]], viceroy of Egypt in 1805.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicker|2001|pp=104–5}}</ref>

Until his death in 1848, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern Egypt.<ref>{{harvnb|Afaf Lutfi Sayyid-Marsot|1984|p=1}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McGregor|2006|p=53}}</ref> However, while Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city,<ref>{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=437}}</ref> those reforms had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape.<ref>{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=291, 302}}</ref> Bigger changes came to Cairo under [[Isma'il Pasha]] (r. 1863–1879), who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather. Drawing inspiration from [[Paris]], Isma'il environs a city of maidans and wide avenues; due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing [[Downtown Cairo]], came to fruition.<ref>{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=313–4}}</ref> Isma'il also sought to modernize the city, which was merging with neighboring settlements, by establishing a [[public works]] ministry, bringing [[natural gas|gas]] and lighting to the city, and opening a theater and opera house.<ref>{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=311–3}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Abu-Lughod|1965|pp=436–44}}</ref>

The immense debt resulting from Isma'il's projects provided a pretext for increasing European control, which culminated with the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War|British invasion]] in 1882.<ref name="sh199"/> The city's economic centre quickly moved west toward the [[Nile]], away from the historic [[Islamic Cairo]] section and toward the contemporary, European-style areas built by Isma'il.<ref>{{harvnb|Abu-Lughod|1965|pp=429–31, 455–7}}</ref><ref name="hokhwi317">{{harvnb|Hourani|Khoury|Wilson|2004|p=317}}</ref> Europeans accounted for five percent of Cairo's population at the end of the 19th century, by which point they held most top governmental positions.<ref>{{harvnb|Abu-Lughod|1965|p=431}}</ref>

The British occupation was intended to be temporary, but it lasted well into the 20th century. Nationalists staged [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|large-scale demonstrations]] in Cairo in 1919,<ref name="sh199"/> five years after Egypt had been declared a British [[protectorate]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{harvnb|Hourani|Khoury|Wilson|2004|p=12}}</ref> Nevertheless, while this led to Egypt's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|independence in 1922]], British troops remained in the country until 1956. During this time, urban Cairo, spurred by new bridges and transport links, continued to expand to include the upscale neighbourhoods of [[Garden City (Cairo)|Garden City]], [[Zamalek]], and [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=326–9}}</ref> Between 1882 and 1937, the population of Cairo more than tripled—from 347,000 to 1.3 million<ref>{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=319}}</ref>—and its area increased from {{convert|10|to|163|km2|sqmi|0}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=322}}</ref>

The city was devastated during the 1952 riots known as the [[Cairo Fire]] or Black Saturday, which saw the destruction of nearly 700 shops, movie theatres, casinos and hotels in Downtown Cairo.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ahram.org.eg/433/2011/02/04/457/55/Malafat.aspx |script-title=ar:خسائر الحريق |date=12 May 2010 |journal=[[Al-Ahram]] |trans_title=The Fire Damage |language=Arabic |accessdate=4 February 2011 |ref=harv}}</ref> The British departed Cairo following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], but the city's rapid growth showed no signs of abating. Seeking to accommodate the increasing population, [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] redeveloped [[Midan Tahrir]] and the Nile [[Corniche]], and improved the city's network of bridges and highways.<ref>{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=349}}</ref> Meanwhile, additional controls of the Nile fostered development within [[Gezira Island]] and along the city's waterfront. The metropolis began to encroach on the fertile [[Nile Delta]], prompting the government to build desert [[satellite town]]s and devise incentives for city-dwellers to move to them.<ref>{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=343–5}}</ref>

Despite these efforts, Cairo's population has doubled since the 1960s, reaching close to seven million (with an additional ten million in its [[urban area]]). Concurrently, Cairo has established itself as a political and economic hub for [[North Africa]] and the [[Arab world|Arab World]], with many multinational businesses and organisations, including the [[Arab League]], operating out of the city.

In 1992, Cairo was hit by a [[1992 Cairo earthquake|damaging earthquake]], that caused 545 deaths, 6512 injuries and left 50,000 people homeless.<ref name="NGDC">{{cite web|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?eq_0=5339&t=101650&s=13&d=22,26,13,12&nd=display|title=NGDC page on the Cairo earthquake|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>

The uprising was mainly a campaign of non-violent civil resistance, which featured a series of demonstrations, marches, acts of civil disobedience, and labour strikes. Millions of protesters from a variety of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Despite being predominantly peaceful in nature, the revolution was not without violent clashes between security forces and protesters, with at least 846 people killed and 6,000 injured. The uprising took place in Cairo, Alexandria, and in other cities in Egypt, following the [[Tunisian revolution]] that resulted in the overthrow of the long-time [[President of Tunisia|Tunisian president]] [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]]. On 11 February, following weeks of determined popular protest and pressure, Hosni Mubarak resigned from office.

Cairo is located in northern [[Egypt]], known as [[Lower Egypt]], {{convert|165|km|mi|-1}} south of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and {{convert|120|km|mi}} west of the [[Gulf of Suez]] and [[Suez Canal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=cairo+to+suez|work=WolframAlpha |publisher=Wolfram Research |accessdate=10 September 2009 |title=Cairo to Suez}}</ref> The city is along the [[Nile|Nile River]], immediately south of the point where the river leaves its desert-bound valley and branches into the low-lying [[Nile Delta]] region. Although the Cairo metropolis extends away from the Nile in all directions, the city of Cairo resides only on the east bank of the river and two islands within it on a total area of {{convert|453|km2|sqmi}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cairo.gov.eg/C17/C8/Cairo%20Maps/default.aspx |publisher=Cairo Governorate |accessdate=10 September 2009 |title=Cairo Maps |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090419130737/http://www.cairo.gov.eg:80/C17/C8/Cairo%20Maps/default.aspx |archivedate=19 April 2009 }}</ref><ref name="citypop">{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Egypt.html |publisher=City Population |last=Brinkhoff |first=Thomas |accessdate=12 September 2009 |title=Egypt: Governorates & Cities}}</ref>

Until the mid-19th century, when the river was tamed by dams, levees, and other controls, the Nile in the vicinity of Cairo was highly susceptible to changes in course and surface level. Over the years, the Nile gradually shifted westward, providing the site between the eastern edge of the river and the [[Mokattam]] highlands on which the city now stands. The land on which Cairo was established in 969 (present-day [[Islamic Cairo]]) was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier, when [[Fustat]] was first built.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2002|p=125}}</ref>

Low periods of the Nile during the 11th century continued to add to the landscape of Cairo; a new island, known as ''Geziret al-Fil'', first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connected to the mainland. Today, the site of ''Geziret al-Fil'' is occupied by the [[Shubra]] district. The low periods created another island at the turn of the 14th century that now composes [[Zamalek]] and [[Gezira Island|Gezira]]. [[Land reclamation]] efforts by the [[Mamluk]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] further contributed to expansion on the east bank of the river.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2002|p=126}}</ref>

Because of the Nile's movement, the newer parts of the city—[[Garden City (Cairo)|Garden City]], [[Downtown Cairo]], and Zamalek—are located closest to the riverbank.<ref name="riverbank">

}}</ref> The areas, which are home to most of Cairo's [[diplomatic mission|embassies]], are surrounded on the north, east, and south by the older parts of the city. [[Old Cairo]], located south of the centre, holds the remnants of [[Fustat]] and the heart of Egypt's [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]] community, [[Coptic Cairo]]. The [[Boulaq]] district, which lies in the northern part of the city, was born out of a major 16th-century port and is now a major industrial centre. The [[Cairo Citadel|Citadel]] is located east of the city centre around [[Islamic Cairo]], which dates back to the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] era and the foundation of Cairo. While western Cairo is dominated by wide boulevards, open spaces, and [[modern architecture]] of European influence, the eastern half, having grown haphazardly over the centuries, is dominated by small lanes, crowded tenements, and [[Islamic architecture]].

Northern and extreme eastern parts of Cairo, which include [[satellite town]]s, are among the most recent additions to the city, as they developed in the late-20th and early-21st centuries to accommodate the city's rapid growth. The western bank of the Nile is commonly included within the urban area of Cairo, but it composes the city of [[Giza]] and the [[Giza Governorate]]. Giza has also undergone significant expansion over recent years, and today the city, although still a suburb of Cairo, has a population of 2.7 million.<ref name="citypop"/> The Cairo Governorate was just north of the [[Helwan Governorate]] from 2008 when some Cairo's southern districts, including [[Maadi]] and [[New Cairo]], were split off and annexed into the new governorate,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/894/eg6.htm |publisher=al-Ahram Weekly |last=Leila |first=Reem |number=894 |date=24–30 April 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2009 |title=Redrawing the Map}}</ref> to 2011 when the Helwan Governorate was reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate.

===Climate===
In Cairo, and along the Nile River Valley, the climate is a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh'' according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system<ref>{{cite web|url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |title=World Map of Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification |publisher=Köppen-Geiger |accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref>), but often with high humidity as it is not very far from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Nile Delta]]. Wind storms can be frequent, bringing [[Mineral dust|Saharan dust]] into the city, sometimes from March to May (see [[Khamsin|Khamasin]]) and the air often becomes uncomfortably dry. High temperatures in winter range from {{convert|19|to|29|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while night-time lows drop to below {{convert|11|°C|0|abbr=on}}, often to {{convert|5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. In summer, the highs rarely surpass {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}}, and lows drop to about {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Rainfall is sparse and only happens in the colder months, but sudden showers do cause harsh flooding. Snowfall is extremely rare; a small amount of [[graupel]], widely believed to be [[snow]], fell on Cairo's easternmost suburbs on 13 December 2013, the first time Cairo's area received this kind of precipitation in many decades.<ref>{{cite news|title= Biblical snowstorm: Rare flakes in Cairo, Jerusalem paralyzed by over a foot |first= Jason |last= Samenow |work= The Washington Post |date= 13 December 2013 |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/12/13/rare-snow-in-cairo-jerusalem-paralyzed-in-historic-snow/}}</ref> Dewpoints in the warm months range from {{convert|13.9|°C|0|abbr=on}} in June to {{convert|18.3|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August.<ref name=NOAA/>

Cairo has an extensive road network, [[rail system]], [[Rapid transit|subway system]] and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and [[Microbus#Van conversions|Cairo microbuses]]. Cairo, specifically Ramses Square, is the centre of almost the entire Egyptian [[transport network|transportation network]].<ref name=TravelCairo>{{Cite book|title=Travel Cairo|year=2007|publisher=MobileReference|isbn=978-1-60501-055-7|url=http://books.google.com.tw/books?id=50O9dQlwreYC&pg=PT44&lpg=PT44&dq=cairo,+specifically+ramses+square,+is+the+centre+of+almost+the+entire+egyptian+transportation+network&source=bl&ots=xVe8a_96AL&sig=m80pe2fMggr7VUi5LuONGLJXPqw&hl=zh-TW&sa=X&ei=9c4LUPmLPILmmAXCwryfCg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

[[Cairo Metro|The subway system]], officially called "Metro (مترو)", is a fast and efficient way of getting around Cairo. Metro network covers [[Helwan]] and other suburbs. It can get very crowded during [[rush hour]]. Two train cars (the fourth and fifth ones) are reserved for women only, although women may ride in any car they want.

[[Trams in Greater Cairo]] ([[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]] and [[Nasr City]]) exists now, while Cairo trolleybus was closed.

An extensive road network connects Cairo with other Egyptian cities and villages. There is a new [[Ring road|Ring Road]] that surrounds the outskirts of the city, with exits that reach outer Cairo districts. There are flyovers and bridges, such as the Sixth of October bridge that, when the traffic is not heavy, allow fast<ref name=TravelCairo/> [[Mode of transport|means of transportation]] from one side of the city to the other.

===Sports===
[[File:Cairo International Stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Cairo International Stadium]] with 75,100 seats]]

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Egypt, and Cairo has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and regional leagues. The best known teams are [[Al-Ahly]], [[Zamalek SC|El Zamalek]] and [[Al-Ismaily]]. [[Al-Ahly]] and [[Zamalek SC|El Zamalek]]  annual football tournament is perhaps the most watched sports event in Egypt as well as the African-Arab region. Both teams are known as the "rivals" of Egyptian football, and are the first and the second champions in Africa and the [[Arab World]]. They play their home games at [[Cairo International Stadium]] or Naser Stadium, which is Egypt's 2nd largest stadium, Cairo's largest one and one of the largest stadiums in the world.

The Cairo International Stadium was built in 1960 and its multi-purpose sports complex that houses the main football stadium, an indoor stadium, several satellite fields that held several regional, continental and global games, including the [[All-Africa Games|African Games]], U17 Football World Championship and was one of the stadiums scheduled that hosted the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] which was played in January 2006. Egypt later won the competition and went on to win the next edition In Ghana (2008) making the Egyptian and Ghanaian national teams the only teams to win the African Nations Cup Back to back which resulted in Egypt winning the title for a record number of six times in the history of African Continental Competition. This was followed by a third consecutive win in Angola 2010, making Egypt the only country with a record 3-consecutive and 7-total Continental Football Competition winner. This achievement had also placed the Egyptian football team as the #12 best team in the world's FIFA rankings.

Cairo failed at the applicant stage when bidding for the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympic Games]], which was hosted in Beijing, China. However, Cairo did host the [[2007 Pan Arab Games]].

There are several other sports teams in the city that participate in several sports including el Gezira [[Sports club|Sporting Club]], el Shams Club, el Seid Club, Heliopolis Club and several smaller clubs, but the biggest clubs in Egypt (not in area but in sports) are [[Al-Ahly|Al Ahly]] and [[Zamalek|Al Zamalek]]. They have the two biggest football teams in Egypt. There are new sports clubs in the area of New Cairo (one hour far from Cairo's down town), these are Al Zohour sporting club, Wadi Degla sporting club and Platinum Club. 

Most of the sports federations of the country are also located in the city suburbs, including the [[Egyptian Football Association]]. The headquarters of the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) was previously located in Cairo, before relocating to its new headquarters in [[6th of October City|6 October City]], a small city away from Cairo's crowded districts.

On October 2008, the Egyptian Rugby Federation was officially formed and granted membership into the [[International Rugby Board]].

Egypt is internationally known for the excellence of its squash players who excel in both professional and junior divisions. Gizira Club in Zamalek is where former world #1 Amr Shabana and former world #1 Karim Darwish practice. The Heliopolis Club in Heliopolis is the home of current world #1 Ramy Ashour and his brother, world #24, Hisham Ashour. Other major squash-playing venues are The Shooting Club (Nadi el Seid) in Dokki, The Maadi Club in Maadi and Wadi Degla in Degla.

==Culture==
Over the ages, and as far back as four thousand years, Egypt stood as the land where many [[civilization]]s have met. The [[Pharaoh]]s together with the [[Greeks]], [[Babylonians]] and the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] have left their imprints here. [[Muslim]]s from the Arabian Peninsula, led by [['Amr ibn al-'As|Amr ibn al-A'as]], introduced [[Islam]] into Egypt. [[Khedive]] [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammad Ali]], with his Albanian family roots, put Egypt on the road to modernity. The cultural mixture in this city is only natural, considering its heritage. Egypt can be likened to an open museum with monuments of the different historical periods on display everywhere.

The [[Khedivial Opera House]] or Royal Opera House was the original opera house in Cairo, Egypt. It was dedicated on 1 November 1869 and burned down on 28 October 1971. After the original opera house was destroyed, Cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new Cairo Opera House in 1988.

===Cairo International Film Festival===
{{Main|Cairo International Film Festival}}
Egypt's love of the arts in general can be traced back to the rich heritage bequeathed by the Pharaohs. In modern times, Egypt has enjoyed a strong cinematic tradition since the art of filmmaking was first developed, early in the 20th century. A natural progression from the active theatre scene of the time, cinema rapidly evolved into a vast motion picture industry. This together with the much older music tradition, raised Egypt to become [[Hollywood]] Middle East and the [[cultural capital]] of the Arab world.

For more than 500 years of [[recorded history]], Egypt has fascinated the West and inspired its creative talents from play writer [[William Shakespeare]], poet and dramatist [[John Dryden]], and novelist and poet [[Lawrence Durrell]] to film producer [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. Since the [[silent film|silent movies]] Hollywood has been capitalising on the [[box office|box-office]] returns that come from combining Egyptian stories with visual effects.

Egypt has also been a fount of [[Arabic literature]], producing some of the 20th century's greatest Arab writers such as [[Taha Hussein]] and [[Tawfiq el-Hakim|Tawfiq al-Hakim]] to [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureate]], novelist [[Naguib Mahfouz]]. Each of them has written for the cinema.

With these credentials, it was clear that Cairo should aim to hold an international [[film festival]]. This dream came true on Monday 16 August 1976, when the first [[Cairo International Film Festival]] was launched by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics, headed by [[Kamal El-Mallakh]]. The Association ran the festival for seven years until 1983.

This achievement lead to the President of the Festival again contacting the [[FIAPF]] with the request that a competition should be included at the 1991 Festival. The request was granted.

In 1998, the Festival took place under the presidency of one of Egypt's leading actors, [[Hussein Fahmy]], who was appointed by the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Minister of Culture]], [[Farouk Hosny|Farouk Hosni]], after the death of Saad El-Din Wahba.

Four years later, the journalist and writer Cherif El-Shoubashy became president.

For 33 years The International Festival has awarded dozens of international superstars, including [[John Malkovich]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Bud Spencer]], [[Gina Lollobrigida]], [[Ornella Muti]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Claudia Cardinale]], [[Victoria Abril]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Shashi Kapoor]], [[Alain Delon]], [[Goldie Hawn]], [[Kurt Russell]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Greta Scacchi]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Julia Ormond]], [[Mira Sorvino]], [[Stuart Townsend]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Irene Papas]], [[Marcello Mastroianni]], [[Salma Hayek]], [[Lucy Liu]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Tom Berenger]] and [[Omar Sharif]], as well as directors like [[Robert Wise]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Oliver Stone]], [[Roland Joffé]], [[Carlos Saura]], [[Ismail Merchant]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], in an annual celebration and examination of the state of cinema in the world today. The presidents of the Festival since it was founded in 1976 are [[Saad El-Din Wahba]], [[Hussein Fahmy]] and [[Sherif El Shoubashy]]. This year the festival a milestone of 30 years in an annual celebration and examination of the state of cinema in the world today.

[[File:Solomon Schechter.jpg|thumb|upright|Solomon Schechter studying documents from the Cairo Geniza, c. 1895]]

===Cairo Geniza===
{{Main|Cairo Geniza}}
The [[Cairo Geniza]] is an accumulation of almost 200,000 Jewish manuscripts that were found in the genizah of the [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ben Ezra]] synagogue (built 882) of Fustat, Egypt (now Old Cairo), the Basatin cemetery east of Old Cairo, and a number of old documents that were bought in Cairo in the later 19th century. These documents were written from about 870 to as late as 1880 AD and have now been archived in various American and European libraries. The Taylor-Schechter collection in the [[University of Cambridge]] runs to 140,000 manuscripts, a further 40,000 manuscripts are at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]].

===Religions===
Most residents are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]]. Al-Azhar University is the leading authority of Sunni Islam. The number of [[mosque]]s in the city is growing. Most Christians are [[Copts]]. Until his death in March 2012, [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] was the leader of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]], whose residence is in Cairo. Cairo has several synagogues, but only few [[Judaism|Jews]] remain after [[Israel]] was established, and [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries#Egypt|persecution intensified]]. Tension between members of different religions has increased recently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/monde/egypte-24-coptes-tues-par-les-forces-de-l-ordre-au-caire-10-10-2011-1382636_24.php |title=Égypte : 24 coptes tués par les forces de l'ordre au Caire - Le Point |publisher=Lepoint.fr |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

Cairo accounts for 11 per cent of Egypt's population and 22 per cent of her economy (PPP). Cairo is also in every respect the centre of Egypt, as it has been almost since its founding in 969 AD. The majority of the nation's commerce is generated there, or passes through the city. The great majority of [[publishing|publishing houses]] and media outlets and nearly all [[Movie studio|film studios]] are there, as are half of the nation's hospital beds and universities. This has fueled rapid construction in the city—one building in five is less than 15 years old.

This astonishing growth until recently surged well ahead of [[Municipal services|city services]]. Homes, roads, electricity, telephone and sewer services were all suddenly in short supply. Analysts trying to grasp the magnitude of the change coined terms like "[[hyper-urbanization]]".

===Tahrir Square===
{{Main|Tahrir Square}}
[[File:Tahrir Square, Cairo, in the early morning - c.jpg|thumb|[[Tahrir Square]].]]
[[Tahrir Square]] was founded during the mid 19th century with the establishment of modern downtown Cairo. It was first named Ismailia Square, after the 19th-century ruler [[Khedive Ismail]], who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, though it was not officially renamed as such until after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] which eliminated the monarchy. Several notable buildings surround the square including, the [[American University in Cairo]]'s downtown campus, the [[Mogamma]] governmental administrative Building, the headquarters of the [[Arab League]], the Nile Ritz Carlton Hotel, and the [[Egyptian Museum]]. Being at the heart of Cairo, the square witnessed several major protests over the years. However, the most notable event in the square was being the focal point of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]] against former president [[Hosni Mubarak]].

===The Egyptian Museum===
{{Main|Egyptian Museum}}
The [[Egyptian Museum|Museum of Egyptian Antiquities]], known commonly as the Egyptian Museum, is home to the most extensive collection of [[ancient Egypt]]ian antiquities in the world. It has 136,000 items on display, with many more hundreds of thousands in its basement storerooms. Among its most famous collections on display are the finds from the Tomb of [[Tutankhamun]].

===Cairo Tower===
{{Main|Cairo Tower}}
[[File:Cairotower.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cairo Tower]]]]
The Cairo Tower is a free-standing tower with a revolving restaurant at the top. It provides a bird's eye view of Cairo to the restaurant patrons. It stands in the Zamalek district on Gezira Island in the Nile River, in the city centre. At 187 meters, it is 43 meters higher than the Great Pyramid of Giza, which stands some {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} to the southwest.

===Old Cairo===
{{Main|Old Cairo}}

This area of Cairo is so-named as it contains the remains of the ancient Roman [[Babylon Fortress|fortress of Babylon]] and also overlaps the original site of [[Fustat]], the first Arab settlement in Egypt (7th century AD) and the predecessor of later Cairo. The area is also known as [[Coptic Cairo]] as it holds a high concentration of old Christian churches including the [[Hanging Church]], the [[Church of St. George (Cairo)|Greek Orthodox Church of St. George]], and other Christian or Coptic buildings, most of which are located over the site of the ancient Roman fortress. It is also the location of the [[Coptic Museum]], which showcases the history of [[Coptic art]] from [[Egypt history#Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt|Greco-Roman]] to [[History of Muslim Egypt|Islamic]] times, and of the [[Ben Ezra Synagogue]], the oldest and best-known [[synagogue]] in Cairo, where the important collection of [[Cairo Geniza|Geniza documents]] were discovered in the 19th century.<ref>Williams, Caroline. 2008 (6th ed.). Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, p. 43.</ref> To the north of this Coptic enclave is the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As|Amr ibn al-'As Mosque]], the first mosque in Egypt and the most important religious center of former [[Fustat]], founded in 642 AD right after the [[Arab conquest of Egypt|Arab conquest]] but rebuilt many times since.<ref>Williams, Caroline. 2008 (6th ed.).

Cairo holds one of the greatest concentrations of historical monuments of [[Islamic architecture]] in the world.<ref name="ReferenceA">Williams, Caroline. 2008 (6th ed.). ''Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press.</ref> The areas around the old [[Fatimid architecture#Cairo fortifications|walled]] city and around the [[Citadel of Cairo|Citadel]] are characterized by hundreds of [[mosques]], tombs, [[madrasas]], mansions, [[caravanserais]], and fortifications dating from the Islamic era and are often referred to as "[[Islamic Cairo]]", especially in English travel literature.<ref>e.g. O'Neill, Zora et al. 2012. ''Lonely Planet: Egypt'' (11th edition).</ref> It is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the [[al-Hussein Mosque]] (whose shrine is believed to hold the head of [[Husayn ibn Ali]]), the Mausoleum of Imam [[al-Shafi'i]] (founder of the [[Shafi'i]] [[madhhab]], one of the primary schools of thought in [[Sunni]] Islamic [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]]), the [[Mashhad of Sayyida Ruqayya|Tomb of Sayyida Ruqayya]], the Mosque of Sayyida Nafisa, and others.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

While the first mosque in Egypt was the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Fustat]], the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] is the oldest mosque to retain its original form and is a rare example of [[Abbasid]] architecture, from the [[Islamic Golden Age|classical period of Islamic civilization]]. It was built in 876-879 AD in a style inspired by the Abbasid capital of [[Samarra]] in [[Iraq]].<ref>Williams, Caroline. 2008 (6th ed.). ''Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, pp. 50-54.</ref> It is one of the largest mosques in Cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful.<ref>Williams, Caroline. 2008 (6th ed.). ''Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, p 50.</ref><ref>O'Neill, Zora et al. 2012. ''Lonely Planet: Egypt'' (11th edition), p. 87.</ref>  Another Abbasid construction, the [[Nilometer]] on [[Rhoda Island]], is the oldest original structure in Cairo, built in 862 AD. It was designed to measure the level of the [[Nile]], which was important for agricultural and administrative purposes.<ref>Yeomans, Richard. 2006. ''The Art and Architecture of Islamic Cairo''. Garnet Publishing, p 29.</ref>

The city named Cairo (Arabic: ''al-Qahira'') was founded to the northeast of Fustat in 959 AD by the victorious [[Fatimid]] army. The Fatimids built a separate palatial city which contained their palaces and institutions of government. It was enclosed by a circuit of walls, which were rebuilt in stone in the late 11th century AD by the [[vizir]] [[Badr al-Jamali|Badr al-Gamali]],<ref>Raymond, André. 1993. ''Le Caire''. Fayard, p. 62.</ref> parts of which survive today at [[Bab Zuwayla]] in the south and [[Bab al-Futuh]] and [[Bab al-Nasr (Cairo)|Bab al-Nasr]] in the north.

One of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the Fatimid period was the [[Al-Azhar Mosque|Mosque of al-Azhar]], founded in 970 AD, which competes with the [[Qarawiyyin]] in [[Fes]] for the title of oldest university in the world.<ref name="Williams, Caroline p. 169">Williams, Caroline. 2008 (6th ed.). ''Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, p. 169.</ref> Today, [[al-Azhar University]] is the foremost center of Islamic learning in the world and one of Egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country.<ref name="Williams, Caroline p. 169"/> The mosque itself retains significant Fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries, notably by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] sultans [[Qaitbay]] and [[Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri|al-Ghuri]] and by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the 18th century.

Other extant monuments from the Fatimid era include the large [[Al-Hakim Mosque|Mosque of al-Hakim]], the [[Al-aqmar mosque|al-Aqmar mosque]], and the [[Salih Talai Mosque|Mosque of Salih Tala'i]].

The most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk period]], from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, [[madrasa]], [[khanqah]] (for [[Sufis]]), water distribution centers (sabils), and mausoleum for themselves and their families.<ref>Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. 2007. ''Cairo of the Mamluks: A History of Architecture and its Culture''. Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press.</ref> 
Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan|Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan]], the [[Mosque of Amir al-Maridani]], the [[Mosque of Sultan al-Muayyad|Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad]] (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of [[Bab Zuwayla]]), the [[Sultan Al-Ghuri Complex|Sultan Al-Ghuri complex]], the [[Complex of Sultan al-Ashraf Qaytbay|funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay]] in the [[City of the Dead (Cairo)|Northern Cemetery]], and the trio of monuments in the [[Bayn al-Qasrayn]] area comprising the [[Qalawun complex|complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun]], the [[Madrassa of Al-Nasir Muhammad|Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad]], and the Madrasa of Sultan Barquq.

The Mamluks, and the later Ottomans, also built wikalas or [[caravanserais]] to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in Cairo's economy.<ref name="Raymond, André 1993. pp. 90-97">Raymond, André. 1993. ''Le Caire''. Fayard, pp. 90-97.</ref> The most famous example still intact today is the Wikala al-Ghuri, which nowadays also hosts regular performances by the Al-[[Tannoura]] Egyptian Heritage Dance Troupe.<ref>O'Neill, Zora et al. 2012. ''Lonely Planet: Egypt'' (11th edition), p. 81.</ref> The famous Khan al-Khalili (see below) is a commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais (also known as khans).

The Citadel is a fortified enclosure begun by [[Saladin|Salah al-Din]] in 1176 AD on an outcrop of the [[Muqatam|Muqattam Hills]] as part of a large defensive system to protect both Cairo to the north and [[Fustat]] to the southwest.<ref name="Raymond, André 1993. pp. 90-97"/> It was the center of Egyptian government and residence of its rulers until 1874, when [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Isma'il]] moved to [[Abdeen Palace|'Abdin Palace]].<ref>Williams, Caroline. 2008 (6th ed.). ''Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide''.

[[Khan el-Khalili]] is an ancient [[bazaar]], or marketplace adjacent to the [[Al-Hussein Mosque]]. It dates back to 1385, when Amir [[Jarkas el-Khalili]] built a large [[caravanserai]], or khan. (A caravanserai is a hotel for traders, and usually the focal point for any surrounding area.) This original carvanserai building was demolished by [[qansuh al-Ghuri|Sultan al-Ghuri]], who rebuilt it as a new commercial complex in the early 16th century, forming the basis for the network of [[souqs]] existing today.<ref>Raymond, André. 1993.

==Pollution==
[[File:0021 Cairo in smog, 2010.JPG|thumb|Smog in Cairo]]
Cairo is an expanding city, which has led to many environmental problems. The [[air pollution]] in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. Greater Cairo's volatile [[aromatic hydrocarbon]] levels are higher than many other similar cities.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Khoder |first=M.I. |title=Ambient levels of volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere of Greater Cairo |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=554–566 |publisher=Air Pollution Research Department, [[National Research Centre]], Dokki, Giza |date=January 2007 |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.08.051 |id=ISSN: 1352-2310 |ref=harv |accessdate=1 January 2007 |postscript=.}}</ref> Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of [[lead]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur dioxide|sulphur dioxide]], and [[suspended solids|suspended particulate matter]] concentrations due to decades of unregulated [[vehicle emissions control|vehicle emissions]], urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features like [[catalytic converter]]s. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.
In recent years, a mysterious [[Smog|black cloud]] (as Egyptians refer to it) [[Inversion (meteorology)|appeared over Cairo every Autumn]] and causes serious respiratory diseases and eye irritations for the city's citizens. Tourists who are not familiar with such high levels of pollution must take extra care.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Black cloud reappears over Cairo|journal=Middle East online|first=|last=|volume=41|issue=3|page=554|id=|url=|accessdate=|ref=harv|doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.08.051|author=Khoder, M|postscript=.}}</ref>

Cairo also has many unregistered lead and [[copper]] [[smelter]]s which heavily pollute the city. The results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels. It is estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 people a year in Cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases. Lead has been shown to cause harm to the [[central nervous system]] and neurotoxicity particularly in children.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Lead neurotoxicity in children: basic mechanisms and clinical correlates|journal=Brain|volume=126|issue=1|pages=5–19|date=January 2003|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/126/1/5|accessdate=19 April 2008|doi=10.1093/brain/awg014|author=Lidsky, T. I.|pmid=12477693|ref=harv|last2=Schneider|first2=JS|postscript=.}}</ref> In 1995, the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with 36 air monitoring stations and [[Emissions testing|emissions tests]] on cars. Twenty thousand buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels, which are very high.

The city also suffers from a high level of [[pollution|land pollution]]. Cairo produces 10,000 tons of waste material each day, 4,000 tons of which is not [[Waste collection|collected]] or [[Waste management|managed]]. This once again is a huge [[health|health hazard]] and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste; however, they also work with the [[Zabbaleen]] (or Zabaleen), a community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo's waste since the turn of the 20th century and live in an area known locally as [[Manshiyat naser]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/06/03/MNGKOJ82991.DTL |title=From Cairo's trash, a model of recycling / Old door-to-door method boasts 85% reuse rate |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=3 June 2006 |accessdate=5 May 2009 |first=Jack |last=Epstein}}</ref> Both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits, though it remains a pressing problem.

The city also suffers from [[water pollution]] as the [[Sanitary sewer|sewer system]] tends to fail and overflow. On occasion, [[sewage]] has escaped onto the streets to create a health hazard. This problem is hoped to be solved by a new sewer system funded by the [[European Union]], which could cope with the demand of the city. The dangerously high levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in the city's water system has [[global health]] officials concerned over related health risks. As of 2035 the hunger games have been held on the Red Sea.
