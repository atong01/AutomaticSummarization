'''Ceuta''' (assimilated pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|sj|u:|t|ə}} {{respell|SEW|tə}}, also {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|ʊ|t|ə}} {{respell|SAY|uu-tə}};<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Ceuta Ceuta].

Separated from the [[Iberian peninsula]] by the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], Ceuta lies along the boundary between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Ceuta, along with the Spanish exclave [[Melilla]], is one of two permanently inhabited Spanish territories in mainland Africa. It was part of [[Province of Cádiz|Cádiz province]] until 14 March 1995 when the city's [[Statute of Autonomy]] was passed.

Ceuta, like Melilla, was a [[free port]] before Spain joined the [[European Union]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} As of 2011, it has a population of 82,376.<ref name=census/> Its population consists of [[Christian]]s, [[Muslim]]s (chiefly [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Berber languages|Berber]] speakers), and small minorities of [[Jew]]s and [[Indian people|Indian]] [[Hindu]]s. Spanish is the official language.

==History==
[[File:Ceuta Spain crop.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Royal Walls of Ceuta]] and navigable moats]]

[[File:Ceuta Calle de Companía del Mar.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Calle de Compañía del Mar in Ceuta]]

Ceuta's location has made it an important commercial trade and military way-point for many cultures, beginning with the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] in the 5th century BC, who called the city ''[[Abyla]]''; initially, this was also its name in Greek and Latin. (It was known variously as {{lang-grc|Ἀβύλη}},  Ἀβύλα, Ἀβλύξ, Ἀβίλη στήλη – ''Abyle'', ''Abila'', ''Ablyx'' or ''Abile Stele'' – "Pillar of Abyle")<ref name="perseus.tufts.edu">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, illustrated by numerous engravings on wood. William Smith, LLD (London:Walton and Maberly, Upper Gower Street and Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row; John Murray, Albemarle Street, 1854), ''Abyla'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=abyla-geo&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064])</ref> and from Greek, ''Abyla'' (...''Mons'',...''Columna'', "Mount Abyla" or "Column of Abyla") in Latin. Together with [[Gibraltar]] on the European side, it formed one of the famous "[[Pillars of Hercules]]".<ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/><ref>A Latin Dictionary. Founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary. revised, enlarged, and in great part rewritten by. Charlton T. Lewis, Ph.D. and. Charles Short, LL.D.

It changed hands again approximately 400 years later, when [[Vandal]] tribes ousted the Romans.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} After being controlled by the [[Visigoths]], it then became an [[Hispania#Byzantine reconquest|outpost]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Ceuta was an important Christian center since the fourth century (as recent discovered ruins of a Roman basilica show<ref>[http://www.ceutaturistica.com/basilica/basilica.html Roman basilica article, with related Video]</ref>), and consequently is the only place in the [[Maghreb]] where the Roman heritage has survived continuously until modern times.

In the 7th century the Umayyads tried to conquer the region but were unsuccessful. Byzantine governor, [[Julian, count of Ceuta|Julian]] (described as ''King of the [[Ghomara people|Ghomara]]'') who was a vassal of the Visigothic kings of Iberia changed his allegiance after the king [[Roderic]] raped his daughter, and exhorted the Muslims to invade the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Under the leadership of the [[Berber people|Berber]] general [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], the Muslims used Ceuta as a [[staging area|staging ground]] for an assault on [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Iberian Peninsula. After Julian's death, the Berbers took direct control of the city, which the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes resented. They destroyed Ceuta during the [[Kharijite]] rebellion led by [[Maysara al-Matghari]] in 740.

Ceuta lay in ruins until it was resettled in the 9th century by Mâjakas, chief of the Majkasa Berber tribe, who started the short-lived [[Banu Isam]] dynasty.<ref name="GibbKramers1994">{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Johannes Hendrik Kramers|author3=Bernard Lewis |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZXrAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 July 2013|year=1994|publisher=Brill|page=690}}</ref> His great-grandson briefly allied his tribe with the [[Idrisid]]s, but the Banu Isam rule ended in 931 when he abdicated in favor of [[Abd ar-Rahman III]], the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph of Cordoba]]. Ceuta reverted to [[Moorish]] [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]]ian rule in 927 along with [[Melilla]], and later [[Tangier]], in 951.

Chaos ensued with the fall of the [[Umayyad caliphate]] in 1031. Following this Ceuta and the rest of Muslim Iberia were controlled by successive North African dynasties. Starting in 1084, the [[Almoravid]] [[Berbers]] ruled the region until 1147, when the [[Almohad]]s conquered the land. Apart from [[Ibn Hud]]'s rebellion of 1232, they ruled until the Tunisian [[Hafsid]]s established control. The Hafsids' influence in the west rapidly waned, and Ceuta's inhabitants eventually expelled them in 1249. After this, a period of political instability persisted, under competing interests from the [[Kingdom of Fez]] and the [[Kingdom of Granada]]. The [[Kingdom of Fez]] finally conquered the region in 1387, with assistance from the [[Crown of Aragon]].

In 1415, during the [[Battle of Ceuta]], the city was captured by the Portuguese during the reign of [[John I of Portugal]]. The Benemerine sultan [[Siege of Ceuta (1418)|besieged the city]] in 1418 but was defeated. [[Phillip II of Spain|Phillip II]] (King of Spain 1556–1598), [[Struggle for the throne of Portugal|ascended the Portuguese throne]] in 1580 and Spanish kings of Portugal governed Ceuta for 60 years ([[Iberian Union]]). During this time, Ceuta attracted many residents of Spanish origin.<ref name=Griffinh>{{cite book |author= Griffin, H | year=2010 |title=Ceuta Mini Guide  |url=http://www.miragebooks.co.uk/ceuta | publisher=Mirage | isbn= 978-0-9543335-3-9}}</ref> Ceuta became the only city of the [[Portuguese Empire]] that sided with Spain when Portugal regained its independence in 1640, and [[Portuguese Restoration War|war broke out between the two countries]].

On 1 January 1668 by the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]], King [[Afonso VI of Portugal]] recognized the formal allegiance of Ceuta to Spain and formally ceded Ceuta to King [[Carlos II of Spain]]. However, the originally Portuguese flag and [[coat of arms]] of Ceuta remained unchanged, and the modern-day Ceuta flag features the configuration of the [[Flag of Portugal#Portuguese shield|Portuguese shield]]. The flag has the same background as that of the flag of the city of [[Lisbon]]. The city was [[Siege of Ceuta (1694-1727)|besieged]] by Moroccan forces under [[Moulay Ismail]] from 1694 to 1727.

In July 1936, General [[Francisco Franco]] took command of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]] and rebelled against the Spanish republican government; his military uprising led to the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–1939. Franco transported troops to mainland Spain in an airlift using transport aircraft supplied by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Ceuta became one of the first casualties of the uprising: General Franco's rebel nationalist forces repressed the citizens of Ceuta, while at the same time the city came under fire from the air and sea forces of the official republican government.<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.miragebooks.co.uk/ceuta-guide/ceuta-history.html |title=History of Ceuta |accessdate=2012-03-01}}</ref>

A monument was erected to honour [[Francisco Franco]]; the [[Monumento del Llano Amarillo|Llano Amarillo]], inaugurated on 13 July 1940, still stands. The tall obelisk has been abandoned, but the shield symbols of the [[Falange]] and Imperial Eagle remain visible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_13051.shtml |title=Franco monument now part of a rubbish dump in Ceuta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121207133923/http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_13051.shtml |archivedate=7 December 2012 }}</ref>

When Spain recognized the independence of [[Spanish Morocco]] in 1956, Ceuta and the other ''[[plazas de soberanía]]'' remained under Spanish rule. Spain considered them integral parts of the Spanish state, but Morocco has disputed this point.

Culturally, modern Ceuta is part of the Spanish region of [[Andalusia]]. It was attached to the [[province of Cádiz]] until 1925, the Spanish coast being only 20&nbsp;km (12.5 miles) away. It is a cosmopolitan city, with a large ethnic [[Berber people|Berber]] Muslim minority as well as [[Sephardic]] Jewish and [[Hindu]] minorities.<ref>

On 5 November 2007, King [[Juan Carlos I]] visited the city, sparking great enthusiasm from the local population and protests from the Moroccan government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.periodistadigital.com/infordeus.php/2007/11/06/p125486 |title=Ceuta y Melilla son España, dice Juan Carlos I; Sebta y Melilia son nuestras, responde Mohamed VI|publisher=Blogs.periodistadigital.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> It was the first time a Spanish head of state had visited Ceuta in 80 years.

Since 2010, Ceuta (and Melilla) have declared the [[Muslim holiday]] of [[Eid al-Adha]] or Feast of the Sacrifice, as an official public holiday. It is the first time a non-Christian [[religious festival]] has been officially celebrated in Spain since the [[Reconquista]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spainforvisitors.com/module-News-display-sid-310.htm |title=Muslim Holiday in Ceuta and Melilla |publisher=Spainforvisitors.com |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qppstudio.net/bankholidays2010/spain.htm |title=Public Holidays and Bank Holidays for Spain |publisher=Qppstudio.net |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref>

===Ecclesiastical history===
The Catholic [[Diocese of Ceuta]] existed from 1417 to 1879. It was a [[suffragan]] of the [[Patriarchate of Lisbon]] until 1675 and the end of the [[Iberian Union]], when Ceuta chose to remain linked to the [[king of Spain]]. Since then it has been a suffragan of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville|archbishopric of Seville]].<ref>{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|dc206|Diocese of Ceuta|21 January 2015}}</ref> The [[Diocese of Tanger]] was suppressed and incorporated to that of Ceuta in 1570.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14736a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Tingis |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 July 1912 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref>

In 1851, upon the signature of the [[Concordat of 1851|concordat]] between the [[Holy See]] and Spain, the diocese of Ceuta was agreed to be suppressed, being combined into the [[Diocese of Cádiz y Ceuta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03131b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Cadiz |publisher=Newadvent.org|date=1 November 1908|accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> Until then in the [[Diocese of Cádiz y Algeciras]], the bishop was usually the [[apostolic administrator]] of Ceuta. The agreement was not implemented until 1879.

==Geography==
Ceuta is dominated by Monte Anyera, a hill along its western frontier with Morocco. The mountain is guarded by a [[Spanish army|Spanish]] fort.

===Climate===
Ceuta has a maritime-influenced [[Mediterranean climate|Subtropical/Mediterranean climate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=2306&cityname=Ceuta%2C+Ciudad+Aut%F3noma+de+Ceuta%2C+Spain&units=|title=Ceuta, Spain Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref> The average [[diurnal temperature variation]] is relatively low; the average annual temperature is {{convert|18.6|C|F}} with average yearly highs of {{convert|21.4|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|15.7|C|F}} though the Ceuta weather station has only been in operation since 2003.<ref name="Standard climate values for Ceuta">{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=5000C&k=ceu|title=Standard climate values for Ceuta|publisher=Aemet.es|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref> with relatively mild summers for the latitude.

==Politics==
[[File:Juan Jesús Vivas en la Convención Nacional del Partido Popular (enero de 2011).jpg|thumb|167px|[[Juan Jesús Vivas]], Mayor-President of Ceuta since 2001]]

Since 1995, Ceuta is, along with [[Melilla]], one of the two [[Autonomous community#autonomous cities|autonomous cities]] of Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo1-1995.html |title=Ley Orgánica 1/1995, de 13 de marzo, Estatuto de Autonomía de Ceuta|publisher=Noticias.juridicas.com|accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref>

Ceuta is known officially in Spanish as ''Ciudad Autónoma de Ceuta'' (English: ''Autonomous City of Ceuta''), with a rank between a standard Spanish city and an [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]]. Ceuta is part of the territory of the [[European Union]]. The city was a [[free port]] before Spain joined the European Union in 1986. Now it has a low-tax system within the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]]. As of 2006, its population was 75,861.

Ceuta has held elections every four years since 1979, for its 25-seat assembly. The leader of its government was the Mayor until the Autonomy Statute had the title changed to the [[Mayor-President]]. In the most recent election in 2011, the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) won 18 seats, keeping [[Juan Jesús Vivas]] as Mayor-President, which he has been since 2001. The remaining seats are held by the regionalist [[Caballas Coalition]] (4) and the [[Socialist Workers' Party (Spain)|Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE, 3).<ref>http://resultados.elpais.com/elecciones/2011/municipales/18/</ref>

Ceuta is subdivided into 63 ''barriadas'' (neighbourhoods), such as Barriada de Berizu, Barriada de P. Alfonso, Barriada del Sarchal, and El Hacho.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elpueblodeceuta.es/200708/20070819/200708195101.html |title=elpueblodeceuta.es |publisher=elpueblodeceuta.es |accessdate=2009-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110720140539/http://www.elpueblodeceuta.es/200708/20070819/200708195101.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>http://www.planetware.com/i/map/MAR/ceuta-map.jpg</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://codigo-postal.info/ceuta/ceuta?page=7 |title=Códigos postales de Ceuta en Ceuta |publisher=Codigo-postal.info |accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref>

Due to its small population, Ceuta elects only one member of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]], the lower house of the Spanish legislature. Since the 2011 election, this post is held by Francisco Márquez de la Rubia of the PP.<ref>http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Diputados/DipCircuns/ComAutCeu?_piref73_1333447_73_1333444_1333444.next_page=/wc/fichaDiputado&idDiputado=196</ref>

===Dispute with Morocco===
The government of Morocco has repeatedly called for Spain to transfer the sovereignty of Ceuta and [[Melilla]], along with uninhabited islets such as the islands of Alhucemas, Velez and the [[Perejil island]], drawing comparisons with Spain's territorial claim to [[Gibraltar]].<ref name=rev>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/999729 |title=Spain's North African enclaves: Gibraltar in reverse? |publisher=The Economist |date= 21 February 2002|accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> In both cases, the national governments and local populations of the disputed territories reject these claims by a large majority.<ref>* François Papet-Périn, "La mer d'Alboran ou Le contentieux territorial hispano-marocain sur les deux bornes européennes de Ceuta et Melilla". Tome 1, 794 p., tome 2, 308 p., thèse de doctorat d'histoire contemporaine soutenue en 2012 à Paris 1-Sorbonne sous la direction de Pierre Vermeren.</ref> The Spanish position states that both Ceuta and Melilla are integral parts of Spain, and have been since the 16th century, whereas Gibraltar, being a [[British Overseas Territory]], is not and never has been part of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/12/worlddispatch.gibraltar |title=A rocky relationship &#124; World news &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 12 June 2003|accessdate=2009-06-17 | location=London | first=Giles | last=Tremlett}}</ref> Some argue{{who|date=May 2014}} that Ceuta has been under Christian rule (Spanish or Portuguese) for a longer period than major cities in [[peninsular Spain]] such as Málaga, Granada or Almería, and has been so since before the creation of the Spanish state in 1475. Morocco denies these claims and maintains that the Spanish presence in Ceuta and the other ''presidios'' on its coast is a remnant of the colonial past which should be ended. However, the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]] do not consider those Spanish territories to be colonies, whereas it does declare Gibraltar as a non-[[Decolonization|decolonized]] territory.<ref>{{cite web|title=The United Nations and the decolonization|url=http://www.un.org/en/decolonization/nonselfgovterritories.shtml|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref>

The Moroccan claim on the Spanish territories is part of the larger nationalist movement [[Greater Morocco]], which would include Mauritania, Western Sahara, the northern part of Mali and several Algerian provinces in Morocco.<ref>{{cite web|last=Torres García|title=La frontera terrestre argelino-marroquí: de herencia colonial a instrumento de presión|url=http://www.historia-actual.org/Publicaciones/index.php/haol/article/view/757/689|work=Hao|accessdate=30 August 2013|page=9|language=Spanish|date=Spring 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cable sobre el mensaje de Mohamed VI tras la visita a Ceuta y Melilla de los Reyes de España|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2010/12/13/actualidad/1292231846_850215.html|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=El País|date=13 December 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Bienvenidos a ceuta.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A sign welcoming visitors to Ceuta, showing the flags of Ceuta, Spain and the [[European Union]]]]

==Economy==
The official currency of Ceuta is the [[euro]]. It is part of a special low tax zone in Spain.<ref name="Ceuta.es">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceuta.es/servlet/ContentServer?idioma=es_es&mD=true&pagename=CeutaTur%2FInformacionViajero%2FInformacionViajeroDetalle&cid=1113994915129&mC=true&idP=1111055969345&idA=1113994915129|title=Economic Data of Ceuta, de ceutna digital |publisher=Ceuta.es |accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> Ceuta is one of two Spanish port cities on the northern shore of Africa, along with [[Melilla]]. They are historically military strongholds, [[free port]]s, oil ports, and also fishing ports.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xuBgaSzsYVgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ceuta+economy&cad=0#PPA7,M1 |title=pp. 6–7, IBRU, Boundary and Territory Briefing. Ceuta and the Spanish Sovereign Territories: Spanish and Moroccan |publisher= |accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> Today the economy of the city depends heavily on its port (now in expansion) and its industrial and retail centres.<ref name="Ceuta.es"/> [[Ceuta Heliport]] is now used to connect the city to mainland Spain by air.

===Transport===
The city receives high numbers of ferries each day from [[Algeciras]] in [[Andalusia]] in the south of Spain. The closest airport is [[Sania Ramel Airport]] in Morocco. There is a bus service throughout the city which does not pass into neighbouring Morocco.

A single road border checkpoint allows for cars to travel between Morocco and Ceuta. The rest of the border is closed and inaccessible.

==Demographics==

Due to its location, Ceuta is home to a mixed ethnic/religious population. The two main religious groups are Christian and Muslim. Approximately 50% of the population is Spanish/Christian and approximately 49% Arab-Berber/Muslims.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Roa |first=J. M. | year=2006 | title=Scholastic achievement and the diglossic situation in a sample of primary-school students in Ceuta | journal=Revista Electrónica de Investigación Educativa |volume=8 |number=1 | url=http://redie.uabc.mx/index.php/redie/article/download/124/216}}</ref>

Spanish is the primary and official language of the enclave. Berber, Moroccan Arabic and French are also widely spoken.

===Education===

The [[University of Granada#Campus located in Ceuta|University of Granada]] offers undergraduate programs at their campus in Ceuta. Like all areas of Spain, Ceuta is also served by the [[National University of Distance Education|National University of Distance Education (UNED)]].

Primary and secondary education is only possible in Spanish. There are no English speaking or bilingual primary or secondary schools in Ceuta.

===Religion===
[[File:Catedral la Asunción de Ceuta - España..jpg|thumb|right|200px||[[Cathedral of St Mary of the Assumption (Ceuta)|Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption]]]]
Christianity has been present in Ceuta (called in Roman times ''Septum'') continuously since the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The ruins of a basilica in downtown Ceuta confirm this reality.<ref>[http://www.academia.edu/1378720/Ceuta_huellas_del_cristianismo_en_Ceuta Christian Ceuta]</ref>

In 1415, on reconquering the city from the Muslims, the Portuguese started the construction of the [[Cathedral of St Mary of the Assumption (Ceuta)|Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption]]. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ceuta]] was established two years later, and was amalgamated with the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cadiz y Ceuta]], in  1851. The present cathedral, from the late 17th century, combines [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] elements.
