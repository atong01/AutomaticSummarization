'''DKW''' ('''''Dampf-Kraft-Wagen''''', {{lang-en|steam-driven car}}) is a defunct [[Germany|German]] [[automobile|car]] and [[motorcycle]] [[marque]].

In 1916, [[Denmark|Danish]] [[engineer]] [[Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen]] founded a factory in [[Zschopau]], [[Saxony]], Germany, to produce steam fittings. That year he attempted to produce a steam-driven car, called the DKW. Although unsuccessful, he made a [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] toy engine in 1919, called ''Des Knaben Wunsch'' &ndash; "the boy's desire". He put a slightly modified version of this engine into a motorcycle and called it ''Das Kleine Wunder'' &ndash; "the little marvel". This was the beginning of the DKW brand: by the 1930s, DKW was the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer.

In 1932, DKW merged with [[Audi]], [[Horch]] and [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]] to form [[Auto Union]]. After [[World War II]], DKW moved to [[West Germany]], with the original factory becoming [[MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk|MZ]].<ref name="MC"/> Auto Union came under [[Daimler-Benz]] ownership in 1957 and was purchased by the [[Volkswagen Group]] in 1964. The last German-built DKW car was the [[DKW F102|F102]], which ceased production in 1966. Its successor, the [[four-stroke]] [[Audi F103|F103]], was marketed under the Audi brand, another Auto Union marque.

DKW-badged cars continued to be built under license in [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] until 1967 and 1969 respectively.

==Automobiles made between 1928 and 1942==
[[File:MHV DKW F1 1931 01.jpg|thumb|1931 DKW F1]]
DKW cars were made from 1928 until 1966, apart from an interruption caused by the Second World War. DKWs always used [[two-stroke engine]]s, reflecting the company's position by the end of the 1920s as the world's largest producer of motorcycles. The first DKW car, the small and rather crude [[DKW Typ P|Typ P]], emerged on 7 May 1928<ref name="Oswald, p 86">[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 86</ref> and the model continued to be built at the company's [[Spandau]] (Berlin) plant, first as a roadster and later as a stylish if basic sports car, until 1931.

More significant was a series of inexpensive cars built 300&nbsp;km (185 miles) to the south in Zwickau in the plant acquired by [[Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen|the company's owner]] in 1928 when he had become the majority owner in [[Audi|Audi Werke AG]].<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 85</ref> Models [[DKW F1|F1]] to [[DKW F8|F8]] (F for Front) were built between 1931 and 1942, with successor models reappearing after the end of the [[Second World War|war]] in 1945. They were the first volume production cars in Europe with [[front wheel drive]], and were powered by [[transversely mounted engine|transversely mounted]] two-cylinder two-stroke engines.   Displacement was 584 or 692&nbsp;cc: claimed maximum power was initially 15 PS, and from 1931 a choice between 18 or {{convert|20|hp|abbr=on}}. These models had a generator that doubled as a starter, mounted directly on the [[crankshaft]], known as a [[Dynastart]].<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 94 - 103</ref> DKWs from Zwickau notched up approximately 218,000 units between 1931 and 1942.<ref name="Oswald, p 86"/> Most cars were sold on the home market and over 85% of DKWs produced in the 1930s were the little F series cars: DKW reached second place in German sales by 1934 and stayed there, accounting for 189,369 of the cars sold between 1931 and 1938, more than 16% of the market.<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 531</ref>

Between 1929 and 1940, DKW produced a less well remembered but technically intriguing series of rear-wheel drive cars called (among other names) [[DKW Typ 4=8|''Schwebeklasse'' and ''Sonderklasse'']] with two-stroke [[V4 engine|V4]] engines.<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 87</ref> [[Engine displacement]] was 1,000&nbsp;cc, later 1,100&nbsp;cc. The engines had two extra cylinders for [[forced induction]], so they appeared like [[V6 engine]]s but without [[spark plug]]s on the front cylinder pair.

In 1939, DKW made a [[prototype]] with the first [[straight-three engine|three-cylinder engine]], with a displacement of 900&nbsp;cc and producing {{convert|30|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. With a streamlined body, the car could run at {{convert|115|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. It was put into production after [[World War II]], first as an [[Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau]] (IFA) F9 (later [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]]) in [[Zwickau]], [[East Germany]], and shortly afterwards in DKW-form from Düsseldorf as the 3=6 or F91.

DKW engines were used by [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] as a model for the [[Saab two-stroke]] in its [[Saab 92]] car manufacturing venture, in 1947.

==Automobiles made after 1945==
[[File:Osmo Kalpala - 1956 Rally Finland.jpeg|thumb|Osmo Kalpala servicing his DKW during the 1956 [[Rally Finland]].]]

As Auto Union was based in Saxony in what became the [[German Democratic Republic]], it took some time for it to regroup after the war. The company was registered in West Germany as Auto Union GmbH in 1949, first as a spare-part provider, but soon to take up production of the RT 125 motorcycle and a new [[delivery van]], called a ''[[DKW Schnellaster|Schnellaster]]'' F800. Their first line of production took place in [[Düsseldorf]]. This van used the same engine as the last F8 made before the war.

Their first car was the F89 using the body from the prototype F9 made before the war and the two-cylinder [[two-stroke engine]] from the last F8. Production went on until it was replaced by the successful three-cylinder engine that came with the F91. The F91 was in production 1953–1955, and was replaced by the larger F93 in 1956. The F91 and F93 had 900&nbsp;cc three-cylinder two-stroke engines, the first ones delivering {{convert|34|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, the last {{convert|38|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The ignition system comprised three independent sets of [[Circuit breaker|points]] and [[Ignition coil|coils]], one for each cylinder, with the points mounted in a cluster around a single [[wikt:lobe|lobed]] [[cam]] at the front end of the crankshaft. The cooling system was of the [[convection|free convection]] type assisted by a fan driven from a pulley mounted at the front end of the crankshaft.

The F93 was produced until 1959, and was replaced by the Auto-Union 1000. These models where produced with a 1,000&nbsp;cc two-stroke engine, with a choice between {{convert|44|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or {{convert|50|hp|kW|abbr=on}} S versions until 1963. During this transition, production was moved from Düsseldorf to [[Ingolstadt]], where Audi still has its production. From 1957, the cars could be fitted with a [[saxomat]], an automatic clutch, the only small car then offering this feature. The last versions of the Auto-Union 1000S had [[disc brakes]] as option, an early development for this technology. A sporting 2+2 seater version was available as the Auto-Union 1000 SP from 1957 to 1964, the first years only as a [[coupé]] and from 1962 also as a [[Convertible (car)|convertible]].

In 1956, the very rare [[DKW Monza]] was put into small-scale production on a private initiative, with a sporting two-seater body of [[glassfiber]] on a standard F93 frame. It was first called Solitude, but got its final name from the long-distance speed records it made on the [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza]] in Italy in November 1956. Running in [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) class G, it set records including 48 hours at an average speed of {{convert|140.961|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, 10,000&nbsp;km at {{convert|139.453|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and 72 hours at {{convert|139.459|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The car was first produced by [[Dannenhauer & Strauss]] in [[Stuttgart]], then by Massholder in [[Heidelberg]] and lastly by Robert Schenk in Stuttgart. The number produced is said to be around 230 and production finished by the end of 1958.
[[File:DKW Junior DeLuxe 1962.JPG|thumb|right|DKW Junior (1962)]]

A more successful range of cars was sold from 1959, the Junior/F12 series based on a modern concept from the late 1950s. The range consist of Junior (basic model) made from 1959 to 1961, Junior de Luxe (a little enhanced) from 1961 to 1963, F11 (a little larger) and F12 (larger and bigger engine) from 1963 to 1965, and F12 Roadster from 1964 to 1965. The Junior/F12 series became quite popular, and many cars were produced. An assembly plant was licensed in Ireland between 1952 and c.1964 and roughly 4,000 vehicles were assembled, ranging from saloons, vans and motorbikes to commercial [[combine harvester]]s. This was the only DKW factory outside Germany in Europe.

All the three-cylinder two-stroke post-war cars had some sporting potential and formed the basis for many [[rallying|rally]] victories in the 1950s and early 1960s. This made DKW the most winning car brand in the European rally league for several years during the fifties.

In 1960, DKW developed a [[V6 engine]] by combining two three-cylinder two-stroke engines, with a capacity of 1,000&nbsp;cc. The capacity was increased and the final V6 in 1966 had a capacity of 1,300&nbsp;cc, which developed {{convert|83|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm using the standard configuration with two [[carburettor]]s. A four-carburettor version produced {{convert|100|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, a six-carburettor one {{convert|130|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. It weighed only {{convert|84|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The V6 was planned to be used in the [[DKW Munga]] and the F102. About 100 engines were built for testing purposes and 13 DKW F102 and some Mungas were fitted with the V6 engine in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dyna.co.za/cars/specs.htm |title=DKW Specifications |publisher=Dyna.co.za |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2010-10-02}}</ref>

The last DKW was the [[DKW F102|F102]], coming into production in 1964 as a replacement for the old-looking AU1000. It was the direct forerunner of the first post-war Audi, the [[Audi F103|F103]], with the main difference that the Audi used a conventional [[four-stroke engine]]. The transition to four-stroke engines marked the end of the DKW marque for cars.

From 1956 to 1961, Dutch importer [[Hart, Nibbrig & Greve]] assembled cars in an abandoned asphalt factory in [[Sassenheim]], where they employed about 120 workers, two transporter, that collected SKD kits from Duesseldorf and build about 13.500 cars. When the DKW plant moved the import of SKD kits stopped, as it became too expensive.<ref>Autokampioen 25/26 2007 "Made in Holland" by Yop Segers</ref>

==DKW in South America==
From 1956 to 1967, DKW cars were made in [[Brazil]] by the local company [[Vemag]] (''Veículos e Máquinas Agrícolas S.A.'', "Vehicles and Agricultural Machinery Inc.").<ref>{{cite journal|year=1973|journal=Automobile Quarterly|publisher=Automobile Quarterly|volume=11|issue=4|title=Vemag|quote=the Vemag company that had been manufacturing two-stroke DKW models under license in Brazil.}}</ref> Vemag was assembling [[Scania-Vabis]] trucks, but Scania Vabis became an independent company in July 1960.<ref name=shapiro>{{cite journal | title = Determinants of Firm Entry into the Brazilian Automobile Manufacturing Industry, 1956-1968 | ref = HShap | first = Helen | last = Shapiro | volume = 65 | journal = The Business History Review | number = 4, The Automobile Industry |date=Winter 1991 | page = 897 }}</ref> The original plans were to build the Candango off-roader (Munga), a utility vehicle and a four-door sedan, called Vemaguet and Belcar respectively. The first model built was the 900&nbsp;cc F91 Universal but the Belcar and Vemaguet names were applied later.
[[File:1967 DKW-Vemag Belcar.jpg|thumb|A First Series 1967 DKW-Vemag Belcar (At The Front) Besides A Second Series 1964 DKW-Vemag Belcar]]

In 1958, the F94 four-door sedan and station wagon were launched, in the early 1960s renamed Belcar and Vemaguet. The company also produced a luxury coupe (the DKW Fissore) and the off-road [[DKW Munga|Munga]] (locally called Candango). In 1960 Vemag cars received the larger one-litre, {{convert|50|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine from the [[Auto Union 1000]].<ref name=VoGo>{{cite web | url = http://www.team.net/www/ktud/saspeci/dkwbr.html | title = DKWs in Brazil | last1 = Vogel | first1 = Jason | last2 = Gomes | first2 = Flavio | publisher = KTUD Online Automotive Archive }}</ref>

Vemag had a successful official racing team, with the coupe GT Malzoni, with fiberglass body. This project was the foundation of the long-lasting Brazilian sports car brand [[Puma (car)|Puma]]. The Brazilian F94 line has been improved with several cosmetic changes and became more and more different from the German and Argentine models. Vemag had no capital to invest in new products and came under governmental pressure to merge. In 1964-1965 Volkswagen gradually took over [[Auto Union]], a minority holder in Vemag, and in 1967 Volkswagen bought the remainder of the stock.<ref>[[#HShap|Shapiro]], p. 935</ref> They quickly began phasing out the DKW-Vemag production and building the [[Volkswagen Type 3#Coffin|Volkswagen 1600]] sedan in the old Vemag plant.<ref name=VoGo/> A total of 109,343 DKW-Vemag cars were built.<ref name="Maravilha">{{citation | title = DKW - A grande história da Pequena Maravilha | trans_title = DKW: The great history of the little wonder | language = Portuguese | first1 = Paulo César | last1 = Sandler | first2 = Rogério | last2 = de Simone | publisher = Editora Alaúde | isbn = 978-85-7881-037-5 | location = São Paulo, Brazil }}</ref>

DKW vehicles were made in [[Argentina]] from 1960 to 1969 by IASF S.A. (Industria Automotriz Santa Fe Sociedad Anónima) in [[Sauce Viejo, Argentina|Sauce Viejo]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]. The most beautiful were the Cupé Fissore, which had many famous owners (Julio Sosa, César Luis Menotti, and others). Other models are the Auto Union 1000 S Sedán (21,797 made until 1969) and the Auto Union 1000 Universal S (6,396 made until 1969).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/a/auto_union.htm |title=Auto Union |publisher=Coche Argentino |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref> and the Auto Union [[DKW Schnellaster|Combi/Pick-up]].
The last version of the Auto Union Combi/Pick-up ([[DKW F1000 L]]), launched in 1969, survived a few months and was bought out by [[Industrias Aeronáuticas y Mecánicas del Estado|IME]], which continued production until 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/a/auto_union.htm#frontal69 |title=Auto Union |publisher=Coche Argentino |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>

==Vans and utility vehicles==
[[File:DKW F 91-4.jpg|thumb|DKW Munga]]
The [[DKW Munga]] was built by Auto Union in Ingolstadt. Production began in October 1956 and ended in December 1968, with 46,750 cars were built.

From 1949 to 1962, DKW produced the ''Schnellaster'' with a trailing-arm [[rear suspension]] system with [[Spring (device)|springs]] in the cross bar assembly. Spanish subsidiary IMOSA produced a modern successor introduced in 1963, the DKW F 1000&nbsp;L. This van started with the three-cylinder 1,000&nbsp;cc engine, but later received a [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[Diesel engine]] and was renamed a Mercedes-Benz in 1975.

During the late 1920s and 1930s, DKW was the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 1931, Ing Zoller started building [[split-single]]s and this concept made DKW the dominant racing motorcycle in the Lightweight and Junior classes between the wars.<ref>[http://www.classicmotorcycles.org.uk/bikemuseum/museum_twn.htm Adopted by Ing Zoller in 1931] the concept [of the Split Single Engine] was to make DKW the dominant racing motorcycle in the Lightweight and Junior classes during the pre-war years.</ref> This included off road events like the [[International Six Days Enduro|International Six Days Trial]] where the marque scored some considerable inter-war year successes alongside [[BMW|Bavarian Motor Works]] At the same time, the company also had some success with [[forced induction|super-charged]] racing motorcycles which because of their light weight were particularly successful in the ISDT<ref>[http://speedtracktales.com/folks-n-motors/silver-vase-winning-dkw-246-isdt-1935/ ISDT award winning DKW 246cc 1935].</ref>

The motorcycle branch produced famous models such as the [[DKW RT 125|RT 125]] pre- and post-[[World War II]], and after the war with production at the original factory in [[GDR]] becoming [[MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk|MZ]]<ref name="MC"/> it made 175, 250 and 350 models. As war reparations, the design drawings of the RT125 were given to [[Harley-Davidson]] in the US and [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] in the UK. The Harley-Davidson version was known as the [[Harley-Davidson Hummer|Hummer]], while BSA used them for the [[BSA Bantam|Bantam]]. IFA and later [[MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk|MZ]] models continued in production until the 1990s, when economics brought production of the two stroke to an end. Other manufacturers copied the DKW design, officially or otherwise. This can be seen in the similarity of many small two-stroke motorcycles from the 1950s, including from [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]], [[Voskhod motorcycle|Voskhod]], [[Maserati (motorcycle)|Maserati]], and Polish [[PZL|WSK]].
