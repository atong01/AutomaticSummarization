'''Enya''' (born '''Eithne Ní Bhraonáin'''; {{IPA-ga|ˈɛnʲə nʲiː ˈvˠɾˠiːn̪ˠaːnʲ}}, [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] as '''Enya Brennan'''; 17 May 1961) is an Irish singer, instrumentalist, and songwriter.

Enya began her musical career in 1980, when she briefly joined her family band [[Clannad]] before leaving to perform [[solo artist|solo]]. She gained wider recognition for her music in the 1986 BBC series ''[[The Celts (BBC documentary)|The Celts]]''. Shortly afterwards, her 1988 album ''[[Watermark (Enya album)|Watermark]]'' propelled her to further international fame and she became known for her distinctive sound, characterised by voice-layering, folk melodies, synthesised backdrops and ethereal reverberations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warnermusic.com.au/enya |publisher=Warner Music Australia|title= Enya |accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> She has performed in 10 languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldmusic.about.com/od/bandsartistsaz/p/Enya.htm |title=Enya Profile – Celtic New Age Music Star Enya |publisher=Worldmusic.about.com |date=17 May 1961 |accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref>

==Life and career==

===1961–83: Musical upbringing and Clannad===
[[File:Crolly - Leo's Tavern Sign - geograph.org.uk - 1174573.jpg|230px|thumb|A sign for Leo's Tavern in Gweedore, which reads "The home of Clannad & Enya"]]
Eithne Ni Bhraonain was born and raised in [[Gweedore]], [[County Donegal]], in the northwest corner of Ireland. She is part of an [[Irish language|Irish-speaking]], [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic]] musical family,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicandmeaning.com/site/enya_ksca_2.html|title=Enya interview on KSCA-FM (Transcript) – Part 2|publisher=Musicandmeaning|year=1996}}</ref> the sixth of nine children.<ref name = Enyafaq/> ''Enya'' is an approximate transliteration of how ''[[Eithne]]'' is pronounced in the [[Ulster Irish|Donegal dialect]] of the [[Irish language]], her [[native language|native tongue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/enya |title=Albums by Enya |publisher=Rate Your Music |accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Stas Bekman: stas (at) stason.org |url=http://stason.org/TULARC/music-bands/enya/1-1-Enya-is-Eithne-Brennan.html |title=1.1 Enya is Eithne Brennan |publisher=Stason.org |date=17 May 1961 |accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famouslikeme.com/13195/article.html |title=Profile on Enya |publisher=Famouslikeme.com |accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref> Her grandparents were in a band that played throughout Ireland, her father was the leader of the Slieve Foy Band before opening [[Leo's Tavern]], and her mother played in a dance band and later taught music at [[Pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair]]. From a young age, Enya appeared in many [[pantomimes]] onstage at Gweedore's [[Amharclann Ghaoth Dobhair|local theatre]] and sang with her siblings in her mother's choir at St Mary's Catholic Church, Derrybeg. She attended Loreto Community School in [[Milford, County Donegal]] and then moved away to attend college wanting to become a classical pianist, continuing her studies in music and also studying watercolour painting.

Enya has four brothers and four sisters, several of whom formed the band An Clann As Dobhar in 1968. They renamed the band [[Clannad]] in the 1970s. In 1980, Enya worked with Clannad, the band composed of her siblings [[Máire Brennan|Máire (Moya)]], [[Pól Brennan|Pól]], and [[Ciarán Brennan|Ciarán]] and twin uncles [[Noel Duggan|Noel]] and [[Pádraig Duggan]]. Enya played the keyboard and provided backing vocals on their album ''[[Crann Úll]]'' (1980), although she was not officially a member of the group until the 1981 release ''[[Fuaim]]'', when she appeared on the cover. During that same year, Enya was also a member of Ragairne, the band of [[Altan (band)|Altan]] front-woman [[Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh]].<ref name="Ragairne">{{cite web|url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/altan |title=Altan: National Geographic Music |work=National Geographic |date=17 October 2002 |accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> In 1982, shortly before Clannad became internationally renowned for "[[Theme From Harry's Game]]", producer and manager [[Nicky Ryan]] left the group and Enya joined him to start her own solo career. Enya then formed her own recording studio, named "Aigle", which is French for "eagle".

===1984–87: Career beginnings ===
Enya recorded two solo instrumental pieces called "An Ghaoth Ón Ghrian" (Irish for "The Solar Wind") and "Miss Clare Remembers" that were released on the 1984 album ''Touch Travel''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://discography.enya.com/miscellaneous/A01.html |title=Miscellaneous Discography |publisher=Enya.com |accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref> She was first credited as ''Enya'' (as opposed to ''Eithne'') for writing some of the music for the 1984 movie ''[[The Frog Prince (1984 film)|The Frog Prince]]'', which was released on a [[The Frog Prince (album)|soundtrack album of the same title]]. Another early appearance on record followed in 1987, where Enya provided spoken (not sung) vocals in Irish on the song "Never Get Old" on [[Sinéad O'Connor]]'s debut album, ''[[The Lion and the Cobra]]''.

Enya was contracted to provide music for the soundtrack of the 1986 BBC television documentary ''[[The Celts (BBC documentary)|The Celts]]''. The music she produced was featured on her first solo album, ''[[Enya (album)|Enya]]'' (1987), but it attracted little attention at the time.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/enya/427862 |title=Enya Biography |publisher=Artistdirect.com |accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> The [[B-side]] single "Eclipse" is actually a reversed and modified version of Enya's song "Deireadh An Tuath" from this 1987 album.<ref>[http://discography.enya.com/tracks/E02.asp] {{wayback|url=http://discography.enya.com/tracks/E02.asp |date=20050318085737 |df=y }}</ref> The song "[[Boadicea (song)|Boadicea]]", also from this album, would be sampled and modified by [[The Fugees]] on their single "Ready or Not" (1996), causing a brief stir because the group neither sought permission from Enya nor gave her credit initially. [[Mario Winans]]' song "[[I Don't Wanna Know (Mario Winans song)|I Don't Wanna Know]]" (which featured a [[rapping|rap]] by [[P. Diddy]]) sampled the Fugees sample, and is officially credited to Winans, Diddy and Enya. The song became Enya's highest charting US single, peaking at No.2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] in 2004.<ref name = Enyafaq/>

===1988–91: International breakthrough, ''Watermark'' and ''Shepherd Moons''===
{{listen |filename= enyalaetha.ogg |title= "Na Laetha Geal M'Óige" (1988) |description= [[Irish language]] song from her album ''[[Watermark (Enya album)|Watermark]]''. |format= [[Ogg]]}}
Enya achieved a breakthrough in her career in 1988 with the album ''[[Watermark (Enya album)|Watermark]]'', which featured the hit song "[[Orinoco Flow]]" (sometimes incorrectly known as "Sail Away"). "Orinoco Flow", reported to be named after Orinoco Studios (now [[Miloco Studios]]), where it was conceived, topped the charts in the United Kingdom and peaked at number 2 in Germany. The ''Watermark'' album sold eleven million copies.<ref name = Enyafaq/>

Enya was quoted as saying: "The success of ''Watermark'' surprised me. I never thought of music as something commercial; it was something very personal to me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enyaone.com/enya-quotes.html |title=Enya quotes &#124; Enya Lyrics, videos, MP3, discography, news, facts, biography, pictures, quotes |publisher=Enyaone.com |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> Enya also said in an interview paraphrased, "''Watermark'' has in its theme searching, longing, of reaching out for an answer. The ocean is a central image. It is the symbolism of a great journey, which is the way I would describe this album."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/interview.asp?CTR=68231 |title=Enya – THE ENIGMATIC ENYA An Exclusive Interview with the Alluring Star|publisher=Barnesandnoble.com |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>

The surprise success of Watermark actually led to a delay in the completion of Enya's third single, Storms in Africa because she was busy travelling the world to promote the album. Storms in Africa was re-recorded for the single and the deadline was missed. Record company WEA used TV adverts to promote Storms in Africa by reminding audiences of Enya's previous two hits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enya.sk/articles-archive/stormy-weather/ |title=Stormy Weather – Record Mirror interview from 1989}}</ref>

Three years later she followed with another hit album, ''[[Shepherd Moons]]'', which sold twelve million copies and earned Enya her first [[Grammy Award]]. ''Shepherd Moons'' is also her longest charting album to date, spending 238 weeks on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The songs "On Your Shore" and "[[Exile (song)|Exile]]" (from ''Watermark'') and "Epona" (from ''Enya'') were featured in the 1991 film ''[[L.A. Story]]''. "Ebudæ" is also featured on the soundtrack to the [[Robin Williams]] feature film ''[[Toys (1992 film)|Toys]]'', while the 1990 feature film ''[[Green Card (film)|Green Card]]'' features "River", "Watermark", and "Storms in Africa".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099699/soundtrack |title=Soundtracks for Green Card (1990) |accessdate=14 February 2007 |work=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref> "[[Book of Days (song)|Book of Days]]" was featured prominently in the movie ''[[Far and Away]]'', with an English-lyric version created for the film then replacing the old Irish language version on all pressings of the ''Shepherd Moons'' album from 1993 onwards. In 1993, her recording of "[[Marble Halls]]" from ''Shepherd Moons'' was featured in the [[Martin Scorsese]] film, ''[[The Age of Innocence (1993 film)|The Age of Innocence]]''.

===1992–99: ''The Celts'', ''The Memory of Trees'', and ''Paint the Sky with Stars''===
In 1992, a re-mastered version of the ''Enya'' album was released as ''[[The Celts (album)|The Celts]]'' including a longer, modified version of "Portrait", which was renamed "Portrait (Out of the Blue)".

Four years after ''Shepherd Moons'' she released ''[[The Memory of Trees]]'' (1995), another Top Five success in both the UK and Germany, as well as her first Top 10 album in the U.S. Singles released from the album were "[[Anywhere Is]]" and "[[On My Way Home (song)|On My Way Home]]".

{{listen |filename= enyaonlyif.ogg |title= "Only If..." (1997) |description= Hit song from her greatest hits compilation, ''[[Paint the Sky with Stars]]''. |format= [[Ogg]]}}
In 1997, Enya released her greatest hits collection, ''[[Paint the Sky with Stars|Paint the Sky with Stars: The Best of Enya]]'', again a top five smash in the UK and Germany, which featured two new songs: "Paint the Sky with Stars" and "Only If..."; "[[Only If...]]" later became a single. (''"Only If You Want To"'', is an early version of "Only If...". It appears on a promotional Japanese CD called ''The Best of Enya'', and does not include the French lyrics).<ref name = "Enyafaqh">[http://web.archive.org/web/20061105073259/http://fansites.hollywood.com/~enya/enya/music_faqs.html]{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}</ref> She was offered the chance to compose the score for [[James Cameron]]'s 1997 feature film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', but she declined. A 1989 recording of Enya singing "Oíche Chiúin", an Irish language version of "Silent Night", has been reissued at least twice: on ''The Christmas EP'' (which otherwise contains several non-holiday related previously issued recordings by Enya) and the 1997 edition of the charity album ''[[A Very Special Christmas]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discography.enya.com/singles/14.html|title=The Christmas EP|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref>

[[Ansett Australia]] extensively used "Storms in Africa" for promotional purposes when the airline re-branded itself in the 1990s. The 1992 film ''[[Sleepwalkers (film)|Sleepwalkers]]'' features "Boadicea" as the film's signature tune.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enya.com/about_filmography.php|title=Enya.com Filmography|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref>
"Boadicea" has also been sampled in the popular Fugees song "Ready or Not", and can be heard in Season 2 Episode 19 of ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', titled "Ashes and Dust", 24 seconds into episode.

===2000–04: ''A Day Without Rain''===
Following a five-year break Enya released the album ''[[A Day Without Rain]]'' in 2000, featuring 37 minutes of new material (34 minutes on the U.S. version). The album is Enya's most successful to date, peaking at number two on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. The first single, "[[Only Time]]", was used in the film ''[[Sweet November (2001 film)|Sweet November]]'' and received U.S. radio airplay in late 2000. In May 2001, [[NBC]] began using "Only Time" to accompany commercials for their television series ''[[Friends]]'', which helped the song top the Adult Contemporary and Adult Top 40 charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/enya-p4197/charts-awards/billboard-singles|title=Enya's ''Billboard'' singles chart history|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref>

After the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]], "Only Time" was used as a soundtrack in many radio and television reports about the attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disquiet.com/2002/02/01/into-the-mystic/ |title=Into The Mystic|first=Marc|last=Weidenbaum|date=1 February 2002|publisher=Disquiet.com|accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> Enya released a special edition of the song, and a [[maxi single]] was issued on 20 November 2001 featuring a pop mix, with proceeds donated to the families of victims. "Only Time" peaked at number 10 on the U.S. Hot 100, number 12 on the Pop Chart and hit number one on the Adult Contemporary and Hot Adult Contemporary charts. In Germany, "Only Time" re-entered the German single charts at number 1<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ki.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~topsi/deu2001/deu_2001t.html |title=Infinity Charts: German Top 20 |publisher=Ki.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de |date=5 March 2001 |accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> and the album ''A Day Without Rain'' reached number one some weeks later. Enya won an [[ECHO (music award)|Echo Award]] for best-selling international single in Germany of 2001, and received a nomination for best-selling album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echopop.de/no_cache/pop-suche/|title=Echo Pop: Suche|publisher=[[Echo (music award)|Echo]]|accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref>

In 2001, Enya recorded "[[May It Be]]", which was featured in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', earning her an [[Academy Award]] [[74th Academy Awards|nomination]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. It was her second consecutive single to enter the German charts at number one. The video features scenes from the [[Peter Jackson]] film.<ref>VH1.com – [http://www.vh1.com/video/play.jhtml?artist=828&vid=32167 Enya – May It Be]</ref> Enya also performed the song "[[Aníron]]" – a song sung in Tolkien's Elvish language [[Sindarin]] – for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

A new song called "[[wiktionary:菫草|Sumiregusa]]" ("Wild Violet") was based on a Japanese poem by Roma Ryan. In September 2004, the song was used in Japan as part of an advertising campaign for [[Panasonic]]. [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Music Japan]] stated that Enya's next album was scheduled for release in Japan in mid-November. Enya issued a press release on her official Web site on 19 September stating that this was a mistake and no new album was immediately forthcoming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enya.com |title=Official announcement |publisher=Enya.com |date=19 September 2004 |accessdate=19 September 2004}}</ref>

===2005–08: ''Amarantine'' and ''And Winter Came...''===
In November 2005, a new album, entitled ''[[Amarantine (album)|Amarantine]]'', was released. It reached the Top 10 in both the UK and the US, and peaked at number 3 in Germany. The album won the [[Grammy Award]] for ''[[Grammy Award for Best New Age Album|Best New Age Album]]'' for 2007, Enya's fourth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=enya&title=&year=All&genre=All|title=Grammy – Past Winners Search|publisher=[[Grammys]]|accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, Enya released several Christmas-themed CDs with newly recorded material. On 10 October 2006 ''[[Sounds of the Season: The Enya Holiday Collection]]'' was released containing six songs: the previously released "Oíche Chiúin" (a.k.a. "[[Silent Night (song)|Silent Night]]") and "Amid the Falling Snow", new recordings of the standards "[[Adeste Fideles]]" (a.k.a. "Oh Come All Ye Faithful") and "[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]" as well as two original songs, "Christmas Secrets" and "The Magic of the Night". This CD was released only in the United States in an exclusive partnership with the [[NBC]] television network and the [[Target Corporation|Target]] department store chain. Enya won the ''World's Best-Selling Irish Act'' award at the [[World Music Awards]] in London on 19 November 2006.<ref>[http://www.irishmusicdaily.com/enya World's Best Selling Irish Act], "irishmusicdaily.com", retrieved April 18, 2015</ref>

In late November two new editions of ''Amarantine'' were released. In the UK it was reissued as ''Christmas Edition: Amarantine'' with a second disc containing the four new Christmas songs previously issued on ''Sounds of the Season'' (the original album already had "Amid the Falling Snow" while "Oíche Chiúin" is a recording dating back to 1988, which had already been featured on numerous collections). The U.S. received a special version of this release (''Amarantine – Deluxe Collector's Edition''), which also included three postcards and a copy of Roma Ryan's book ''Water Shows the Hidden Heart'', which is referenced on the original album. Canadian fans could choose from the ''Special Christmas Edition'' of ''Amarantine'' or an EP entitled ''Christmas Secrets'', which contained only the four new songs.

By mid-2007, Enya claimed to have sold 80 million albums. An American businessperson has coined the phrase "enyanomics" to explain Enya's ability to sell millions of records without giving any live performances. It is defined as the inexplicable growth in sales of an artist in inverse relation to how much publicity they have.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3562058/Enya-talks-about-her-new-album-And-Winter-Came.html|first=Jacques|last=Peretti|title=Enya talks about her new album And Winter Came|date=12 October 2008|accessdate=25 November 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

On 29 June 2007, Enya received an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]].<ref name = "Doctorate">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnbreslin.com/blog/2007/06/29/enya-receives-honorary-doctorate-from-the-national-university-of-ireland-galway/ |title=Enya received honorary doctorate from NUI |publisher=Johnbreslin.com |date=29 June 2007 |accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> Shortly after, on 10 July 2007, Enya received a second honorary doctorate from the [[University of Ulster]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/education/article2751156.ece|first=Lisa|last=Smyth|title=Enya receives second doctorate|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|date=10 July 2007|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ulster.ac.uk/releases/2007/3306.html |title=UU Honours Musician Enya |publisher=University of Ulster|date=11 July 2007 |accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref>

November 2008 saw the release of ''[[And Winter Came…]]'' with a new video for the song "Trains and Winter Rains". This album follows her passion for the Christmas period. It also features guitar on the track "My! My! Time Flies!" (an instrument rarely heard on an Enya recording since "I Want Tomorrow" from ''The Celts'' soundtrack) and a chorale version of the previously released "Oíche Chiúin". She promoted the album on morning news shows and performed some songs live.

===2009–present: ''The Very Best of Enya'' and ''Dark Sky Island''===
In March 2009, Warner Music Japan released Enya's first 4 albums in a new format, called [[Super High Material CD|SHM-CD]]. On 23 November 2009 Enya released a new album called ''[[The Very Best of Enya]]''. It includes most of her hits from 1987 to 2008, as well as a new version of "[[Aníron]]", a song created for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' in 2001.

In a May 2011 interview, Enya's manager said that she is working on a new album and will likely tour to support it, with part of the recording taking place in [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/ent/Mysterious-Irish-superstar-Enya-turns-50-122225914.html |title=Mysterious Irish superstar Enya turns 50 |publisher=irishcentral.com |accessdate=19 May 2011}}</ref>

Enya's single "[[Only Time]]" was used by Volvo Trucks for their commercial starring [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], released in November 2013, in which the action film star executed the splits while suspended between two trucks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Alex|title=Jean-Claude Van Damme Did A Crazy Split Standing on 2 Trucks for a Volvo Ad|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jean-claude-van-damme-epic-split-volvo-trucks-2013-11|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=27 November 2013|date=14 November 2013}}</ref> Numerous parodies of the commercial appeared online in the weeks following, again using "Only Time". The new-found attention allowed the song to re-enter the [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Hot 100 Singles]] chart at No. 43.

In September 2015 a short snippet of a new track appeared on her official website in anticipation of a new album with another preview clip appearing in October. On 7 October 2015, [[BBC Radio 2]] announced on their [[Facebook]] page that the lead single for the album ''[[Dark Sky Island]]'' would be "'[[Echoes In Rain]]" and that the world premiere of the song would be on the following morning on their [[Ken Bruce]] radio show.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bruce|first1=Ken|title=BBC Radio 2|url=https://www.facebook.com/BBCR2/photos/pb.129044383774217.-2207520000.1444231478./1235941909751120/?type=3&theater|website=Facebook|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref> After the premiere of "Echoes In Rain", its lyric video was posted on Enya's official YouTube Channel, and the song was made available digitally on [[iTunes]], [[Amazon Music]] and [[Spotify]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dark Sky Island by Enya on iTunes|url=https://itunes.apple.com/album/dark-sky-island/id1043622490|website=iTunes.apple.com|publisher=iTunes|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Spotify Player|url=https://player.spotify.com/album/3cIOhmhGz4sdi2jbU05TlJ|website=player.spotify.com|publisher=player.spotify.com|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref> 

A complete update of her website followed with improved graphics and a total reformat.

==Musical style and other projects==
As a musical group ''Enya'' represents a partnership between three people: Enya herself, who composes and performs the music; [[Nicky Ryan]], who produces the albums; and [[Roma Ryan]], who writes the [[lyrics]] in various [[language]]s, except Irish, in which Enya will render the lyrics herself.<ref name="Enyafaq">{{cite web|first=Lee|last=Tobin |url=http://www.enya.com/about_bio.php |title=About Enya |publisher=Enya.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref> Enya performs all instruments and vocals in her pieces unless specified.<ref name = Enyafaq/> Although there are certain pieces where acoustic instruments are featured, almost all sounds of her pieces are created by a synthesiser. Her signature sound uses simple arrangements with extensive [[Multitrack recording|multi-tracking]] vocals. The vocals are performed individually and are then layered together to form a virtual choir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enya.sk/articles-archive/the-very-best-of-enya-detailed-enya-biography/ |title=The Very Best of Enya Detailed Enya Biography |publisher=Enya.sk |date= |accessdate=2014-12-09}}</ref> According to Enya, ''Angeles'', the fifth track on her album ''[[Shepherd Moons]]'' has about 500 layered vocal tracks, which is a result of making approximately 25 copies of 20 individually layered vocal tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enyabookofdays.com/articles/sm-1.htm |title=Shepherd Moons Article |publisher=Enya Book of Days |date= |accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref>

Enya's vocal range is [[mezzo-soprano]].<ref name="nyulocal">{{cite web|url=http://nyulocal.com/entertainment/2010/10/26/let-the-ghostly-spirit-of-enya-guide-your-halloween-music-picks/ |title=Let The Ghostly Spirit Of Enya Guide Your Halloween Music Picks |publisher=nyulocal |accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>  In "Cursum Perficio" of the album ''Watermark'', Enya reaches a C an [[octave]] below middle C. Later in the piece, she sings a high A-flat above the treble clef.

Certain songs on the albums ''Amarantine'' and ''Dark Sky Island'', are sung in [[Loxian]], a language invented by [[Roma Ryan]]. The vocabulary is formed by Enya singing the notes to which Roma provides the phonetic writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enya.sk/amarantine.php#loxian |title=Loxian - Amarantine album |publisher=Enya.sk |date= |accessdate=2014-12-09}}</ref> There is no official syntax for Loxian.<ref name = Enyafaq/> While most of her songs are sung in English, some of Enya's songs are sung entirely in Irish or [[Latin]]. Enya has also sung songs written entirely or partially in Welsh, Spanish, French, and even [[languages of Middle-earth|languages created by J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Enya has performed several songs relating to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', including 1991's "[[Lothlórien]]" (instrumental), and 2001's "[[May It Be]]" (sung in English and [[Quenya]]), and "[[Aníron]]" (in [[Sindarin]])—the latter two appearing in [[Peter Jackson]]'s movie ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and on its soundtrack album. "May It Be" was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].

Enya's performances are "semi-live", using playback music and singing. She has given live performances on various television shows, events and ceremonies (one of her recent appearances was in Gweedore in the summer of 2005, which coincided with a tribute event to the [[Leo Brennan|Brennan family]] that took place in Letterkenny), but she has yet to do a concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enya.sk/articles-archive/enya-set-for-return-to-limelight-with-album-and-tour |title=Enya set for return to limelight with album and tour |publisher=Enya.sk |date= |accessdate=2014-12-09}}</ref> She does not classify her music as belonging to the new-age [[genre]]. When asked what genre she would classify her music as belonging to, she would reply, "Enya".<ref name = Enyafaq/>

==Personal life==
[[File:Enya House.jpg|right|thumb|Enya's home in [[Killiney]], County Dublin]]
In 1997, Enya bought a castle in [[Killiney]], south of Dublin, for £2.5 million, and named it [[Manderley Castle]] after the house in her favourite book, [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]''. Beginning with ''Watermark'', Enya began to attract the attention of stalkers, several of whom succeeded in breaking into her castle and attacking some of the staff.<ref>{{cite news

In 1996, a man who had been seen in Dublin wearing her photograph around his neck stabbed himself after being ejected from her parents' pub in County Donegal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/enya-escapes-intruder-by-hiding-in-panic-room-317211.html|title=Enya escapes intruder by hiding in panic room|work=The Independent|date=5 October 2005|accessdate=14 August 2009|location=London|first=David|last=McKittrick}}</ref>

In 2006, Enya made it to the number three spot in the ranks of wealthy Irish entertainers with an estimated fortune of €109 million (£75 million or US$165 million), and number 95 in the [[Sunday Times Rich List|''Sunday Times'' Rich List]] 2006 of the 250 Wealthiest Irish People.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,29049,00.html | title= Times Online article – | location=London | first=David | last=McKittrick | work=The Times}}</ref>

"My influences are with Irish music, church music and classical music," she said in a 1997 interview.<ref name="enyabookofdays1997">{{cite news | first = Jim | last = Sullivan | title = Enya Knocks on Heaven's Doors | date = 20 December 1997 | publisher = NY Times Co. | url = http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/ptsws-12.htm | work = Boston Globe | accessdate =29 December 2010}}</ref>

In addition to performing for [[Pope John Paul II]], Enya participated in a live broadcast on British television for Christmas Eve in 1997, before she flew home to County Donegal to join her family at midnight Mass.<ref name="enyabookofdays1997"/> She still sings in her mother's choir every Christmas at midnight Mass, at St. Mary's Church.<ref>{{cite news | first = Anita | last = Guidera | title = Donegal Catch as Proud Parents of Folk Music's First Family Get Freedom of County | date = 15 July 2005 | publisher = [[Independent News & Media]] | url = http://www.independent.ie/national-news/donegal-catch-as-proud-parents-of-folk-musics-first-family-get-freedom-of-county-249795.html | work = [[Irish Independent]] | accessdate =29 December 2010 | quote = ...Enya, joined her four sisters, Moya, Deirdre, Bridin and Olive, on Wednesday night at St Mary's Church, Derrybeg, where their mother conducts the choir...Enya, who joins the choir for midnight Mass every Christmas, said she was overwhelmed by the occasion.}}</ref>

===Video releases===
The first official home video collection of music videos by Enya, ''Moonshadows'', was issued on VHS and [[laserdisc]] by Warner Music in 1991, containing most of her music videos up until that point. This release occurred in both the UK and North America.

In 2000, Warner Music released ''Enya: The Video Collection'' on DVD in Europe, South Africa and Asia, collecting all her videos from "Orinoco Flow" up to and including "Wild Child", except for the video from "Book of Days", which was replaced by a live TV performance due to licensing complications relating to the video's use of footage from the film ''[[Far and Away]]''.  The DVD release also included interviews and features on the making of two videos.

A North American ([[Region 1]]) release of the ''Video Collection'' DVD was announced on several occasions during 2000–2001, but it did not occur; the reason for which has never been officially stated. At one point it was announced that the release had been delayed to allow the inclusion of the video for "May it Be", while the (now defunct) fan sites reported that a dispute over the sound quality of the release led to it being withdrawn.

Enya is featured in featurettes included with the 2003 [[BBC Video]] DVD release of ''The Celts'', including performances of several songs videotaped in the late 1980s. This release was available in both the UK and North America.

In November 2009, the deluxe version of the compilation release ''[[The Very Best of Enya]]'' included a DVD bonus disc containing most (but not all) of the music videos from the 2001 release, documentaries from that release, and videos from Enya's post-2001 albums. This DVD (formatted as [[Region 0]]) was distributed in North America and remains available as of 2014.
