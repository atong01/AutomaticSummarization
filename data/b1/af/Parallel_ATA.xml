The interface cards used to connect a parallel ATA drive to, for example, a<space/><link><target>PCI slot</target></link><space/>are not drive controllers: they are merely bridges between the host bus and the ATA interface. Since the original ATA interface is essentially just a 16-bit<space/><link><target>ISA bus</target></link><space/>in disguise, the bridge was especially simple in case of an ATA connector being located on an ISA interface card. The integrated controller presented the drive to the host computer as an array of 512-byte blocks with a relatively simple command interface. This relieved the mainboard and interface cards in the host computer of the chores of stepping the disk head arm, moving the head arm in and out, and so on, as had to be done with earlier<space/><link><target>ST-506</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Enhanced Small Disk Interface</target><part>ESDI</part></link><space/>hard drives. All of these low-level details of the mechanical operation of the drive were now handled by the controller on the drive itself. This also eliminated the need to design a single controller that could handle many different types of drives, since the controller could be unique for the drive. The host need only ask for a particular sector, or block, to be read or written, and either accept the data from the drive or send the data to it.</paragraph><paragraph>The interface used by these drives was standardized in 1994 as ANSI standard X3.221-1994,<space/><italics>AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives</italics>.

The introduction of ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface) by a group called the<space/><link><target>Small Form Factor committee</target></link><space/>(SFF) allowed ATA to be used for a variety of other devices that require functions beyond those necessary for hard disk drives. For example, any removable media device needs a &quot;media eject&quot; command, and a way for the host to determine whether the media is present, and these were not provided in the ATA protocol.</paragraph><paragraph>The Small Form Factor committee approached this problem by defining ATAPI, the &quot;ATA Packet Interface&quot;. ATAPI is actually a protocol allowing the ATA interface to carry<space/><link><target>SCSI</target></link><space/>commands and responses; therefore, all ATAPI devices are actually &quot;speaking SCSI&quot; other than at the electrical interface. In fact, some early ATAPI devices were simply SCSI devices with an ATA/ATAPI to SCSI protocol converter added on. The SCSI commands and responses are embedded in &quot;packets&quot; (hence &quot;ATA Packet Interface&quot;) for transmission on the ATA cable. This allows any device class for which a SCSI command set has been defined to be interfaced via ATA/ATAPI.</paragraph><paragraph>ATAPI devices are also &quot;speaking ATA&quot;, as the ATA physical interface and protocol are still being used to send the packets.

Similarly, ATA-6 introduced a maximum transfer speed of 100 megabytes per second, and some drives complying to this version of the standard are marketed as &quot;PATA/100&quot; drives.</paragraph><heading level='3'>x86 BIOS size limitations</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Logical block addressing#Enhanced BIOS</arg><arg name="l1">Enhanced BIOS</arg></template></paragraph><preblock><preline></preline></preblock><paragraph>Initially, the size of an ATA drive was stored in the system<space/><link><target>x86</target></link><space/>BIOS using a type number (1 through 45) that predefined the C/H/S parameters<space/><extension extension_name='ref' name="pdef"><link type='external' href='http://www.kva.kursk.ru/bios1/HTML1/standard.html'>kursk.ru Standard CMOS Setup</link></extension><space/>and also often the landing zone, in which the drive heads are parked while not in use.

The top row of contacts are the even-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the even-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to every other even-numbered conductor of the cable. The bottom row of contacts are the odd-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the odd-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to the remaining even-numbered conductors of the cable.</paragraph><paragraph>Note the connections to the common ground bus from sockets 2 (top left), 19 (center bottom row), 22, 24, 26, 30, and 40 on all connectors.

On the gray connector, note that socket 28 is completely missing, so that pin 28 of the drive attached to the gray connector will be open. On the black connector, sockets 28 and 34 are completely normal, so that pins 28 and 34 of the drive attached to the black connector will be connected to the cable. Pin 28 of the black drive reaches pin 28 of the host receptacle but not pin 28 of the gray drive, while pin 34 of the black drive reaches pin 34 of the gray drive but not pin 34 of the host. Instead, pin 34 of the host is grounded.</paragraph><paragraph>The standard dictates color-coded connectors for easy identification by both installer and cable maker. All three connectors are different from one another. The blue (host) connector has the socket for pin 34 connected to ground inside the connector but not attached to any conductor of the cable. Since the old 40 conductor cables do not ground pin 34, the presence of a ground connection indicates that an 80 conductor cable is installed. The wire for pin 34 is attached normally on the other types and is not grounded. Installing the cable backwards (with the black connector on the system board, the blue connector on the remote device and the gray connector on the center device) will ground pin 34 of the remote device and connect host pin 34 through to pin 34 of the center device. The gray center connector omits the connection to pin 28 but connects pin 34 normally, while the black end connector connects both pins 28 and 34 normally.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Multiple devices on a cable</heading><paragraph>If two devices are attached to a single cable, one must be designated as<space/><italics>device 0</italics><space/>(commonly referred to as<space/><italics>master</italics>) and the other as<space/><italics>device 1</italics><space/>(<italics>slave</italics>). This distinction is necessary to allow both drives to share the cable without conflict.

On old BIOSes (<link><target>Intel 486</target></link><space/>era and older), the drives are often referred to by the BIOS as &quot;C&quot; for the master and &quot;D&quot; for the slave following the way DOS would refer to the active primary partitions on each.</paragraph><paragraph>The mode that a drive must use is often set by a<space/><link><target>Jumper (computing)</target><part>jumper setting</part></link><space/>on the drive itself, which must be manually set to<space/><italics>master</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>slave</italics>. If there is a single device on a cable, it should be configured as<space/><italics>master</italics>. However, some hard drives have a special setting called<space/><italics>single</italics><space/>for this configuration (Western Digital, in particular). Also, depending on the hardware and software available, a single drive on a cable will often work reliably even though configured as the<space/><italics>slave</italics><space/>drive (most often seen where an optical drive is the only device on the secondary ATA interface).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Cable select</heading><preblock><preline>A drive mode called<space/><italics>cable select</italics><space/>was described as optional in ATA-1 and has come into fairly widespread use with ATA-5 and later. A drive set to &quot;cable select&quot; automatically configures itself as master or slave, according to its position on the cable. Cable select is controlled by pin 28. The host adapter grounds this pin; if a device sees that the pin is grounded, it becomes the master device; if it sees that pin 28 is open, the device becomes the slave device.</preline></preblock><paragraph>This setting is usually chosen by a<space/><link><target>Jumper (computing)</target><part>jumper setting</part></link><space/>on the drive called &quot;cable select&quot;, usually marked<space/><italics>CS</italics>, which is separate from the &quot;master&quot; or &quot;slave&quot; setting.</paragraph><paragraph>Note that if two drives are configured as<space/><italics>master</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>slave</italics><space/>manually, this configuration does not need to correspond to their position on the cable. Pin 28 is only used to let the drives know their position on the cable; it is not used by the host when communicating with the drives.</paragraph><paragraph>With the 40-wire cable, it was very common to implement cable select by simply cutting the pin 28 wire between the two device connectors; putting the slave device at the end of the cable, and the master on the middle connector. This arrangement eventually was standardized in later versions. If there is just one device on the cable, this results in an unused stub of cable, which is undesirable for physical convenience and electrical reasons. The stub causes<space/><link><target>signal reflections</target></link>, particularly at higher transfer rates.</paragraph><paragraph>Starting with the 80-wire cable defined for use in ATAPI5/UDMA4, the master device goes at the end of the<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>18</arg><arg>in</arg><arg>mm</arg><arg name="sing">on</arg></template><space/>cablethe black connectorand the slave device goes on the middle connectorthe gray oneand the blue connector goes onto the motherboard. So, if there is only one (master) device on the cable, there is no cable stub to cause reflections. Also, cable select is now implemented in the slave device connector, usually simply by omitting the contact from the connector body.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Master and slave clarification</heading><paragraph>Although they are in extremely common use, the terms<space/><link><target>Master/slave (technology)</target><part>&quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot;</part></link><space/>do not actually appear in current versions of the ATA specifications. The two devices are simply referred to as &quot;device 0&quot; and &quot;device 1&quot;, respectively, in ATA-2 and later.</paragraph><paragraph>It is a common myth that the controller on the master drive assumes control over the slave drive, or that the master drive may claim priority of communication over the other device on the same ATA interface. In fact, the drivers in the host operating system perform the necessary arbitration and serialization, and each drive's onboard controller operates independently of the other.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Serialized, overlapped, and queued operations</heading><paragraph>The parallel ATA protocols up through ATA-3 require that once a command has been given on an ATA interface, it must complete before any subsequent command may be given. Operations on the devices must be serializedwith only one operation in progress at a timewith respect to the ATA host interface. A useful mental model is that the host ATA interface is busy with the first request for its entire duration, and therefore can not be told about another request until the first one is complete. The function of serializing requests to the interface is usually performed by a device driver in the host operating system.</paragraph><paragraph>The ATA-4 and subsequent versions of the specification have included an &quot;overlapped feature set&quot; and a &quot;queued feature set&quot; as optional features, both being given the name &quot;<link><target>Tagged Command Queuing</target></link>&quot;, a reference to a set of features from SCSI which the ATA version attempts to emulate. However, support for these is extremely rare in actual parallel ATA products and device drivers because these feature sets were implemented in such a way as to maintain software compatibility with its heritage as originally an extension of the ISA bus. This implementation resulted in excessive CPU utilization which largely negated the advantages of command queuing. By contrast, overlapped and queued operations have been common in other storage buses, in particular, SCSI's version of tagged command queuing had no need to be software compatible with ISA's APIs, allowing it to attain high performance with low overhead on buses which supported first party DMA like PCI. This has long been seen as a major advantage of SCSI.</paragraph><paragraph>The Serial ATA standard has supported<space/><link><target>Native Command Queuing</target><part>native command queueing</part></link><space/>since its first release, but it is an optional feature for both host adapters and target devices. Many less expensive PC motherboards do not support NCQ. Many SATA/II hard drives sold today support NCQ, while no removable (CD/DVD) drives do because the ATAPI command set used to control them prohibits queued operations.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Two devices on one cablespeed impact</heading><paragraph>There are many debates about how much a slow device can impact the performance of a faster device on the same cable.

This allows commands to be sent to the other device on the cable, reducing the impact of the &quot;one operation at a time&quot; limit.</paragraph><paragraph>The impact of this on a system's performance depends on the application. For example, when copying data from an optical drive to a hard drive (such as during software installation), this effect probably will not matter: Such jobs are necessarily limited by the speed of the optical drive no matter where it is. But if the hard drive in question is also expected to provide good throughput for other tasks at the same time, it probably should not be on the same cable as the optical drive.</paragraph><heading level='3'>HDD passwords and security</heading><paragraph><template><target>redirect</target><arg>ATA Secure Erase</arg><arg>ATA Secure Erase with flash memory</arg><arg>Write amplification#Secure erase</arg><arg>general use</arg><arg>Disk formatting#Recovery of data from a formatted disk</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The disk lock is a built-in security feature in the disk.

Ribbon cables are poorly shielded, and the standard relies upon the cabling to be installed inside a shielded computer case to meet RF emissions limits.</paragraph><paragraph>All external PATA devices, such as external hard drives, use some other interface technology to bridge the distance between the external device and the computer. USB is the most common external interface, followed by Firewire. A bridge chip inside the external devices converts from the USB interface to PATA, and typically only supports a single external device without cable select or master/slave.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Compact Flash interface</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Compact Flash is just a miniature IDE-ATA interface.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Compact flash is just a miniature ATA interface, slightly modified to be able to also supply power to the CF device.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Compact Flash#Technical details</target><part>Compact Flash</part></link><space/>in its<space/><italics>IDE mode</italics><space/>is essentially just a miniaturized ATA interface, intended for use on devices that use flash memory storage. No interfacing chips or circuitry are required, other than to directly adapt the smaller CF socket onto the larger ATA connector.</paragraph><paragraph>The ATA connector specification does not include pins for supplying power to a CF device, so power is inserted into the connector from a separate source. The exception to this is when the CF device is connected to a 44-pin ATA bus designed for 2.5&quot; hard disk drives, commonly found in notebook computers, as this bus implementation must provide power to a standard hard disk drive.</paragraph><paragraph>CF devices can be designated as master or slave on an ATA interface, though since most CF devices offer only a single socket, it is not necessary to offer this selection to end users. Although CF can be<space/><link><target>hot-pluggable</target></link><space/>with additional design methods, by default when wired directly to an ATA interface, it is not intended to be hot-pluggable.</paragraph><heading level='2'>ATA standards versions, transfer rates, and features</heading><paragraph>The following table shows the names of the versions of the ATA standards and the transfer modes and rates supported by each. Note that the transfer rate for each mode (for example, 66.7&amp;nbsp;MB/s for UDMA4, commonly called &quot;Ultra-DMA 66&quot;, defined by ATA-5) gives its maximum theoretical transfer rate on the cable. This is simply two bytes multiplied by the effective clock rate, and presumes that every clock cycle is used to transfer end-user data. In practice, of course, protocol overhead reduces this value.</paragraph><paragraph>Congestion on the host bus to which the ATA adapter is attached may also limit the maximum burst transfer rate. For example, the maximum data transfer rate for<space/><link><target>conventional PCI</target></link><space/>bus is 133&amp;nbsp;MB/s, and this is shared among all active devices on the bus.</paragraph><paragraph>In addition, no ATA<space/><link><target>hard drive</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>existed in 2005 that were capable of measured sustained transfer rates of above 80&amp;nbsp;MB/s. Furthermore, sustained transfer rate tests do not give realistic throughput expectations for most workloads: They use I/O loads specifically designed to encounter almost no delays from seek time or rotational latency. Hard drive performance under most workloads is limited first and second by those two factors; the transfer rate on the bus is a distant third in importance. Therefore, transfer speed limits above 66&amp;nbsp;MB/s really affect performance only when the hard drive can satisfy all I/O requests by reading from its internal<space/><link><target>disk buffer</target><part>cache</part></link>a very unusual situation, especially considering that such data is usually already buffered by the operating system.</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>As of</target><arg>2010</arg><arg>4</arg></template>, mechanical hard disk drives can transfer data at up to 157&amp;nbsp;MB/s,<extension extension_name='ref' name="Tom2010HardDrives"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="title">VelociRaptor Returns: 6Gb/s, 600GB, And 10,000 RPM<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">tomshardware.com<space/></arg><arg name="author">Patrick Schmid and Achim Roos<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd6000hlhx-velociraptor-600gb,2600-5.html<space/></arg><arg name="date">2010-04-06<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2010-06-26</arg><arg name="archiveurl"><space/>http://www.webcitation.org/5uKd8rggb<space/></arg><arg name="archivedate"><space/>2010-11-18</arg><arg name="deadurl">no</arg></template></extension><space/>which is beyond the capabilities of the PATA/133 specification.

Usually an ARMD device is configured earlier in the boot order than the hard drive. Similarly to a floppy drive, if bootable media is present in the ARMD drive, the BIOS will boot from it; if not, the BIOS will continue in the search order, usually with the hard drive last.</paragraph><paragraph>There are two variants of ARMD, ARMD-FDD and ARMD-HDD. Originally ARMD caused the devices to appear as a sort of very large floppy drive, either the primary floppy drive device 00h or the secondary device 01h. Some operating systems required code changes to support floppy disks with capacities far larger than any standard floppy disk drive. Also, standard-floppy disk drive emulation proved to be unsuitable for certain high-capacity floppy disk drives such as<space/><link><target>Iomega Zip drive</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Later the ARMD-HDD, ARMD-&quot;Hard disk device&quot;, variant was developed to address these issues.
