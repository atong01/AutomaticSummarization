As can be seen in the texts, the French declaration is heavily influenced by the political philosophy of the Enlightenment, by Enlightenment principles of human rights, and by the<space/><link><target>U.S. Declaration of Independence</target></link><space/>which preceded it (4 July 1776). Thomas Jeffersonthe primary author of the U.S. Declaration of Independencewas at the time in France as a U.S. diplomat, and worked closely with Lafayette in designing a bill of rights for France. In the ratification by the states of the<space/><link><target>U.S. Constitution</target></link><space/>in 1788, critics had demanded a written Bill of Rights. In response,<space/><link><target>James Madison</target></link>'s proposal for a<space/><link><target>United States Bill of Rights</target><part>U.S. Bill of Rights</part></link><space/>was introduced in New York on 8 June 1789, 11 weeks before the French declaration.
