The Canadian Pacific Railway began its westward expansion from<space/><link><target>Bonfield, Ontario</target></link><space/>(previously called Callander Station), where the first spike was driven into a sunken railway tie. Bonfield was inducted into Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2002 as the CPR first spike location.

The CCR started in Brockville and extended to Pembroke. It then followed a westward route along the Ottawa River passing through places like Cobden, Deux-Rivires, and eventually to Mattawa at the confluence of the Mattawa and Ottawa rivers. It then proceeded cross-country towards its final destination of Bonfield. Duncan McIntyre and his contractor James Worthington piloted the CPR expansion. Worthington continued on as the construction superintendent for the CPR past Bonfield. He remained with the CPR for about a year after which he left the company. McIntyre was uncle to John Ferguson who staked out future North Bay and who became the town's wealthiest inhabitant and mayor for four successive terms.<extension extension_name='ref'>Berton, Pierre. &quot;The Last Spike: The Great Railway 1881-1885&quot;.

This route was more direct and closer to the American border, making it easier for the CPR to keep American railways from encroaching on the Canadian market.

The CPR promised him a<space/><link><target>cheque</target></link><space/>for $5,000 and that the pass would be named in his honour.

He later agreed to cash it with the promise of an engraved watch.<space/><template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">April 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Another obstacle was that the proposed route crossed land in Alberta that was controlled by the<space/><link><target>Blackfoot</target></link><space/><link><target>First Nation</target></link>.

In return for his assent, Crowfoot was famously rewarded with a lifetime pass to ride the CPR. A more lasting consequence of the choice of route was that, unlike the one proposed by Fleming, the land surrounding the railway often proved too arid for successful agriculture.

Some sections of track were incomplete or had not been used before, but the trip to Winnipeg was made in nine days and the rebellion quickly put down. Perhaps because the government was grateful for this service, they subsequently re-organized the CPR's debt and provided a further $5 million loan. This money was desperately needed by the CPR. However, this government loan was later found out to be controversial. Even with Van Horne's support with moving troops to Qu'Appelle, the government still delayed in giving its support to CPR. This was due to Sir John A. Macdonald putting pressure on George Stephen for additional benefits. Stephen himself later did admit to spending $1 million between 1881 and 1886 to ensure government support. This money went to buying a 40,000 necklace for Lady MacDonald and numerous other &quot;bonifications&quot; to government members.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Cruise</arg><arg name="first">David</arg><arg name="title">The men who built the CPR: Lords of the Line</arg><arg name="year">1988</arg><arg name="publisher">Penguin Group</arg><arg name="location">New York</arg><arg name="page">157</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>On 7 November 1885, the<space/><link><target>Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)</target><part>last spike</part></link><space/>was driven at<space/><link><target>Craigellachie, British Columbia</target></link>, making good on the original promise.

Proving already to be a very resourceful organization, Canadian Pacific began an intense campaign to bring immigrants to Canada. Canadian Pacific agents operated in many overseas locations. Immigrants were often sold a package that included passage on a CP ship, travel on a CP train, and land sold by the CP railway.

CP consolidated most of its Canadian train control into the new office, creating the Network Management Centre (NMC). The NMC controlled all CP train movement from the Port of Vancouver to Northern Ontario (Mactier, Ontario).

Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 1995. p. 134.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Starting in the 1960s, however, the railway started to discontinue much of its passenger service, particularly on its branch lines. For example, passenger service ended on its line through southern<space/><link><target>British Columbia</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Crowsnest Pass</target></link><space/>in January 1964, and on its<space/><link><target>Quebec Central</target></link><space/>in April 1967, and the transcontinental train<space/><italics>The Dominion</italics><space/>was dropped in January 1966. On 29 October 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to<space/><link><target>Via Rail</target></link>, a new federal Crown corporation that was now responsible for intercity passenger services in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presided over major cuts in Via Rail service on 15 January 1990. This ended service by &quot;The Canadian&quot; over CPR rails, and the train was rerouted on the former &quot;Super Continental&quot; route via Canadian National without a change of name. Where both trains had been daily prior to the 15 January 1990 cuts, the surviving &quot;Canadian&quot; was only a three-times-weekly operation. In October 2012, the &quot;Canadian&quot; was reduced to twice-weekly for the six-month off-season period, and now operates three-times-weekly for only six months a year. In addition to inter-city passenger services, the CPR also provided<space/><link><target>Commuter rail in North America</target><part>commuter rail</part></link><space/>services in Montreal.

The CPR decided from the very beginning that it would operate its own sleeping cars, unlike railways in the United States that depended upon independent companies that specialized in providing cars and porters, including building the cars themselves.

Providing and operating their own cars allowed better control of the service provided as well as keeping all of the revenue received, although profit was never a direct result of providing food to passengers. Rather, it was the realization that those who could afford to travel great distances expected such facilities and their favourable opinion would bode well to attracting others to Canada and the CPR's trains.<extension extension_name='ref'>Lamb, W.

Van Horne decided from the very beginning that the CPR would retain as much revenue from its various operations as it could. This translated into keeping express, telegraph, sleeping car and other lines of business for themselves, creating separate departments or companies as necessary. This was necessary as the fledgling railway would need all the income it could get, and in addition, he saw some of these ancillary operations such as express and telegraph as being quite profitable. Others such as sleeping and dining cars were kept in order to provide better control over the quality of service being provided to passengers.

It was soon absorbed into the CPR and expanded everywhere the CPR went. It was renamed<space/><bold>Canadian Express Company</bold><space/>on 1 September 1926, and the headquarters moved from Winnipeg, to Toronto. It was operated as a separate company with the railway charging them to haul express cars on trains. Express was handled in separate cars, some with employees on board, on the headend of passenger trains to provide a fast scheduled service for which higher rates could be charged than for LCL (<link><target>Less-than-carload</target><part>Less than Carload Lot</part></link>), small shipments of freight which were subject to delay. Aside from all sorts of small shipments for all kinds of businesses such products as cream, butter, poultry, and eggs were handled along with fresh flowers, fish and other sea foods some handled in separate refrigerated cars. Horses and livestock along with birds and small animals including prize cattle for exhibition were carried often in special horse cars that had facilities for grooms to ride with their animals.<space/><template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">April 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Automobiles for individuals were also handled by express in closed boxcars.

The silk trains had superior rights over all other trains; even passenger trains (including the Royal Train of 1939) would be put in sidings to make the silk trains' trip faster.

These sleek steamships were of the latest design and christened with the prefix Empress in a link to the Orient. Travel to and from the Orient and cargo, especially imported tea and silk were an important source of revenue aided by Royal Mail contracts. This was an important part of the All Red Route to link the British Empire. The other ocean part was the Atlantic service from England which began with acquisition of two existing lines, Beaver Line, owned by Elder Dempster and Allan Lines. These two segments became Canadian Pacific Ocean Services (later, Canadian Pacific Steamships) and operated separately from the various lake services operated in Canada and which were considered to be a direct part of the railway's operations. These trans-ocean routes made it possible to travel from Britain to Hong Kong using only the CPR's ships, trains and hotels. CPs 'Empress' ships became world-famous for their luxury and speed.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">June 2014</arg></template><space/>They had a practical role too in transporting immigrants from much of Europe to Canada especially to populate the vast prairies.
