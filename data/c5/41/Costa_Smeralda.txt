The '''Costa Smeralda''' ({{IPA-it|ˌkɔsta zmeˈralda}}, {{lang-sdn|Monti di Mola}}, {{lang-sc|Montes de Mola}}) is a coastal area and tourist destination in northern [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]], with a length of some 20&nbsp;km, although the term originally designated only a small stretch in the commune of [[Arzachena]]. With white sand beaches, golf clubs, private jet and helicopter services and exclusive hotels, the area has drawn celebrities, business leaders and other affluent visitors. In a study released by the European [[luxury real estate]] brokerage Engel & Völkers, Costa Smeralda is the most expensive location in Europe.  House prices reach up to 30,000 euros per square meter.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Jason |last=Sheftell |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/hottest-european-luxury-residential-soaring-article-1.1328619 |title=Top residential markets in Europe soar to new heights: study |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=New York |date=April 27, 2013 |access-date=April 5, 2015}}</ref>

The main towns and villages in the area, built according to a detailed [[urban planning|urban plan]], are [[Porto Cervo]], [[Liscia di Vacca]], [[Capriccioli]] and [[Romazzino]]. [[archaeology|Archaeological]] sites include the Li Muri [[Giants' grave]]s.

Each September the Sardinia Cup [[sailing]] [[regatta]] is held off the coast. Polo matches are held between April and October at Gershan near Arzachena. Other attractions include a film festival in Tavolara and a vintage car rally.

Development of the area started in 1961, and was financed by a consortium of companies led by Prince [[Aga Khan IV|Karim Aga Khan]]. Spiaggia del Principe, one of the beaches along the Costa Smeralda, was named after this [[Isma'ilism|Ishmaelite]] prince.<ref name="CharmingSardinia">{{cite web | url=http://www.charmingsardinia.com/booksardegna/SARDINIA-Olbia-Costa%20Smeralda-Badesi.pdf | format=web | title=Guide to Olbia, Costa Smeralda, Badesi | publisher=CharmingSardinia.com |date=January 2009}}</ref> Architects involved in the project included [[Michele Busiri Vici]], [[Jacques Couëlle]], Savin Couëlle and Vietti.

The Pevero Golf Club includes an 18 hole course designed by Robert Trent Jones. The club opened in 1972 and is located on the outskirts of Port Cervo. Private memberships are available and non-members can access the course and clubhouse for a daily fee. The club has a fine restaurant, snack bar, swimming pool, golf driving range and well stocked pro shop. Lessons are also available from the local staff and there is a practice green and short game area.  The design criteria  used for the golf course did not provide for many recovery areas. Therefore, the course tends to challenge even low handicap golfers, as the fairways are narrow and lined by Mediterranean thick underbrush.  Also, windy conditions are typical as the course is on a promontory and exposed to prevailing sea breezes. The Pevero Golf Club is the only facility of its kind on the Costa Smeralda.
