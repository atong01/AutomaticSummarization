It was a result of the<space/><link><target>Bulgarian unification</target><part>unification</part></link><space/>with<space/><link><target>Eastern Rumelia</target></link>, which happened on 6 September 1885. The unification was not completely recognized, however, and one of the countries which refused to recognize the act was the<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Serbia</target></link>. The<space/><link><target>Austro-Hungarian Empire</target></link><space/>had been expanding its influence in the<space/><link><target>Balkans</target></link><space/>and was particularly opposed. Serbia also feared this would diminish its dominance in the region. In addition, Serbia's ruler<space/><link><target>Milan Obrenovi IV</target></link><space/>was annoyed that Serbian opposition leaders like<space/><link><target>Nikola Pai</target></link>, who had escaped persecution after the<space/><link><target>Timok Rebellion</target></link>, had found asylum in Bulgaria. Lured by Austria-Hungary's promises for territorial gains from Bulgaria (in return for concessions in the Western Balkans), Milan IV declared war on Bulgaria on 14 November 1885.</paragraph><paragraph>The Military strategy relied largely on surprise, as Bulgaria had moved most of its troops near the border with the Ottoman Empire, in the southeast. As it happened, the Ottomans did not intervene and the Serbian army's advance was stopped after the<space/><link><target>Battle of Slivnitsa</target></link>. The main body of the Bulgarian army traveled from the Ottoman border in the southeast to the Serbian border in the northwest to defend the capital<space/><link><target>Sofia</target></link>. After the defensive battles at Slivnitsa and<space/><link><target>Vidin</target></link>, Bulgaria began an offensive which took the city of<space/><link><target>Pirot</target></link>. At this point, the Austro-Hungarian Empire stepped in, threatening to join the war on Serbia's side if the Bulgarian troops did not retreat. Fighting lasted for only 14 days, from 14 to 28 November. A peace treaty was signed in<space/><link><target>Bucharest</target></link><space/>on 19 February 1886. No territorial changes were made to either country, but the Bulgarian unification was recognized by the Great Powers. However, the relationship of trust and friendship between Serbia and Bulgaria, built during their long common fight against Ottoman rule, suffered irreparable damage.</paragraph><heading level='3'>First Balkan War</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>First Balkan War</arg></template>The instability in the Balkan region in the early 1900s quickly became a precondition for a new war. Serbia's aspirations towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were thwarted by the<space/><link><target>Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina</target><part>Austrian annexation of the province</part></link><space/>in October 1908, and so the Serbs focused their attention onto their historic cradle, Kosovo and to the south for expansion. Greek officers,<space/><link><target>Goudi coup</target><part>revolting</part></link><space/>in August 1909, had secured the appointment of a progressive government under<space/><link><target>Eleftherios Venizelos</target></link><space/>which they hoped would resolve the<space/><link><target>History of Crete#Modern Crete</target><part>Cretan issue</part></link><space/>in Greece's favour and reverse their<space/><link><target>Greco-Turkish War (1897)</target><part>defeat of 1897 by the Ottomans</part></link>. Bulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of her independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia, also looked to districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia for expansion.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Camels on the way to Catalca, 1912.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>right</part><part>A<space/><link><target>camel</target></link><space/>caravan of the Bulgarian 17th regiment carrying supplies for the<space/><link><target>First Battle of atalca</target><part>atalca operation</part></link>, 1912</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>In March 1910, an<space/><link><target>Albanians</target><part>Albanian</part></link><space/>insurrection broke out in Kosovo. In August 1910, Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom. In 1911, Italy launched an<space/><link><target>Italo-Turkish War</target><part>invasion of Tripolitania</part></link>, which was quickly followed by the occupation of the<space/><link><target>Dodecanese</target></link><space/>Islands. The Italians' decisive military victories over the Ottoman Empire greatly influenced the Balkan states to prepare for war against Turkey. Thus in the spring of 1912, consultations between the various Christian Balkan nations resulted in a network of military alliances which became known as the<space/><link><target>Balkan League</target></link>. The Great Powers, most notably France and Austria-Hungary, reacted to this diplomatic sensation by trying to dissuade the League from going to war, but failed.</paragraph><paragraph>In late September, both the League and the Ottoman Empire mobilized their armies. Montenegro was the first to declare war, on 25 September (<link><target>Old Style</target><part>O.S.</part></link>)/ 8 October. The other three states, after issuing an impossible ultimatum to the Porte on 13 October, declared war on Turkey on 17 October. The Balkan League relied on 700,000 troops, 370,000 of which were Bulgarians.

For the latter Bulgaria had a secret agreement with Serbia to divide it between them signed at 13 March 1912 during the negotiations that led to the establishment of the Balkan League. But it was not a secret that Bulgaria's target was the fulfilment of the never materialized<space/><link><target>Treaty of San Stefano</target></link><space/>signed after the<space/><link><target>Russo-Turkish War, 187778</target></link>. They deployed their main force in Thrace, forming three armies. The<space/><link><target>First Army (Bulgaria)</target><part>First Army</part></link>, under general<space/><link><target>Vasil Kutinchev</target></link><space/>with 3 infantry divisions, was deployed to the south of<space/><link><target>Yambol</target></link>, with direction of operations along the<space/><link><target>Tundzha</target></link><space/>river. The<space/><link><target>Second Army(Bulgaria)</target><part>Second Army</part></link>, under general<space/><link><target>Nikola Ivanov</target></link>, with 2 infantry divisions and 1 infantry brigade, was deployed west of the First and was assigned to capture the strong fortress of Adrianopel (now<space/><link><target>Edirne</target></link>). According to the plans, the<space/><link><target>Third Army(Bulgaria)</target><part>Third Army</part></link>, under general<space/><link><target>Radko Dimitriev</target></link>, was deployed east of and behind the First, and was covered by the cavalry division hiding it from the Turkish view. The Third Army had 3 infantry divisions and was assigned to cross the Stranja mountain and to take the fortress of Lozengrad (<link><target>Kirk Kilisse</target></link>). The 2nd and 7th divisions were assigned independent roles, operating in<space/><link><target>Western Thrace</target></link><space/>and eastern Macedonia respectively.</paragraph><paragraph>The first great battles were at the<space/><link><target>Adrianople</target></link><space/><link><target>Kirk Kilisse</target></link><space/>defensive line, where the Bulgarian 1st and 3rd Armies (together 110,000 men) defeated the Ottoman East Army (130,000 men) near Gechkenli, Seliolu and Petra. The fortress of<space/><link><target>Adrianople</target></link><space/>was<space/><link><target>Battle of Adrianople (1913)</target><part>besieged</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Battle of Kirk Kelesse</target><part>Kirk Kilisse was taken</part></link><space/>without resistance under the pressure of the Bulgarian Third Army. The initial Bulgarian attack by First and Third Army defeated the Turkish forces, numbering some 130,000, and reached the<space/><link><target>Sea of Marmara</target></link>. But the Turks, with the aid of fresh reinforcements from the Asian provinces, established their third and strongest defensive position at the<space/><link><target>Chataldja</target></link><space/>Line, across the peninsula where<space/><link><target>Constantinople</target></link><space/>is located. New Turkish forces landed at<space/><link><target>Bulair</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>arky</target></link><space/>but after heavy fighting they were crushed and overthrown by the newly formed 4th Bulgarian army under the command of General<space/><link><target>Stiliyan Kovachev</target></link>. The offensive at<space/><link><target>Chataldja</target></link><space/>failed too. On 11 March, the final Bulgarian<space/><link><target>Battle of Adrianople (1913)</target><part>assault on Adrianople</part></link><space/>began. Under the command of General<space/><link><target>Georgi Vazov</target></link><space/>the Bulgarians, reinforced with two Serb divisions, conquered the &quot;untakable&quot; city. On 17/30 May a peace treaty was signed between Turkey and the Balkan Alliance. The First Balkan War, which lasted from October 1912 to May 1913, strengthened Bulgaria's position as a regional military power, significantly reduced Ottoman influence over the Balkans, and resulted in the formation of an independent Albanian state.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Second Balkan War</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Second Balkan War</arg></template>The peace settlement of the First Balkan War proved unsatisfactory for both Serbia and Bulgaria. Serbia refused to cede a part of the territories in Macedonia, which it occupied and promised to give to Bulgaria according to a secret agreement. Serbia, on its side, was not satisfied with the independence of Albania, and sought a secret alliance with Greece. Armed skirmishes between Serbian and Bulgarian troops occurred.</paragraph><paragraph>On 16 June 1913, just a few months after the end of the first war, the Bulgarian government ordered an attack on Serbian and Greek positions in Macedonia, without declaring war. Almost all of Bulgaria's 500,000-man standing army was positioned against these two countries, on two fronts western and southern, while the borders with Romania and the<space/><link><target>Ottoman Empire</target></link><space/>were left almost unguarded. Montenegro sent a 12,000-strong force to assist the Serbs. Exhausted from the previous war, which took the highest toll on Bulgaria, the Bulgarian army soon turned on the defensive. Romania attacked from the north and north-east, the Ottoman Empire also intervened in<space/><link><target>Thrace</target></link>. Allied numerical superiority was almost 2:1. After a month and two days of fighting, the war ended as a moral disaster for Bulgaria, in the same time its economy was ruined and the military demoralized.</paragraph><heading level='3'>First World War</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Bulgaria during World War I</arg></template><link><target>File:Nikola Todorov Zhekov.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>170px</part><part><link><target>Nikola Zhekov</target></link>, Commander-in-Chief of the Bulgarian Army during World War I</part></link>The<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Bulgaria</target></link><space/>participated in World War I on the side of the<space/><link><target>Central Powers</target></link><space/>between 15 October 1915, when the country declared war on<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Serbia</target><part>Serbia</part></link>, to 29 September 1918, when the<space/><link><target>Armistice with Bulgaria</target><part>Armistice of Thessalonica</part></link><space/>was signed. In the aftermath of the<space/><link><target>Balkan Wars</target></link>, Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the western powers, whom the Bulgarians felt had done nothing to help them. The government of<space/><link><target>Vasil Radoslavov</target></link><space/>aligned the country with<space/><link><target>German Empire</target><part>Germany</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Austria-Hungary</target></link>, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) were all in possession of lands perceived in Bulgaria as its own.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1915 Germany promised to restore the boundaries according to the<space/><link><target>Treaty of San Stefano</target></link><space/>and Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October the same year. In the First World War Bulgaria decisively asserted its military capabilities. The<space/><link><target>Battle of Doiran (1917)</target><part>second Battle of Doiran</part></link>, with general<space/><link><target>Vladimir Vazov</target></link><space/>as commander, inflicted a heavy blow on the numerically superior<space/><link><target>British army</target></link>, which suffered 12,000 casualties against 2,000 from the opposite side. One year later, during the<space/><link><target>Battle of Doiran (1918)</target><part>third battle of Doiran</part></link>, the United Kingdom, supported by Greece, once again suffered a humiliating defeat, losing 3,155 men against just about 500 for the Bulgarian side. The reputation of the<space/><link><target>French army</target></link><space/>also suffered badly. The<space/><link><target>Battle of the Red Wall</target></link><space/>was marked with the total defeat of the French forces, with 5,700 out of 6,000 men killed. The 261 Frenchmen who survived were captured by Bulgarian soldiers.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite the outstanding victories, Germany was near defeat, which meant that Bulgaria would be left without its most powerful ally. The war was already unpopular among Bulgarians themselves, as they were allied with the Muslim Ottomans against their<space/><link><target>Orthodox Christian</target></link><space/>neighbours. The<space/><link><target>February Revolution</target><part>Russian Revolution</part></link><space/>of February 1917 had a great effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities. In June Radoslavov's government resigned. In 1919 Bulgaria officially left the war with the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The army between the World Wars</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Fiat Ansaldo.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>250px</part><part>Bulgarian<space/><link><target>Fiat Ansaldo</target></link><space/>armored cars, early 1930s</part></link>The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine proved to be a severe blow for Bulgaria's military. According to the treaty, the country had no right to organize a<space/><link><target>conscription</target></link>-based military. The professional army was to be no more than 20,000 men, including internal forces and border guard. Equipping the army with tanks, submarines, bombers and heavy artillery was strictly prohibited, although Bulgaria managed to get around some of these prohibitions. Nevertheless, in the eve of World War II the Bulgarian army was still well-trained and well-equipped.</paragraph><heading level='3'>World War II</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Bulgaria during World War II</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The government of the<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Bulgaria</target></link><space/>under Prime Minister<space/><link><target>Bogdan Filov</target></link><space/>declared a position of neutrality upon the outbreak of World War II. Bulgaria was determined to observe it until the end of the war; but it hoped for bloodless territorial gains, especially in the lands with a significant Bulgarian population occupied by neighbouring countries after the<space/><link><target>Second Balkan War</target></link><space/>and World War I. However, it was clear that the central geopolitical position of Bulgaria in the Balkans would inevitably lead to strong external pressure by both World War II factions. Turkey had a<space/><link><target>non-aggression pact</target></link><space/>with Bulgaria. On 7 September 1940, Bulgaria succeeded in negotiating a recovery of<space/><link><target>Southern Dobruja</target></link><space/>with the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Craiova</target></link><space/>(see<space/><link><target>Second Vienna Award</target></link>). Southern Dobruja had been part of Romania since 1913. This recovery of territory reinforced hopes for resolving other territorial problems without direct involvement in the War. The country joined the<space/><link><target>Axis Powers</target></link><space/>in 1941, when<space/><link><target>Nazi Germany</target><part>German</part></link><space/>troops preparing to invade<space/><link><target>Yugoslavia</target></link><space/>and Greece reached the Bulgarian borders and demanded permission to pass through its territory.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:376bombgroup-bulgaria-01-jun-1944.gif</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>The<space/><link><target>Bombing of Sofia in World War II</target></link>, 1944</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>On 1 March 1941, Bulgaria signed the<space/><link><target>Tripartite Pact</target></link><space/>and Tsar<space/><link><target>Boris III of Bulgaria</target><part>Boris III</part></link><space/>officially joined the Axis bloc. After a short period of inaction, the army launched an operation against<space/><link><target>Yugoslavia</target></link><space/>and Greece. The goal of reaching the shores of the<space/><link><target>Aegean sea</target></link><space/>and completely occupying the region of Macedonia came to success. Even though Bulgaria did not send any troops to support the<space/><link><target>Operation Barbarossa</target><part>German invasion of the Soviet Union</part></link>, the Navy was involved in a number of skirmishes with the<space/><link><target>Soviet Black Sea Fleet</target></link>, which attacked Bulgarian shipping. Besides this, Bulgarian armed forces garrisoned in the Balkans battled various resistance groups. The Bulgarian government declared a token war on the United Kingdom and the United States near the end of 1941, an act which resulted in the<space/><link><target>Bombing of Sofia in World War II</target><part>bombing of Sofia</part></link><space/>and other Bulgarian cities by<space/><link><target>Allies of World War II</target><part>Allied</part></link><space/>aircraft.</paragraph><paragraph>Some communist activists managed to activate a guerrilla movement headed by the underground<space/><link><target>Bulgarian Communist Party</target></link>. A resistance movement called<space/><link><target>Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)</target><part>Otechestven front</part></link><space/>(Fatherland front, Bulgarian: ) was set up in August 1942 by the Communist Party, the<space/><link><target>Zveno</target></link><space/>movement and a number of other parties to oppose the elected government, after a number of Allied victories indicated that the Axis might lose the War. In 1943, tsar<space/><link><target>Boris III</target></link><space/>died suddenly. In the summer of 1944, after having crushed the Nazi defence around<space/><link><target>Iai</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Chiinu</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Soviet Army</target></link><space/>was approaching the Balkans and Bulgaria. On 23 August 1944, Romania quit the Axis Powers and declared war on Germany, and allowed Soviet forces to cross its territory to reach Bulgaria. On 26 August 1944, the Fatherland Front made the decision to incite an armed rebellion against the government, which led to the appointment of a new government on 2 September. Support for the government was withheld by the Fatherland Front, since it was composed of pro-Nazi circles, in a desperate attempt to hold on to power.

By the time the army had expanded to over 200,000 men with hundreds of thousands of more reserve troops. Military service was obligatory. A special<space/><link><target>defensive line</target></link>, known as the<space/><link><target>Krali Marko defensive line</target></link>, was constructed along the entire border with Turkey.

In the meantime, during the rule of<space/><link><target>Todor Zhivkov</target></link>, a significant military industrial complex was established, capable of producing armored vehicles, self-proppelled artillery, small arms and ammunition, as well as aircraft engines and spare parts. Bulgaria provided weapons and military expertise to Algeria, Yemen, Libya, Iraq, Nicaragua, Egypt and Syria. Some military and medical aid was also supplied to North Korea and<space/><link><target>North Vietnam</target></link><space/>in the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1970s the Air Force was at the apogee of its power, possessing at least 500 modern combat aircraft in its inventory. Training in the Bulgarian People's Army was exhaustive even by Soviet standards, however, it was never seen as a major force within the Warsaw Pact.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/explore/cold-war-country-information.cfm?country=Bulgaria&amp;amp;topic=Army'>Bulgaria Army</link>, nationalcoldwarexhibition.org</extension><space/>In 1989, when the<space/><link><target>Cold War</target></link><space/>was coming to its end, the army (the combined number of ground, air and naval forces) numbered about 120,000 men, most of them conscripts.

An example of bad spending plans is the large-scale purchasing of transport aircraft, while the Air Force has a severe need of new fighters (the<space/><link><target>MiG-29</target><trail>s</trail></link>, even though modernized, are nearing their operational limits). The planned procurement of 24<space/><link><target>Gowind class corvette</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>has been cancelled. As of 2009, military spending were about 1.98% of GDP. In 2010 the budget is to be only 1.3% due to the international financial crisis.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Land Forces</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Bulgarian T-72 tanks.JPEG</target><part>thumb</part><part>220px</part><part>T-72 tanks advance towards the OPFOR on an exercise</part></link></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Bulgarian Land Forces</arg></template>The Land Forces are functionally divided into<space/><bold>Deployable</bold><space/>and<space/><bold>Reserve Forces</bold>.
