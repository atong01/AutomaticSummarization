Most scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of [[folklore]], misidentification, and [[hoax]],<ref>[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], pp. 62–63.</ref> rather than a living animal, because of the lack of physical evidence and the large numbers of creatures that would be necessary to maintain a breeding population.<ref name="skepdic" /><ref name="breedingpop">{{cite web |url= http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/news/bfhunting.html |title= Bigfoot hunting |author= Earls, Stephanie |accessdate= January 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100129061319/http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/news/bfhunting.html| archivedate= January 29, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> However, a few scientists, such as [[Grover Krantz]] and [[Jeffrey Meldrum]], have focused research on the alleged creature for the greater parts of their careers, or, in the case of [[John Bindernagel]], for significant parts of it.

==Reported descriptions==

===Appearance and anatomy===
Bigfoot is described in reports as a large, hairy, muscular, bipedal ape-like creature, with adults in a range of {{convert|1.8|–|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall,<ref>Henner Fahrenbach, quoted in Murphy (2009), 151</ref> and usually estimated to weigh from {{convert|280|to|1000|lb|kg}}.<ref>("Patty", the subject of the [[Patterson film]], is estimated by Henner Fahrenbach to weigh 542 pounds.) (Henner Fahrenbach, quoted in Murphy (2009), 151); He used a formula that derives weight from estimated chest circumference.  [[John Bindernagel]] wrote, "It is not yet clear how much sexual dimorphism occurs in sasquatch regarding body size." (Bindernagel, 167. However, [[Grover Krantz]] wrote, "Most of my calculations indicate that the males are about 60 to 65 percent more massive than the females. This degree of dimorphism is much more than in humans, where males average 30 percent heavier, but it is less than in gorillas and orangs where the males weigh twice as much as the females." (Krantz, 155).</ref> It is reportedly covered in hair that is usually black, dark brown, or dark reddish.<ref name="skepdic">{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/bigfoot.html |title=Bigfoot [a.k.a. Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas, Mapinguari (the Amazon), Sasquatch, Yowie (Australia) and Yeti (Asia)] |publisher=The Skeptic's Dictionary |accessdate=August 17, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080914040152/http://skepdic.com/bigfoot.html| archivedate= September 14, 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=Sasquatch |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/524755/Sasquatch}}</ref><ref>"The coat color is almost always solid; it is never described as having shading, spots, or stripes." (Krantz, 148)</ref> "The skin, when it can be seen, is generally dark", "but sometimes light."<ref name="Green, 446"/>

Hair is described as straight and short or medium length.<ref name="Green, 446"/><ref>"Hair length ... varies from short to long, and may be smooth or shaggy. It is often longer on the head, shoulders, and arms.... Patches of bare black skin on the face and chest of Sasquatches are sometimes mentioned ..." and on "the nipple area" of a female. (Bindernagel, 38–39, 162–63) "Glen Thomas ... noted that 'the male had much longer hair on his shoulders, head, and neck, and [it] hung in strings, like you see on an [[Angora goat]].'" (Bindernagel, 165–66)</ref> Rupert Matthews noted the occasional presence of a mane, or "mantle", of hair.<ref name="ReferenceA">Matthews, Chapter 5, under the heading: "A Description of the Sasquatch"</ref>

With respect to the torso, Rupert Matthews states:<ref>in his 2008 book ''Sasquatch: North America's Enduring Mystery''</ref> "Their shoulders are wider in proportion to their height than is usual for a human and that width is maintained right down to the equally wide hips"; he characterized the chest as deep.<ref>"being almost as thick front to back as ... side to side". (Quotes from Matthews, Chapter 5, Kindle location 1526); see also, for the depth of the chest and the width of the shoulders, Green (1978), 447, and Napier, 86: "Universally commented upon are the breadth of the shoulders and the depth of the chest." [[John Willison Green|Green]] writes, "In a later letter he [Roe] added a few details.... the animal was as deep as it was wide." (Green (1978), 56) Large bellies (like those of gorillas and orangoutangs) are not reported. [[John R. Napier|John Napier]], 92–93, writes, "Frank Beebe ... made an extremely pertinent observation: Why, he asks, does a creature with a tall bony crest on its skull, as Patterson's creature clearly did, have a non-protrudent abdomen?" The many persons who have reported a Bigfoot sighting and described it as looking like the Patterson Bigfoot, and not included a protrudent abdomen as among any differences some of them have listed from it, have implicitly described it as flat-bellied. Kenneth Wylie writes telegraphically, in a table, 244: "If described, stomach usually flat, as in humans."</ref>

Matthews describes females as having "visible breasts" (unlike gorillas).<ref>Matthews, Chapter 5, Kindle location 1526</ref><ref>Re breasts, see Bindernagel, 39, 165</ref><ref name="Green, 448">Green (1978), 448, writes, "It is generally assumed that the ones that are not obviously females are males, but .... Many are seen at too great a distance to tell. There is also a possibility that only lactating females have prominent breasts."</ref> Breasts have been reported to be located lower on the chest than a human's.<ref>(Green (1978), 425) "Patty" exhibits this trait. Bill Munns, 265, writes, "Patty's breasts do sit a bit low on the chest region compared to the human norm, but ... [her] longer arms would allow for a lower breast to still easily be accessible to a nursing infant held in the arms."</ref> A lack of detail on genitalia in reports have led some to conclude they are inconspicuous.<ref>Bindernagel, 171</ref><ref>Napier wrote, 196: "One curious aspect of the Bigfoot tales ... is the almost total absence of sexuality."</ref><ref>Meldrum, 187, writes: "Albert Ostman" [said that] "the penis was ensheathed" [like] "a stallion's." Meldrum goes on to say that this is similar to the arrangement in great apes. However, [[Loren Coleman]] infers that the absence of data on genitalia in sighting accounts is the result of under-reporting due to forgetfulness, modesty, and avoidance by witnesses and interviewers, and that breast data is scanty for the same reasons. (Coleman (2003), Chapter 13, especially 197–200)</ref>

The arms are reported as long.<ref name="Green, 446">Green (1978), 446</ref><ref>Bindernagel writes, "Measurements of the sasquatch in the [[Patterson-Gimlin film]] confirm that the proportions of the sasquatch are consistent with those of other apes in that its arms are longer than its legs—the arm length of this adult female is approximately 115 percent of its leg length." "...&nbsp;whereas in humans, arm length is 80 percent of leg length." (Bindernagel, 159) (Meldrum, 158</ref> "Their hands are large and wide with stubby fingers and short thumbs that are not opposable to the fingers."<ref name="Matthews, Kindle location 1526">Matthews, Kindle location 1526</ref>

The neck is purportedly thick and so short as to be unobservable.<ref>Bindernagel, 37</ref> Claimed witnesses have described the head as being flat-faced, like a human, or exhibiting slight [[prognathism]];<ref>Bindernagel, 38, 154</ref><ref>Green (1978) writes, "In a later letter he [Roe] added a few details.... the jaws project beyond the small nose</ref> having a pronounced [[Supraorbital ridge|brow ridge]]; and having a low-set forehead with the skull behind it being noticeably higher in back than in front, culminating in a top that is rounded and crested, similar to the [[sagittal crest]] of the male [[gorilla]].<ref>Bindernagel, 157–58</ref><ref>Napier, 86, summarizes reports as describing "a backwardly sloping forehead, a flattened nose, and a slit-like, lipless mouth."</ref><ref>More details: "The size of the head indicates a brain capacity that is marginally larger than that of a gorilla." (Matthews, Kindle location 1526") Other reported features of the head are deep-set, dark eyes with no "whites" around the pupil; hair-covered, inconspicuous or invisible ears; a broad, flat nose "halfway between those of apes and humans"; mobile lips, like a chimpanzee's, that are "seldom full" (Green (1978), 446); a mouth that is wide (Green (1978), 446) and "at a level well below the tops of the shoulders (Krantz, 149); teeth that resemble humans' in shape, but are larger"—although "Large [[canine teeth]] in the [male] Sasquatch have been described by some claimed observers." (Matthews, Chapter 5, under the heading: "A Description of the Sasquatch") (Bindernagel, 168–69) (Bindernagel, Appendix 1: Details of Appearance and Anatomy, 158–63</ref>

===Locomotion, gait, and posture===

[[John Bindernagel]] describes three reported elements of Bigfoot's gait as: gracefulness and smoothness, owing to its ''bent-knee'' or ''compliant gait''; an exaggerated arm-swing; and a high [[Tibia|shank]]-lift, which "brings the sole of the foot to an almost vertical position at the end of each stride."<ref>Bindernagel, 41–42, 108</ref><ref>Bindernagel claims that shank rotation exhibits about 21 degrees of separation between a Bigfoot and a human, based on a measurement of "Patty", and that "Sasquatch trails typically show less straddle [offset to the side from print to print] than human trails". (Bindernagel, 50) (Meldrum, 223–24) Krantz, 22, writes, "Footprint trails are sometimes observed to cross unusual obstacles" and not to "appreciably shorten when when they are progressing up shallow inclines."</ref><ref>Green (1978) writes, "When they left [an encounter], there were almost as many that ran as walked." They have sometimes been reported to run alongside or behind automobiles at high speeds. Green (1978),176, 205, 215, 222, 273, 446, and 448</ref><ref>Alley, 67–68, 220</ref> [[John Willison Green|John Green]] (1978) writes, "Whether walking or running, they almost always took long steps."<ref name="Green, 446"/><ref>Gimlin stated, "She ["Patty"] averaged a forty-on-inch stride [sic—"step" meant].... She took up to a forty-six-inch stride [sic]." (Coleman (2003), 94)</ref>

[[John Bindernagel|Bindernagel]] further states that a "hunched or stooped posture" is "noted in many Sasquatch reports" . . ., with "their long arms dangling" when standing. Sasquatches have been reported crouching, squatting, and sitting.<ref>Bindernagel, 43–44</ref><ref>Claimed sighting accounts indicate that when squatting, or when rising from a squat, sasquatch do so without the use of their arms or hands. (Alley, 73, 113); in this report one observer said that the knees were turned out when squatting.</ref> "Swimming . . . appears to be an important means of locomotion, ... especially on the west coast."<ref>Bindernagel, 44–45</ref><ref>Coleman (2007), 210–13</ref>

===Claimed "sign"===
("Sign: The trail or trace of wild animals, etc."<ref>''Compact Oxford English Dictionary'' (1971), item 11d</ref> A synonym for "spoor".)

* Tracks.<ref>Murphy (2009), 116–68, contains a well-illustrated discussion of purported tracks</ref> Features of the foot have mostly been inferred from footprints. [[John Willison Green|Green]] writes, "The bottom of the foot is flat; there is no [[longitudinal arch of the foot]], nor a transverse one."<ref>Green (1978), 153</ref> The feet seem to be somewhat flexible, though not as much as those of apes.<ref>Bindernagel, 53–54, 160</ref><ref>Krantz calculates that the ankle would need to be thickened and shifted forward somewhat, relative to a human foot, to achieve maximum walking leverage with such a foot. (Krantz, 58–63, 153–54). See also some long quotes from one of Krantz's articles in Hunter and Dahinden, 168–71</ref> Fahrenbach's analysis finds the average foot length to be 15.6 inches,<ref>Murphy (2009), 148; this is of casts and on-site measurements, mostly from [[John Willison Green|John Green]]'s records</ref> with a low end of 7 inches and a high of 27.<ref>Bindernagel, 53</ref> [[Grover Krantz]] writes, "...&nbsp;for individuals of the same stature [t]he sasquatch foot is 23 percent longer than the human. It is also about one-third wider for the same length ...."<ref>Krantz, 147, fig. 63</ref><ref>Krantz writes, "The toes are more nearly equal to each other in size than are human toes." (Krantz, 151: This was: "On the basis of hundreds of recorded footprints.") The big toe ([[hallux]]) ordinarily projects forward, like a human's and unlike an ape's. (Bindernagel, 54) (Meldrum, 223, 236) However, [[John Bindernagel|Bindernagel]] writes that toes, including the big toe, can spread out considerably. (Bindernagel, 53-56; Appendix 1: Details of Appearance and Anatomy, 159–60) Bindernagel writes, "Many sasquatch tracks show the entire length of fully extended toes.... Other tracks, however, show foreshortened toes, the result of a partially curled toe position." (Bindernagel, 52) Meldrum writes that "recent enhancements to the [[Patterson-Gimlin film]], using digital color–channel separation technologies, have provided never-before-seen clarity of detail of the film subject's anatomy", revealing toes that are longer and more flexible than previously thought. (Meldrum, 243–44)</ref>
:While most casts have five toes&nbsp;— like all known apes&nbsp;— some casts of Bigfoot tracks have had numbers ranging from two to six.<ref name="SI_Radford">{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/bigfoot_at_50_evaluating_a_half-century_of_bigfoot_evidence |title=Bigfoot at 50 Evaluating a Half-Century of Bigfoot Evidence |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|date=March–April 2002|accessdate=August 17, 2008 }}</ref> Some have also contained claw marks, making it likely that a portion came from known animals such as bears, which have five toes and claws.<ref name="SI_Nickell" /><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100524154832/http://www.sdnhm.org/fieldguide/mammals/bearsign.html Bear signs], San Diego Natural History Museum.</ref>

* Broken or twisted-off saplings.<ref>[[John Bindernagel]] writes, "occasionally observed ... is a series of broken saplings or branches up to four inches in diameter, snapped or twisted off six to eight feet above the ground." (Bindernagel, 75–76)  [[John Willison Green|John Green]], relying on a UPI report, wrote about one of those cases in detail. (Green (1978), 199) Krantz described a few other cases, mostly with a skeptical tone. (Krantz, 135–36)  J. Robert Alley describes two Alaskan cases. However, he notes that other cases may be the result of the activities of moose or elk. (Alley, 252–55)</ref>  Beds, nests, bowers, and dens. Possible instances of these are described by [[John Bindernagel|Bindernagel]], Krantz, Alley, and Matthews.<ref>Beds: Bindernagel writes of three cases of beds. (Bindernagel, 68–69) Krantz writes that of the two possible beds he saw, one might be authentic. (Krantz, 138–39) Nests: Bindernagel describes beds entailing a certain amount of construction as nests. He cites two possible cases. (Bindernagel, 69)  J. Robert Alley describes four possible Alaskan nests. (Alley, 238–39, 244–47) Bowers are nests with some sort of canopy. J. Robert Alley describes one possible Alaskan instance in detail. (Alley, 239–44) His photos are reproduced in color in Murphy's ''Know the Sasquatch'', along with much of Alley's text. See Murphy (2008), 178–79.  Bindernagel describes three possible cases. (Bindernagel, 68–69) Dens involve a hollow tree or a cave. Bindernagel describes five possible cases. (Bindernagel, 70–71). Matthews discusses beds, nests, and dens (Kindle locations 1302–22)</ref>  Odor. Bigfoot is often but not always reported to have a strong, unpleasant odor by those who have claimed a close encounter.<ref>Green (1978), 444, 135–36</ref><ref>Bindernagel, 77, 181–82</ref><ref>Murphy (2008), 79</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/biology/smell.htm |title=Sasquatch Smell / Aroma / Odor / Scent |publisher=Bigfoot Encounters |accessdate=August 15, 2008 }}</ref><ref>Meldrum, 213</ref><ref>Green (1978), 444</ref><ref>[[Grover Krantz]] writes, "Some possible explanations for the rank smell are sweat glands, carrion eating, and unclean personal habits.... " (Krantz, 135–36) Gimlin said "Patty" "smelled like a 'skunk.' Patterson said it smelled like a wet dog rolling in cow manure." (Perez, 10)</ref>

===Behavioral traits===

[[John R. Napier|John Napier]] writes, "A frequent comment is that when observed, the creature stands and stares, immobile and expressionless ...."<ref>Napier, 86</ref> Behavioral traits claimed by [[John Bindernagel]] and others include that they occasionally sway slightly from side to side when standing;<ref>Bindernagel, 107</ref> that infrequently, bristling hair ([[piloerection]]) has been observed on the shoulders and neck;<ref>Bindernagel, 108, 199–200</ref><ref>Green (1980), 40</ref><ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 190, quoting Paul Freeman</ref><ref>(About which Meldrum quotes Jane Goodall to the effect that such bristling is a known behavior in chimpanzees when they are agitated (Meldrum, 183–84); he includes a picture of a bristling chimp on page 184.</ref> and that reports of them sleeping are rare – but that a face-down position appears in some accounts.<ref>Green (1980), 27</ref><ref>Bindernagel, 175–76</ref> Drinking from cupped hands, as a man would.<ref>Regal, 106</ref>

Proponents further claim that Bigfoot is [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] and mainly [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/gdb/show_FAQ.asp?id=586 |title=Physiology |publisher=Bigfoot Field Research Organization |accessdate=August 19, 2008 }}</ref>

==History==

===[[Native American (Americas)|Native American]] accounts===
Wild men stories are found among the indigenous peoples of the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast. [[Grover Krantz]] writes, "Native stories that can confidently be related to the sasquatch occur throughout the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Their distribution corresponds to the area where White Man accounts are concentrated."<ref>Krantz, 143; see also 141–43</ref> According to [[David Daegling]], the legends existed before there was a single name for the creature;<ref name="Dae04_p28">[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 28</ref> and that they differed in their details both regionally and between families in the same community; and that Similar stories of wild men are found on every continent except [[Antarctica]].<ref name="Dae04_p28" /> Ecologist [[Robert Michael Pyle|Robert Pyle]] argues that most cultures have human-like giants in their folk history: "We have this need for some larger-than-life creature."<ref name="Goodavage">{{cite web|last=Goodavage |first=Maria |title=Hunt for Bigfoot Attracts True Believers |publisher=''USA TODAY''/bz050 |date=May 24, 1996 |url=http://web.ncf.ca/bz050/HomePage.usatbf.html}}</ref> Each language had its own name for the creature featured in the local version of such legends. Many names meant something along the lines of "wild man" or "hairy man", although other names described common actions it was said to perform, ''e.g.'', eating [[clams]].<ref name="Mil07" />

Members of the [[Lummi]] tribe tell tales about ''Ts'emekwes'', the local version of Bigfoot. The stories are similar to each other in the general descriptions of ''Ts'emekwes'', but details about the creature's diet and activities differed between family stories.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rasmus|first1=Stacy M.| title=Repatriating Words: Local Knowledge in a Global Context|journal=[[American Indian Quarterly]]| date=2002|volume=26|issue=2|pages=286–307| doi=10.1353/aiq.2003.0018| jstor=4128463}}</ref>

Some regional legends contained more nefarious creatures. The ''stiyaha'' or ''kwi-kwiyai'' were a nocturnal race that children were told not to say the names of lest the monsters hear and come to carry off a person—sometimes to be killed.<ref name="Rigsby">{{cite web |last=Rigsby |first=Bruce |title=Some Pacific Northwest Native Language Names for the Sasquatch Phenomenon |publisher=Bigfoot: Fact or Fantasy? |url=http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/papers/rigsby.html |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}</ref> In 1847, [[Paul Kane]] reported stories by the native people about ''skoocooms'': a race of cannibalistic wildmen living on the peak of [[Mount St. Helens]].<ref name="SI_Nickell" /> The ''[[Skookum#monsters|skoocooms]]'' have been regarded as supernatural, rather than natural.<ref name="SI_Nickell" /><!--strikes me as POV in nature; natives do NOT see it that way; rather the natural and supernatural are one; this is an example of systemic bias; there are few indigenous sources cited in this article, only bigfoot theorists and anti-theorists-->

Less-menacing versions exist, such as the one recorded by Reverend [[Elkanah Walker]]. In 1840, Walker, a Protestant missionary, recorded stories of giants among the Native Americans living near present-day [[Spokane, Washington]]. The Indians said that these giants lived on and around the peaks of nearby mountains and stole [[salmon]] from the fishermen's nets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/classics/walker.htm |title=The Diary of Elkanah Walker |publisher=Bigfoot Encounters |accessdate=August 1, 2007 }}</ref>

The ''Sts'Ailes'' maintain, as do other indigenous peoples of the region, that the Sasquatch are very real, not legendary, and take great umbrage when it is suggested that they are mythical. According to Sts'Ailes eyewitness accounts, the Sasquatch prefer to avoid white men, and speak the "Douglas language", i.e., ''[[Lillooet language|Ucwalmicwts]]'', the language of the people at [[Port Douglas, British Columbia]] at the head of [[Harrison Lake]].<ref>[http://www.bigfootencounters.com/legends/jwburns.htm ''The Hairy Giants of British Columbia'', told by J.W.

The most notable reports include:

*'''1850s''' (late). Chris Murphy wrote, "Remarkably, the first major published report of a possible Sasquatch encounter is in a book entitled ''The Wilderness Hunter'' (1895) by [[Theodore Roosevelt]]... In his book, Roosevelt provides a very detailed account of a story he was told by a trapper named Bauman. As the story goes, Bauman's trapping companion [in Idaho] was viciously killed by a 'beast creature' that walked on two legs... By this time Bauman was an old man, so the incident he related probably took place in the late 1850s."<ref>Murphy (2009), 27</ref><ref>An edited version of Roosevelt's account is online at: http://www.bigfootencounters.com/classics/bauman.htm</ref><ref>Coleman (2003), 181–82</ref><ref>Bindernagel, 129–31, 205</ref><ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 18–22</ref><ref>Byrne, 43–46</ref> However, contrary to nearly all reports of Bigfoot teeth (see the "Appearance and Anatomy" section), he said "there were four great fang marks in the throat" of the victim.<ref>Green (2003), 15; see 14–16 for the whole account</ref>
*'''1870''': "The Wild Man of Crow Canyon." An anonymous "correspondent of the ''Antioch Ledger'' writing from Grayson" stated that he observed, from hiding, a Bigfoot visit his campfire. "It was in the image of a man, but it could not have been human." It was "joined by another—a female, unmistakably" and they both swung sticks from his campfire around "until the fire on the end had gone out." He said the first one "stood fully five feet high, and disproportionately broad and square at the foreshoulders, with arms of great length. The legs were short, and the body long. The head was small compared to the rest of the creature, and appeared to be set upon his shoulders without a neck. The whole was covered with a dark brown and cinnamon-colored hair, quite long in some parts; that on the head standing in a shock and growing close down to the eyes .... I have told this story many times since then and ... I have met one person who has seen the mysterious creatures, and a dozen who have come across their tracks...." This account was reprinted in several California newspapers at the time.<ref>Reprinted online at: http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/wildmen.htm</ref><ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 139-42</ref><ref>Green (1978), 40–43</ref><ref>Green (1980a), 5–6</ref><ref>Bord, 11–13</ref>
*'''1895''': The Winsted Wildman. ""While (Riley Smith) was stooped over picking berries, his bulldog (Ned), which is noted for its pluck, ran with a whine to him and stationed itself between his legs,' accounts from the Aug. 21, 1895 ''Winsted [Connecticut] Herald'' reported. 'A second afterward a large man, stark naked and covered with hair all over his body, ran out of a clump of bushes and, with fearful yells and cries, made for the woods at lightening [sic] speed where he soon disappeared. Selectman Smith is a powerful, wiry man and has a reputation for having lots of sand, and his bulldog is also noted for his pluck, but Riley admits that he was badly scared and his dog was fairly paralyzed with fear.' Word of Smith's tale spread throughout the little town quickly and it eventually piqued the interest of newspapers from New York and Boston. Soon after newsmen converged on Winsted — on what was then a very active rail service — to not only write about the incident, but to try and capture the wildman and bring him back to the city on a return train trip. According to [local historian] Wentworth, the gaggle of reporters were unsuccessful and all they went home with were sunburns and hangovers from the local beer. Townsfolk were scared, however, and a local posse was formed to find the mysterious creature. But like the reporters, the posse also was unsuccessful."<ref>"Winsted Wildman craze made things a little hairy", Winsted ''American-Republican'' Newspaper, July 2002, online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/wildmancraze.htm</ref> However, this tale has not held up well under the scrutiny of Brandon T. Bisceglia in a January 11, 2010 article in ''The Examiner'' titled, "The truth about the Winsted Wildman."<ref>online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/winstedwildman.htm</ref>
*'''1924''': Prospector [[Albert Ostman]] said he had been camped near [[Toba Inlet]] in [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]] when he was abducted by a Sasquatch and held captive by him and his family for up to six<ref>Byrne, 80</ref><ref>Debanet, 23</ref> days.<ref>{{Cite journal

:Portions of Patterson's lengthier taped interview are reprinted in [[John Willison Green|Green]]'s ''Sasquatch: The Apes Among Us''. [[Cryptozoologist]] Mark A. Hall pointed out that in it Beck significantly increased the ape-men's foot size (to 19 inches, on page 94), height (to eight feet, on page 95), and weight (to "six or eight hundred pounds", on page 96), from what he had told the press in earlier interviews.<ref>Mark A.

:Beck co-wrote, with his paranormalist son, a 22-page pamphlet about the event in 1967, in which he said that the creatures were mystical beings from another dimension, stating that he had experienced psychic premonitions and visions his entire life of which the apemen were only one component.<ref>Beck, Fred; told to Ronald A.

====After 1950====

*'''1955''': William Roe, a highway worker, reported that he was hiking alone up Mica Mountain near the British Columbia/Alberta border and the little town of Tete Jaune Cache.<ref>Place (1974), 108, writes that he hiked "to hunt and to poke around for a lost gold mine."</ref> He sat down when he saw a dark shape ahead of him. He described features of a female ape-like creature he claims to have observed in an affidavit. He averred that it approached within 20 feet of him and began eating leaves. It noticed him, backed away, turned, and departed, looking over its shoulder and making a "kind of whinny" at one point. He said he did not shoot it, because he thought it might be a man. Roe said he followed its tracks and some areas where it had slept. In March 1960 [[True magazine]] published [[Ivan Sanderson]]'s "A New Look At America's Mystery Giant", about the Roe encounter, and reprinted his affidavit.<ref>Online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/truemag.htm</ref><ref>Sanderson, Ch. 4, 107–11</ref><ref>Green (1978), 52–57</ref><ref>Bord, 62–66</ref><ref>Murphy, 38</ref><ref>Wasson, 12–13</ref><ref>Daniel Perez's ''Bigfoot Times'' for October 2013, page 3, included some new information: a photo of Roe taken in 1963, a citation of a little-known contemporary newspaper story on the incident, and quotations from Roe family members Perez contacted.</ref><ref>Debenat, 36, provides a photo of Mica Mountain from a nearby motel</ref> His daughter made a drawing of it under his direction. However, the drawing gives the creature long hair on the back of the head and a distinct neck, unlike what Roe had described.

*'''1975''': The [[Vancouver Sun]] reported, "on the [[Lummi]] Indian Reserve ... Bigfeet were seen more than a hundred times and the witnesses included the reserve policemen." Sightings occurred from October 2 until "a few days after" October 24. The Bigfoot Encounters site says, "The [[Lummi]] Reservation is seven miles northwest of [[Bellingham, Washington]], in the western portion of [[Whatcom County]], 95 miles north of [[Seattle]]. The reservation is a five mile long peninsula."<ref>This was reported in the ''Vancouver Sun'' of November 17 and posted online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/lummi1.htm Two other newspaper articles are online at: http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/lummi2.htm and http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/lummi3.htm</ref> "When reading these reports, we wish the police and public would carry cameras rather than guns."<ref>Bord, 142</ref>
*'''1975''': Terry Reams of [[Yakima, Washington]] was riding in an eastbound  car on December 6 with three others on I-84 just upstream of [[Bonneville Dam]] [east of [[Portland, Oregon]]]. It was 7 PM [dark in December there]. A figure running along the divider in the same direction veered into the road and the car slowed sharply. Then, he said, he had a close-up and longer-than usual sighting of a Bigfoot while it ran alongside his car.<ref>Ray Crowe, ''The Track Record'' newsletter, March 1998, online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/sbs/reams.htm.</ref> Thom Powell writes, "Terry reported his sighting to the [[Hood River County, Oregon|Hood River]] Sheriff's Office and they acknowledged that they had several other calls reporting the same event."<ref>Powell, 51–52</ref><ref>A detailed account, in Reams's own words, is quoted in Bryan K.

*'''1995''': The "Redwoods footage" was videotaped in August near [[Crescent City, California]] in the [[Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park]], near the Oregon border. The observers were the crew of Adventures television shooting an episode featuring a drive up the California coast highway ... in [[Del Norte County, California]]. A cameraman shot a 30-second video of a figure walking along a minor road, then crossing it right in front of their RV. Comments on the video can be found on the Bigfoot Encounters website, including "a BBC article and on-going comments by the late [[Richard Greenwell]], Dr. [[Jeff Meldrum]], Dave Bittner, Daniel Perez, Larry Lund and Robert Stansberry."<ref>Bobbie Short, online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/films/redwoodsfilm.htm</ref> Opinions of Bigfooters were split on its authenticity. The BBC Wildlife magazine article concluded, "In our view, there are only two hypotheses about the Sasquatch, both of which seem improbable. One is that the Sasquatch doesn't exist and the thousands of reports are spurious. The other is that a giant, non-human, bipedal primate inhabits the forests of the US [[Pacific Northwest]] and western [[Canada]] and has so far eluded conventional scientific observation. One must decide for oneself which is the less improbable of the two."
*'''1996''': "The [[Memorial Day]] video is a Hi-8mm video that is purported to show a rapidly moving Bigfoot, going from left to right. It was videotaped on May 26, 1996, by Lori Pate while on a fishing trip with family and friends at [[Chopaka Lake]], in [[Okanogan County]], north central Washington. ...

* '''2000''': The [[Marble Mountain, California]] footage shows a purported Sasquatch walking down a ridgeline about 750 yards away. It was shot in July 2000 near [[Fort Jones, California]] by the leader of a group of 15 hikers, mostly youths. Bigfooter Bobbie Short commented sarcastically on her website<ref>online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/hoaxes/marble_hoax.htm</ref> that the subject's gait was unconvincing, and posted an image analysis by M.K. Davis showing demarcation lines indicative of clothing.

===Aftermath of 1957 and 1958 events ===
In 1957, [[John Willison Green|John Green]] wrote, "The village council of [[Harrison Hot Springs]] was pondering what to do with a small grant from the government of [[British Columbia]] .... Someone suggested spending it ... to finance a sasquatch hunt.... the village councillors voted to ask the provincial Centennial Committee to ask permission to use the money in that way....<ref>Regal, 56</ref> The story that a government ... wanted to search for a monster<ref>"Footprints and Fables: John Green's Half-Century Hunt for Bigfoot" by Don Wells, ''Trek Magazine'', Issue #25: Fall 2009; online at http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_article.asp?id=609</ref> was news around the world.<ref name="Green, 50–51">Green (1978), 50–51</ref><ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 79–83</ref><ref>"Green did a story on the hunt for the ''Sun'' and the story exploded. 'I understand now—I certainly didn't then—any type of official organization taking an interest in a monster suddenly becomes a story, a huge story,' he said. News outlets from as far away as Sweden and India took an interest in the sasquatch hunt." "Seeking Sasquatch: local Bigfoot hunter John Green honoured for his 50-year quest to find the elusive biped." Paul J. Henderson, ''Chilliwack Times,'' British Columbia; online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/green.htm</ref> It also started a lot of talk around Agassiz and [[Harrison Hot Springs]] and I was quickly exposed to the fact that there were local people who took sasquatch very seriously indeed, and not all of them were Indians. [One of them] told me that he had seen enormous footprints at Ruby Creek [see the 1941 event, above], only a dozen miles away."<ref name="Green, 50–51"/><ref>Place, 105–06, writes that, in response to Sanderson's question [in 1959], "[[John Willison Green|Green]] chuckled....  [b]y a fantastic stroke of luck he learned that the family involved in the [1941] Ruby Creek encounter still lived close by.... [T]hey gladly told him their story so he could record it on tape."</ref> [[John Willison Green|Green]] then had participants in the 1941 Ruby Creek incident interviewed by himself and by a magistrate,<ref name="Green, 52"/> and published a story on it.

1957/1958 were watershed years, not just for the story of the [[Harrison Hot Springs]] hunt proposal and the two "Bigfoot-classic" stories of the Ruby Creek encounter and the discovery of Bigfoot footprints at Bluff Creek,<ref>Betty Allen published many accounts of Bigfoot activity in the Bluff Creek area in the ''Humboldt Times'' (Eureka) newspaper (Buhs, 75, writes: "The ''Humboldt Times'' featured stories about Bigfoot in eighteen issues during the month of October [1958], some of those issues carrying more than one story"  and compiled them, and other unpublished ones she collected in the early 1960s, into a self-published booklet, ''Bigfoot Diary.'' (Buhs, 79, 122–23) For a complete list of Bigfoot activity in and around the Bluff Creek area, see the screen online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/sightings.htm → "Weitchpec, Humboldt County, California" and the four page-down screens that follow it. Other sources were told of these reports. Hunter and Dahinden, 86, write: "Bob Titmus, a taxidermist, ... said that over the years he had received reports from hunters ... of giant human-like tracks, and that he had always assured them they were seeing bear tracks." For more on this matter, see the 1958 entry under the heading "After 1950", above.</ref> but also for the additional stories they triggered<ref>Regal, 59, writes: "The swift public reaction caught them all off guard. As Genzoli put it, 'it was like loosening a single stone in an avalanche.'"</ref> and the effect of that publicity on the culture that surrounds Bigfoot. In their wake:

* Three more of the Bigfoot "classics" came to light: 1) William Roe contacted the British Columbian press in 1958 with an account of his 1955 encounter;<ref>Green (1978), 52–53</ref> 2) [[Albert Ostman]] contacted the newspaper that had printed the Roe story, telling of his 1924 encounter;<ref>Green (1978), 97, 99</ref><ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 83: "The Roe story surfaced, followed shortly by the Ostman one and, gradually, others."</ref> and 3) researcher Betty Allen rediscovered the 1924 [[Ape Canyon]] apeman tale of Fred Beck.<ref>Buhs, 122–23</ref><ref>Beck was interviewed in 1966 by Roger Patterson (see Green (1978), 91–96, which quotes extensively from Patterson's taped interview). Roger Patterson printed its gist in his book, ''Do Abominable Snowmen of America Really Exist?'' along with drawings, a photo of the miners, a map, a reprint of a contemporary newspaper story on the incident, plus reprints of three newspaper stories about subsequent spooky and Bigfoot-related activity in Ape Canyon; see Patterson and Murphy, 74–85, 86–93. Beck was later interviewed by [[John Willison Green|Green]] himself. (Green (1978), 96–97)</ref>

* The December 1959 issue of ''[[True magazine]]'' carried [[Ivan Sanderson]]'s detailed account of the 1958 track finds,<ref>McLeod, 52–53</ref><ref>"The Jerry Crew Story", online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/true1959.htm</ref> which ignited interest in the topic among its many readers, including Roger Patterson.<ref>McLeod, 22, 57, 91</ref><ref>Regal, 70</ref> In 1961, [[Ivan Sanderson]] followed up with his encyclopedic ''Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life'', a worldwide survey of accounts of Bigfoot-type creatures, including recent track finds, etc., in the Bluff Creek area.<ref name="McLeod, 56–57">McLeod, 56–57</ref> It inspired Roger Patterson to compile a collection of sighting reports and track finds into his 1966 book, ''Do Abominable Snowmen of America Really Exist?''<ref>McLeod, 22, 57</ref> Sanderson's book sold well<ref>Buhs, 108: "His ''Abominable Snowmen''—despite a hefty $7.50 price tag  ... —sold fifteen thousand copies in five years."</ref> and he appeared on the [[Johnny Carson]] [[Tonight Show]].<ref name="McLeod, 56–57"/>
* [[John Willison Green|John Green]] published his influential collections of encounters, ''On the Track of the Sasquatch'' (1968)<ref>Regal, 60</ref> and ''Year of the Sasquatch'' (1970),<ref>Regal, 91; it was subsequently re-titled ''Encounters with Bigfoot''.</ref> both of which sold so well<ref>Green "estimates that he has sold close to 250,000 copies" of all his books.

* Rupert Matthews wrote that the printing and broadcasting of those reports in turn "encouraged people who had encountered the creature or its footprints to come forward more readily to talk to the newspapers, or to supply information to one or other of the new breed of researchers. This contributed to the massive increase in the numbers of reports being made ...."<ref>Rupert Matthews, ''Sasquatch: North America's Enduring Mystery'' (2008/2014), Arcturus Publishing, Chapter 2, after the heading "Practical Joker", Kindle Location 508</ref><ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 65–66: "The hundreds of reports that are now on record are there largely through Dahinden's persistent searching.

Pages 83–84 reiterate those points.</ref> To collect these reports and make them better known, George Haas started the first Bigfoot newsletter, the influential ''Bigfoot Bulletin'', in 1969.<ref>Buhs, 169–74</ref><ref>Coleman (2003), 226–27</ref><ref>Haas is profiled in ''Sasquatch Apparitions'' (Wasson, 37–41).</ref> Buhs wrote, "The only way to receive a subscription was to submit something in exchange—a citation, an idea, a report from the field."<ref>Buhs, 171</ref>"Subscribers to the ''Bigfoot Bulletin'' combed through old newspapers ....

==Proposed explanations for sightings==
Various types of creatures have been suggested to explain both the sightings and what type of creature Bigfoot would be. The scientific community typically attributes sightings to either hoaxes or misidentification of known animals and their tracks. While [[Cryptozoology|cryptozoologists]] generally explain Bigfoot as an unknown ape, some attribute the phenomenon to [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] or other [[paranormal]] causes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/scenes_from_a_bigfoot_conference |last=Boston |first=Rob |title=Scenes from a Bigfoot Conference |publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=December 2003 |accessdate=August 19, 2008 }}</ref><ref>Murphy (2009), 294–99</ref><ref>Bord, 104–05, 134, 152, 156, 172, 177, 182, 210</ref><ref>Buhs, 155, 157, 196–99, 217–21, 233, 253</ref><ref>Daegling, 20, 195–99</ref><ref>Powell, 173</ref><ref>Loxton and Prothero, 321</ref><ref>Guttilla, passim</ref><ref>Rob Riggs (2001).

===Misidentification===

====General====
Some people interpret an ambiguous shape or sound as a Bigfoot. [[John Willison Green|John Green]] writes, "There have been numerous instances of people wanting to have seen something definite and indulging in wishful thinking. Some of them can be pretty convincing ...."<ref>Green (1973), 47</ref> [[Daniel Loxton]] writes, "Even if we were to grant that humans, bears, and Sasquatch look dissimilar, the simple fact remains that people make whoppingly huge misidentification errors all the time.... [and] given that everyone in North America is exposed to the idea that Bigfoot might exist, the vast number of animal sightings virtually guarantees that tales about encounters with Sasquatches will emerge—even in a world without Sasquatches."<ref>Loxton and Prothero, 58–59</ref>

====Bears, and bear tracks====
A study published in for the [[Journal of Biogeography]] in 2009 by J.D. Lozier et al. used ecological niche modeling on reported sightings of Bigfoot, using their locations to infer Bigfoot's preferred ecological parameters. They found a very close match with the ecological parameters of the [[American black bear]], ''Ursus americanus'', "sightings of which are thought to be sometimes confused as Bigfoot encounters (Meldrum, 2007)." They continue, "Although it is possible that Sasquatch and ''U. americanus'' share such remarkably similar bioclimatic requirements, we nonetheless suspect that many Bigfoot sightings are, in fact, of black bears."<ref name="Lozier2009">{{cite journal|last1=Lozier|first1=J. D.|last2=Aniello|first2=P.|last3=Hickerson|first3=M. J.|title=Predicting the distribution of Sasquatch in western North America: anything goes with ecological niche modelling|journal=Journal of Biogeography|date=September 2009|volume=36|issue=9|pages=1623–1627|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02152.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02152.x/full}}</ref>

However, Bigfoot proponents disagree. [[Jeff Meldrum]] writes, "Dr. [[Lynn Rogers]], [a] bear biologist ... considers the chances of mistaking a bear sighting for a sasquatch possible, but unlikely for a knowledgeable observer." Unlike Sasquatches, "Bears ... rarely walk for more than a few steps .... Their gait is usually halting ... and their forelimbs do not alternately swing with each step, but instead are held out forward in front of the body."  They also have "prominent rounded ears atop their heads, long snouts, sloping shoulders ... and short legs."<ref>Meldrum, 204–05</ref> [[John Bindernagel]] considers that misidentification "is most unlikely in the case of sightings or encounters lasting more than one or two seconds."<ref>Bindernagel, 29; 28–32</ref>

Continuing, [[Meldrum]] writes, "in fact, it should be considered that the very opposite may more likely be the case. The initial reaction of many eyewitnesses to a possible sasquatch sighting is to rationalize the experience by assuming they have simply seen a bear."<ref>Meldrum, 204</ref> Similarly, [[John Bindernagel|Bindernagel]] writes, "sasquatches typically move about in a crouch or stooped position when foraging. For this reason they are frequently mistaken for bears until they stand ...."<ref>Bindernagel, 43</ref>

[[File:Croped BFRO image.jpg|thumb|A 2007 photo of an unidentified animal the Bigfoot Research Organization claims is a "juvenile Sasquatch"<ref name=debate>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfro.net/avevid/jacobs/jacobs_photos.asp|title= Jacobs Photos |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref>]]

In 2007, the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]] said that photos the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization said showed a juvenile Bigfoot were of a bear with [[mange]].<ref name = "ap_bigfoot">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490638/Is-Bigfoot---bear-bad-skin.html|title=Is this Bigfoot ... or is it a bear with bad skin?|publisher=[[Mail Online]]|date=October 30, 2007 |accessdate=August 16, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21518056/ |title=Hunter's pics revive lively Bigfoot debate |publisher=MSNBC |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> [[Jeffrey Meldrum]], on the other hand, said the limb proportions of the suspected juvenile in question were not bear-like, and stated that he felt they were "more like a chimpanzee."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthfiles333.com/earthfiles/Episode27mp3.html |title=Young Sasquatch? '&#39;Earthfiles Podcast 10-31-07'&#39; |publisher=Earthfiles333.com |date=October 31, 2007 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref>

Turning to bear ''tracks'', [[Meldrum]] writes, "Bruce Marcot, a wildlife ecologist in Portland, Oregon, has maintained a web page illustrating [the] line of reasoning" that "'some, maybe many tracks of Bigfoot ... are probably tracks of large wildlife—most likely bears that are simply enlarging their own tracks by sliding, by overstepping, or by having their tracks enlarged by weather effects.'" [[Meldrum]] responds that "the 'fit' ... quickly falls apart when the aforementioned details<ref>Meldrum, 206–09</ref> such as absolute size, toe proportions, heel shape, claw marks, pads, and so on, are carefully examined."<ref>Meldrum, 209–10</ref> [[John Willison Green|John Green]] argues similarly.<ref>Green (1978), 81–82</ref>

===Bigfoot hoaxes===
<!-- {{Redirect|bigfoot hoaxes (disambiguation)}} -->

====In general====
Both Bigfoot believers and non-believers agree that many of the sightings are hoaxes or misidentified animals.<ref name="SI_Radford" /> Bigfooter Bobbie Short's site lists about two dozen suspect cases,<ref>online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/hoaxes.htm</ref> and Bigfooter Diane Stocking criticizes a half-dozen.<ref>online at http://www.stockinghominidr.com/Hoaxes---Misidents.html</ref>
 
Bigfooter [[John Willison Green|John Green]] offers this observation: "I feel quite sure that the preceding sections of this chapter contain some [sighting reports] that aren't true. The reason for this is the great interest created by Roger Patterson's movie [the [[Patterson–Gimlin film|PGF]]], which hundreds of thousands of people have seen and millions must have read about." Presumably things have gotten worse since the release of ''[[The Legend of Boggy Creek]]'' and the free availability of the [[Patterson film]], and other Bigfoot images and stories, on the Internet.

[[John Willison Green|Green]] continues in this vein, but ends on a positive note: "Until the end of 1967 it was a rare thing to investigate a Sasquatch report that did not turn out to have something to it. From 1968 on I have found that is no longer the case. There have been half a dozen people who have told elaborate stories that ultimately collapsed from their own weight. Some less elaborate deceptions have presumably passed undetected, and while many of us have our suspicions we may be suspecting the wrong ones."

"Lest that sound unduly discouraging, bear in mind  ... [that] if Sasquatches are to be wished back into the books of mythology, every last one of those reports has to be wrong."<ref>Green (1973), 47–48</ref>

Regarding non-sighting evidence, Brian Regal contends, "No super cunning or technical expertise is needed by a faker of evidence. All they need to do is throw something together and let their audience do the rest."<ref>Regal, 139</ref>

* An 1884 newspaper report of an apelike creature captured near [[Yale, British Columbia]] was the basis of this story.<ref>Place (1974), 81–85</ref> [[Loren Coleman]] explained in 2003 how the [[Jacko hoax|Jacko Affair]] achieved its popularity: "During the 1950s, a news reporter named Brian McKelvie ... found ...the ... article about Jacko.... McKelvie shared the Jacko account with researchers [[John Willison Green|John Green]] and [[René Dahinden]]. McKelvie told them that this was the only record of the event due to a fire that had destroyed other area newspapers at the time.... The story's appearance in [[Ivan T. Sanderson]]'s 1961 ''Abominable Snowman: Legend Come to Life''<ref>It comes at the start of Chapter 2: "Ubiquitous Woodsmen: Reports from Canada (1860 to 1920)"; pages 62–67 in the edition listed in Sources</ref> propelled the Jacko story into history...." Subsequently, [[Jerome Clark]] <ref>Regal, 164</ref> says that research by [[John Willison Green|John Green]] found that two contemporary British Columbia newspapers regarded the alleged capture as very dubious, Clark notes that the ''Mainland Guardian'' of [[New Westminster]], [[British Columbia]] wrote, "Absurdity is written on the face of it."<ref>{{cite book |page=195 |last=Clark |first=Jerome |title=Unexplained! 347 Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences and Puzzling Physical Phenomena |publisher=Visible Ink |year=1993 |isbn=0-8103-9436-7}}</ref> "[[John Willison Green|Green]] ... wrote of[f] the Jacko story as a piece of probable journalistic fiction in ''Pursuit'' ... in 1975." But by then the story had taken on a life of its own.<ref>Coleman (2003), 40–42</ref><ref>See also Green (1978), 85–88</ref>
* In January 1969, while Bigfooters were in [[Bossburg, Washington]] in the wake of Ivan Marx's [[cripplefoot]] track find there,<ref>Regal, 88</ref> they were approached by Joe Metlow, a prospector. He told them that he had a Bigfoot immobilized in an abandoned mine shaft, and that he had sold it. The Bigfooters said that they "would top your best offer", and a bidding war ensued. Metlow declined to give anyone a peek for $1000. Bids topped out at $55,000, which called his bluff, and interest fizzled when he wouldn't bite. He then claimed that he had a Sasquatch foot in his freezer, which started another bidding war. Again, he was evasive, changed his story, and ducked out of a trip to have potential buyers view it. At this point "it was obvious to the Sasquatch squads that they'd been had."<ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 153–59</ref>
* Ivan Marx phoned [[René Dahinden]] on October 1970 and said, "I've got a film of the cripple[foot Bigfoot]." Bigfooters flocked to his hometown of [[Bossburg, Washington]], near the Canadian border. After viewing his film, nearly all were convinced of its authenticity and a bidding war for rights ensued. However, [[Pangboche Hand|Peter Byrne]] paid attention to a couple of children who had been saying that they knew where the film had been shot. When he arrived there, he discovered that the features of the site were inconsistent with what Marx had claimed about the circumstances of the filming and the height of the subject. Subsequent investigation turned up more red flags, and belief in the film evaporated.<ref>Hunter & Dahinden, 159–63</ref> [[Pangboche Hand|Peter Byrne]] wrote a detailed account of the episode,<ref>online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/hoaxes/marx_footage.htm</ref> as did [[Michael McLeod]].<ref>McLeod, 119–28</ref><ref>An uncredited pro-Marx and pro-film article with a lot of biographical information is online at  http://www.bigfootencounters.com/films/marx-photos.htm</ref>
* The [[Museum of Hoaxes]] writes that, in 1976 "Cherie Darvell was a member of a film crew searching for Bigfoot in the woods outside [[Eureka, California]]. Unfortunately for her, she found Bigfoot and he abducted her. Or so she claimed. [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]] organized a search party to find her, but without success. (Total cost for the search: $11,613. Humboldt County tried to sue [[Shasta County]] to make them pay a portion of the cost, but a judge struck down their suit, ruling that the search for Bigfoot had been an 'exercise in futility.') A few days later, Darvell walked into [Bluff Creek Resort], looking none the worse for wear, despite her experience as a Bride of Bigfoot. When reporters tried to ask her questions about her ordeal, her only response was to scream. Her fellow filmmakers, Ed Bush and Terry Gaston, later released a movie showing her being carried away by Bigfoot. It crossed the minds of a few people that the 'abduction' had been simply an elaborate publicity stunt."<ref>http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/bride_of_bigfoot</ref><ref>Place (1978), 65</ref>
* In May 1977 a bus driving from [[Harrison Hot Springs, British Columbia]] to [[Vancouver]]  stopped after a man in a [[gorilla suit]] ran across the road. The driver exited and gave chase into the forest, thinking it was a hoax—as did a passenger, who shouted after it, "You're not fooling us!" Thomas Steenberg wrote, "I have studied photos of the costume they used and I still can't see how anyone with any sense was fooled by it."<ref>Thomas Steenberg, ''Bigfoot/Sasquatch: The continuing mystery'' (1993) (Original title, ''The Sasquatch in [[Alberta]]'' (1990)). pp. 90–91</ref> However, the driver claimed his "initial anger turned to awe, then to fright, as he gazed at the beast, which he described as being about seven feet tall and weighing 350 pounds" and noticed a "horrible smell" "from about a twenty-five-foot distance." "But 24-year-old Ken Ticehurst, who wore the [[gorilla suit]], was only 5-foot-11 and weighed 165 pounds."<ref name="hoaxes.org">http://hoaxes.org/archive/display/category/bigfoot</ref> The police were convinced by "thirteen footprints in a hard sand creek bed .... All the prints differed slightly from each other", which they photographed. Radio stations spread the news and "before the day was out" "more than a thousand people [arrived] to view the evidence." One of them was [[René Dahinden]], who was "suckered in." After suspicions emerged, "The result was an appearance of the four hoaxers on a radio show and a complete ... description of their coup." It involved a clever laying-down of sophisticated tracks beforehand, a roadside parked car with a [[walkie-talkie]] to alert the mime to the approach of the bus, and a passenger aboard the bus to make a fuss when he sighted the mime.<ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 185–89</ref><ref>online at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/canadianhoax.htm</ref><ref>Place (1978), 16–28</ref>
* Rupert Matthews writes, "In October 1985 the [[Pennsylvania]] police force arrested a man [from Enola] and charged him with wasting police time. He had been in the habit of dressing up in a [[gorilla suit]] and then going out at night to prance alongside remote rural roads, scaring passers-by."<ref>Matthews, Introduction, Kindle location 78</ref> He did so "after seeing a local newspaper story about residents who were noticing a foul odor and screeching noises emanating from the wooded area, the chief said."<ref name="hoaxes.org"/>
* [[Grover Krantz]] described an amusing, clever footprint-track-in-snow hoax that made it appear as though a Sasquatch had ascended a 20-degree slope while maintaining eight-foot steps. "It was later found out that ... he wore fake feet that were put on ''backwards'' and he ran down the slope."<ref>Krantz, 41–42</ref>
* On July 14, 2005, [[Tom Biscardi]], a long-time Bigfoot enthusiast and CEO of Searching for Bigfoot Inc., appeared on the ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' paranormal radio show and announced that he was "98% sure that his group will be able to capture a Bigfoot which they have been tracking in the [[Happy Camp, California]] area."<ref name="Biscardi_C2C">{{cite web|url= http://www.oregonbigfoot.com/georgia_bigfoot_dead_body_in_freezer_dyer_whitton_biscardi.php |title= Georgia Bigfoot body in freezer |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref> A month later, Biscardi announced on the same radio show that he had access to a captured Bigfoot and was arranging a [[pay-per-view]] event for people to see it. Biscardi appeared on ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' again a few days later to announce that there was no captive Bigfoot. Biscardi blamed an unnamed woman for misleading him and the show's audience for being gullible.<ref name="Biscardi_C2C" />
* The Sonoma video was a hoax in which magicians [[Penn and Teller]] were involved and which they exposed as such on their cable TV Showtime series ''Bulls**t'' on April 24, 2006.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0794951/</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr-Yl_Sa0Jo</ref> It was intended to test Bigfooters' gullibility. Bigfooter Kathy Strain wrote, "The Sonoma video first made its appearance on November 18, 2005. [According to the hoax storyline,] Mark Nelson was out hiking with his girlfriend near [[Lake Sonoma]] [California] on November 14, 2005 and videotaped a bigfoot..."

* On July 9, 2008, [[Rick Dyer]] and Matthew Whitton posted a video to [[YouTube]] claiming that they had discovered the body of a dead Sasquatch in a forest in northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

===''Gigantopithecus''===
[[File:Gigantopithecus blacki mandible 010112.jpg|250px|thumb|Fossil jaw of ''Gigantopithecus blacki'', an extinct primate]]
Bigfoot proponents [[Grover Krantz]] and [[Geoffrey H. Bourne]] believed that Bigfoot could be a [[relict (biology)|relict population]] of ''[[Gigantopithecus]]''. According to Bourne, all ''Gigantopithecus'' fossils were found in Asia, and, as many species of animals migrated across the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]], it is not unreasonable to assume that ''Gigantopithecus'' might have as well.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gentle Giants: The Gorilla Story |last=Bourne |first=Geoffrey H. |author2=Cohen, Maury |year=1975 |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |isbn=0-399-11528-5 |page=296 }}</ref> [[Jeffrey Meldrum]], another Bigfoot devotee, has said that the fossil remains of an ancient giant ape called ''Gigantopithecus'' could turn out to be ancestors of today's commonly known Bigfoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=When Legend Meets Science: A Scientific analysis to the Sasquatch – or Bigfoot – debate|last=Meldrum |first=Jeffrey |authorlink=Jeffrey Meldrum |year=2006 |publisher=Johnson Books |isbn= 0-7653-1216-6 |pages=89–106}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isu.edu/~meldd/fxnlmorph.html |title= Evaluation of Alleged Sasquatch Footprints and their Inferred Functional Morphology |accessdate=October 18, 2010 }}</ref>

''Gigantopithecus'' fossils have not been found in the Americas. The only recovered fossils are of [[mandible]]s and teeth, leaving uncertainty about ''Gigantopithecus's'' locomotion. Krantz has argued, based on his extrapolation of the shape of its mandible, that ''[[Gigantopithecus|Gigantopithecus blacki]]'' could have been bipedal. However, the relevant part of mandible is not present in any fossils.<ref>[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 14</ref> An alternative view is that ''Gigantopithecus'' was [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]], and it has been said that ''Gigantopithecus's'' enormous mass would have made it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait.

Matt Cartmill presents another view regarding the ''Gigantopithecus'' hypothesis: "The trouble with this account is that ''Gigantopithecus'' was not a hominin and maybe not even a [[crown group]] hominoid; yet the physical evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted [[hallux]]. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that ''Gigantopithecus'' would have evolved these uniquely [[hominini|hominin]] traits in parallel."<ref>[[#Car08|Cartmill 2008]], p. 117</ref>

Bernard G. Campbell wrote: "That ''Gigantopithecus'' is in fact extinct has been questioned by those who believe it survives as the Yeti of the Himalayas and the Sasquatch of the north-west American coast. But the evidence for these creatures is not convincing."<ref>{{cite book |title=Humankind Emerging |last=Campbell |first=Bernard G.|year=1979 |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |id=Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 78-78234 |page=100 |isbn=0-673-52170-2 }}</ref>

===Extinct hominidae===
A species of ''[[Paranthropus]]'', such as ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'', with its crested skull and bipedal gait, was suggested by [[Primatology|primatologist]] [[John R. Napier]] and anthropologist Gordon Strasenburg as a possible candidate for Bigfoot's identity,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/REF/scinafaq.htm |title=Scientific Names for Bigfoot |last=Coleman |first=Loren |publisher=BFRO |accessdate=August 19, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080909091922/http://www.bfro.net/REF/scinafaq.htm| archivedate= September 9, 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> despite the fact that fossils of ''Paranthropus'' are found only in Africa.

Michael Rugg,<ref name="Murphy 2009, 256–57">Murphy (2009), 256–57</ref> of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum, presented a comparison between human, ''Gigantopithecus'' and ''[[Meganthropus]]'' skulls (reconstructions made by [[Grover Krantz]]) in episodes 131 and 132 of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootdiscoveryproject.com/media.php |title=Bigfoot Discovery Project Media |accessdate=April 4, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100419030214/http://www.bigfootdiscoveryproject.com/media.php| archivedate= April 19, 2010 | deadurl= no}} {{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> He favorably compares a modern tooth suspected of coming from a Bigfoot to the ''Meganthropus'' fossil teeth, noting the worn enamel on the [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] surface. The ''Meganthropus'' fossils originated from Asia, and the tooth was found near [[Santa Cruz, California]].

Some suggest [[Neanderthal]], ''[[Homo erectus]]'', or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' to be the creature, but no remains of any of those species have been found in the [[Americas]].<ref>[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 16</ref>

==Scientific view==
The evidence that does exist supporting the survival of such a large, prehistoric ape-like creature has been attributed to hoaxes or delusion rather than to sightings of a genuine creature.<ref name="skepdic" /> In a 1996 ''[[USA Today]]'' article, Washington State zoologist John Crane said, "There is no such thing as Bigfoot. No data other than material that's clearly been fabricated has ever been presented."<ref name="Goodavage"/>

In addition, scientists cite the fact that Bigfoot is alleged to live in regions unusual for a large, nonhuman primate, i.e., temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere; all recognized apes are found in the [[tropics]] of Africa and Asia.<ref>Wylie, 247: "Among apes dispersal is limited by the tropical forest habitat."</ref><ref>Daegling, 16</ref> As with other proposed megafauna cryptids, climate and food supply issues would make such a creature's survival in reported habitats unlikely.<ref>Wylie, 103–10</ref><ref>Daegling, 17</ref><ref name="Sjögren, Bengt 1980">{{cite book |author= Sjögren, Bengt |title= ''Berömda vidunder'' |publisher= Settern |year= 1980 |isbn= 91-7586-023-6|language=sv}}</ref> Great apes have not been found in the fossil record in the Americas, and no Bigfoot remains are known to have been found.<ref>Wylie, 247: "There's no evidence that any kind of ape ever evolved in, or migrated to, the Nearctic or Neotropic Region (N. and S. America."</ref> The breeding population of such an animal would be so large that it would account for many more purported sightings than currently occur, making the existence of such an animal an almost certain impossibility.<ref name="breedingpop"/><ref>Wylie, 248</ref> Skeptic Kenneth Wylie has published, in boiled-down, tabular form, a comprehensive, nine-page "comparison between Bigfoot 'data' and various relevant bionomic facts."<ref>Wylie, 243–51</ref>

There have been a limited number of formal scientific studies of Bigfoot. Evidence such as the 1967 [[Patterson–Gimlin film]] has provided "no supportive data of any scientific value."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G3z5VVbGfbgC&pg=PA221&dq=pyle+bigfoot+-inauthor:pyle#v=onepage&q=scientific&f=false|title=Bigfoot exposed: an anthropologist examines America's enduring legend|author=[[David Daegling|David J.

===Formal studies===
* In 1970, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] funded a field study seeking Bigfoot evidence. It was headed by "a flamboyant Floridian named Robert Morgan".<ref>McLeod, 125</ref><ref>George Harrison, "On the Trail of Bigfoot", ''National Wildlife'', October–November 1970</ref> Morgan is profiled in Chris Murphy's ''Know the Sasquatch''<ref>Murphy (2009), 240–41</ref> and in ''Cryptozoology A to Z''.<ref>Coleman and Clark, 171–72</ref> No formal federation members were involved and the study made no notable discoveries.<ref>Bourne, Geoffrey H, ''The Gentle Giants: The Gorilla Story'' 1975, ISBN 0-399-11528-5, p. 295</ref>
* The first scientific study of available evidence was conducted by [[John R. Napier|John Napier]] and published in his book, ''Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality,'' in 1973.<ref>Napier, John. ''Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality.'' 1973, ISBN 0-525-06658-6, p. 197</ref> Napier wrote that if a conclusion is to be reached based on scant extant "'hard' evidence", science must declare "Bigfoot does not exist."<ref>Napier, 197</ref> However, he found it difficult to entirely reject thousands of alleged tracks, "scattered over 125,000 square miles" or to dismiss all "the many hundreds" of eyewitness accounts. Napier concluded, "I am convinced that Sasquatch exists, but whether it is all it is cracked up to be is another matter altogether. There must be ''something'' in north-west America that needs explaining, and that something leaves man-like footprints."<ref>Napier, 205</ref>
* Beginning in the late 1970s, physical anthropologist [[Grover Krantz]] published several articles<ref>Two foot-related papers of Krantz's are online: "Anatomy of the Sasquatch Foot", ''Northwest Anthropological Research Notes'' 6(1) (Spring 1972), at http://woodape.org/index.php/about-bigfoot/articles/91-anatomy-of-the-sasquatch-foot and "Anatomy and Dermatoglyphics of Three Sasquatch Footprints", ''Cryptozoology'', 2, 1983, 53-81, at http://woodape.org/index.php/about-bigfoot/articles/90-anatomy-and-dermatoglyphics-of-three-sasquatch-footprints</ref> and one book-length treatment of Sasquatch.<ref>The latter was published as ''Big Footprints'' in 1992; an expanded edition with an Addendum was published as ''Bigfoot Sasquatch Evidence'' in 1999.</ref> Critics objected that he had certified a phony cast as authentic; that he had gone against scientific practice by conditionally assigning a scientific name for Bigfoot; and that he had been unable to get major scientific journals to accept his papers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buhs|first=Joshua Blu|title=Bigfoot: The Life and Times of a Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RI4SlHwH7h0C&pg=PA227|accessdate=November 10, 2014|date=August 1, 2009|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-50215-1|page=227}}</ref><ref>Additional criticisms are leveled in Brian Regal's ''Searching for Sasquatch'', especially in chapter 4, "The Life of Grover Krantz", pages 81–104.</ref>

* In the first ever systematic genetic analysis of 30 hair samples which were suspected to be from bigfoot, yeti, sasquatch, almasty or other anomalous primates, none was found to be primate in origin except that one sample was identified to be human. A joint study by [[University of Oxford]] and [[Musée Cantonal de Zoologie|Lausanne's Cantonal Museum of Zoology]] and published in the [[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] in 2014, the team used a previously published cleaning method to remove all surface contamination and the [[ribosomal]] [[mitochondrial DNA]] 12S fragment of the sample was sequenced and then compared to [[GenBank]] to identify the species origin. The samples submitted were from different parts of the world, including the United States, Russia, the Himalayas, and Sumatra. Other than one sample of human origin, all but two are from common animals. Black and brown bear accounted for most of the samples, other animals include cow, horse, dog/wolf/coyote, sheep, goat, raccoon, porcupine, deer and tapir. The last two samples matched a fossilized genetic sample of a 40,000 year old polar bear of the [[Pleistocene]] Epoch.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sykes|first1=B|last2=Mullis|first2=R|last3=Hagenmuller|first3=C|last4=Melton|first4=T|last5=Sartori|first5=M|title=Genetic analysis of hair samples attributed to yeti, bigfoot and other anomalous primates|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=281|issue=1789|pages=|date=July 2, 2014|publisher=The Royal Society|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.0161}}</ref>

==Popular culture==
{{main|Bigfoot in popular culture}}
In 1951, [[Eric Shipton]] photographed what he described as a [[Yeti]] footprint,<ref name="missingLinks" /> which generated considerable attention and led to the story of the Yeti entering popular consciousness. The notoriety of ape-men grew over the decade. [[Loren Coleman]] describes "The Changing Image of Bigfoot" in popular culture, mainly in movies and TV documentaries, in Chapter 14 of his ''Bigfoot!: The True Story of Apes in America''.<ref>Coleman (2003), 201–15</ref>

As Bigfoot has become better known and a [[Bigfoot in popular culture|phenomenon in popular culture]], sightings have spread throughout North America. In addition to the Pacific Northwest, the [[Great Lakes region]] and the [[Southern United States]] have had many reports of Bigfoot sightings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/GDB/ |title=Geographical Database of Bigfoot/Sasquatch Sightings & Reports |publisher=[[BFRO]] |accessdate=April 10, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228213753/http://www.bfro.net/GDB/| archivedate= February 28, 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The debate over the legitimacy of Bigfoot sightings reached a peak in the 1970s, and Bigfoot has been regarded as the first widely popularized example of pseudoscience in American culture.<ref name="McLeod 2009 4">{{cite book|title=Anatomy of a Beast: Obsession and Myth on the Trail of Bigfoot|last=McLeod|first=Michael|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-25571-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6FmjJYd13wC&pg=PA4|page=4|year=2009|location=Berkeley}}</ref>

Bigfoot has had a demonstrable impact as a [[popular culture]] phenomenon. It has "become entrenched in American popular culture and it is as viable an icon as [[Michael Jordan]]" with more than forty-five years having passed since reported sightings in California, and neither an animal nor "a satisfying explanation as to why folks see giant hairy men that don't exist."<ref>[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 4.</ref>
