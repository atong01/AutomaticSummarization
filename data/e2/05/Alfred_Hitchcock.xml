I have a strongly visual mind. I visualise a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score ... When you finish the script, the film is perfect.

While this exasperated some writers, others admitted the director inspired them to do their very best work. Hitchcock often emphasised that he took no screen credit for the writing of his films. However, over time the work of many of his writers has been attributed solely to Hitchcock's creative genius, a misconception he rarely went out of his way to correct. Notwithstanding his technical brilliance as a director, Hitchcock relied on his writers a great deal.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Steven DeRosa,<space/><italics>Writing with Hitchcock</italics>, New York: Faber and Faber, 2001, p. xi.</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Storyboards and production</heading><paragraph>According to the majority of commentators, Hitchcock's films were extensively storyboarded to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the<space/><link><target>viewfinder</target></link>, since he did not need to, though in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternate takes to consider.<link><target>File:Alfred Hitchcock by Jack Mitchell.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>left</part><part>Alfred Hitchcock</part></link>However, this view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by the book<space/><italics>Hitchcock at Work</italics>, written by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of<space/><italics><link><target>Cahiers du cinma</target></link></italics>. Krohn, after investigating several script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock alongside inspection of storyboards, and other production material, has observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned. He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his movies, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. A great example would be the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of<space/><italics>North by Northwest</italics><space/>which was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.</paragraph><paragraph>Even when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's extensive analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like<space/><italics>Notorious</italics><space/>reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of<space/><italics>The Man Who Knew Too Much,</italics><space/>whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including<space/><italics><link><target>Strangers on a Train (film)</target><part>Strangers on a Train</part></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>Topaz (1969 film)</target><part>Topaz</part></link></italics>. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his movies, he was fully cognizant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions.</paragraph><paragraph>Krohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternate takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how he/she chooses (often under the producer's aegis). Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency of giving himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock.</paragraph><paragraph>His fastidiousness and attention to detail also found its way into each<space/><link><target>film poster</target></link><space/>for his films.

Hitchcock simply did not tolerate the<space/><link><target>Method acting</target><part>method</part></link><space/>approach, as he believed that actors should only concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. In a<space/><italics><link><target>Sight and Sound</target></link></italics><space/>interview, he stated that, 'the method actor is OK in the theatre because he has a free space to move about.

It may have been made ... when we used actors who were simultaneously performing in stage plays. When they had a matinee, and I suspected they were allowing themselves plenty of time for a very leisurely lunch. And this meant that we had to shoot our scenes at breakneck speed so that the actors could get out on time. I couldn't help feeling that if they'd been really conscientious, they'd have swallowed their sandwich in the cab, on the way to the theatre, and get there in time to put on their make-up and go on stage.

His<space/><link><target>irony</target></link>-tinged voice and signature droll delivery, gallows humour, iconic image and mannerisms became instantly recognisable and were often the subject of parody.</paragraph><paragraph>The title-sequence of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of Hitchcock's profile (he drew it himself; it is composed of only nine strokes), which his real silhouette then filled.
