==Biography==
Arabian Prince started working with [[Bobby Jimmy & the Critters]] in 1984. He also produced the hit single and album for [[JJ Fad]], "Supersonic."

He was a founding member of [[N.W.A]] but when fellow member [[Ice Cube]] came back from the Phoenix Institute of Technology in 1988, Arabian Prince found himself to be surplus to the band—[[Eazy-E]], Ice Cube and [[MC Ren]] were the main performers, [[DJ Yella]] was the [[turntablist]] and [[Dr. Dre]] was the main producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/whatever-happened-to-nwas-posse-2164896|title=Whatever Happened to N.W.A's Posse?|author=Martin Cizmar|work=L.A. Weekly|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref>

After leaving N.W.A, Arabian Prince began his solo career.<ref name="youtube1"/> His first solo album ''Brother Arab'' was released in 1989, although it sold poorly. He continued his solo career and released his fourth album ''Where's My Bytches'' in 1993, which was his last album of the 1990s.

In the mid-2000's, he started releasing music again, with his Professor X project on the Dutch label Clone records. In 2007, he performed as a DJ on the 2K Sports Holiday Bounce Tour with artists from the [[Stones Throw]] label. In 2008, Stones Throw released a compilation of his electro-rap material from the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stonesthrow.com/arabianprince/ |title=Arabian Prince &#124; Stones Throw Records |publisher=Stonesthrow.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15}}</ref> One of his songs was included on the 2007 video game, ''[[College Hoops 2K8]]''.
