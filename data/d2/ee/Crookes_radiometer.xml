This heat loss through the glass keeps the internal bulb temperature steady so that the two sides of the vanes can develop a temperature difference. The white or silver side of the vanes are slightly warmer than the internal air temperature but cooler than the black side, as some heat conducts through the vane from the black side. The two sides of each vane must be thermally insulated to some degree so that the silver or white side does not immediately reach the temperature of the black side.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg></arg><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template><space/>If the vanes are made of metal, then the black or white paint can be the insulation.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg></arg><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template><space/>The glass stays much closer to ambient temperature than the temperature reached by the black side of the vanes.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg></arg><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template><space/>The higher external air pressure helps conduct heat away from the glass.</paragraph><paragraph>The air pressure inside the bulb needs to strike a balance between too low and too high. A strong vacuum inside the bulb does not permit motion, because there are not enough air molecules to cause the air currents that propel the vanes and transfer heat to the outside before both sides of each vane reach thermal equilibrium by heat conduction through the vane material. High inside pressure inhibits motion because the temperature differences are not enough to push the vanes through the higher concentration of air: there is too much air resistance for &quot;eddy currents&quot; to occur, and any slight air movement caused by the temperature difference is damped by the higher pressure before the currents can &quot;wrap around&quot; to the other side.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Movement with black-body radiation</heading><paragraph>When the radiometer is heated in the absence of a light source, it turns in the forward direction (i.e. black sides trailing). If a person's hands are placed around the glass without touching it, the vanes will turn slowly or not at all, but if the glass is touched to warm it quickly, they will turn more noticeably. Directly heated glass gives off enough infrared radiation to turn the vanes, but glass blocks much of the far-infrared radiation from a source of warmth not in contact with it. However, near-infrared and visible light more easily penetrate the glass.</paragraph><paragraph>If the glass is cooled quickly in the absence of a strong light source by putting ice on the glass or placing it in the freezer with the door almost closed, it turns backwards (i.e. the silver sides trail). This demonstrates black-body radiation from the black sides of the vanes rather than black-body absorption. The wheel turns backwards because the net exchange of heat between the black sides and the environment initially cools the black sides faster than the white sides. Upon reaching equilibrium, typically after a minute or two, reverse rotation ceases. This contrasts with sunlight, with which forward rotation can be maintained all day.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Explanations for the force on the vanes</heading><paragraph>Over the years, there have been many attempts to explain how a Crookes radiometer works:</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>Crookes incorrectly suggested that the force was due to the<space/><link><target>radiation pressure</target><part>pressure of light</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="first">William<space/></arg><arg name="last">Crookes<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink">William Crookes<space/></arg><arg name="date">1 January 1874<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/164/501.full.pdf+html<space/></arg><arg name="doi">10.1098/rstl.1874.0015<space/></arg><arg name="title">On Attraction and Repulsion Resulting from Radiation<space/></arg><arg name="journal">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London<space/></arg><arg name="volume">164<space/></arg><arg name="pages">501–527</arg></template>.</extension><space/>This theory was originally supported by<space/><link><target>James Clerk Maxwell</target></link>, who had predicted this force. This explanation is still often seen in leaflets packaged with the device. The first experiment to test this theory was done by<space/><link><target>Arthur Schuster</target></link><space/>in 1876, who observed that there was a force on the glass bulb of the Crookes radiometer that was in the opposite direction to the rotation of the vanes. This showed that the force turning the vanes was generated inside the radiometer. If light pressure were the cause of the rotation, then the better the vacuum in the bulb, the less air resistance to movement, and the faster the vanes should spin. In 1901, with a better vacuum pump,<space/><link><target>Pyotr Nikolaevich Lebedev</target><part>Pyotr Lebedev</part></link><space/>showed that in fact, the radiometer only works when there is low pressure gas in the bulb, and the vanes stay motionless in a hard vacuum.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2014</arg></template><space/>Finally, if light pressure were the motive force, the radiometer would spin in the opposite direction, as the<space/><link><target>photon</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>on the shiny side being reflected would deposit more momentum than on the black side where the photons are absorbed. The actual pressure exerted by light is far too small to move these vanes, but can be measured with devices such as the<space/><link><target>Nichols radiometer</target></link>.</listitem><listitem>Another incorrect theory was that the heat on the dark side was causing the material to outgas, which pushed the radiometer around. This was effectively disproved by both Schuster's and Lebedev's experiments.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">October 2013</arg></template></listitem><listitem>A partial explanation is that gas<space/><link><target>molecule</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>hitting the warmer side of the vane will pick up some of the heat, bouncing off the vane with increased speed. Giving the molecule this extra boost effectively means that a minute pressure is exerted on the vane. The imbalance of this effect between the warmer black side and the cooler silver side means the net pressure on the vane is equivalent to a push on the black side, and as a result the vanes spin round with the black side trailing. The problem with this idea is that while the faster moving molecules produce more force, they also do a better job of stopping other molecules from reaching the vane, so the net force on the vane should be exactly the same the greater temperature causes a decrease in local density which results in the same force on both sides. Years after this explanation was dismissed,<space/><link><target>Albert Einstein</target></link><space/>showed that the two pressures do not cancel out exactly at the edges of the vanes because of the temperature difference there.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2014</arg></template><space/>The force predicted by Einstein would be enough to move the vanes, but not fast enough.</listitem><listitem>The final piece of the puzzle,<space/><link><target>thermal transpiration</target></link>, was theorized by<space/><link><target>Osborne Reynolds</target></link><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="first">Osborne<space/></arg><arg name="last">Reynolds<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink">Osborne Reynolds<space/></arg><arg name="date">1 January 1879<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/170/727.full.pdf+html<space/></arg><arg name="doi">10.1098/rstl.1879.0078<space/></arg><arg name="title">On certain dimensional properties of matter in the gaseous state …<space/></arg><arg name="journal">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London<space/></arg><arg name="volume">170<space/></arg><arg name="pages">727–845</arg></template>; Part 2.</extension><space/>in an unpublished paper that was refereed by Maxwell, who then published his own paper which contained a critique of the mathematics in Reynolds's unpublished paper.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="first">J.

The vanes of a typical Crookes radiometer are not porous, but the space past their edges behaves like the pores in Reynolds's plate. On average, the gas molecules move from the cold side toward the hot side whenever the pressure ratio is less than the square root of the (absolute) temperature ratio. The pressure difference causes the vane to move, cold (white) side forward due to the tangential force of the movement of the rarefied gas moving from the colder edge to the hotter edge.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Usenet Physics FAQ"></extension></listitem></list><heading level='2'>All-black light mill</heading><paragraph>To rotate, a light mill does not have to be coated with different colors across each vane.
