The dispute lead to open warfare, and in September Boniface appointed Landolfo to the command of his army, to put down the revolt of Landolfo's own Colonna relatives. By the end of 1298 Landolfo had captured<space/><link><target>Colonna</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Palestrina</target></link><space/>and other towns and razed them to the ground.

While the two managed to apprehend the Pope and Sciarra reportedly slapped the pope in the face in the process, which was accordingly dubbed the &quot;Outrage of Anagni&quot;.
