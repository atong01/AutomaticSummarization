Such titles are used in publicly and privately held for-profit<space/><link><target>corporation</target><trail>s</trail></link>. In addition, many<space/><link><target>non-profit</target></link><space/>organizations, educational institutions,<space/><link><target>partnership</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and<space/><link><target>sole proprietorship</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>also confer corporate titles.</paragraph><paragraph>The highest-level executives in<space/><link><target>senior management</target></link><space/>usually have titles beginning with &quot;chief&quot; and are therefore usually called &quot;C-level&quot; or part of the &quot;C-suite&quot;. The traditional three such officers are<space/><link><target>chief executive officer</target></link><space/>(CEO),<space/><link><target>chief operations officer</target></link><space/>(COO), and<space/><link><target>chief financial officer</target></link><space/>(CFO). Depending on the management structure, C-titles may exist instead of or are blended/overlapped with other traditional executive titles, such as<space/><italics><link><target>President (corporate title)</target><part>president</part></link></italics>, various designations of<space/><italics>vice presidents</italics><space/>(e.g. VP of marketing), and<space/><italics>general managers</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>directors</italics><space/>of various divisions (such as director of marketing); the latter may or may not imply membership of the<space/><italics>board of directors</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>Certain other prominent C-level positions have emerged, some of which are sector-specific. For example, CEO and<space/><link><target>chief risk officer</target></link><space/>(CRO) positions are often found in many types of financial services companies. Technology companies of all sorts now tend to have a<space/><link><target>chief technology officer</target></link><space/>(CTO) to manage technology development. A<space/><link><target>chief information officer</target></link><space/>(CIO) oversees IT (information technology) matters, either in companies that specialize in IT or in any kind of company that relies on it for supporting infrastructure.</paragraph><paragraph>Many companies now also have a<space/><link><target>chief marketing officer</target></link><space/>(CMO), particularly mature companies in competitive sectors, where brand management is a high priority. In creative/design industries, there is sometimes a<space/><link><target>chief creative officer</target></link><space/>(CCO), responsible for keeping the overall look and feel of different products consistent across a brand. A<space/><link><target>chief administrative officer</target></link><space/>may be found in many large complex organizations that have various departments or divisions. Additionally, many companies now call their top diversity leadership position the<space/><link><target>chief diversity officer</target></link><space/>(CDO). However, this and many other nontraditional and/or lower-ranking C-level titles (see below) are not universally recognized as corporate officers, and they tend to be specific to particular organizational cultures or the preferences of employees.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Variations</heading><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">February 2012</arg></template>There are considerable variations in the composition and responsibilities of corporate titles.</paragraph><paragraph>Within the corporate office or corporate center of a company, some companies have a chairman and CEO as the top-ranking executive, while the number two is the president and COO; other companies have a president and CEO but no official deputy. Typically, C-level managers are &quot;higher&quot; than vice presidents, although many times a C-level officer may also hold a vice president title, such as executive vice president and CFO. The board of directors is technically not part of management itself, although its chairman may be considered part of the corporate office if he or she is an executive chairman.</paragraph><paragraph>A corporation often consists of different businesses, whose senior executives report directly to the CEO or COO. If organized as a<space/><link><target>Division (business)</target><part>division</part></link><space/>then the top manager is often known as an executive vice president (for example, Todd Bradley, who used to head the Personal Systems Group in<space/><link><target>Hewlett-Packard</target></link>). If that business is a<space/><link><target>subsidiary</target></link><space/>which has considerably more independence, then the title might be chairman and CEO (for example,<space/><link><target>Philip I. Kent</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Turner Broadcasting System</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Time Warner</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>In many countries, particularly in<space/><link><target>Europe</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Asia</target></link>, there is a separate<space/><link><target>Board of directors</target><part>executive board</part></link><space/>for day-to-day business and<space/><link><target>supervisory board</target></link><space/>(elected by shareholders) for control purposes. In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between<space/><link><target>management</target></link><space/>by the executive board and<space/><link><target>governance</target></link><space/>by the supervisory board. This seemingly allows for clear lines of authority. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political<space/><link><target>Cabinet (government)</target><part>cabinet</part></link><space/>from the management<space/><link><target>civil service</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In the United States and other countries that follow a single-board corporate structure, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the European/Asian supervisory board, while the functions of the executive board may be vested either in the board of directors or in a separate committee, which may be called an operating committee (J.P.

The CEO is also often the chairman of the board, especially in closely held corporations and also often in public corporations.
