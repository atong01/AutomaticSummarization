{{Business administration}}

'''Corporate titles''' or '''business titles''' are given to company and organization officials to show what duties and responsibilities they have in the organization. Such titles are used in publicly and privately held for-profit [[corporation]]s. In addition, many [[non-profit]] organizations, educational institutions, [[partnership]]s, and [[sole proprietorship]]s also confer corporate titles.

The highest-level executives in [[senior management]] usually have titles beginning with "chief" and are therefore usually called "C-level" or part of the "C-suite". The traditional three such officers are [[chief executive officer]] (CEO), [[chief operations officer]] (COO), and [[chief financial officer]] (CFO). Depending on the management structure, C-titles may exist instead of or are blended/overlapped with other traditional executive titles, such as ''[[President (corporate title)|president]]'', various designations of ''vice presidents'' (e.g. VP of marketing), and ''general managers'' or ''directors'' of various divisions (such as  director of marketing); the latter may or may not imply membership of the ''board of directors''.

Certain other prominent C-level positions have emerged, some of which are sector-specific. For example, CEO and [[chief risk officer]] (CRO) positions are often found in many types of financial services companies. Technology companies of all sorts now tend to have a [[chief technology officer]] (CTO) to manage technology development. A [[chief information officer]] (CIO) oversees IT (information technology) matters, either in companies that specialize in IT or in any kind of company that relies on it for supporting infrastructure.

Many companies now also have a [[chief marketing officer]] (CMO), particularly mature companies in competitive sectors, where brand management is a high priority. In creative/design industries, there is sometimes a [[chief creative officer]] (CCO), responsible for keeping the overall look and feel of different products consistent across a brand. A [[chief administrative officer]] may be found in many large complex organizations that have various departments or divisions. Additionally, many companies now call their top diversity leadership position the [[chief diversity officer]] (CDO). However, this and many other nontraditional and/or lower-ranking C-level titles (see below) are not universally recognized as corporate officers, and they tend to be specific to particular organizational cultures or the preferences of employees.

==Variations==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
There are considerable variations in the composition and responsibilities of corporate titles.

Within the corporate office or corporate center of a company, some companies have a chairman and CEO as the top-ranking executive, while the number two is the president and COO; other companies have a president and CEO but no official deputy. Typically, C-level managers are "higher" than vice presidents, although many times a C-level officer may also hold a vice president title, such as executive vice president and CFO. The board of directors is technically not part of management itself, although its chairman may be considered part of the corporate office if he or she is an executive chairman.

A corporation often consists of different businesses, whose senior executives report directly to the CEO or COO. If organized as a [[Division (business)|division]] then the top manager is often known as an executive vice president (for example, Todd Bradley, who used to head the Personal Systems Group in [[Hewlett-Packard]]). If that business is a [[subsidiary]] which has considerably more independence, then the title might be chairman and CEO (for example, [[Philip I. Kent]] of [[Turner Broadcasting System]] in [[Time Warner]]).

In many countries, particularly in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], there is a separate [[Board of directors|executive board]] for day-to-day business and [[supervisory board]] (elected by shareholders) for control purposes. In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board. This seemingly allows for clear lines of authority. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] from the management [[civil service]].

In the United States and other countries that follow a single-board corporate structure, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the European/Asian supervisory board, while the functions of the executive board may be vested either in the board of directors or in a separate committee, which may be called an operating committee (J.P. Morgan Chase),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/magazine/ina-drew-jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Susan | last=Dominus | title=Ina Drew, Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan Chase's $6 Billion Mistake | date=2012-10-03}}</ref> management committee (Goldman Sachs), executive committee ([[Lehman Brothers]]), or executive council ([[Hewlett-Packard]]), composed of the division/subsidiary heads and C-level officers that report directly to the CEO.

===United States===

State laws in the United States traditionally required certain positions to be created within every corporation, such as [[President (corporate title)|president]], [[Company secretary|secretary]] and [[treasurer]]. Today, the approach under the [[Model Business Corporation Act]], which is employed in many states, is to grant companies discretion in determining which titles to have, with the only mandated organ being the [[board of directors]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Model Business Corporation Act|url=http://users.wfu.edu/palmitar/ICBCorporations-Companion/Conexus/ModelBusinessCorporationAct.pdf|accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref>

Some states that do not employ the MBCA continue to require that certain offices be established. Under the law of [[Delaware]], where most large US corporations are established, stock certificates must be signed by two officers with titles specified by law (e.g. a president and secretary or a president and treasurer).<ref>{{cite web|title=Delaware General Corporation Law § 158|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc05/index.shtml|accessdate=19 December 2013|quote=Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the chairperson or vice-chairperson of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.}}</ref> Every corporation incorporated in [[California]] must have a chairman of the board or a president (or both), as well as a secretary and a chief financial officer.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Corporations Code § 312|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=corp&group=00001-01000&file=300-318|accessdate=19 December 2013|quote=A corporation shall have a chairman of the board or a president or both, a secretary, a chief financial officer and such other officers with such titles and duties as shall be stated in the bylaws or determined by the board and as may be necessary to enable it to sign instruments and share certificates.}}</ref>

[[Limited liability company|LLC]]-structured companies are generally run directly by their members (shareholders), but the members can agree to appoint officers such as a CEO, or to appoint "managers" to operate the company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=George|title=Does an LLC Have to Have a President or CEO?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/llc-president-ceo-17385.html|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref>

American companies are generally led by a [[chief executive officer]] (CEO). In some companies, the CEO also has the title of [[president]]. In other companies, the president is responsible for internal management of the company while the CEO is responsible for external relations. Many companies also have a [[chief financial officer]] (CFO), [[chief operating officer]] (COO) and other "C-level" positions that report to the president and CEO. The next level of middle management may be called [[vice president]], [[Director (business)|director]] or [[Management|manager]], depending on the company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lowe|first=Keith|title=The Relevance of Employee Titles|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/48776|accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref>

===Britain and Commonwealth===

In British English, the title of [[managing director]] is generally synonymous with that of chief executive officer.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is MANAGING DIRECTOR?|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/managing-director/|publisher=The Law Dictionary|accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref> Managing directors do not have any particular authority under the Companies Act in the UK, but do have [[implied authority]] based on the general understanding of what their position entails, as well as any authority expressly delegated by the board of directors.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Powers of a Managing Director|url=http://www.jordanslawforbusiness.co.uk/articles/the-powers-of-a-managing-director|publisher=Jordans|accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref>

===Japan and South Korea===

In [[Japan]], corporate titles are roughly standardized across companies and organizations; although there is variation from company to company, corporate titles within a company are always consistent, and the large companies in Japan generally follow the same outline.<ref name=Whitehill1991>{{cite book|title=Japanese management: tradition and transition|author=Arthur Murray Whitehill|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1991|isbn=<!--0-415-02253-3-->978-0-415-02253-8|page=113}}</ref>  These titles are the formal titles that are used on business cards.<ref name=Kopp2000>{{cite book|page=172|title=The rice-paper ceiling: breaking through Japanese corporate culture|author=Rochelle Kopp|publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]], Inc.|year=2000|isbn=<!--1-880656-51-5-->978-1-880656-51-8}}</ref> Korean corporate titles are similar to those of Japan, as the [[South Korean]] corporate structure had been influenced by the Japanese model.<ref>{{cite web|author=Meg Ulrich |url=http://www.business-in-asia.com/koreabiztips.html |title=Businesstips |publisher=Business in Asia |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}</ref>

Legally, Japanese and Korean companies are only required to have a board of directors with at least one representative director.{{cn|date=August 2015}} In Japanese, a company director is called a ''torishimariyaku'' (取締役) and the representative director is called a ''daihyo torishimariyaku'' (代表取締役). The equivalent Korean titles are ''isa'' (이사, 理事) and ''daepyo-isa'' (대표이사, 代表理事). These titles are often combined with lower titles, e.g. ''senmu torishimariyaku'' or ''jomu torishimariyaku'' for Japanese executives who are also board members.<ref name=LazerRynn1990 /><ref name=Condon1984 /> Most Japanese companies also have [[statutory auditor]]s, who operate alongside the board of directors in a supervisory role.

The typical structure of executive titles in large companies includes the following:<ref name=LazerRynn1990>{{cite book|title=International business handbook|volume=1|series=Haworth series in international business|author=William Lazer and Midori Rynn|chapter=Japan|editor=Vishnu H.

The top management group, comprising ''jomu''/''sangmu'' and above, is often referred to collectively as "senior management" (幹部 or 重役; ''kambu'' or ''juyaku'' in Japanese; ''ganbu'' or ''jungyŏk'' in Korean).

Some Japanese and Korean companies have also adopted American-style C-level titles, but these are not yet widespread and their usage varies. For example, although there is a Korean translation for [[chief operating officer]] (''최고운영책임자, choego unyŏng chaegimja''), not many companies have yet adopted it with an exception of a few multi-national companies such as [[Samsung]] and [[CJ Corporation|CJ]], while the [[chief financial officer]] title is often used alongside other titles such as ''bu-sajang'' (SEVP) or ''Jŏnmu'' (EVP).

Since the late 1990s, many Japanese companies have introduced the title of ''shikko yakuin'' (執行役員) or "officer," seeking to emulate the separation of directors and officers found in American companies. In 2002, the statutory title of ''shikko yaku'' (執行役) was introduced for use in companies that introduced a three-committee structure in their board of directors. The titles are frequently given to ''bucho'' and higher-level personnel. Although the two titles are very similar in intent and usage, there are several legal distinctions: ''shikko yaku'' make their own decisions in the course of performing work delegated to them by the board of directors, and are considered managers of the company rather than employees, with a legal status similar to that of directors. ''Shikko yakuin'' are considered employees of the company that follow the decisions of the board of directors, although in some cases directors may have the ''shikko yakuin'' title as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=執行役／執行役員　Operating Officer|url=http://www.nri.co.jp/opinion/r_report/m_word/archive2/sikkouyakuin.html|publisher=[[Nomura Research Institute]]|accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Suzuki|first=Kengo|title=執行役と執行役員の異同|url=http://www.kengosuzuki.com/archive/entries/200810/28post-40.html|accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref>

The CEO is also a visionary, often leaving day-to-day operations to the president, COO or division heads. Other corporate officers such as the COO, CFO, CIO, and division heads report to the CEO. The CEO is also often the chairman of the board, especially in closely held corporations and also often in public corporations. Recently, though, many public companies have been separating the roles of chairman and CEO to improve corporate governance. President and CEO is a popular combination if there is a separate chairman.
* [[Chief executive manager]] or CEM ([[United States of America|United States]]). The CEM of a [[Limited liability company]] is the highest ranking management person of an LLC and has final decisions over the day-to-day operations and of an LLC.

* [[Chief operating officer]] or COO/ director of operations for the nonprofit sector &ndash; high-level corporate officer with responsibility for the daily operation of the company; reports to the ''CEO''.

* [[Chief performance officer]]
* [[Chief privacy officer]]
* [[Chief process officer]] or CPO
* [[Chief procurement officer]] or CPO
* [[Chief product officer]] or CPO &ndash; responsible for all product-related matters. Usually includes product conception and development, production in general, innovation, project and product management.

* [[Chief technology officer]] or CTO (sometimes chief technical officer) &ndash; high-level corporate officer responsible for the company's technology/R&D direction. Now common in both IT/software and other technological fields as well, the focus on this position is typically overseeing the development of technology ''to be commercialized''. (For an IT company, the subject matter would be similar to the CIO's, however the CTO's focus is technology for the firm to ''sell'' versus technology used for facilitating the firm's own operations.)
* [[Chief visionary officer]]
* [[Chief web officer]]

===Senior management===
*[[Chairman|Chairman of the board]] &ndash; presiding officer of the corporate board of directors. The Chairman influences the board of directors, which in turn elects and removes the officers of a corporation and oversees the human, financial, environmental and technical operations of a corporation.
**The CEO may also hold the title of [[chairman]], resulting in an executive chairman. In this case, the board frequently names an independent member of the board as a lead director.
**Executive chairman &ndash; the chairman's post may also exist as an office separate from that of CEO, and it is considered an executive chairman if that titleholder wields influence over company operations, such as [[Steve Case]] of [[AOL Time Warner]] and [[Douglas Flint]] of [[HSBC]]. In particular, the group chairmanship of HSBC is considered the top position of that institution, outranking the chief executive, and is responsible for leading the board and representing the company in meetings with government figures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8019235/HSBC-investors-against-Michael-Geoghegan-becoming-chairman.html |title=HSBC investors against Michael Geoghegan becoming chairman |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2010-09-22|accessdate=2011-12-31 |location=London |first1=Harry |last1=Wilson |first2=Sean |last2=Farrell |first3=Philip |last3=Aldrick}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/business/hsbc-chief-michael-geoghegan-to-quit-after-failing-to-get-top-job/story-e6frfm1i-1225928665163 |title=HSBC chief Michael Geoghegan 'to quit' after failing to get top job |publisher=News.com.au |date=2010-09-24 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> Prior to the creation of the group management board in 2006, HSBC's chairman essentially held the duties of a chief executive at an equivalent institution, while HSBC's chief executive served as the deputy. After the 2006 reorganization, the management cadre ran the business, while the chairman oversaw the controls of the business through compliance and audit and the direction of the business.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8212815/HSBC-ex-chief-Michael-Geoghegan-relaxes-as-another-marathon-looms.html |title=HSBC ex-chief Michael Geoghegan relaxes as another marathon looms |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2010-12-20|accessdate=2011-12-31 |location=London |first=Damian |last=Reece}}</ref>
**Non-executive chairman &ndash; also a separate post from the CEO, unlike an executive chairman, a non-executive chairman does not interfere in day-to-day company matters. Across the world, many companies have separated the roles of chairman and CEO, often resulting in a non-executive chairman, saying that this move improves corporate governance.
* [[Chief of Staff]] is a corporate director level manager who has overall responsibility for the staff activity within the company who often would have responsibility of hiring and firing of the highest level managers and sometimes directors. They can work with and report directly to managing directors and the chief executive officer.
*[[Commissioner]]
*[[Comptroller|Financial Control Officer]], FCO or FC, also Comptroller or Controller &ndash; supervises accounting and financial reporting within an organization
* Director or member of the [[board of directors]] &ndash; high-level official with a fiduciary responsibility of overseeing the operation of a corporation and elects or removes officers of a corporation; nominally, ''directors'', other than the ''chairman'' are usually not considered to be employees of the company ''per se'', although they may receive compensation, often including benefits; in publicly held companies. A ''board of directors'' is normally made up of members (''directors'') who are a mixture of corporate officials who are also management employees of the company ([[inside director]]s) and persons who are not employed by the company in any capacity ([[outside director]]s or [[non-executive director]]s). In privately held companies, the ''board of directors'' often only consists of the statutory corporate officials, and in ''sole proprietorship'' and ''partnerships'', the board is entirely optional, and if it does exist, only operates in an advisory capacity to the owner or ''partner''s. Non-profit corporations are governed by a ''board of trustees'' instead of a ''board of directors''
* [[Director (business)|Director]] &ndash; a manager of managers within an organization who is often responsible for a major business function and who sometimes reports to a vice president (note that in some financial services companies the title vice president has a different meaning). Often used with name of a functional area; ''finance director'', ''director of finance'', ''marketing director'', and so on. Not to be confused with a ''member of the board of directors'', who is also referred to as a ''director''. Usually denotes the lowest executive level within a company, except in the banking industry.  Alternatively, a manager of managers is often referred to as a "senior manager' or as an "associate vice president", depending upon levels of management, and industry type.
* Fellow &ndash; In a dual career ladder organization a fellow is often a very senior technical position and is equal to a director or VP
* [[President (corporate title)|President]] &ndash; legally recognized highest "titled" corporate officer, and usually a member of the board of directors. There is much variation; often the CEO also holds the title of president, while in other organizations if there is a separate CEO, the president is then second highest-ranking position. In such a case the president is often the COO and is considered to be more focused upon daily operations compared to the CEO, who is supposed to be the visionary. If the corporate president is not the COO (such as [[Richard Parsons (businessman)|Richard Parsons]] of Time Warner from 1995–2001), then many division heads report directly to the CEO themselves, with the president taking on special assignments from the CEO.
* [[Secretary]] or [[company secretary]] &ndash; legally recognized "titled" corporate officer who reports to the board of directors and is responsible for keeping the records of the board and the company. This title is often concurrently held by the ''treasurer'' in a dual position called ''secretary-treasurer''; both positions may be concurrently held by the ''CFO''. Note, however, that the ''Secretary'' has a reporting line to the board of directors, regardless of any other reporting lines conferred by concurrent titles.
* [[Secretary-treasurer]] &ndash; in many cases, the offices of ''Secretary'' and ''Treasurer'' are held by the same person. In this case, the position is commonly referred to by the combined title ''Secretary-Treasurer''
* [[Treasurer]] &ndash; legally recognized corporate officer entrusted with the fiduciary responsibility of caring for company funds. Often this title is held concurrently with that of ''secretary'' in a dual role called ''secretary-treasurer''. It can also be held concurrently with the title of ''CFO'' or fall under the jurisdiction of one, though the CFO tends to oversee the finance department instead, which deals with accounting and audits, while the treasurer deals directly with company funds. Note, however, that the ''treasurer'' has a reporting line to the board of directors, regardless of any other reporting lines conferred by concurrent titles.
* [[Statutory agent]]
* [[Superintendent (disambiguation)|Superintendent]]
* [[Owner]] (sometimes proprietor or sole proprietor, for [[sole proprietorship]]s)
* [[Partner (business rank)|Partner]] &ndash; Used in many different ways. This may indicate a co-owner as in a legal partnership or may be used in a general way to refer to a broad class of employees or temporary/contract workers who are often assigned field or customer service work. Associate is often used in a similar way.
* Principal &ndash; may refer to an owner of the business or a high-level technical worker such as Principal Engineer or Principal Scientist. The Principal title is often used in [[dual career ladder]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sun.com/syw/entry/career_ladders_at_sun |title=Dual Ladder Career Path at Sun (Whiteboard infinity) |publisher=Blogs.sun.com |date=2005-12-15 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> organizations and may be equivalent to manager or director.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projectpartners.com/resources/prineng.html |title=Principal Engineer—ASCE Definition of Classification |publisher=Projectpartners.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}</ref>
* Vice Chair or [[Vice Chairman]] &ndash; officer of the board of directors who may stand in for the ''chairman'' in his/her absence. However, this type of vice chairman title on its own usually has only an advisory role and not an operational one (such as [[Ted Turner]] at Time Warner).<ref>{{cite web |first= James | last= Welsh|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/ustv/news/a10201/ted-turner-quits-as-aoltw-vice-chairman.html |title=Ted Turner quits as AOLTW Vice Chairman |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2003-01-29 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> An unrelated definition of ''vice chair'' describes an executive who is higher ranking or has more seniority than ''executive vice president''. Sometimes, EVPs report to the vice chair, who in turn reports directly to the CEO (so vice chairs in effect constitute an additional layer of management), other vice chairs have more responsibilities but are otherwise on an equal tier with EVPs. Executive vice chairman are usually ''not'' necessarily on the board of directors. [[Royal Bank of Canada]] previously used vice chair in their inner management circle until 2004 but have since renamed them as ''group head''.

===Middle management===
* Associate &ndash; Used in many different ways in US business. Often used to indicate a customer service position or temporary/part-time [[employee]]. Some US businesses use the term for all or most [[exempt employee]]s. In legal firms an [[associate attorney]] indicates a lawyer who is not a [[Partner (business rank)|partner]] of the law firm. Partner is often used in a similar way.
* [[Supervisor]]
* [[Shop foreman|Foreman]]
* [[General manager]] or GM
* [[Manager (disambiguation)|Manager]]
* [[Of Counsel]] &ndash; A lawyer working on a part-time or temporary basis for a company or law firm.
* [[Vice president]] &ndash; Middle or upper manager in a corporation. They often appear in various hierarchical layers such as ''executive vice president'', ''senior vice president'', ''associate vice president'', or ''assistant vice president'', with EVP usually considered the highest and usually reporting to the CEO or president. Many times, corporate officers such as the ''CFO'', ''COO'', ''CIO'', ''CTO'', ''secretary'', or ''treasurer'' will concurrently hold ''vice president'' titles, commonly EVP or SVP. Vice presidents in small companies are also referred to as chiefs of a certain division, such as vice president for finance, or vice president for administration. Note that in some financial contexts, the title of vice president is actually subordinate to a director.

===Exempt and non-exempt===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
Other [[Corporation|corporate]] employee classifications, in US organizations, include:
*[[Exempt employee|Exempt]] &ndash; exempt from the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA). In a corporation, this generally applies to salaried professional staff, and executives, earning in excess of $23,660 annually.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
*Non-exempt &ndash; Generally an employee paid by the hour who is entitled to a minimum wage, overtime pay at the rate of time and one-half the regular rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week or according to state labor laws, as well as other protections under child labor and equal pay laws.

===Non-employees===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
Most modern corporations also have non-[[employee]] workers. These are usually 'temps' (temporary workers) or [[consultant]]s who, depending on the project and their experience, might be brought on to lead a task for which the skill-set did not exist within the company, or in the case of a temp, in the vernacular sense, to perform busy-work or an otherwise low-skilled repetitive task for which an employee is deemed too valuable to perform.

Non-employees generally are employed by outside agencies or firms, but perform their duties within a corporation or similar entity. They do not have the same benefits as employees of that company, such as pay-grades, health insurance, or sick days.

Some high-skilled consultants, however, may garner some benefits such as a bonus, sick leave, or food and travel expenses, since they usually charge a high flat-fee for their services, or otherwise garner high hourly wages. An example of high-skilled consultants include [[lawyer]]s, lobbyists, and [[accountant]]s who may not be employed by a corporation, but have their own firms or practices. Most temps, however, are compensated strictly for the hours they work, and are generally non-exempt.
