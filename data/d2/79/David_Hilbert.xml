Gdel's contributed talk took place on Saturday, 6 September [1930], from 3 until 3:20 in the afternoon, and on Sunday the meeting concluded with a round table discussion of the first day's addresses. During the latter event, without warning and almost offhandedly, Gdel quietly announced that &quot;one can even give examples of propositions (and in fact of those of the type of<space/><link><target>Christian Goldbach</target><part>Goldbach</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Pierre de Fermat</target><part>Fermat</part></link>) that, while contentually true, are unprovable in the formal system of classical mathematics [153]&quot; (Dawson:69) &quot;... As it happened, Hilbert himself was present at Knigsberg, though apparently not at the Conference on Epistemology. The day after the roundtable discussion he delivered the opening address before the Society of German Scientists and Physicians -- his famous lecture<space/><italics>Naturerkennen und Logik</italics><space/>(Logic and the knowledge of nature), at the end of which he declared: 'For the mathematician there is no Ignorabimus, and, in my opinion, not at all for natural science either. ...

Gdel's paper was received on November 17, 1930 (cf Reid p. 197, van Heijenoort 1976:592) and published on 25 March 1931 (Dawson 1997:74).

This is generally reckoned the most successful and deeply considered compilation of open problems ever to be produced by an individual mathematician.</paragraph><paragraph>After re-working the foundations of classical geometry, Hilbert could have extrapolated to the rest of mathematics. His approach differed, however, from the later 'foundationalist' Russell-Whitehead or 'encyclopedist'<space/><link><target>Nicolas Bourbaki</target></link>, and from his contemporary<space/><link><target>Giuseppe Peano</target></link>. The mathematical community as a whole could enlist in problems, which he had identified as crucial aspects of the areas of mathematics he took to be key.</paragraph><paragraph>The problem set was launched as a talk &quot;The Problems of Mathematics&quot; presented during the course of the Second International Congress of Mathematicians held in Paris. Here is the introduction of the speech that Hilbert gave:</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem><italics>Who among us would not be happy to lift the veil behind which is hidden the future; to gaze at the coming developments of our science and at the secrets of its development in the centuries to come?

In a subsequent publication, he extended the panorama, and arrived at the formulation of the now-canonical 23 Problems of Hilbert. The full text is important, since the exegesis of the questions still can be a matter of inevitable debate, whenever it is asked how many have been solved.</paragraph><paragraph>Some of these were solved within a short time. Others have been discussed throughout the 20th century, with a few now taken to be unsuitably open-ended to come to closure. Some even continue to this day to remain a challenge for mathematicians.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Formalism</heading><paragraph>In an account that had become standard by the mid-century, Hilbert's problem set was also a kind of manifesto, that opened the way for the development of the<space/><link><target>formalism (mathematics)</target><part>formalist</part></link><space/>school, one of three major schools of mathematics of the 20th century. According to the formalist, mathematics is manipulation of symbols according to agreed upon formal rules. It is therefore an autonomous activity of thought. There is, however, room to doubt whether Hilbert's own views were simplistically formalist in this sense.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Hilbert's program</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Hilbert's program</arg></template>In 1920 he proposed explicitly a research project (in<space/><italics><link><target>metamathematics</target></link></italics>, as it was then termed) that became known as Hilbert's program. He wanted<space/><link><target>mathematics</target></link><space/>to be formulated on a solid and complete logical foundation. He believed that in principle this could be done, by showing that:</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>all of mathematics follows from a correctly chosen finite system of<space/><link><target>axiom</target><trail>s</trail></link>; and</listitem><listitem>that some such axiom system is provably consistent through some means such as the<space/><link><target>epsilon calculus</target></link>.</listitem></list><paragraph>He seems to have had both technical and philosophical reasons for formulating this proposal. It affirmed his dislike of what had become known as the<space/><italics><link><target>ignorabimus</target></link></italics>, still an active issue in his time in German thought, and traced back in that formulation to<space/><link><target>Emil du Bois-Reymond</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>This program is still recognizable in the most popular<space/><link><target>philosophy of mathematics</target></link>, where it is usually called<space/><italics>formalism</italics>.

This approach has been successful and influential in relation with Hilbert's work in algebra and functional analysis, but has failed to engage in the same way with his interests in physics and logic.</paragraph><paragraph>Hilbert wrote in 1919:</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem>We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense.

During November 1915 Einstein published several papers culminating in &quot;The Field Equations of Gravitation&quot; (see<space/><link><target>Einstein field equations</target></link>).<extension extension_name='ref'>In time, associating the gravitational field equations with Hilbert's name became less and less common. A noticeable exception is P. Jordan (Schwerkraft und Weltall, Braunschweig, Vieweg, 1952), who called the equations of gravitation in the vacuum the EinsteinHilbert equations. (Leo Corry, David Hilbert and the Axiomatization of Physics, p. 437)</extension><space/>Nearly simultaneously David Hilbert published &quot;The Foundations of Physics&quot;, an axiomatic derivation of the field equations (see<space/><link><target>EinsteinHilbert action</target></link>). Hilbert fully credited Einstein as the originator of the theory, and no public priority dispute concerning the field equations ever arose between the two men during their lives.<extension extension_name='ref'>Since 1971 there have been some spirited and scholarly discussions about which of the two men first presented the now accepted form of the field equations. &quot;Hilbert freely admitted, and frequently stated in lectures, that the great idea was Einstein's.&quot;Every boy in the streets of Gottingen understands more about four dimensional geometry than Einstein,&quot; he once remarked. &quot;Yet, in spite of that, Einstein did the work and not the mathematicians&quot; (Reid 1996, pp. 141-142, also Isaacson 2007:222 quoting Thorne p. 119).</extension><space/>See more at<space/><link><target>relativity priority dispute#General Relativity 3</target><part>priority</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Additionally, Hilbert's work anticipated and assisted several advances in the<space/><link><target>mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics</target></link>.

While highly dependent on higher math, physicists tended to be &quot;sloppy&quot; with it. To a &quot;pure&quot; mathematician like Hilbert, this was both &quot;ugly&quot; and difficult to understand. As he began to understand physics and how physicists were using mathematics, he developed a coherent mathematical theory for what he found, most importantly in the area of<space/><link><target>integral equations</target></link>. When his colleague<space/><link><target>Richard Courant</target></link><space/>wrote the now classic<space/><italics><link><target>Methoden der mathematischen Physik</target></link></italics><space/>(Methods of Mathematical Physics) including some of Hilbert's ideas, he added Hilbert's name as author even though Hilbert had not directly contributed to the writing.
