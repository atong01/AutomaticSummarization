It is on the north shore of the<space/><link><target>Firth of Forth</target></link>, looking south to the island of<space/><link><target>Inchcolm</target></link><space/>and its Abbey, and to<space/><link><target>Leith</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Edinburgh</target></link><space/>beyond. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,633.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Scotland's Census 2011"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ods-web/area.html</arg><arg name="title">Scotland's Census 2011- Aberdour Locality 2010 Profile<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk</arg><arg name="year">2011<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2 March 2015</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The village's winding High Street lies a little inland from the coast. Narrow lanes run off it, providing access to the more hidden parts of the village and the shoreline itself. The village nestles between the bigger coastal towns of<space/><link><target>Burntisland</target></link><space/>to the east and<space/><link><target>Dalgety Bay</target></link><space/>to the west.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph>The origins of the village lie with its harbour, where the Dour Burn enters the River Forth. The place-name itself is<space/><link><target>Pictish language</target><part>Pictish</part></link>, implying an origin in the<space/><link><target>Dark Ages (historiography)</target><part>Dark Ages</part></link>:<space/><italics>aber</italics><space/>'confluence'. The -dour element, referring to the Burn, means simply 'water' (archaic<space/><italics>dobur</italics>), and is unconnected to the Scots/English 'dour'. For much of its history Aberdour was two villages,<space/><bold>Wester Aberdour</bold><space/>and<space/><bold>Easter Aberdour</bold>, on either side of the Dour Burn. Although this distinction was blurred by the 19th century arrival of the railway.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 18th century Aberdour's harbour was improved by the addition of a stone pier to help handle the coal traffic from nearby collieries. However, in the 1850s the traffic changed dramatically, and Aberdour Harbour became a popular destination for pleasure steamers from<space/><link><target>Leith</target></link>. This in turn led to the building of a deeper water pier a little around the bay at Hawkcraig, and to the development of hotels and many of the other services still on view today in the village.</paragraph><paragraph>The railway came to Aberdour in 1890, with the building of the line east from the newly opened<space/><link><target>Forth Bridge</target></link>. The<space/><link><target>Aberdour railway station</target><part>station</part></link><space/>has won many &quot;best kept station&quot; awards. The half an hour journey to the centre of<space/><link><target>Edinburgh</target></link><space/>helped build on the existing popularity of the village, though it put the steamers out of business. The main result was a growth in the building of large and attractive houses, especially down the hill from Wester Aberdour to the West Sands.<space/><link><target>Ticket inspector</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>on the train line through Aberdour were known for their sing song refrain:<space/><italics>&quot;Half an hour, Half an hour, Half an hour to Aberdour - tickets please.&quot;</italics></paragraph><heading level='2'>Landmarks</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Aberdour Castle from dovecote.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Aberdour Castle</target></link></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Virtually between the two former settlements, though actually part of Easter Aberdour, lies<space/><link><target>Aberdour Castle</target></link>. This started life as a modest<space/><link><target>hall house</target></link><space/>on a site overlooking the Dour Burn in the 13th century. The oldest part of the present semi-ruin constitutes one of the earliest surviving stone castles in mainland<space/><link><target>Scotland</target></link>. Over the next four hundred years the Castle was successively developed according to contemporary architectural ideas. Notable are the parts, still largely roofed, built by the Earls of Morton, with refined<space/><link><target>Renaissance</target></link><space/>detail, in the second half of the 16th century. A fire in the late 17th century was followed by some repairs, but in 1725 the family purchased 17th century Aberdour House, on the west side of the burn and in Wester Aberdour, and the medieval Castle was allowed to fall into relative decay. Aberdour Castle is now in the care of<space/><link><target>Historic Scotland</target></link><space/>and open to the public (entrance charge). After a period of dereliction Aberdour House was developed for residential use in the early 1990s.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:St Fillans Church -Aberdour -Scotland2.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>St Fillan's Church</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Neighbouring St Fillan's Church is one of the best-preserved medieval parish churches in<space/><link><target>Scotland</target></link>, dating largely to the 12th century. A south arcade was added to the nave in the early 16th century (open in summer). The<space/><link><target>A921 road</target><part>A921</part></link>, the main road along the south coast of<space/><link><target>Fife</target></link>, leads down the High Street of Wester Aberdour, before kinking sharply left to cross the railway line, then right again to progress through Easter Aberdour's Main Street.</paragraph><paragraph>Wester Aberdour has the more 'olde worlde' feel of the two, with the narrower through road more closely hemmed in by shops and hotels. A number of vernacular buildings of the 17th-early 19th centuries add to the historic scene. Close to the railway bridge, three lanes continue eastwards, presumably once the route of the original High Street before the arrival of the railway. One now leads to<space/><link><target>Aberdour railway station</target></link>, a beautifully kept and cared for example of a traditional station, in keeping with its role of transporting at least a quarter of the village's working population to their work each day.</paragraph><paragraph>A second lane leads alongside the railway line to<space/><link><target>Aberdour Castle</target></link>, while a third leads to the restored Aberdour House. A little further west, a narrow road closely lined with high walls, Shore Road, leads down to the West Sands and the Harbour. For many this area is the highlight of any visit to Aberdour; parking at the foot of Shore Road is usually at a premium.</paragraph><paragraph>Another road leads coastwards from Easter Aberdour. Hawkcraig Road leads past St Fillan's Church and through Silversand Park, home to<space/><link><target>Aberdour Shinty Club</target></link>, en route to the much better parking area on Hawkcraig. This was formerly a sandstone quarry and then used as the council refuse tip before becoming a carpark, part of the overgrown and rocky bluff separating Aberdour's two bays. From here is it a short walk to the Silver Sands, Aberdour's busiest and most popular beach. On the west side of Hawkcraig Point there is a short concrete jetty that was used as part of the development of radio controlled torpedoes during World War One. The foundations of the Radio Hut can still be seen in the lea of the hill.</paragraph><paragraph>The Aberdour obelisk was built by<space/><link><target>James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton</target><part>Lord Morton</part></link><space/>on his departure from the village to relocate to a large home in Edinburgh, it was built so he could see his former hometown from his new house when he looked through binoculars - it stands in a cowfield between the castle and the beach.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Festival</heading><paragraph>The yearly festival runs from the last week in July for a week, running into early August. It is now in its 32nd year and is most notable for its marquee on the silver sands playing fields. The festival hosts a number of children's, cultural and local events.

New facilities are currently under construction by Fife Council, which will much improve the beach throughout the year.</paragraph><paragraph>The Black Sands, as the contrasting name would suggest, have a rockier and darker sand, and are also popular with visitors exploring the rock caves and fascinating sea life. During the summer months (AprilSeptember), dogs are banned from the Silver Sands but they are allowed all year round at the Black Sands.
