Giving thanks to God, he returned forthwith to his palace, called for St. Dunstan and bade him follow, then rode straight to Glastonbury. Entering the church, the king first knelt in prayer before the altar, then, taking St. Dunstan by the hand, he gave him the kiss of peace, led him to the [[abbot]]'s throne and, seating him thereon, promised him all assistance in restoring Divine worship and regular observance.<ref name">"ce"/></arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Abbot of Glastonbury</heading><paragraph>Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, went to work at once on the task of reform.<extension extension_name='ref' name="osv"></extension><space/>He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey.
