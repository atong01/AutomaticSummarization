'''Afghan''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]] also [[Gujari]][[Persian language|Persian]]: افغان; see ''[[Afghan (ethnonym)|etymology]]'') refers to something from [[Afghanistan]], particularly a citizen of that country. Prior to this definition, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the [[Pashtun people]]. In modern times, "Afghan" is rarely used as an ethnic term for the [[Pashtun People|Pashtuns]] but is rather used as the national [[demonym]] for all citizens of Afghanistan—[[Pashtun People|Pashtuns]], [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], and also a large number of [[Hazara people|Hazaras]], [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]], [[Aimaq people|Aimaqs]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]], [[Baloch people|Balochs]], [[Nuristani people|Nuristanis]], [[Pashayi people|Pashayis]], [[Pamiri people|Pamiris]], [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Arabs]], [[Brahui people|Brahui]], [[Jat]], [[Gurjar]], and others.

According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', the word Afghan (afḡān) in current political usage means any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of their tribal or religious affiliation.<ref>{{cite web |work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |title=AFGHAN|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/afgan-in-current-political-usage-any-citizen-of-afghanistan-whatever-his-ethnic-tribal-or-religious-affiliation}}</ref> According to the [[1964 Afghanistan Constitution|1964 Constitution of Afghanistan]], all Afghans are equal in rights and obligations before the law.<ref>{{cite web|title=Article 1 of the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan|url=http://www.afghan-web.com/history/const/const1964.html |publisher=Government of Afghanistan |accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref> The fourth article of the current [[Constitution of Afghanistan]] states that citizens of Afghanistan consist of  [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], [[Hazara people|Hazara]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Aymaq]], [[Arab]], [[Baloch people|Baluch]], [[Pashai people|Pashayi]], [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]], [[Qezelbash]], [[Gujjars]], [[Brahui people|Brahui]], and members of other tribes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of Afghanistan|url=http://www.embassyofafghanistan.org/page/constitution |quote=National sovereignty in Afghanistan shall belong to the nation, manifested directly and through its elected representatives.

==Afghan==
In [[Farsi]] language, the word 'Afghan' literally means whining, wailing, and bawling. The word also carries some negative connotations among non-Pashtuns. For instance, among [[Hazaras|Hazara]], [[Tajiks|Tajik]] and [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], the word ‘Afghan’ is metaphorically used to denote backwardness. Among ethnic Hazara, 'Afghan' attains its meaning through a semantic shift, as 'Awgho' and it is often used in the households to scare the children for obedience. Historically, Hazaras have suffered at the hands of Pashtuns, and in their literature, Pashtuns are psychologically portrayed as evil, terror, savage, oppressor, and uncivilized people. This kind of portrayal has also shared among Uzbeks, Tajiks and [[Turkmens|Turkmen]]. Similarly, in northern Afghanistan among non-Pashtuns, the word 'Afghan' has also experienced a semantic change, which is 'Awghan,' and both metonymically and metaphorically used as a swear word to shame someone for wrongdoing and in contemptuous way it means representing someone as an object of ridicule.<ref>What do we know about the word ‘Afghan’ and who is called Afghan?

==Afghani==
The term "Afghani" refers to the unit of [[Afghan afghani|Afghan currency]]. It is often improperly used for a person or thing related to Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|title=More on Afghani|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2001/10/more_on_afghani.html |publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}</ref> The incorrect use of the term may have originated during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] when millions of Afghans took refuge in neighboring [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]]. The Afghani was created in 1925. Between 1925 and 1993 varieties of Afghani coins and banknotes were in circulation through Afghanistan. Coins issued during this period consisted of: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25 pul in bronze, brass, copper nickel, and aluminum-bronze; silver ½, 1, and 2½ Afghani; and gold ½, 1, and 2½ amani. Banknotes issued were in: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, and 10,000 Afghani. In 1958 bank notes worth 2 and 5 were switched with coins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://famouswonders.com/afghan-afghani/|title=Afghan Afghani|work=famouswonders.com}}</ref>
