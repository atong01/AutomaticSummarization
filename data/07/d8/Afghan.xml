The word also carries some negative connotations among non-Pashtuns. For instance, among<space/><link><target>Hazaras</target><part>Hazara</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Tajiks</target><part>Tajik</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Uzbeks</target><part>Uzbek</part></link>, the word Afghan is metaphorically used to denote backwardness. Among ethnic Hazara, 'Afghan' attains its meaning through a semantic shift, as 'Awgho' and it is often used in the households to scare the children for obedience. Historically, Hazaras have suffered at the hands of Pashtuns, and in their literature, Pashtuns are psychologically portrayed as evil, terror, savage, oppressor, and uncivilized people. This kind of portrayal has also shared among Uzbeks, Tajiks and<space/><link><target>Turkmens</target><part>Turkmen</part></link>. Similarly, in northern Afghanistan among non-Pashtuns, the word 'Afghan' has also experienced a semantic change, which is 'Awghan,' and both metonymically and metaphorically used as a swear word to shame someone for wrongdoing and in contemptuous way it means representing someone as an object of ridicule.<extension extension_name='ref'>What do we know about the word Afghan and who is called Afghan?
