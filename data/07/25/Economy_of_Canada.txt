[[Canada]] has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|11th]] (nominal) or [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|14th-largest]] (PPP) economy in the world (measured in US dollars at market exchange rates), is one of the world's wealthiest nations, and is a member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[G7|Group of Seven]] (G7). As with other developed nations, the Canadian economy is dominated by the [[Tertiary sector of industry|service industry]], which employs about three quarters of [[Canadians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/labr68a.htm|title=Actual hours worked per week by industry, seasonally adjusted crack |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of the [[Primary sector of industry|primary sector]], with the [[logging]] and [[petroleum|oil]] industries being two of Canada's most important.

==Basic information==
With the exception of a few small island nations in the [[Caribbean]], [[Canada]] is the only major [[parliamentary democracy]] in the [[western hemisphere]]. As a result, Canada has developed its own social and political institutions, distinct from most other countries in the world.<ref name="autogenerated1">Global Systems by David J Rees with Michael G Jones, Chapter 4, ISBN 0-919913-74-1</ref> Though the Canadian economy is closely integrated with the [[Economy of the United States|American Economy]], it has developed unique economic institutions.

The Canadian economic system generally combines elements of [[private enterprise]] and [[public enterprise]]. Many aspects of public enterprise, most notably the development of an extensive [[social welfare]] system to redress social and economic inequities, were adopted after 1945, or after the events of [[World War Two]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Canada has a private to public (Crown) property ratio of 60:40 and one of the highest levels of [[List of countries by economic freedom|economic freedom]] in the world. Today Canada closely resembles the U.S. in its market-oriented economic system and pattern of production.<ref name="cia_factbook">{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html |title=The World Factbook: Canada |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> As of February 2013, Canada's national unemployment rate stood at 7.0%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/130308/longdesc-cg130308a002-eng.htm |title=Labour force characteristics, seasonally adjusted, by province (monthly) |publisher=statcan.gc.ca |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2011-09-13}}</ref> as the economy continues its recovery from the effects of the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. In May 2010, provincial unemployment rates varied from a low of 5.0% in [[Saskatchewan]] to a high of 13.8% in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/lfss02a-eng.htm|title=Labour force characteristics, unadjusted, by province (monthly)  |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> According to the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's largest companies in 2008, Canada had 69 companies in the list, ranking 5th next to France.<ref name="2008 [[Forbes]] Global 2000">{{cite news | author=forbes|authorlink= forbes|publisher= forbes|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/18/biz_2000global08_The-Global-2000-Canada_10Rank.html|title=Latest release |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

[[International trade]] makes up a large part of the Canadian economy, particularly of its natural resources. In 2009, agricultural, energy, forestry and mining exports accounted for about 58% of Canada's total exports.<ref name="www40.statcan.gc.ca">{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/gblec04-eng.htm|title=Exports of goods on a balance-of-payments basis, by product |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> Machinery, equipment, automotive products and other manufactures accounted for a further 38% of exports in 2009.<ref name="www40.statcan.gc.ca"/> In 2009, exports accounted for approximately 30% of Canada's GDP. The United States is by far its largest trading partner, accounting for about 73% of exports and 63% of imports as of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a.htm|title=Imports, exports and trade balance of goods on a balance-of-payments basis, by country or country grouping |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> Canada's combined exports and imports ranked 8th among all nations in 2006.<ref>Canada's Private to Public (Crown) Property Ratio is 60:40.[[:File:Top 20 Exporters and Importers in 2006.gif|2006 exports/imports]]</ref>

These primary industries are increasingly becoming less important to the overall economy. Only some 4% of Canadians are employed in these fields, and they account for 6.2% of GDP.<ref name="gdpstats">{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/gdps04a-eng.htm|title=Gross domestic product at basic prices, by industry (monthly) |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> They are still paramount in many parts of the country. Many, if not most, towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, exist because of a nearby mine or source of timber. Canada is a world leader in the production of many natural resources such as [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[uranium]], [[diamonds]], [[lead]], and in recent years, crude petroleum, which, with the world's second-largest oil reserves, is taking an increasingly prominent position in natural resources extraction. Several of Canada's largest companies are based in natural resource industries, such as [[EnCana]], [[Cameco]], [[Goldcorp]], and [[Barrick Gold]]. The vast majority of these products are exported, mainly to the United States. There are also many secondary and service industries that are directly linked to primary ones. For instance one of Canada's largest manufacturing industries is the [[pulp and paper]] sector, which is directly linked to the [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] business.

The reliance on natural resources has several effects on the Canadian economy and Canadian society. While manufacturing and service industries are easy to standardize, natural resources vary greatly by region. This ensures that differing economic structures developed in each region of Canada, contributing to Canada's strong regionalism. At the same time the vast majority of these resources are exported, integrating Canada closely into the international economy. Howlett and Ramesh argue that the inherent instability of such industries also contributes to greater government intervention in the economy, to reduce the social impact of market changes.<ref>Howlett, Michael and M. Ramesh. ''Political Economy of Canada: An Introduction.'' Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1992.</ref>

Such industries also raise important questions of sustainability. Despite many decades as a leading producer, there is little risk of depletion. Large discoveries continue to be made, such as the massive nickel find at [[Voisey's Bay]]. Moreover, the far north remains largely undeveloped as producers await higher prices or new technologies as many operations in this region are not yet cost effective. In recent decades Canadians have become less willing to accept the environmental destruction associated with exploiting natural resources. High wages and Aboriginal land claims have also curbed expansion. Instead many Canadian companies have focused their exploration, exploitation and expansion activities overseas where prices are lower and governments more amendable. Canadian companies are increasingly playing important roles in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.

The depletion of renewable resources has raised concerns in recent years. After decades of escalating [[overutilization]] the [[Cod fisheries|cod fishery]] all but collapsed in the 1990s, and the Pacific salmon industry also suffered greatly. The [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] industry, after many years of activism, has in recent years moved to a more sustainable model, or to other countries.

==Measuring Productivity==
{{Economy of Canada}}
Productivity measures are key indicators of economic performance and a key source of economic growth and competitiveness. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)<ref group=notes>The OECD produces an annual report on member nations who share the goal of "contributing to the development of the world economy" by attaining the "highest sustainable economic growth and employment and a rising standard of living while maintaining financial stability."</ref> The OECD Compendium of Productivity Indicators,<ref name=OECDcompend2012 /> published annually, presents a broad overview of productivity levels and growth in member nations, highlighting key measurement issues. It analyses the role of "productivity as the main driver of economic growth and convergence" and the "contributions of labour, capital and MFP in driving economic growth."<ref name=OECDcompend2012>{{cite report|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/industry-and-services/oecd-compendium-of-productivity-indicators-2012_9789264188846-en|title='OECD Compendium of Productivity Indicators 2012|publisher=OECD|year=2012}}page 3</ref> According to the definition above "MFP is often interpreted as the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation" (OECD 2008,11). Measures of productivity include [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP)(OECD 2008,11) and [[multifactor productivity]]

==Gross Domestic Product (GDP)==

The OECD provides data for example comparing labour productivity levels in the total economy of each member nation. In their 2011 report Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was $CDN 1,720,748 million.<ref name=OECDlabprod2011>{{cite report|year=2011|url=http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=LEVEL|title=Labour productivity levels in the total economy|accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>

===Multifactor productivity (MFP)===

Another productivity measure, used by the OECD, is the long-term trend in multifactor productivity (MFP) also known as [[total factor productivity]] (TFP). This indicator assesses an economy’s "underlying productive capacity ("potential output"), itself an important measure of the growth possibilities of economies and of inflationary pressures." MFP measures the residual growth that cannot be explained by the rate of change in the services of labour, capital and intermediate outputs, and is often interpreted as the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation. (OECD 2008,11)

According to the OECD's annual economic survey of Canada in June 2012, Canada has experienced weak growth of multi-factor productivity (MFP) and has been declining further since 2002. One of the ways MFP growth is raised is by boosting innovation and Canada's innovation indicators such as business R&D and patenting rates were poor. Raising MFP growth, is "needed to sustain rising living standards, especially as the population ages."<ref name=OECD2012>{{cite report|title=OECD Economic Surveys Canada June 2012 Overview|url=http://www.oecd.org/eco/50543310.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IqRsaqI0|archivedate=2013-08-13|format=PDF|year=2012|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development}}</ref>

==Central Government Debt==
The OECD reports the Central Government Debt as percentage of the GDP. In 2000 Canada's was 40.9 percent, in 2007 it was 25.2 percent, in 2008 it was 28.6 percent and by 2010 it was 36.1 percent.<ref name=OECDdebtGDP>{{cite report|publisher=OECD|year=2011|accessdate=13 June 2013|url=http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=GOV_DEBT|title=Central Government Debt}}</ref> The OECD reports ''net'' financial liabilities measure used by the OECD, reports the net number at 25.2%, as of 2008,<ref name=OECDdebtGDP /> making Canada’s total [[government debt]] burden as the lowest in the G8. The gross number was 68% in 2011.<ref name=OECD>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4456/is_80/ai_n18617470 |title=Fiscal balances and public indebtedness &#124; OECD Economic Outlook |publisher=Find Articles |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>

The CIA World Factbook, updated weekly, measures financial liabilities by using gross general government debt, as opposed to net federal debt used by the OECD and the Canadian federal government. Gross general government debt includes both "intragovernmental debt and the debt of public entities at the sub-national level." For example, the CIA measured Canada's public debt as 84.1% of GDP in 2012 and 87.4% of GDP in 2011 making it 22nd in the world.<ref name=CIAWorldFact>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref>

==Household Debt==
In March 2015 the International Monetary Fund reported that Canada's high household debt was one of two vulnerable domestic areas in Canada's economy; the second is its overheated housing market.<ref name="IMF_2015_CA">{{citation |work=International Monetary Fund |date=9 March 2015 |accessdate=7 August 2015 }}</ref>

According to a July 2015 report by Laura Cooper, an economist with the [[Royal Bank of Canada|RBC]]—the largest financial institution in Canada— "outstanding household credit balances" had reached $1.83 trillion.<ref name="RBC_2015_HD">{{cite report |url= http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/other-reports/cancredit_0715.pdf |format=PDF |series=Canadian Credit |date=July 2015 |accessdate=7 August 2015 |publisher=RBC Economics |author=Laura Cooper}}</ref> Canadian household credit growth had reached a peak in 2009 then plummeted to a cycle-low in late 2013.<ref name="RBC_2015_HD" /> There was a quickened pace of growth in household debt in December 2012 and another in April and May 2015.<ref name="RBC_2015_HD" /><ref name="CBC_2013">{{citation |title=Canadian consumer debt levels up 21%, RBC survey shows: Many Canadians say they have postponed purchases to keep spending in check |work=CBC News |date=29 October 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2015 }}</ref>

===Household debt in 2013===
According to the August 2013 third annual Ipsos Reid Debt Poll only 24 per cent of Canadians were debt free in 2013 compared to 26 per cent in 2012. The average personal non-mortgage debt in 2013 was $15,920 up from $13,141 in 2012.

==Household debt in 2014==

Statistics Canada announced in December 2014 that Canada's household [[debt-to-income ratio]] "hit a record high in the third quarter of 2014, climbing to 162.6 percent from 161.5 percent in the second quarter." However "household assets and net worth increased much faster than debt,"<ref name="Fraser2015" /> with the national net worth at C$8.12 trillion in the third quarter of 2014, a increase of 2.8 percent from the second quarter.<ref name="reuters_2014_debt-to-income">{{citation |title=Canada household debt-to-income ratio hits a record high |date=15 December 2014 |accessdate=7 August 2015 |location=Ottawa, Ontario |publisher=Reuters |url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN0JT1FF20141215 }}</ref><ref name="162_percent">{{citation |title=Household Debt In Canada Hits Record 162.6% Of Income After StatsCan Revisions |author=Alexandra Posadzki |publisher=Canadian Press via Huffington Post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/12/15/household-debt-canada-2014_n_6327298.html |date=15 December 2015 |accessdate=7 August 2015 }}</ref> Also through the inflation-targeting policy of the Bank of Canada, interest rates are kept low improving the ability of households to service their debt.

By 2015 according to the Globe and Mail, "The total debt owed by all Canadians at the end of March 2015 was a record $1.8-trillion with mortgage debt making up $1.29-trillion."<ref name="household_debt">{{citation |title=Debt: Canada's borrowing binge: Canada's households now owe a record $1.8-trillion |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/household-finances/canadian-households-now-owe-a-record-18-trillion-and-more-debt-statistics/article24322565/ |author1=Danielle Webb |author2=Tavia Grant |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=8 May 2015 |accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref>

According to Philip Cross of the [[Fraser Institute]], in May 2015, while the Canadian household debt-to-income ratio is similar to that in the US, however lending standards in Canada are tighter than those in the United States to protect against high-risk borrowers taking out unsustainable debt.<ref name="Fraser2015">{{citation |url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/longer-term-perspective-on-canadas-household-debt.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Longer-term Perspective on Canada’s Household Debt |author=Philip Cross |accessdate=7 August 2015 |date=May 2015}}</ref>

[[Household debt]], the amount of money that all adults in the household owe financial institutions, includes [[consumer debt]] and [[mortgage loan]]s. Paul Krugman argued that by 2007 household debt in the United States, prior to the financial crisis, had reached 130 percent of household income. Krugman distinguished between the total domestic non-financial debt (public plus private) relative to GDP which is "money we owe to ourselves" and net foreign debt.<ref name=Krugmanhouseholddebt2010>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/opinion/13krugman.html|title=Block those Metaphors|publisher=New York Times|date=13 December 2010|accessdate=13 June 2013|author=[[Paul Krugman]]}}</ref><ref name=Krugman2011>{{cite news|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=Debt Is (Mostly) Money We Owe to Ourselves|url=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/debt-is-mostly-money-we-owe-to-ourselves|work=The New York Times|date=2011-12-28}}</ref> Statistics Canada reported in March 2013 that "credit-market debt such as mortgages rose to 165% of disposable income, compared with 164.7% in the prior three-month period" in 2013<ref name=householddebt15mar2013>{{cite news|title=Canadians turns deaf ear to Carney’s warnings as household debt hits fresh record at 165%|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/03/15/canadians-turns-deaf-ear-to-carneys-warnings-as-household-debt-hits-fresh-record-at-165|date=15 March 2013|publisher=Financial Post|accessdate=13 June 2013|author=Greg Quinn Bloomberg News}}</ref> According to the IMF in 2012, "Housing-related debt (mortgages) comprises about 70 percent of gross household debt in advanced economies.

==International Monetary Fund==
In the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s (IMF) quarterly [[World Economic Outlook]] released in April 2015, the IMF forecast that Canada’s real gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 2.2 percent.

==Bank of Canada==

===Inflation targeting===
The [[Bank of Canada]], a federal crown corporation, has the responsibility of Canada's monetary system. During the period that [[John Crow]] was Governor of the Bank of Canada—1987 to 1994— there was a worldwide [[Early 1990s recession|recession]] and the bank rate rose to around 14% and unemployment topped 11%.<ref name="Blake 2007">{{citation |editor=Blake |title=Transforming the Nation: Canada and Brian Mulroney |date=2007}}</ref> In 1991, with Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] in office, the federal government and the Bank of Canada announced a new [[inflation targeting]] monetary policy that has been the cornerstone of Canada's monetary and fiscal policy ever since.<ref name="Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07" /><ref name="inflation-targeting_2010">{{citation |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/inflation_control_target.pdf |format=PDF |title=Inflation-Control Target Backgrounder |publisher=Bank of Canada |date=November 2010}}</ref> Although since that time inflation-targeting has been adopted by "most advanced-world central banks",<ref name="beyond_inflation-targeting_2011" /> in 1991 it was innovative and Canada was an early adopter when the then-Finance Minister [[Michael Wilson (Canadian politician)|Michael Wilson]] approved the Bank of Canada's first inflation-targeting in the 1991 federal budget.<ref name="beyond_inflation-targeting_2011" /> The inflation target was set at 2 per cent, which is the midpoint of an inflation range of 1 to 3 per cent. They established a set of inflation-reduction targets in order to keep inflation "low, stable and predictable" and to foster "confidence in the value of money," contribute to Canada's sustained growth, employment gains and improved standard of living.<ref name="Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07" /> Inflation is measured by the total [[consumer price index]] (CPI). In 2011 the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada extended Canada's inflation-control target to December 31, 2016.<ref name="Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07" /> The Bank of Canada uses three unconventional instruments to achieve the inflation target: "a conditional statement on the future path of the policy rate," [[quantitative easing]], and [[credit easing]].<ref name="MPR_2009">{{cite report |title=Monetary Policy Report |date=April 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2015 |publisher=Bank of Canada}}</ref>

As a result, interest rates and inflation eventually came down along with the value of the Canadian dollar.<ref name="Blake 2007" /> From 1991 to 2011 the inflation-targeting regime kept "price gains fairly reliable."<ref name="beyond_inflation-targeting_2011" />

Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]] the narrow focus of inflation-targeting as a means of providing stable growth in the Canadian economy, was questioned. By 2011, the then-Bank of Canada Governor [[Mark Carney]] argued that the central bank’s mandate would allow for a more flexible inflation-targeting in specific situations where he would consider taking longer "than the typical six to eight quarters to return inflation to 2 per cent."<ref name="beyond_inflation-targeting_2011">{{citation |title=Bank of Canada to get marching orders to look beyond inflation targeting |authors=Jeremy Torobin, Bill Curry |location=Ottawa, Ontario |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=16 October 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>

The central bank— the [[Bank of Canada]]— issues its rate announcement through its Monetary Policy Report which is released eight times a year.<ref name="Monetary_Policy_Report_2015_07">{{cite report |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mpr-2015-07-15.pdf |format=PDF |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=6 August 2015 |title=Monetary Policy Report}}</ref> On July 15, 2015 the [[Bank of Canada]] announced that it was lowering its target for the overnight rate by another one-quarter percentage point, to 0.5 per cent<ref name="Bank_of_Canada_2015_July">{{citation |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2015/07/fad-press-release-2015-07-15/ |publisher=Bank of Canada |title=Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target to 1/2 per cent |accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref> "to try to stimulate an economy that appears to have failed to rebound meaningfully from the oil shock woes that dragged it into decline in the first quarter."<ref name="IMF_2015_07" /> According to the Bank of Canada announcement, in the first quarter of 2015, the total [[Consumer price index]] (CPI) inflation was about 1 per cent. This reflects "year-over-year price declines for consumer energy products." Core inflation in the first quarter of 2015 was about 2 per cent with an underlying trend in inflation at about 1.5 to 1.7 per cent.<ref name="Bank_of_Canada_2015_July" />

In response to the Bank of Canada's July 15, 2015 rate adjustment, Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] explained that the Canadian economy was being dragged down by forces beyond Canadian borders such as  global oil prices, the European debt crisis, and China's economic slowdown" which has made the global economy "fragile."<ref name="dailymail_2015">{{citation |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3162865/After-rate-cut-Canada-PMs-office-says-global-woes-hit-economy.html#ixzz3i8S0eXBA |publisher=Daily Mail UK |date=15 July 2015 |title=After rate cut Canada PMs office says global woes hit economy |accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref>

===Service sector===
[[Image:TD Centre View from Yonge and King.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The [[Toronto-Dominion Centre]] in Toronto]]

The service sector in Canada is vast and multifaceted, employing about three quarters of Canadians and accounting for 78% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html |title=CIA World Factbook - Canada |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2011-02-22}}</ref> The largest employer is the [[retail]] sector, employing almost 12% of Canadians.<ref>Wallace, Iain, ''A Geography of the Canadian Economy.'' Don Mills: Oxford University Press, 2002.</ref> The retail industry is mainly concentrated in a small number of chain stores clustered together in [[shopping mall]]s. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of [[big-box store]]s, such as [[Wal-Mart]] (of the United States) and [[Future Shop]] (a subsidiary of the US based [[Best Buy]]) and Zellers (most of their leases have since been purchased by [[Target Corporation|Target]]). This has led to fewer workers in this sector and a migration of retail jobs to the suburbs.

The second largest portion of the service sector is the business service and hire only a slightly smaller percentage of the population. This includes the [[financial services]], [[real estate]], and communications industries. This portion of the economy has been rapidly growing in recent years. It is largely concentrated in the major urban centres, especially [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]] and [[Vancouver]] (see [[Banking in Canada]]).

The education and health sectors are two of Canada's largest, but both are largely under the influence of the government. The health care industry has been quickly growing, and is the third largest in Canada. Its rapid growth has led to problems for governments who must find money to fund it.

Canada has an important [[high tech]] industry, and a burgeoning film, television, and entertainment industry creating content for local and international consumption (see [[Media in Canada]]).<ref>{{cite book |last=Gasher |first=Mike |date=2002 |title=Hollywood North the feature film industry in British Columbia |location=Vancouver |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=978-0774809689 |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref> [[Tourism in Canada|Tourism]] is of ever increasing importance, with the vast majority of international visitors coming from the United States. Though the recent strength of the Canadian Dollar has hurt this sector, other nations such as China have increased tourism to Canada. Casino gaming is currently the fastest-growing component of the Canadian tourism industry, contributing $5 billion in profits for Canadian governments and employing 41,000 Canadians as of 2001.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 =MacLaurin | first1 =Tanya | last2 =MacLaurin | first2 =Donald | title =Casino gaming and tourism in Canada | journal =International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management | volume =15 | issue =6 | pages =328–332 | publisher =MCB UP Ltd | date =2003 | doi =10.1108/09596110310488177 | accessdate =June 4, 2014 }}</ref>

The general pattern of development for wealthy nations was a transition from a primary industry based economy to a manufacturing based one, and then to a service based economy. Canada did not escape this pattern - at its (abnormally high World War II) peak in 1944, manufacturing accounted for 29% of GDP,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0027m/2009057/ct029-eng.htm|title=Manufacturing's share of gross domestic product, 1900 to 2005 |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> declining to 15.6% in 2005. Canada has not suffered as greatly as most other rich, industrialized nations from the pains of the relative decline in the importance of manufacturing since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0027m/2009057/ct030-eng.htm|title=Manufacturing share of gross domestic product, 1961 to 2007 |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> A 2009 study by [[Statistics Canada]] also found that, while manufacturing declined as a relative percentage of GDP from 24.3% in the 1960s to 15.6% in 2005, manufacturing volumes between 1961 and 2005 kept pace with the overall growth in the volume index of GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0027m/2009057/aftertoc-aprestdm2-eng.htm|title=The Canadian Manufacturing Sector: Adapting to Challenges |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> Manufacturing in Canada was especially hit hard by the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. As of 2010, manufacturing accounts for 13% of Canada's GDP,<ref name="gdpstats"/> a relative decline of more than 2% of GDP since 2005.

Central Canada is home to [[branch plant]]s to all the major American and Japanese automobile makers and many parts factories owned by Canadian firms such as [[Magna International]] and [[Linamar|Linamar Corporation]]. Central Canada today produces more vehicles each year than the neighbouring U.S. state of [[Michigan]], the heart of the American automobile industry. Manufacturers have been attracted to Canada due to the highly educated population with lower labour costs than the United States.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Canada's [[publicly funded health care]] system is also an important attraction, as companies are exempt from the high health insurance costs US firms pay, though they are offset by corporate health care taxes.

Much of the Canadian manufacturing industry consists of branch plants of United States firms, though there are some important domestic manufacturers, such as [[Bombardier Inc.]]. This has raised several concerns for Canadians. Branch plants provide mainly [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] jobs, with research and executive positions confined to the United States.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Energy===
{{See also|Petroleum production in Canada}}

[[Image:Oil well3419.jpg|thumb|[[Nodding donkey]] pumping an oil well near [[Sarnia]], [[Ontario]]]]Canada is one of the few developed nations that is a net exporter of energy - in 2009 net exports of energy products amounted to 2.9% of GDP. Most important are the large oil and gas resources centred in Alberta and the Northern Territories, but also present in neighbouring [[British Columbia]] and [[Saskatchewan]]. The vast [[Athabasca oil sands]] give Canada the world's third largest reserves of oil after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela according to [[USGS]]. In British Columbia and [[Quebec]], as well as Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the Labrador region, hydroelectric power is an inexpensive and relatively environmentally friendly source of abundant energy. In part because of this, Canada is also one of the world's highest per capita consumers of energy.<ref>[http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Indicators/Issues/Energy/Bulletin/ec_iss_e.cfm Environment Canada - Energy Consumption] {{wayback|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Indicators/Issues/Energy/Bulletin/ec_iss_e.cfm |date=20040222212419 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentalindicators.com/htdocs/indicators/8ener.htm |title=Canada vs. The OECD: An Environmental Comparison |publisher=Environmentalindicators.com |accessdate=2011-02-22}}</ref> Cheap energy has enabled the creation of several important industries, such as the large [[aluminium]] industries in British Columbia <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guidetobceconomy.org/major_industries/resource_based.htm |title=Resource-based Industries and High-tech Manufacturing - Goods Sector - Major Industries - A Guide to the BC Economy and Labour Market |publisher=Guidetobceconomy.org |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110907052003/http://www.guidetobceconomy.org:80/major_industries/resource_based.htm |archivedate=7 September 2011 }}</ref> and Quebec.<ref>{{cite web|last=Canadian |first=The |url=http://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/general/aluminum-heavyweights-to-make-15-billion-quebec-investment-43389 |title=Aluminum heavyweights to make $15-billion Quebec investment |publisher=Canadian Manufacturing |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111013193436/http://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/general/aluminum-heavyweights-to-make-15-billion-quebec-investment-43389 |archivedate=13 October 2011 }}</ref>

Historically, an important issue in Canadian politics is the interplay between the oil and energy industry in [[Western Canada]] and the industrial heartland of Southern Ontario. Foreign investment in Western oil projects has fueled [[Canada]]'s rising dollar. This has raised the price of Ontario's manufacturing exports and made them less competitive, a problem similar to the [[Dutch disease|decline of the manufacturing sector in the Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/07/20/growing-equalization-payments-to-ontario-threaten-country-expert/|title=Growing Equalization Payments to Ontario Threaten Country|author=Lee Greenberg|date=2011-07-20|publisher=National Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Does the Canadian economy suffer from Dutch Disease?|author = Michel Beine, Charles S. Bos, Serge Coulombe | date=January 2009 | url=http://www.economie.uqam.ca/pages/docs/Beine_Michel.pdf}}</ref> Also, Ontario has relatively fewer native sources of power. However, it is cheaper for Alberta to ship its oil to the western United States than to eastern Canada. The eastern Canadian ports thus import significant quantities of oil from overseas, and Ontario makes significant use of [[Nuclear power in Canada|nuclear power]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The [[National Energy Policy]] of the early 1980s attempted to force Alberta to sell low priced oil to eastern Canada. This policy proved deeply divisive, and quickly lost its importance as oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s. One of the most controversial sections of the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] of 1988 was a promise that Canada would never charge the United States more for energy than fellow Canadians.

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Agriculture in Canada}}
[[Image:Alberta modern cement grain elevator 034 cropped.jpg|thumb|An inland grain terminal in Alberta]]
Canada is also one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products, particularly of wheat and other grains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/modules/prb98-2-grain/grainmarket-e.htm |title=The Relative Position of Canada in the World Grain Market |publisher=Dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca |date=2002-10-02 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}</ref> Canada is a major exporter of agricultural products, to the United States and Asia. As with all other developed nations the proportion of the population and GDP devoted to agriculture fell dramatically over the 20th century.

As with other developed nations, the Canadian agriculture industry receives significant government subsidies and supports. However, Canada has been a strong supporter of reducing market influencing subsidies through the [[World Trade Organization]]. In 2000, Canada spent approximately CDN$4.6 billion on supports for the industry. Of this, $2.32 billion was classified under the WTO designation of "green box" support, meaning it did not directly influence the market, such as money for research or disaster relief. All but $848.2 million were subsidies worth less than 5% of the value of the crops they were provided for.

The United States is by far Canada's largest trading partner, with more than [http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a.htm $1.7] billion [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] in trade per day in 2005. In 2009, 73% of Canada's exports went to the United States, and 63% of Canada's imports were from the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a-eng.htm |title=Imports, exports and trade balance of goods on a balance-of-payments basis, by country or country grouping |publisher=0.statcan.gc.ca |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}</ref> Trade with Canada makes up 23% of the United States' exports and 17% of its imports.<ref>{{cite web|author=FTDWebMaster, [Name of person creating HTML] |url=http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/top/top0512.html |title=FTD - Statistics - Trade Highlights - Top Trading Partners |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2011-02-22}}</ref>  By comparison, in 2005 this was more than U.S. trade with all countries in the [[European Union]] combined,<ref>{{cite web|author=FTDWebMaster, FTD Data Dissemination |url=http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0003.html |title=FTD - Statistics - Country Data - U.S. Trade Balance with European Union |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2011-02-22}}</ref> and well over twice U.S. trade with all the countries of [[Latin America]] combined.<ref>{{cite web|author=FTDWebMaster, FTD Data Dissemination |url=http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0009.html#2005 |title=FTD - Statistics - Country Data - U.S. Trade Balance with South and Central America |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2011-02-22}}</ref>  Just the two-way trade that crosses the [[Ambassador Bridge]] between [[Michigan]] and [[Ontario]] equals all U.S. exports to [[Japan]]. Canada's importance to the United States is not just a border-state phenomenon: Canada is the leading export market for 35 of 50 U.S. states, and is the United States' largest foreign supplier of energy.

Bilateral trade increased by 52% between 1989, when the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) went into effect, and 1994, when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) superseded it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Trade has since increased by 40%. NAFTA continues the FTA's moves toward reducing trade barriers and establishing agreed-upon trade rules. It also resolves some long-standing bilateral irritants and liberalizes rules in several areas, including agriculture, services, energy, financial services, investment, and government procurement. NAFTA forms the largest trading area in the world, embracing the 405 million people of the three North American countries.

The largest component of U.S.-Canada trade is in the [[commodity]] sector.

The U.S. is Canada's largest agricultural export market, taking well over half of all Canadian food exports.<ref>[http://ats.agr.ca/stats/4141_e.pdf Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada / Agriculture et Agroalimentaire Canada<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Similarly, Canada is the largest market for U.S. agricultural goods, with nearly 20% of American food exports going to its northern neighbour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Nearly two-thirds of Canada's forest products, including [[pulp (paper)|pulp]] and [[paper]], are exported to the United States; 72% of Canada's total [[newsprint]] production also is exported to the U.S.

At [http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/statistics/energy/default.html $73.6]{{dead link|date=March 2015}} billion in 2004, U.S.-Canada trade in [[energy development|energy]] is the largest U.S. energy trading relationship, with the overwhelming majority ($66.7 billion) being exports from Canada. The primary components of U.S. energy trade with Canada are [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], and [[electricity]]. Canada is the United States' largest oil supplier and the fifth-largest energy producing country in the world. Canada provides about 16% of U.S. oil imports and 14% of total U.S. consumption of natural gas. The United States and Canada's national electricity grids are linked, and both countries share [[hydropower]] facilities on the western borders.

While most of U.S.-Canada trade flows smoothly, there are occasionally bilateral trade disputes, particularly in the agricultural and cultural fields.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Usually these issues are resolved through bilateral consultative forums or referral to [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) or NAFTA dispute resolution.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In May 1999, the U.S. and Canadian governments negotiated an agreement on [[magazine]]s that provides increased access for the U.S. [[publishing]] industry to the Canadian market.
