Currently, political power is shared by a Somali president and an Afar prime minister, with an Afar career diplomat as Foreign Minister and other cabinet posts roughly divided. However, Issas are predominate in the government, civil service, and the ruling party. That, together with a shortage of non-government employment, has bred resentment and continued political competition between the Issa Somalis and the Afars. In March 2006, Djibouti held its first regional elections and began implementing a decentralization plan. The broad pro-government coalition, including FRUD candidates, again ran unopposed when the government refused to meet opposition preconditions for participation. In the 2008 elections, the opposition Union for a Presidential Majority (UMP) party boycotted the election, leaving all 65 seats to the ruling RPP. Voter turnout figures were disputed. Guelleh was re-elected in the 2011 presidential election.</paragraph><paragraph>Due to its strategic location at the mouth of the<space/><link><target>Bab el Mandeb</target></link><space/>gateway to the<space/><link><target>Red Sea</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Suez Canal</target></link>, Djibouti also hosts various foreign military bases.<space/><link><target>Camp Lemonnier</target></link><space/>is a United States Naval Expeditionary Base,<extension extension_name='ref' name="MARCENT-2006"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Introduction to MARCENT
