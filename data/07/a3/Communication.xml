The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react.

These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make<space/><link><target>message</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another<space/><link><target>Interpersonal Communication</target><part>person</part></link><space/>or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).</paragraph><paragraph>Communication can be seen as processes of<space/><link><target>information transmission</target></link><space/>governed by three levels of<space/><link><target>semiotic</target></link><space/>rules:</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem><link><target>Pragmatics</target><part>Pragmatic</part></link><space/>(concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users)</listitem><listitem><link><target>Semantic</target></link><space/>(study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent) and</listitem><listitem><link><target>Syntactic</target></link><space/>(formal properties of signs and symbols).</listitem></list><paragraph>Therefore, communication is<space/><link><target>Interpersonal relationship</target><part>social interaction</part></link><space/>where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of<space/><link><target>semiotic</target></link><space/>rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores<space/><link><target>semiotics</target><part>autocommunication</part></link>, including<space/><link><target>intrapersonal communication</target></link><space/>via<space/><link><target>diary</target><part>diaries</part></link><space/>or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.</paragraph><paragraph>In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (2008) proposed a transactional model of communication.<extension extension_name='ref'>Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.),<space/><italics>Communication theory</italics><space/>(2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.</extension><space/>The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.</paragraph><paragraph>In a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked<space/><link><target>wikt:reciprocal</target><part>reciprocally</part></link>. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a<space/><link><target>speech act</target></link>. The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents. In the presence of &quot;<link><target>noise</target><part>communication noise</part></link>&quot; on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a<space/><link><target>codebook</target></link>, and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical. Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.</paragraph><paragraph>Theories of<space/><link><target>coregulation</target></link><space/>describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar<space/><link><target>Harold Innis</target></link><space/>had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society (Wark, McKenzie 1997). His famous example of this is using<space/><link><target>ancient Egypt</target></link><space/>and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called '<link><target>General semantics</target><part>Space Binding</part></link>'. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and '<link><target>General semantics</target><part>Time Binding</part></link>', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society (Wark, McKenzie 1997).</paragraph><heading level='2'>Noise</heading><paragraph>In any communication model, noise is interference with the decoding of messages sent over a channel by an encoder. There are many examples of noise:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><bold>Environmental noise.</bold><space/>Noise that physically disrupts communication, such as standing next to loud speakers at a party, or the noise from a construction site next to a classroom making it difficult to hear the professor.</listitem><listitem><bold>Physiological-impairment noise.</bold><space/>Physical maladies that prevent effective communication, such as actual<space/><link><target>deafness</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>blindness</target></link><space/>preventing messages from being received as they were intended.</listitem><listitem><bold>Semantic noise.</bold><space/>Different interpretations of the meanings of certain words. For example, the word &quot;weed&quot; can be interpreted as an undesirable plant in a yard, or as a euphemism for marijuana.</listitem><listitem><bold>Syntactical noise.</bold><space/>Mistakes in grammar can disrupt communication, such as abrupt changes in<space/><link><target>Grammatical tense</target><part>verb tense</part></link><space/>during a sentence.</listitem><listitem><bold>Organizational noise.</bold><space/>Poorly structured communication can prevent the receiver from accurate interpretation. For example, unclear and badly stated directions can make the receiver even more lost.</listitem><listitem><bold>Cultural noise.</bold><space/>Stereotypical assumptions can cause misunderstandings, such as unintentionally offending a non-Christian person by wishing them a &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;.</listitem><listitem><bold>Psychological noise.</bold><space/>Certain attitudes can also make communication difficult. For instance, great anger or sadness may cause someone to lose focus on the present moment. Disorders such as<space/><link><target>autism</target></link><space/>may also severely hamper effective communication.<extension extension_name='ref'>Roy M. Berko, et al., Communicating. 11th ed.
