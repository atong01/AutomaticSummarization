It is not clear how these various traditions relate to each other, or whether they come from the same tradition; it is very possible that these references are to different men with the same name. The<space/><italics><link><target>Historia Brittonum</target></link></italics><space/>dates the battle of Guoloph to &quot;the twelfth year of Vortigern&quot;, by which 437 seems to be meant.

Subsequent historians accepted Myers' speculation as fact, creating a narrative of events in 5th century Britain with various degrees of elaborate detail.
