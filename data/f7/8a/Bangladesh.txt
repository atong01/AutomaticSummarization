It is bordered by [[India]] to its west, north and east; [[Myanmar|Myanmar (Burma)]] to its southeast; and is separated from [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]] by the [[Siliguri Corridor|Chicken’s Neck]] corridor. To its south, it faces the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Bangladesh is the world's [[List of countries by population|eighth-most populous country]], with over [[Demographics of Bangladesh|168 million people]]. It is one of the [[List of countries by population density|most densely populated countries]], and among countries with a population exceeding 10 million, it is the most densely populated. It forms part of the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]], along with the neighbouring Indian states of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]].

The present-day borders of Bangladesh took shape during the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal]] and the [[Partition of India|British India]] in 1947, when the [[East Bengal|region]] came to be known as [[East Pakistan]], as a part of the newly formed state of [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. It was separated from [[West Pakistan]] by {{convert|1,400|km}} of Indian territory. Because of political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination and economic neglect by the politically dominant western wing, [[Bengali nationalism|nationalism]], popular agitation and [[civil disobedience]] led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and independence in 1971. After independence, the new state endured poverty, famine, political turmoil and [[Military coups in Bangladesh|military coups]]. The [[Bangladeshi constitutional referendum, 1991|restoration of democracy in 1991]] has been followed by relative calm and economic progress. In 2014, the Bangladeshi general election was boycotted by major opposition parties, resulting in a parliament and government dominated by the [[Awami League]] and its smaller coalition partners.

Bangladesh is a unitary [[parliamentary republic]] with an elected parliament called the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]]. The native [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] form the country's largest ethnic group, along with [[Ethnic groups in Bangladesh|indigenous peoples]] in northern and [[Chittagong Hill Tracts|southeastern]] districts. Geographically, the country is dominated by the fertile [[Bengal delta]], the world's largest delta. This also gives Bangladesh a unique name tag as "the land of rivers".

It contributes one of the largest [[Bangladesh UN Peacekeeping Force|peacekeeping forces]] to the [[United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations]]. It is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

== Etymology == <!--linked-->

While the word "Bengali" is generally used to refer to [[Bengali people|people of ethnic Bengali descent]] in Bangladesh including those living in India and other countries, the demonym "[[Bangladeshi]]" is used to describe all citizens of Bangladesh, including non-Bengalis. The origin of the name [[Bengal]] (known as ''Bangla'' and ''Bongo'' in [[Bengali language]]) is unknown. One theory suggests that the word derives from "Bang", a [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] tribe that settled the region around 1000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+bd0014%29|title= Bangladesh: early history, 1000&nbsp;B.C.–A.D. 1202 |date=September 1988 |work= Bangladesh: A country study|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|location= Washington, D.C. |accessdate=1 December 2014|quote=Historians believe that Bengal, the area comprising present-day Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, was settled in about 1000 B.C. by Dravidian-speaking peoples who were later known as the Bang. Their homeland bore various titles that reflected earlier tribal names, such as Vanga, Banga, Bangala, Bangal, and Bengal.}}</ref> The word might have been derived from the ancient [[Vanga Kingdom|kingdom of ''Vanga'']] (or ''Banga''), which came from the [[Austric]] word "Bonga" meaning the Sun-god.<ref>{{cite book |last=SenGupta |first1=Amitabh |title=Scroll Paintings of Bengal: Art in the Village |publisher=AuthorHouse UK |date=14 June 2012 |page=14 |isbn=978-1467896634 |accessdate=16 February 2015 }}</ref> The [[Indo-Aryan language|Indo-Aryan]] suffix "''(-desh)''" is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''{{IAST|deśha-}}'' ("region, province, country") (see [[Desi]]) means "land" or "country" in Bengali language, so ''Bangladesh'' means "The land of Bengal".

The earliest reference to "Vangala" (''Bangla'') has been traced in the Nesari plates (805 AD) of [[Rashtrakuta]] [[Govinda III]] which speak of [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] as the king of Vangala. The records of [[Rajendra Chola I]] of the [[Chola dynasty]], who invaded Bengal in the 11th century, speak of [[Govindachandra]] as the ruler of Vangaladesa.<ref>Keay, John (2011) ''India: A History''.

From 1517 onwards, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders from Malacca and Goa were traversing the sea routes to Bengal. In 1528 they were permitted to open factories and customs houses in [[Chittagong]], which grew into the settlement of ''[[Porto Grande De Bengala|Porto Grande]]''. [[Sher Shah Suri]] conquered Bengal in 1538. He developed the [[Grand Trunk Road]] from [[Kabul]] to Chittagong. The [[Sur dynasty]] was replaced by the Afghan [[Karrani dynasty|Karranis]] in 1564. The decline of the Bengal Sultanate increased the power of the aristocracy, giving rise to the [[Baro-Bhuyan]] landlords. Led by [[Isa Khan]], the Baro-Bhuyans controlled much of eastern Bengal in the late 16th-century. They put up stiff resistance to the expansion of the Mughals, the Ahom kingdom and the Koch dynasty. The [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] was formed in 1530 and placed Chittagong under Arakanese rule. [[Mrauk U]] was a focal point for medieval Bengali literary activities, as the royal court of Arakan became a haven for Muslim writers and bureaucrats.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yegar, Moshe |title=Between Integration and Secession: The Muslim Communities of the Southern Philippines, Southern Thailand, and Western Burma/Myanmar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S5q7qxi5LBgC&pg=PA24 |date=2002 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=978-0-7391-0356-2 |pages=24–}}</ref>

The [[Mughal Empire]] controlled Bengal at the end of the 16th century. [[Dhaka]] was renamed as [[Jahangir Nagar]] and became an important Mughal administrative centre. The Mughals promoted agrarian reform.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> During the reign of [[Akbar]], the Bengali calendar was modified in line with the Islamic hijri. The region witnessed a boom in manufacturing and agriculture, as exports grew and integration into the world economy increased. [[Shaista Khan]] defeated the Arakanese and retook Chittagong in 1666.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> The decline of Mughal power in the 18th-century led to the formation of the [[Principality of Bengal]]. The [[Nawabs of Bengal]] presided over a period of increasing influence from European traders. Bengal was probably the wealthiest part of the subcontinent until the 18th century.

===British rule===
{{Main|British Raj}}
[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|British rule began with [[Robert Clive]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757]]
The [[British East India Company]] gained control of Bengal after defeating its last independent [[Siraj-ud-Daulah|Nawab]] at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757. [[Company Raj|Company rule]] saw the formation of the [[Bengal Presidency]]. The company instituted the [[Permanent Settlement]] in 1793. At its peak, the presidency's jurisdiction included large parts of North India, Burma and the Malacca Straits. The [[1857 Mutiny|mutiny of 1857]] resulted in the transfer of authority directly to the British crown under a viceregal government.<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter]], pp. 30–32</ref> After the foundation of the [[British Indian Empire]], Bengal was still under the heavy influence of British culture, including architecture, education and art. The region was a hotbed of revolutionary and [[Indian independence movement|anti-colonial movements]] to overthrow the [[British Empire]]. Between 1905 and 1911, an [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|abortive partition]] created the short lived province of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]].<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter]], pp. 39–40</ref>

The [[Indian provincial elections, 1937|1937 elections]] ushered the first democratically elected government in the region. [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] of the [[Krishak Praja Party]] became the first elected [[Prime Minister of Bengal|Premier of British Bengal]]. The [[Lahore Resolution]] was adopted in 1942. It called for the creation of independent states in eastern and northwestern British India. The Muslim League formed a coalition government in 1943, with Sir [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]] as premier.

During the [[Second World War]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japanese Air Force]] conducted air raids in Chittagong.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19420509&id=WP0tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aNQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4560,1489075 Nippon Bombers Raid Chittagong].

Following the exit of the [[British Empire]] in 1947, Bengal was [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partitioned]] along religious lines, with the western part going to newly created India and the eastern part (Muslim majority) joining [[Pakistan]] as a province called [[East Bengal]] (later renamed [[East Pakistan]]), with Dhaka as its capital.<ref name="collins">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=L |author2=D Lapierre |year=1986 |title=Freedom at Midnight, Ed. 18 |publisher=Vikas Publishers, New Delhi |isbn=0-7069-2770-2}}</ref>

It agitated for [[Six point movement|autonomy]] in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] (Mujib), was jailed; he was released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising. In 1970, a massive [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] devastated the coast of East Pakistan, killing up to half a million people,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1483615/Bangladesh-cyclone-of-1991 Bangladesh cyclone of 1991].

The anger of the Bengali population was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose [[Awami League]] had won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections,<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter]], pp. 78–79</ref> was blocked from taking office.
After staging compromise talks with Mujibur Rahman, President [[Yahya Khan]] and military officials launched [[Operation Searchlight]],<ref name="salik">{{cite book |last=Salik |first=Siddiq |year=1978 |title=Witness to Surrender |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-577264-4}}</ref> a sustained military assault on East Pakistan, and arrested Mujibur Rahman in the early hours of 26 March 1971.

Awami League leaders set up a government-in-exile in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India. The exile government formally took oath at Meherpur, in the Kustia district of East Pakistan, on 17 April 1971, with [[Tajuddin Ahmad]] as the first Prime Minister and Syed Nazrul Islam as the Acting President. The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] lasted for nine months. A resistance force known as the [[Mukti Bahini]] was formed from the [[Bangladesh Forces]] (consisting of Bengali regular forces) in alliance with civilian fighters such as the [[Kader Bahini]] and the [[Hemayet Bahini]]. Led by General [[M. A. G. Osmani]], the Bangladesh Forces were organized into [[list of Sectors in Bangladesh Liberation War|eleven sectors]] and, as part of Mukti Bahini, conducted a massive guerrilla war against the Pakistan Forces. The war witnessed the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]], in which the [[Pakistan Army]] and its allied religious militias carried out a wide-scale elimination of Bengali civilians, intellectuals, youth, students, politicians, activists and religious minorities. By winter, [[Mitro Bahini|Bangladesh-India Allied Forces]] defeated the Pakistan Army, culminating in its [[Surrender of Pakistan|surrender]] and the Liberation of Dhaka on 16 December 1971.

[[File:Sheikh Mujib Bangladesh Constitution.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]] [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] signs the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] into law on 16 December 1972]]
After independence, the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] established a unitary secular multiparty parliamentary democratic system. The Awami League won the first general elections in 1973 with a massive mandate, gaining an absolute parliamentary majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974,<ref name="sen" /> and in early 1975, Mujib initiated a one-party socialist rule with his newly formed [[BAKSAL]]. On 15 August 1975, Mujib and most of his family members were assassinated by mid-level military officers.<ref name="mascarenhas">{{cite book |last=Mascarenhas |first=A |year=1986 |title=Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton, London |isbn=0-340-39420-X |oclc=13004864 16583315 242251870}}</ref> Vice President Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed was sworn in as President with most of Mujib's cabinet intact. Two Army uprisings on 3 and 7 November 1975 led to a reorganised structure of power. A [[state of emergency]] was declared to restore order and calm. Mushtaq resigned, and the country was placed under temporary martial law, with three service chiefs serving as deputies to the new president, Justice Abu Sayem, who also became the Chief Martial Law Administrator. Lieutenant General [[Ziaur Rahman]] took over the presidency in 1977 when Justice Sayem resigned. President Zia reinstated multi-party politics, introduced free markets, and founded the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP). Zia's rule ended when he was assassinated by elements of the military in 1981.<ref name="mascarenhas" />
Bangladesh's next major ruler was Lieutenant General [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]], who gained power in a coup on 24 March 1982, and ruled until 6 December 1990, when he was forced to resign after a revolt of all major political parties and the public, along with pressure from Western donors (which was a major shift in international policy after the fall of the Soviet Union).
[[File:Ziaur Rahman 1979.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Lieutenant General|Lt General]] [[Ziaur Rahman]] served as [[President of Bangladesh|President]] (1977–1981) and [[Chief Martial Law Administrator|CMLA]] (1977–1979)]]

Since then, Bangladesh has reverted to a parliamentary democracy. Zia's widow, [[Khaleda Zia]], led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to parliamentary victory at the general election in 1991 and became the first female Prime Minister in Bangladeshi history. However, the Awami League, headed by [[Sheikh Hasina]], one of Mujib's surviving daughters, won the next election in 1996. The Awami League lost again to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in 2001. Widespread political unrest followed the resignation of the BNP in late October 2006, but the caretaker government worked to bring the parties to election within the required ninety days. At the last minute in early January, the Awami League withdrew from the election scheduled for later that month. On 11 January 2007, the military intervened to support both a state of emergency and a continuing but neutral caretaker government under a newly appointed [[Chief Advisor]], who was not a politician. The country had suffered for decades from extensive corruption,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4353334.stm |title=Bangladesh tops most corrupt list |publisher=BBC News |date=18 October 2005 |accessdate=13 April 2007 |first=Waliur |last=Rahman}}</ref> disorder, and political violence. The caretaker government worked to root out corruption from all levels of government. It arrested on corruption charges more than 160 people, including politicians, civil servants, and businessmen, among whom were both major party leaders, some of their senior staff, and two sons of Khaleda Zia.

After working to clean up the system, the caretaker government held what was described by observers as a largely free and fair election on 29 December 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/world/asia/30iht-bangla.5.19007747.html|title=Bangladesh election seen as fair, though loser disputes result|work=The New York Times|date=30 November 2008}}</ref> The Awami League's Sheikh Hasina won with a two-thirds landslide in the elections; she took the oath of Prime Minister on 6 January 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/06/us-bangladesh-hasina-idUSTRE5053GG20090106 |title= Hasina takes oath as new Bangladesh prime minister|agency=Reuters |date= 6 January 2009|accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Bangladesh}}
[[File:Satellite image of Bangladesh in October 2001.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Bangladesh from space, including [[Ganges Delta]], the world's largest delta with its three distributaries- [[Padma]], [[Meghna]] and [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]]]]
The geography of Bangladesh is divided between three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile [[Ganges-Brahmaputra delta]]. The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the [[Madhupur tract|Madhupur]] and the [[Barind Tract|Barind]] plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to [[evergreen]] hill ranges. The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name [[Padma River|Padma]] or ''Pôdda''), [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] ([[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] or ''Jomuna''), and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The [[Alluvium|alluvial soil]] deposited by the rivers when they overflow their banks has created some of the most fertile plains in the world. Bangladesh has 57 [[trans-boundary river]]s, making water issues politically complicated to resolve&nbsp;– in most cases as the lower [[riparian zone|riparian]] state to India.<ref>{{cite book | last = Suvedī | first = Sūryaprasāda | title = International watercourses law for the 21st century | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year = 2005 | pages = 154–166 | isbn = 0-7546-4527-4}}</ref>

The country is predominated by rich fertile flat land. Most parts of Bangladesh are less than {{convert|12|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of the land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by {{convert|1|m|ft|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="ali">{{cite journal|last=Ali |first=A |year=1996 |title=Vulnerability of Bangladesh to climate change and sea level rise through tropical cyclones and storm surges |doi = 10.1007/BF00175563|journal=Water, Air, & Soil Pollution |volume=92 |issue=1–2 |pages=171–179}}</ref> 17% of the country is covered by forests and 12% is covered by hill systems. The country's [[haor]] wetlands are of significant importance to global environmental science.

In southeastern Bangladesh, experiments have been done since the 1960s to 'build with nature'. Construction of cross dams has induced a natural accretion of silt, creating new land. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began promoting the development of this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has become a multiagency endeavor, building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some {{convert|27000|acre|ha|0|abbr=on}} to 21,000 families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/bangladesh-fights-survival-against-climate-change|title="Bangladesh fights for survival against climate change", by William Wheeler and Anna-Katarina Gravgaard, The Washington Times |publisher=Pulitzercenter.org |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref>

In September 1998, Bangladesh saw [[1998 Bangladesh floods|the most severe flooding]] in modern world history. As the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and [[Meghna]] spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, {{convert|9700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of road and {{convert|2700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of embankment, 1,000&nbsp;people were killed and 30&nbsp;million more were made homeless, with 135,000 cattle killed, {{convert|50|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of land destroyed and {{convert|11000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of roads damaged or destroyed. Two-thirds of the country was underwater.
There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding. Firstly, there were unusually high [[monsoon]] rains. Secondly, the [[Himalayas]] shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Thirdly, trees that usually would have intercepted rain water had been cut down for firewood or to make space for animals.<ref name="EWG">{{cite book |last=Haggett|first=Peter |title= Encyclopedia of World Geography |url= https://books.google.com/?id=IROIY4ONOSEC&pg=PA2634|accessdate=2 May 2008 |publisher= Marshall Cavendish |year= 2002|location= New York |isbn=0-7614-7308-4 |oclc= 46578454|pages=2, 634 |chapter=The Indian Subcontinent |origyear=2002 }}</ref>

Bangladesh is located in the [[Indomalaya ecozone]]. Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerous [[List of rivers in Bangladesh|rivers and tributaries]], lakes, [[wetland]]s, [[evergreen]] forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moist [[deciduous forest]]s, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertile [[alluvial]] soil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of [[mango]], [[jackfruit]], [[bamboo]], [[betel nut]], [[coconut]] and [[date palm]].<ref name="global.britannica.com">[http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/51736/Bangladesh/33426/Plant-and-animal-life Bangladesh | history – geography :: Plant and animal life].

[[Nymphaeaceae|Water lilies]] and [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotuses]] grow vividly during the [[monsoon]]. The country has [[List of protected areas of Bangladesh|50 wildlife sanctuaries]].

Bangladesh is home to much of the [[Sundarbans]], the world's largest [[mangrove forest]]. It covers an area of 6,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries- the [[Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary|South]], [[Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary|East]] and [[Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary|West]] zones.The forest is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The northeastern [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet region]] is home to [[haor]] wetlands, which is a unique ecosystem. It also includes [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]], a [[freshwater swamp forest]] and mixed [[deciduous forest]]s. The southeastern [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong region]] covers [[evergreen]] and semi evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland [[Sal (tree)|Sal]] forest running along the districts of [[Gazipur District|Gazipur]], [[Tangail]] and [[Mymensingh]]. [[St. Martin's Island]] is the only [[coral reef]] in the country.

Several animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one horned and two horned [[rhinoceros]] and common [[peafowl]]. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, hence limiting deforestation to a certain extent. However, rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. Though many areas are protected under law, a large portion of Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. The [[Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act]] was enacted in 1995. The government has designated several regions as [[Ecologically Critical Area]]s, including wetlands, forests and rivers. The [[Sundarbans tiger project|Sundarbans Tiger Project]] and the Bangladesh Bear Project are among the key initiatives to strengthen conservation.<ref name="bearprojectbd.weebly.com"/>

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Bangladesh}}
{{See also|Constitution of Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[multiparty]] [[parliamentary republic]], based on the [[Westminster system]] of [[unicameral]] parliamentary government. The system was established after independence under the widely hailed [[Constitution of Bangladesh|1972 Constitution]].<ref name="ipcs.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcs.org/article/bangladesh/bangladesh-domestic-politics-and-external-actors-4313.html|title=Dhaka Discourse|work=Institute of Peace & Conflict Studies – Bangladesh: Domestic Politics and External Actors}}</ref> [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] was the preeminent national leader in the early years of independence. Between 1975 and 1990, the country was governed under a [[presidential republic]], initially established under [[BAKSAL]], and adopted later by military-backed governments. President [[Ziaur Rahman]] reinstated multiparty politics in 1978. President [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] ruled the nation for seven years until his resignation in 1991, following a popular uprising for the restoration of parliamentary democracy.

Since 1991, Bangladesh has essentially been under a [[two party system]], in which the [[Awami League]] and the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) have alternated in power. A [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker government]] system was introduced in 1996 to oversee neutral elections under interim administrations. The Awami League has aligned itself with secular and leftist parties, while the BNP is aligned with right-wing and Islamist parties. The two alliances are respectively led by Sheikh Hasina and [[Khaleda Zia]]. A political crisis in 2006 led to a two-year [[2006-2008 Bangladeshi political crisis|state of emergency]], when the country was ruled by a military-backed caretaker government. Elections in 2008 saw the Awami League return to power with a landslide majority. The League repealed the caretaker government system in 2011. The Khaleda Zia-led BNP and other major opposition groups boycotted the next [[Bangladeshi general election, 2014|general election]] in 2014, amid concerns over vote rigging. This resulted in a clean sweep by the Awami League and its allies.

Bangladesh is ranked by [[Freedom House]] as "Partly Free" in its ''[[Freedom in the World]]'' report.<ref>[https://freedomhouse.org/country/bangladesh Bangladesh]. Freedom House. Retrieved on 27 April 2015.</ref> The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] classifies the country as a [[hybrid regime]], which is the third best rank out of four in its [[Democracy Index]]. Bangladeshi politics is dominated by the bitter personal rivalry between Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia.

[[File:Russia-Bangladeshi talks Moscow 2013-01-15 11.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2011]]
Bangladesh's foreign policy follows a principle of ''friendship to all and malice to none'', which was first articulated by Bengali statesman [[H. S.

It was twice elected to the [[UN Security Council]] in 1978 and 2000. [[Humayun Rashid Choudhury|H R Choudhury]] served as [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]].

During the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, Bangladesh contributed 2,300 troops to the US-led multinational coalition for the liberation of Kuwait. It has since become the world's largest contributor to [[UN peacekeeping]] operations, providing 113,000 personnel to 54 UN missions in the Middle East, the Balkans, [[Africa]] and the Caribbean, as of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afd.gov.bd/index.php/un-peacekeeping/bangladesh-in-un-mission|title=Bangladesh in UN Mission|author=Armed Forces Division|publisher=afd.gov.bd}}</ref> Bangladeshi aid agencies work in many developing countries worldwide.

Key to Bangladesh's self-assertiveness is its desire to project the [[soft power]] of Bengali culture and democratic politics. It also relies on its Islamic heritage, being the world's third largest Muslim-majority country, and enjoys fraternal relations with many nations in the [[Muslim world]]. It is a founding member of the [[Developing 8]], along with [[Turkey]], [[Malaysia]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Nigeria]], Pakistan and [[Indonesia]].<ref name="countrystudies.us"/> It has been a member of the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]] since 1973.

As part of efforts to stimulate regional development plans, Bangladesh has been instrumental in organizing regional economic cooperation in the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] of South Asia.<ref name="countrystudies.us"/> The [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] ([[SAARC]]) was founded in Dhaka in 1985. Since then, three Bangladeshis have served as its [[Secretary-General]]. The Bangladeshi capital also hosts the headquarters of the [[Bay of Bengal Initiative]] ([[BIMSTEC]]). Located on the western doorstep of [[Southeast Asia]], Bangladesh has prioritized on building economic, political and strategic relations with member states of [[ASEAN]]. Other regional groupings where it s a key member include the [[BCIM]], [[BBIN]], the [[ASEAN Regional Forum]] and the [[Indian Ocean Rim Association]].

Bangladesh has not always had good relations with neighboring India. Relations are bounded by shared history, cultural affinities and India's support for the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. The two nations were initially very strong allies, but differences soon emerged over water sharing, border security and trade barriers. Bangladesh distanced itself from the Indo-Soviet Cold War axis in South Asia, and pursued stronger relations with Western countries.<ref>https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=cVNRX5QRXTkC&pg=PA240&dq=ziaur+rahman+foreign+policy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rRKPVOWgHIOXuQTGjIHADQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ziaur%20rahman%20foreign%20policy&f=false</ref> Any hint of Indian intimidation or enroachment on territorial rights elicited a strong nationalistic response from all levels of Bangladeshi society.<ref name="countrystudies.us"/> Relations have rapidly improved after some time. The two countries have resolved long pending border disputes, and have forged joint initiatives in counter-terrorism, energy security and developing transport links. Bangladesh and India are today the largest trading partners in South Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/tnvtYZ1HPZtnhQSACSgI9I/Bangladesh-now-Indias-largest-trading-partner-in-subcontine.html|title=Bangladesh now India’s largest trading partner in subcontinent|work=http://www.livemint.com/|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref>

Bangladesh enjoys very warm relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Russian Federation]]. Economic cooperation between Dhaka and the two major powers have rapidly increased. China is both a major trade partner and defense supplier to Bangladesh. A civilian nuclear agreement with Russia in 2011. The Bangladesh Armed Forces operate Russian and Chinese fighter jets, tanks, frigates and missiles.

Bangladesh is an important strategic ally of the [[United States]] in South Asia. The two countries enjoy robust strategic cooperation in defense, [[maritime security]], and [[counter-terrorism]].

Divisions are subdivided into districts (''zila''). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into ''upazila'' (subdistricts) or ''thana''. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several ''[[Union Councils of Bangladesh|unions]]'', with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into ''mahallas''. There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.<ref>''Local Government Act'', No. 20, 1997</ref>

a very high level for a low-income country. This has been achieved to a
large extent through the construction of handpumps with the support of 
external donors. However, in 1993 it was discovered that groundwater, 
the source of drinking water for 97% of the rural population and a 
significant share of the urban population, is in many cases naturally [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|contaminated with arsenic]].

Another challenge is the low level of cost recovery due to low tariffs and poor [[economic efficiency]], especially in urban areas where revenues from water sales do not even cover operating costs.

[[File:BD Porabarir Chamcham.JPG|thumb|[[Cham cham]], a traditional sweet in Bangladeshi cuisine]]
The culinary tradition of Bangladesh has close relations to surrounding Bengali and North-East Indian cuisine as well as having its own unique traits. Rice and fish are traditional favourites. With an emphasis on fish, vegetables and lentils served with rice as a staple diet. [[Biryani]] is a favourite dish of Bangladesh and this includes egg biryani, mutton biryani and beef biryani. Bengaladeshi cuisine is known for its subtle (yet sometimes fiery) flavours, and its huge spread of confectioneries and desserts. Bangladeshis make distinctive [[confectionary|sweetmeats]] from milk products, some common ones being ''[[Rasgulla|Rôshogolla]]'', ''Rasmalai'', ''Rôshomalai'', ''chômchôm'' and ''kalojam''.
It also has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the [[Indian subcontinent]] that is analogous in structure to the modern ''[[service à la russe]]'' style of [[French cuisine]], with food served course-wise rather than all at once.

{{Main|Bangladesh textile industry|Textile arts of Bangladesh}}
The [[Sari]] ({{lang|bn|শাড়ি}} ''shaŗi'') is the traditional dress for Bangladeshi woman and by far the most widely worn dress by Bangladeshi womem.

[[File:Shaheed Minar on 21st February.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]], as displayed on the annual anniversary of Bengali [[Language Movement Day]] ([[International Mother Language Day]])]]
The Muslim holidays of [[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]], the [[Pohela Boishakh|Bengali New Year]], [[Independence Day (Bangladesh)|Independence day]], [[Victory Day (Bangladesh)|Victory Day]], the Hindu festivals of [[Durga Puja]] and [[Krishna Janmashtami]],<!--Please note that remembrance is a major part of Language Movement Day and therefore can't be classed as a celebration--> the Buddhist festival of [[Vesak|Buddha Purnima]], which marks the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Christmas]], called ''Borodin'' (" the Great day"), are [[Public holidays in Bangladesh|national holidays]] in Bangladesh and see the most widespread celebrations in the country.

''[[Pohela Boishakh]]'', the Bengali new year, is the major festival of [[Culture of Bengal|Bengali culture]] and sees widespread festivities. Of the major holidays celebrated in Bangladesh, only ''Pohela Boishakh'' comes without any preexisting expectations (specific religious identity, culture of gift-giving, etc.). Unlike holidays like Eid al-Fitr, where dressing up in lavish clothes has become a norm, or Christmas where exchanging gifts has become an integral part of the holiday, Pohela Boishakh is really about celebrating the simpler, rural roots of the Bengal. As a result, more people can participate in the festivities together without the burden of having to reveal one's class, religion, or financial capacity. Other cultural festivals include [[Nabanna|Nabonno]], and ''Poush porbon'' (festival of [[Poush]]), both Bengali harvest festivals.

Alongside these are national days like the remembrance of 21 February 1952 [[Language Movement Day]] ([[International Mother Language Day]]), Independence Day and [[Victory day of Bangladesh|Victory Day]]. On Language Movement Day, people congregate at the [[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]] in Dhaka to remember the national heroes of the [[Bengali Language Movement]], and at the [[Jatiyo Smriti Soudho]] on Independence Day and Victory Day to remember the national heroes of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. These occasions are observed with public ceremonies, parades, rallies by citizens, political speeches, fairs, concerts, and various other public and private events celebrating the history and traditions of Bangladesh. TV and radio stations broadcast special programs and patriotic songs. And many schools and colleges organise fairs, festivals, and concerts in which citizens from all levels of society can participate.
