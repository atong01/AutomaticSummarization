'''Afrobeat''' is a combination of traditional [[Ghana]] music, [[jazz]], [[highlife]], [[funk]], and [[chant]]ed vocals,<ref name="rebel"/> fused with [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] and [[vocal]] styles, popularised in [[Africa]] in the 1970s. It was named by [[Nigeria]]n multi-[[Musician|instrumentalist]] and [[bandleader]] [[Fela Kuti]], who is responsible for the creation of the style and spreading the genre outside of [[Ghana]].<ref name="rebel">{{cite journal |last1=Grass  |first1=Randall F. |last2= |first2= |year= |title=Fela Anikulapo-Kuti: The Art of an Afrobeat Rebel |journal=The Drama Review: TDR |publisher=MIT Press |volume=30 |issue= |pages=131–148 |jstor=1145717 |doi= 10.2307/1145717}}</ref> Fela used it to revolutionize musical structure as well as the political context in his native Nigeria. It was Kuti who coined the term "afrobeat" upon his return from a U.S. tour with his group Nigeria '70 (formerly Koola Lobitos). Afrobeat features [[chant]]s, [[call-and-response]] vocals, and complex, interacting rhythms.<ref name="rebel"/>

The new sound hailed from a club that he established called the [[New Afrika Shrine|Afrika Shrine]]. Upon arriving in Nigeria, Kuti also changed the name of his group to Africa '70. The band maintained a five-year residency in the Afrika Shrine from 1970 to 1975 while afrobeat thrived among Nigerian youth. Afrobeat is now one of the most recognizable music genres in the world and has influenced as many Western musicians as it has African ones with its exuberant style and [[polyrhythm]]s.

==Origins==

Afrobeat originated from Ghana [[highlife]] and heavy African drumbeats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ghana-soundz-afrobeat-funk-and-fusion-in-the-70s-mw0000259942|title=Ghana Soundz: Afrobeat, Funk and Fusion in the 70's - Various Artists - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Chris Nickson|work=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldmusiccentral.org/2013/08/29/the-infectious-songs-of-ghanaian-afrobeat/|title=The Infectious Songs of Ghanaian Afrobeat|work=worldmusiccentral.org}}</ref> It was later exported to the southern part of [[Nigeria]] in the 1970s, Fela Kuti, experimented with many different forms of contemporary music of the time.<ref>{{cite web | date=18 July 2012 | author=Clyde Macfarlane |url=http://thinkafricapress.com/ghana/album-review-konkoma-afrobeat-highlife |title=Album Review: KonKoma |publisher=Think Africa Press |date=2012-07-18 |accessdate=2015-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/blog/post/radio-afrobeat-airwaves|title=Radio: AfroBeat Airwaves|work=Rhapsody}}</ref> Prevalent in his and [[Lagbaja]]'s music are native African harmonies and rhythms, taking different elements and combining, modernizing, and improvising upon them. [[Politics]] are essential to Afrobeat, since founder Kuti used social criticism to pave the way for social change. His message can be described as confrontational and controversial, which can be related to the political climate of most of the African countries in the 1970s, many of which were dealing with political injustice and military corruption while recovering from the transition from colonial governments to self-determination. As the genre spread throughout the African continent many bands took up the style. The recordings of these bands and their songs were rarely heard or exported outside the originating countries but many can now be found on [[compilation album]]s and [[CD]]s from specialist record shops.

==Influence==
Many [[jazz]] musicians have been attracted to afrobeat. From [[Roy Ayers]] in the 1970s to [[Randy Weston]] in the 1990s, there have been collaborations that have resulted in albums such as ''Africa: Centre of the World'' by Roy Ayers, released on the [[Polydor Records|Polydore]] label in 1981. In 1994 [[Branford Marsalis]], the American jazz saxophonist, included samples of Fela's "Beast of No Nation" on his ''[[Buckshot LeFonque (album)|Buckshot LeFonque]]'' album. The new generation of [[Disc Jockey|DJs]] and musicians of the 2000s who have fallen in love with both Kuti's material and other rare releases have made compilations and [[remix]]es of these recordings, thus re-introducing the genre to new generations of listeners and fans of [[Afro pop music|afropop]] and [[Groove (music)|groove]] (see [[#afrobeats|Afrobeats]] section below).

Afrobeat has profoundly influenced important contemporary producers and musicians like [[Brian Eno]] and [[David Byrne]], who credit Fela Kuti as an essential influence. Both worked on [[Talking Heads]]' highly acclaimed 1980 album ''[[Remain In Light]]'', which brought polyrhythmic afrobeat influences to Western music. More recently, the horn section of [[Antibalas]] have been guest musicians on [[TV On The Radio]]'s highly acclaimed 2008 album ''[[Dear Science]]'', as well as on British band [[Foals (band)|Foals]]' 2008 album, ''[[Antidotes]]''. Some Afrobeat influence can also be found in the music of [[Vampire Weekend]] and [[Paul Simon]].

===Afrobeats===
Recent years have seen the creation of the moniker ''Afrobeats''<ref>Dan Hancox, [http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/19/the-rise-of-afrobeats "The rise of Afrobeats"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 19 January 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26770178 Guide to Nigeria's Afrobeats stars]. By DJ Edu, [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]], 29 March 2014.</ref> (a term also sometimes used to denote popular [[Ghanaian music]], [[Hiplife]], [[Afro pop music|Afropop]] or popular [[Nigerian music]]) in which Afrobeat is often blended with [[highlife]], [[fuji music]], [[Jùjú music|Jùjú]], [[hiphop]], [[RnB]] and traditional Yoruba music.
