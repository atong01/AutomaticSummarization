Wadysaw, who wanted Cossacks on his side in the wars he planned, gave Khmelnytsky a royal charter, protecting his rights to the Subotiv estate. But, because of the structure of the Commonwealth at that time and the lawlessness of Ukraine, even the King was not able to prevent a confrontation with local magnates. In the beginning of 1647, Daniel Czapliski started to harass Khmelnytsky in order to force him off the land. On two occasions the magnate had Subotiv raided: considerable property damage was done and Khmelnytsky's son Yuriy was badly beaten. Finally, in April 1647, Czapliski succeeded in evicting Khmelnytsky from the land, and he was forced to move with his large family to a relative's house in Chyhyryn.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Anonymous Bohdan Khmelnytsky.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Portrait of Bohdan Khmelnytsky (c. 1650) in the District Museum in<space/><link><target>Tarnw</target></link>.

His activity raised suspicion among the local Polish authorities already used to Cossack revolts; he was promptly arrested.

What followed was a period of intermittent warfare and several peace treaties, which were seldom upheld. From the spring of 1649 on, the situation turned for the worse for the Cossacks, as Polish attacks increased in frequency, they became more successful. The resulting<space/><link><target>Treaty of Zboriv</target></link><space/>on 18 August 1649 was unfavourable for the Cossacks. This was followed by another defeat at the<space/><link><target>battle of Berestechko</target></link><space/>on 18 June 1651, where the Tatars betrayed Khmelnytsky and held the hetman captive. The Cossacks suffered a crushing defeat, with an estimated 30,000 casualties. They were forced to sign the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Bila Tserkva</target></link>, which favoured the PolishLithuanians. Warfare broke open again and, in the years that followed, the two sides were almost perpetually at war. In this situation the<space/><link><target>Crimean Tatars</target></link><space/>played a decisive role and did not allow either side to prevail. It was in their interests to keep both Ukraine and the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth from getting too strong and becoming an effective power in the region.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Subtelny"><link><target>Orest Subtelny</target></link>.<space/><italics>Ukraine.

Although the Cossacks had established their<space/><italics><link><target>de facto</target></link></italics><space/>independence from Poland, the new state needed legitimacy in 17th century Europe, which could be provided by a foreign monarch. In search of a protectorate, Khmelnytsky approached the<space/><link><target>Ottoman sultan</target></link><space/>in 1651 and formal embassies were exchanged. The Turks offered vassalship similar to their other arrangements with contemporary<space/><link><target>Khanate of Crimea</target><part>Crimea</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Moldavia</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Walachia</target></link>. However, the idea of a union with the<space/><link><target>Muslim</target></link><space/>monarch was not acceptable to the general populace and most Cossacks.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>The other possible ally was Orthodox<space/><link><target>Tsardom of Russia</target><part>Russia</part></link>. That government remained quite cautious and stayed away from the hostilities in Ukraine. In spite of numerous envoys and calls for help from Khmelnytsky in the name of the shared Orthodox faith, the Tsar preferred to wait until the threat of a Cossack-Ottoman union in 1653 finally forced him to action.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Subtelny"></extension><space/>The idea that the Tsar might be favourable to taking Ukraine under his hand was communicated to the hetman, and the diplomatic activity intensified.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Treaty with the<space/><link><target>Tsardom of Russia</target></link></heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Treaty of Pereyaslav</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>After a series of negotiations, it was agreed that the Cossacks would accept overlordship by the Tsar<space/><link><target>Alexei Mikhailovich</target></link>.

The treaty legitimized Russian claims to the capital of<space/><link><target>Kievan Rus'</target></link><space/>and strengthened the Tsar's influence in the region. Khmelnytsky needed the Treaty of Pereyaslav to gain a legitimate monarch's protection, as well as support from a friendly Orthodox power. Historians have differed in their reading of Khmelnytsky's goal with the union, as to whether it was to be a military union, a<space/><link><target>suzerainty</target></link>, or a complete incorporation of Ukraine into the<space/><link><target>Tsardom of Russia</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\P\E\PereiaslavTreatyof1654.htm'>&quot;Treaty of 1654&quot;</link>,<space/><italics>Encyclopedia of Ukraine</italics></extension></paragraph><paragraph>These differences were expressed during the ceremony of the oath of allegiance to the Tsar: the Russian envoy refused to reciprocate with an oath from the ruler to his subjects, which the Cossacks and Ruthenians expected, as it was the custom of the Polish king.

Charles X of Sweden had solicited his help because of the massive Polish popular opposition and resistance against the Swedes. Under blows from all sides, the Commonwealth barely survived.</paragraph><paragraph>Russia attacked Sweden in July 1656, at a time when its forces were deeply involved in Poland. That war ended in status quo two years later, but it complicated matters for Khmelnytsky, as his ally was now fighting his overlord. In addition to diplomatic tensions between the Tsar and Khmelnytsky, a number of other disagreements between the two surfaced. In particular, these concered Russian officials' interference in the finances of the<space/><link><target>Cossack Hetmanate</target><part>Hetmanate</part></link><space/>and in the newly captured Belarus. The Tsar concluded a separate treaty with the Poles in<space/><link><target>Vilnius</target></link><space/>in 1656. The Hetman's emissaries were not even allowed to attend the negotiations. Khmelnytsky wrote an irate letter to the Tsar accusing him of breaking the Pereyaslav agreement. He compared the Swedes to the Tsar, saying that the former were more honourable and trustworthy than the Russians.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Subtelny"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In Poland, the Cossack army and Transylvanian allies suffered a number of setbacks. As a result, Khmelnytsky had to deal with a Cossack rebellion on the home front.
