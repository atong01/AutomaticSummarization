'''Eureka''' is a city located in [[St. Louis County, Missouri]], United States between the cities of [[St. Louis]] and [[Pacific, Missouri|Pacific]] along [[Interstate 44]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 10,189.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), Eureka city, Missouri| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder 2| accessdate=October 21, 2011}}</ref> Since 1971, Eureka has been known as the home of the [[amusement park]] [[Six Flags St. Louis]] (formerly '''Six Flags Over Mid-America'''). Local news coverage for the town and some of its neighbors is provided by the ''[[Tri County Journal]]'', the ''Eureka Pacific Current NewsMagazine'', and the ''[[Washington Missourian]]''. The city is {{convert|2|mi|0}} west of the former [[Times Beach, Missouri|Times Beach]], the site of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination in the 1980s; the area was depopulated, cleaned up, and reopened as '''[[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] [[Route 66 State Park|State Park]]'''.

==History==
The village of Eureka was platted in 1858<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RfAuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA360#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=How Missouri Counties, Towns and Streams Were Named | publisher=The State Historical Society of Missouri | author=Eaton, David Wolfe | year=1918 | pages=360}}</ref> along the route of the [[Pacific Railroad]]. By 1890, the village consisted of about 100 homes.  According to the Eureka Chamber of Commerce, railroad workers while clearing way for the track and the next railroad camp saw Eureka, level land with little to clear, and declared, "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka!]]" Greek meaning "I have found it." Thus, Eureka was founded.  In 1898, Eureka became home to the St. Louis Children's Industrial Farm, established to give children from St. Louis [[tenement]] neighborhoods a chance to experience life in a rural setting. It later became Camp Wyman (now part of [[Wyman Center]]) and is one of the oldest camps in the United States.  Eureka was incorporated as a fourth-class city on April 7, 1954.

===City of Allenton===
The railroad town of Allenton is a former community on [[U.S. Route 66]] located (now) at the junction of [[Interstate 44]] and Business Loop 44 in western St. Louis County. In 1985, it was annexed by the city of Eureka. The town is currently rural, with adjacent farmland and forested [[Ozark]] ridges. This community was declared blighted by St. Louis County in 1973.
