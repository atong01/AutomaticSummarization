But it is an aesthetic of negation. &quot;To live and die before a mirror&quot;: that according to Baudelaire, was the dandy's slogan. It is indeed a coherent slogan. The dandy is, by occupation, always in opposition. He can only exist by defiance. Up to now, man derived his coherence from the Creator. But from the moment that he consecrates his rupture from Him, he finds himself delivered over to the fleeting moment, to the passing days, and to wasted sensibility. Therefore he must take himself in hand. The dandy rallies his forces and creates a unity for himself by the very violence of his refusal. Profligate, like all people without a rule of life, he is only coherent as an actor. But an actor implies a public; the dandy can only play a part by setting himself up in opposition. He can only be sure of his own existence by finding it in the expression of others' faces. Other people are his mirror. A mirror that quickly becomes clouded, it's true, since human capacity for attention is limited. It must be ceaselessly stimulated, spurred on by provocation. The dandy, therefore, is always compelled to astonish. Singularity is his vocation, excess his way to perfection. Perpetually incomplete, always on the fringe of things, he compels others to create him, while denying their values. He plays at life because he is unable to live it.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="first">Albert</arg><arg name="last">Camus</arg><arg name="authorlink">Albert Camus</arg><arg name="title">[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt]]</arg><arg name="date">2012</arg><arg name="publisher">Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group</arg><arg name="isbn">9780307827838</arg><arg name="page">51</arg><arg name="chapter-url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">11 October 2014</arg><arg name="chapter">II Metaphysical Rebellion</arg></template></extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Jean Baudrillard</target></link><space/>said that dandyism is &quot;an aesthetic form of nihilism&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/simulacra-and-simulations-xviii-on-nihilism/<space/></arg><arg name="title">Jean Baudrillard – Simulacra and Simulations – XVIII.
