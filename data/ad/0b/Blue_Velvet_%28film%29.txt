'''''Blue Velvet''''' is a 1986 American [[neo-noir]] [[mystery film]], written and directed by [[David Lynch]]. Blending [[psychological horror]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/25-most-disturbing-movies/|title=25 Most Disturbing Movies|publisher=gamesradar.com|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/25-best-horror-movies-since-the-shining/slideshow/21/|title=25 Best Horror Movies Since The Shining|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|date=October 25, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}</ref> with [[film noir]], the film stars [[Kyle MacLachlan]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Dennis Hopper]] and [[Laura Dern]]. The title is taken from [[Bobby Vinton]]'s 1963 [[Blue Velvet (song)|song of the same name]]. Although initially receiving a divided critical response, the film is now widely acclaimed as one of the greatest films of the 1980s,<ref name="rottentomatoes">{{cite web | title=Blue Velvet (1986) | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blue_velvet/ | accessdate=June 17, 2007 | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Blue Velvet (1986): Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/bluevelvet?q=blue%20velvet/ | accessdate=June 11, 2007 | publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> and earned Lynch his second [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Director. As an example of a director casting against the norm, ''Blue Velvet'' is also noted for re-launching Hopper's career and for providing Rossellini with a dramatic outlet beyond the work as a fashion model and a cosmetics spokeswoman, for which she had until then been known.

After the commercial and critical failure of Lynch's ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984), he made attempts at developing a more "personal story", somewhat characteristic of the [[surrealism|surrealist]] style he displayed in his debut ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977). The screenplay of ''Blue Velvet'' had been passed around multiple times in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with many major studios declining it because of its strong sexual and violent content.<ref name="rodley">{{cite book | last=Lynch | first=David | authorlink=David Lynch |others=Edited by Chris Rodley | title=Lynch on Lynch | publisher=[[Faber & Faber]] | date=March 24, 2005 | isbn=0-571-22018-5 }}</ref> The independent studio [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]], owned at the time by Italian film producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]], agreed to finance and produce the film.

Since its initial theatrical release, ''Blue Velvet'' has achieved [[cult film|cult]] status, significant academic attention and is widely regarded as Lynch's finest work. ''Blue Velvet'' is consistently ranked among the greatest American films of all time by various publications, including ''[[Time Magazine]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and BBC Magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150720-the-100-greatest-american-films|title=The 100 greatest American films|publisher=BBC|date=July 2015}}</ref> It was also chosen by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the [[AFI's 10 Top 10|greatest mystery films ever made]].

==Plot==
Jeffrey Beaumont ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]) returns to his logging home town of Lumberton, North Carolina from Oak Lake College after his father suffers a near-fatal stroke. While walking home from the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams ([[George Dickerson]]), through whom he reacquaints with the detective's daughter, Sandy ([[Laura Dern]]). She tells him details about the ear case and a suspicious woman, Dorothy Vallens ([[Isabella Rossellini]]), who may be connected to the case. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator, and while Dorothy is distracted by a man dressed in a yellow suit at her door (whom Jeffrey later refers to as the Yellow Man), Jeffrey steals her spare key.

Jeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's nightclub act, in which she sings "[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]", and leave early so Jeffrey can sneak into her apartment to snoop. He hurriedly hides in a closet when she returns home. However, Dorothy, wielding a knife, discovers him and threatens to kill him. Believing his curiosity is merely sexual and aroused by his voyeurism, Dorothy makes Jeffrey undress at knifepoint and begins to [[Fellatio|fellate]] him before their encounter is interrupted by a knock at the door. Dorothy hides Jeffrey in the closet. From there he witnesses the visitor, [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]), inflict his bizarre sexual proclivities—which include inhaling an unidentified gas (possibly nitrous oxide), [[Non-penetrative sex|dry humping]], and [[sadomasochism]]—upon Dorothy. Frank is an extremely foul-mouthed, violent [[Psychopathy|sociopath]] whose orgasmic climax is a fit of both pleasure and rage. He continually refers to her as "Mommy" and to himself as both the "Daddy" and the "Baby", who "want to fuck." Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and son to force her to perform sexual favors; to "Do it for van Gogh." When Frank leaves, a sad and desperate Dorothy tries to seduce Jeffrey again and demands that he hit her, but when he refuses, she tells him to leave. When Jeffrey moves to leave, she asks him to stay, though he leaves anyway.

Jeffrey relays his experience to Sandy, asking her why there are people like Frank. Sandy in turn tells him of a wonderful dream she had about [[American robin|robins]] that she interprets as a sign of hope for humanity. Jeffrey and Sandy are attracted to each other, though Sandy has a boyfriend.

Jeffrey again visits Dorothy's apartment and she tells him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been yearning for him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends the next few days spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.

Afterwards, Frank catches Dorothy and Jeffrey together and forces them both to accompany him to the apartment of Ben ([[Dean Stockwell]]), his suave, effeminate partner in crime who is holding Dorothy's son. Ben [[lip-syncs]] a performance of [[Roy Orbison]]'s "[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]", sending Frank into maudlin sadness, then rage. Frank takes Jeffrey to a lumber yard and when he molests Dorothy, Jeffrey stands up to Frank by punching him. Frank's cronies drag Jeffrey out of the car and Frank kisses Jeffrey's face, intimidates him, and then savagely beats him to the overture of "In Dreams". Jeffrey wakes the next day at the same place and walks home, overcome with guilt and despair. He goes to the police station, where he notices that Sandy's father's partner is the Yellow Man—an officer named Lieutenant Detective Tom Gordon (Fred Pickler). Later, at Sandy's home, her father is amazed by Jeffrey's story, but warns Jeffrey to stop his amateur sleuthing lest he endanger himself and the investigation. Jeffrey and Sandy go to a dance together and profess their love, only to be confronted by Sandy's boyfriend. A confrontation is averted when the group finds Dorothy—naked, battered, and distressed—on Jeffrey's front lawn. Barely conscious, Dorothy reveals her intimacy with Jeffrey, causing Sandy to become upset and to slap Jeffrey, although she later forgives him.

Jeffrey insists on returning to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband (Don Green), who is dead from a gunshot to the head and identifiable by his missing ear, as well as the Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound and appears to have suffered a crude [[lobotomy]]. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, killing the Yellow Man, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him through the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. A [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage sequence]] ends the film, which shows Dorothy and her son reunited.

The film's story originated from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind over a period of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only "a feeling" and the title ''Blue Velvet'', Lynch told ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' in 1987.<ref name="rodley"/><ref name="cineaste">{{cite journal |last=Bouzereau |first=Laurent |year=1987 |title=An Interview with David Lynch |journal=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |pages=39}}</ref><ref name="LynchOnLynch">{{cite book| title = Lynch on Lynch | first = Chris | last = Rodley | year = 2005 | publisher = New York: Faber and Faber | isbn = 978-0-571-22018-2}}</ref> The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. "I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else...The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect", Lynch remarked in an interview.<ref name="LynchOnLynch" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Nan |last=Robertson |title=The All-American Guy Behind ''Blue Velvet'' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 11, 1986}}</ref> The third idea was [[Bobby Vinton]]'s classic rendition of the song ''Blue Velvet'' and "the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time."<ref name=villagevoice>{{cite news |first=Lizzie |last=Borden |title=The World According to Lynch |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=September 23, 1986 }}</ref> Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that "there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while."<ref name="rodley"/>

After completing ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), Lynch met producer [[Richard Roth (producer)|Richard Roth]] over coffee. Roth had read and enjoyed Lynch's ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'' script, but did not think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field."<ref name="cineaste"/><ref name="Peary">{{cite book | title = Cult Movies 3 | first = Danny | last = Peary | year = 1988 | publisher = Simon & Schuster Inc. | location = New York | pages = 38–42 | isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}</ref> Production was announced in August 1984.<ref name="Atkinson" /> Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film.<ref name = "Blue Velvet"/> Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had cut a deal with [[Dino De Laurentiis]] that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million.<ref name = "Blue Velvet"/> This deal meant that ''Blue Velvet'' was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate.<ref name = "Blue Velvet"/> Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production.<ref name = "Blue Velvet"/> "After ''Dune'' I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment."<ref name="rodley"/> Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.<ref>{{cite web  |title=Blue Velvet&nbsp;— David Lynch | url=http://www.lynchnet.com/bv/ | accessdate=June 11, 2007 | publisher=LynchNet}}</ref>

The cast of ''Blue Velvet'' included several then-relatively unknown actors. Isabella Rossellini had gained some exposure before the film for her [[Lancôme]] ads in the early 1980s and for being the daughter of actress [[Ingrid Bergman]] and Italian film director [[Roberto Rossellini]]. Dennis Hopper was the biggest "name" in the film, having starred in ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), while Kyle MacLachlan had played the central role in Lynch's ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984), a [[science fiction]] epic based on [[Dune (novel)|the novel]] of the same name, the film having been a critical and commercial failure. MacLachlan later became a recurring collaborator with Lynch, who remarked: "Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He's the person you trust enough to go into a strange world with."<ref>''GQ'', (for the modern man), Kyle MacLachlan, August 1992, Volume 62, Number 8, p. 134- 137, p. 197</ref> Dennis Hopper—said to be Lynch's third choice—accepted the role, reportedly having exclaimed, "I've got to play Frank! I am Frank!" as Hopper confirmed in the ''Blue Velvet'' "making-of" documentary ''The Mysteries of Love'', produced for the 2002 special edition.<ref name = "Blue Velvet"/> For the role of Dorothy Vallens, Lynch met Isabella Rossellini at a restaurant, and she accepted the role. Laura Dern, then just nineteen years old, was cast after various successful actresses at the time turned it down, including [[Molly Ringwald]].

The scene in which Dorothy appears naked outside was inspired by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never forgotten it.<ref>{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger | title=Biting into ''Blue Velvet'' | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=October 2, 1986 | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19861002/PEOPLE/41216001/1023 | accessdate=February 16, 2007 }}</ref> [[Principal photography]] of ''Blue Velvet'' began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] studio in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.<ref>{{cite book | title=Some of Me | first=Isabella | last=Rossellini | year=1997 | publisher=Random House | location=New York | isbn=0-679-45252-4}}</ref>

Lynch's original rough cut ran for approximately four hours.<ref name="Blue Velvet" /> He was contractually obligated to deliver a two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes.<ref>''Blue Velvet''; a two-part search for the films deleted scenes at [http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s87velvet1.htmlHe DVD Talk]. Retrieved July 24, 2007.</ref> He also made cuts at the request of the [[MPAA]]. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. Lynch announced in a radio interview on January 18, 2011, that footage from the [[deleted scene]]s, long thought lost, had been discovered. It  later appeared on the 2011 special edition Blu-ray disc release of the film.<ref>{{cite web  |title=BLUE VELVET Blu-Ray To Include Newly Rediscovered Deleted Footage | url=http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/2011/01/24/blue-velvet-blu-ray-to-include-deleted-scenes/ | accessdate=January 24, 2011 | publisher= Film Buff Online}}</ref> The final cut produced by Lynch runs for just under two hours.

==Interpretation==
[[File:Blue Velvet 1986.jpg|thumb|right|"I guess it means there's trouble until the robins come": Throughout the film, a dream Sandy had is alluded to, in which the world was full of darkness and turmoil until a group of [[robin (disambiguation)#Birds|robins]] were set free, unleashing blinding light and love. [[Lighting]] is a strong symbolic aspect of the film, illustrated in this second shot which is saturated with light representing the return to normalcy and love.]]
Despite ''Blue Velvet''{{'}}s initial appearance as a mystery, the film operates on a number of thematic levels. The film owes a large debt to 1950s [[film noir]], containing and exploring such conventions as the [[femme fatale]] (Dorothy Vallens), a seemingly unstoppable villain (Frank Booth), and the questionable moral outlook of the hero (Jeffrey Beaumont), as well as its unusual use of shadowy, sometimes dark [[cinematography]].<ref name="Rubin">{{cite book | title=Thrillers | first=Martin | last=Rubin | year=1999 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | location=Britain | pages=175 | isbn=0-521-58839-1}}</ref> ''Blue Velvet'' represents and establishes Lynch's famous "askew vision,"<ref name="johnson">{{cite book | last=Johnson | first=J | year=2004 | title=Pervert in the Pulpit: Morality in the Works of David Lynch | pages =38–39 | isbn=0-7864-1753-6 | publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]}}</ref> and introduces several common elements of Lynch's work, some of which would later become his trademarks, including distorted characters, a polarized world, and debilitating damage to the skull or brain. Perhaps the most significant "Lynchian" trademark in the film is the depiction of unearthing a dark underbelly in a seemingly idealized small town;<ref name="White, Heanni">{{cite book | last=White | first=John | year=2009 | title=Fifty Key American Films | pages=270 | isbn=0-415-77297-4 | publisher=}}</ref> Jeffrey even proclaims in the film that he is "seeing something that was always hidden", alluding to the film's plot central idea. Lynch's characterization of films, symbols, and motifs have become well-known, and his particular style, characterised largely in ''Blue Velvet'' for the first time, has been written about extensively using descriptions like "dreamlike",<ref name="SFSaid">{{cite news | last = Said | first = SF | title = Filmmakers on film: Tom Tykwer on Blue Velvet | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3580902/Filmmakers-on-film-Tom-Tykwer-on-Blue-Velvet.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = August 25, 2012 | location=London | date=August 3, 2002}}</ref> "ultraweird",<ref name="zacharek">{{cite news | last=Stephanie | first=Zacharek | title=David Lynch's latest tour de force | work=Salon | date=October 12, 2001 | url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/10/12/mulholland_drive/index.html?source=search&aim=/ent/movies/review | accessdate=April 7, 2008}}</ref> "dark",<ref name="nochimson">Nochimson, Martha (Autumn 2002).

The film has been compared to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) because of its stark treatment of psychotic evil.<ref name="''Taschen Books''">{{cite book | first=Jürgen | last=Müller | title=The 25 Greatest Films of the 1980s | publisher=Taschen Books | year=2002 | pages=325 | isbn= 3-8228-4783-6}}</ref> The premise of both films is curiosity, leading to an investigation that draws the lead characters into a hidden, voyeuristic underworld of crime.<ref name="orr">{{cite book | last=Orr | first=J | year=2005 | title=Hitchcock and Twentieth-century Cinema | publisher=Wallflower Press | pages=167 | isbn=1-904764-55-X}}</ref>

The film's thematic framework hearkens back to Poe, James, and early [[gothic fiction]], as well as films such as ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943) and ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955) and the entire notion of film noir.<ref name="Denzin">{{cite book | title=The cinematic society: The Voyeur's Gaze | first=Norman K. | last=Denzin | year=1995 | publisher=Sage Publications | location=Britain | pages=247 | isbn=0-521-58839-1}}</ref> Lynch has called it a "film about things that are hidden—within a small city and within people."<ref name="nationalsocietyoffilmcritics" /> Like many other Lynch films, ''Blue Velvet'' is immersed in [[pop culture]] imagery, both from the 1950s and the 1960s, as well as the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_148/20yearslaterblue.html | title=20 years later, ''Blue Velvet'' is surreal as ever | publisher=Downtown Express}}</ref>

[[Feminist]] psychoanalytic film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] argues that ''Blue Velvet'' establishes a metaphorical [[Oedipal]] family—"the child", Jeffrey Beaumont, and his "parents", Frank Booth and Dorothy Vallens—through deliberate references to film noir and its underlying Oedipal theme.<ref name="Mulvey">{{cite book | title = Cult etherworlds and the Unconscious: Oedipus and ''Blue Velvet''", Fetishism And Curiosity 3 | first = Laura | last = Mulvey | year = 1996 | publisher = British Film Institute | location = Suffolk | pages = 137–154 | isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}</ref><ref name="Taylor, Winquist">{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Postmodernism | first = Victor E. | last = Taylor | year = 2001 | publisher = Taylor & Francis | pages = 466 | isbn = 0-415-15294-1}}</ref> The resulting violence, she claims, can be read as symbolic of domestic violence within real families. For instance, Frank's violent acts can be seen to reflect the different types of abuse within families, and the control he has over Dorothy might represent the hold an abusive husband has over his wife.<ref name="Atkinson">{{cite book | title=Blue Velvet | last=Atkinson | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Atkinson (writer) | year=1997 | publisher=British Film Institute | location=London | isbn=978-0-85170-559-0}}</ref> Michael Atkinson reads Jeffrey as an innocent youth who is both horrified by the violence inflicted by Frank, but also tempted by it as the means of possessing Dorothy for himself.<ref name="Atkinson" /><ref>{{cite book | title = American Cinema of the 1980s| first = Stephan | last = Prince| year = 2007 | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick | pages = 160–167| isbn = 0-8135-4034-8}}</ref> Atkinson takes a [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] approach to the film; considering it to be an expression of the traumatised innocence which characterises Lynch's work.<ref name="Atkinson" />  He claims that "Dorothy represents the sexual force of the mother [figure] because she is forbidden and because she becomes the object of the unhealthy, infantile impulses at work in Jeffrey's [[subconscious]]".<ref name="Atkinson" />

===Symbolism===
Symbolism is used very heavily in ''Blue Velvet''.<ref name="Atkinson" /> The most consistent symbolism in the film is an [[insect]] motif introduced at the end of the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]esque paradise.<ref name="Atkinson" /> The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like [[gas mask]] that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator.<ref name="Atkinson" /> One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a [[Yellowjacket|type of wasp]].<ref name="Atkinson" /> Finally, a [[American Robin|robin]] eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film.<ref name="Atkinson" /> The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.

The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers is also a key symbolic element,<ref name="Atkinson" /> leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, the audience is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal until the end of the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Blue Velvet (soundtrack)}}
The ''Blue Velvet'' soundtrack was supervised by [[Angelo Badalamenti]] (who makes a brief cameo appearance as the [[pianist]] at the Slow Club where Dorothy performs). The soundtrack makes heavy usage of vintage pop songs, such as [[Bobby Vinton]]'s "Blue Velvet" and [[Roy Orbison]]'s "[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]", juxtaposed with an orchestral score inspired by [[Shostakovich]]. During filming, Lynch placed speakers on set and in streets and played Shostakovich to set the mood he wanted to convey.<ref name="Blue Velvet">''Mysteries of Love: The Making of Blue Velvet'', ''Blue Velvet'' Special Edition DVD documentary, [2002]</ref> The score makes direct quotations from Shostakovich's 15th Symphony, which Lynch had been listening to regularly while writing the screenplay.<ref>''Blue Velvet'' film score at [http://www.thecityofabsurdity.com/bluevelvet/bvsound.html "The City of Absurdity"].

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked ''Blue Velvet's'' soundtrack  on its list of the ''100 Greatest Film Soundtracks'', at the 100th position. Critic John Alexander wrote, "the haunting soundtrack accompanies the title credits, then weaves through the narrative, accentuating the noir mood of the film".<ref name="British Film Resource">{{cite web | title = The Films of David Lynch: 50 Percent Sound | publisher = The British Film Resource | year = 1997 | url=http://www.britishfilm.org.uk/lynch/Schap3.html | accessdate = August 31, 2009 }}</ref> Lynch worked with music composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]] for the first time in this film and asked him to write a score that had to be "like Shostakovich, be very Russian, but make it the most beautiful thing but make it dark and a little bit scary".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chion |first=Michael |year=1995 | title = Blue Velvet | journal=British Film Institute, London |pages=89}}</ref> Badalamenti's success with ''Blue Velvet'' would lead him to contribute to all of Lynch's future full-length films until ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]''.

The film performed well overseas, grossing $900,000 in Australia, and $450,139 in Hong Kong.

===Critical reception===
''Blue Velvet'' received critical acclaim in the United States upon its release and currently has a "certified fresh" score of 93% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 59 reviews with an average rating of 8.7 out of 10. The critical consensus states "If audiences walk away from this subversive, surreal shocker not fully understanding the story, they might also walk away with a deeper perception of the potential of film storytelling."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blue_velvet/|title=Blue Velvet|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}</ref> The film also has a score of 75 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 14 critics indicating "Generally favorable reviews."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blue-velvet|title=Blue Velvet|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}</ref>

Paul Attanasio of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said "the film showcases a visual stylist utterly in command of his talents" and that Angelo Badalamenti "contributes an extraordinary score, slipping seamlessly from slinky jazz to violin figures to the romantic sweep of a classic Hollywood score", but claimed that Lynch "isn't interested in communicating, he's interested in parading his personality. The movie doesn't progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and to no good end."<ref>{{cite news | last = Attanasio | first = Paul | title = Blue Velvet | work = [[The Washington Post]] |date=September 19, 1986 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/bluevelvetrattanasio_a0ad54.htm | accessdate = October 30, 2006 }}</ref> ''The New York Times'' critic [[Janet Maslin]] expressed her admiration for the film, and directed much praise toward the performances of Hopper and Rossellini: "Mr. Hopper and Miss Rossellini are so far outside the bounds of ordinary acting here that their performances are best understood in terms of sheer lack of inhibition; both give themselves entirely over to the material, which seems to be exactly what's called for." She called it "an instant cult classic." Maslin concluded by saying that ''Blue Velvet'' "is as fascinating as it is freakish.

But ''Blue Velvet'' was not without its detractors. A general criticism from U.S. critics was the film's often vulgar approach to sexuality and violence, which they claimed detracted from the film's serious side.<ref name="ebert">{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | title = Blue Velvet | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=September 19, 1986 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19860919/REVIEWS/609190301/1023 | accessdate = October 30, 2006 }}</ref><ref>''Blue Velvet'' review at the [http://www.themoviesnobs.com/blue-velvet/ "Movie Snobs"].

And when you ask an actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film".<ref name="ebert" /> During an online Q&A session in 2007, Ebert said he still had negativity regarding how Rossellini was depicted but said he should re-visit ''Blue Velvet'' and that David Lynch was a good director.<ref>{{cite web|title=At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper: Webchat with Roger Ebert |date=August 2, 2007 |accessdate=August 24, 2009 |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/chat/transcript-ebert-070802.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20081017161603/http://bventertainment.go.com:80/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/chat/transcript-ebert-070802.html |archivedate=October 17, 2008 }}</ref> In a [[Twitter|tweet]] honoring David Lynch's birthday, Ebert later revealed though he views Lynch as a great director, his feelings remain unchanged about ''Blue Velvet''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Roger Ebert's Twitter Feed | date = January 20, 2009 | accessdate = January 20, 2010 | url = http://twitter.com/ebertchicago/status/8010331149 }}</ref>

==Legacy==
Although it initially gained a relatively small theatrical audience in North America and was met with controversy over its artistic merit, ''Blue Velvet'' soon became the center of a "national firestorm" in 1986, and over time achieved status as an American classic. In the late 1980s, and early 1990s, after its release on videotape, the film became a widely known [[cult film]], well known for its dark depiction of a suburban America.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/blue_velvet.html | title = ''Blue Velvet'' | last=Berardinelli |first=James | authorlink = James Berardinelli | publisher = Reelviews | accessdate = August 28, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | work = [[Boston Globe]] | title = Blue Velvet already a classic | date = April 12, 1987 | url =http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/59484290.html | accessdate=July 5, 2012 | first=Jay | last=Carr}}</ref> Followed by myriad [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]] and [[DVD]] releases, the film became increasingly well-known among American audiences. It marked the entrance of David Lynch into the Hollywood mainstream and the comeback of Dennis Hopper after a significant hiatus from work. Hopper's performance and the character of Frank Booth itself has left an imprint on popular culture, with countless tributes, cultural references and parodies.<ref>{{cite news| url =  http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/aug/04/dennis-hopper-blue-velvet-screening | title = Hopper mad: Blue Velvet screening prompts Lynchian tributes to Dennis | last=Walters |first=Ben | work = The Guardian | accessdate = August 25, 2012 | location=London | date=August 4, 2010}}</ref> The success of the film alone has helped propel Hollywood mainstream toward more graphic displays of previously censored themes, a similar case to ''Psycho'' (1960), to which ''Blue Velvet'' has been frequently compared.<ref name="''Taschen Books''" /> It has become one of the most significant, well-recognized films of its era, spawning countless imitations and parodies in media. The film's dark, stylish and erotic production design has served as a benchmark for a number of films, parodies and even Lynch's own later work, notably ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–91), and ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001). [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine cited it as one of the most "influential American films", as did [[Michael Atkinson]], who dedicated a book to the film's themes and motifs.<ref name="rottentomatoes" /><ref name="Atkinson" />

''Blue Velvet'' now frequently appears in various critical assessments of all-time great films, also ranked as one of the greatest films of the 1980s, one of the best examples of American surrealism and one of the finest examples of David Lynch's work.<ref name="Atkinson" />  In a poll of two American critics ranking the "most outstanding films of the decade", ''Blue Velvet'' was placed third and fourth, behind ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), ''[[E.T. The Extra Terrestrial]]'' (1982) and the German film ''[[Wings of Desire]]'' (1987).<ref>In an American film poll of fifty-four critics, the top ten domestic movies of the 1980s were ''Raging Bull'', ''E.T.
