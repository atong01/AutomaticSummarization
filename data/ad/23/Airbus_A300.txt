The '''Airbus A300''' is a short- to medium-[[Range (aircraft)|range]] [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] [[Twinjet|twin-engine]] [[jet airliner]] that was developed and manufactured by [[Airbus]]. Released in 1972 as the world's first twin-engined widebody, it was the first product of [[Airbus|Airbus Industrie]], a [[consortium]] of European [[aerospace manufacturer]]s, now a subsidiary of [[Airbus Group]]. The A300 can typically seat 266 passengers in a [[Travel class|two-class layout]], with a maximum [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of {{Convert|4070|nmi|km|lk=on}} when fully loaded, depending on model.

Launch customer [[Air France]] introduced the type into service on 30 May 1974. Production of the A300 ceased in July 2007, along with its smaller [[Airbus A310|A310]] derivative. [[Cargo aircraft|Freighter]] sales for which the A300 competed are to be fulfilled by a new [[Airbus A330#A330-200F|A330-200F]] derivative.<ref name=fi_20060314>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-aims-to-fill-freighter-void-with-a330-derivative-205407/|title=Airbus aims to fill freighter void with A330 derivative|publisher=[[Flight International]]|date=14 March 2006}}</ref>
The third production A300 is now a [[Reduced gravity aircraft|zero gravity plane]] and travels to airshows around Europe.

==Development==

The requirements were stated in 1966 by Frank Kolk, an [[American Airlines]] executive, for a [[Boeing 727]] replacement on busy short- to medium-range routes such as United States transcontinental flights. His brief included a passenger capacity of 250 to 300 seated in a twin-aisle configuration and fitted with two engines, with the capability of carrying full passenger loads without penalty from high-altitude airports like [[Denver]]. American manufacturers responded with widebody trijets, the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] and the [[Lockheed L-1011 Tristar]], as twinjets were banned from many routes by the FAA.

[[File:Iran Air's Airbus A300B4-203 cockpit.jpg|thumb|Cockpit view of an Airbus A300B4-200 of [[Iran Air]]]]
On 26 September 1967, the British, French, and West German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding to start development of the 300-seat Airbus A300.<ref name="flightpath3 p43">Endres 2004, p. 43.</ref> An earlier announcement had been made in July 1967, but at that time the announcement had been clouded by the British Government's support for the Airbus, which coincided with its refusal to back [[British Aircraft Corporation]]'s (BAC) proposed competitor, a development of the [[BAC 1-11]], despite a preference for the latter expressed by [[British European Airways]] (BEA).
In the months following this agreement, both the French and British governments expressed doubts about the aircraft.{{which|date=March 2014}} Another problem was the requirement for a new engine to be developed by [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]]; the [[Turbofan#Three spool|triple-spool]] RB207 of 47,500&nbsp;lbf.<ref name="Flight international1968">{{cite journal|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%200017.html|title=Aero Engines 1968: "Flight" special review|date=4 January 1968|journal=FLIGHT International|issue=3069|volume=93|pages=19–30}}</ref> In December 1968, the French and British partner companies ([[Sud Aviation]] and [[Hawker Siddeley]]) proposed a revised configuration, the 250-seat Airbus A250. Renamed the A300B, the aircraft would not require new engines, reducing development costs.<ref name="flightpath3 p45">Endres 2004, p. 45.</ref> To attract potential US customers, American [[GE-Aviation|General Electric]] [[General Electric CF6|CF6-50]] engines powered the A300 instead of the British RB207. The British government withdrew from the venture; however, the British firm Hawker-Siddeley stayed on as a contractor, developing the wings for the A300, which were pivotal in later versions' impressive performance from short domestic to long intercontinental flights.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} (Years later, through [[British Aerospace]], the UK re-entered the consortium.)

Airbus Industrie was formally set up in 1970 following an agreement between [[Aérospatiale]] (France) and the antecedents to [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace|Deutsche Aerospace]] (Germany). They were joined by the Spanish [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas|CASA]] in 1971. Each company would deliver its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly assemblies.

The first prototype A300 was unveiled on 28 September 1972, making its [[maiden flight]] from [[Toulouse–Blagnac Airport]] on 28 October that year,<ref name="flightpath3 p51-2">Endres 2004, pp. 51–52.</ref> which was later commemorated on a French three [[franc]] stamp.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The first production model, the A300B2, entered service in 1974 followed by the A300B4 one year later. Initially the success of the consortium was poor, but by 1979 there were 81 aircraft in service. It was the launch of the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] in 1987 that established Airbus in the aircraft market&nbsp;– over 400 orders were placed before it flew, compared to 15 for the A300 in 1972.

The A300 was the first airliner to use [[Just In Time (business)|just-in-time]] manufacturing techniques. Complete aircraft sections were manufactured by consortium partners all over Europe. These were airlifted to the final assembly line at [[Toulouse Blagnac International Airport|Toulouse-Blagnac]] by a fleet of [[Boeing 377]]-derived [[Aero Spacelines Super Guppy]] aircraft. Originally devised as a way to share the work among Airbus' partners without the expense of two assembly lines, it turned out to be a more efficient way of building aircraft (more flexible and reduced costs) as opposed to building the whole aircraft at one site.

==Design==
[[File:Airbus A300 cross section.jpg|thumb|Airbus A300 fuselage cross-section, showing the passenger compartment above and the baggage area below. On display in the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, Germany.]]

Airbus partners employed the latest technology, some derived from [[Concorde]]. On entry into service in 1974, the A300 was a very advanced plane and influenced later subsonic airliner designs. The technological highlights include:
* Advanced wings by [[de Havilland]] (later [[BAE Systems]]) with:
** [[Supercritical airfoil]] section for economical performance
** advanced [[aerodynamically]] efficient [[flight control surfaces]]
* 5.64&nbsp;m (222&nbsp;in) diameter circular fuselage section for 8-abreast passenger seating and wide enough for 2 [[Unit Load Device|LD3]] cargo containers side-by-side
* Structures made from metal [[billet (manufacturing)|billets]], reducing weight
* First airliner to be fitted with [[wind shear]] protection
* Advanced autopilots capable of flying the aircraft from climb-out to landing
* Electrically controlled braking system

Later A300s incorporate other advanced features such as:
* 2-man crew by automating the [[flight engineer]]'s functions, an industry first
* [[Glass cockpit]] flight instruments
* Extensive use of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|composites]] for an aircraft of its era
* [[center of gravity of an aircraft|Center-of-gravity]] control by shifting around fuel
* [[Wingtip fence]]s for better aerodynamics (first introduced on the [[Airbus A310|A310-300]]).

All these made the A300 a more economical substitute for widebody trijets such as [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] and [[Lockheed L-1011]] for short to medium routes. On the early versions, Airbus used the same engines and similar major systems as the DC-10.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Operational history==
[[File:Air France Airbus A300B2 1974 Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|left|[[Air France]] A300B2 at [[Farnborough Airshow]] in 1974]]
[[File:mahan air a300b4-600 ep-mnr lands birmingham arp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mahan Air]] Airbus A300B4-600 lands at [[Birmingham International Airport, West Midlands|Birmingham International Airport]], England (2010)]]

After the launch, sales of the A300 were weak for some years, with most orders going to airlines that had an obligation to favor the domestically made product&nbsp;– notably [[Air France]] and [[Lufthansa]]. At one stage, Airbus had 16 "whitetail" A300s&nbsp;– completed but unsold aircraft&nbsp;– sitting on the tarmac. [[Germanwings]] was the world's first international airline to purchase the A300. [[Indian Airlines]] was the world's first domestic airline to purchase the A300. These have now been retired.

In 1974, [[Korean Air]] ordered 4 A300s, becoming the first non-European international airline to order Airbus aircraft. Airbus saw South-East Asia as a vital market ready to be opened up and believed that [[Korean Air]] to be the 'key'.<ref name="Champagne... and Drought">[http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/champagneand-drought-1973-1977/ Champagne... and drought], The story of Airbus from its inception to today.</ref>

It was becoming clear that the whole concept of a short haul widebody was flawed. Airlines operating the A300 on short haul routes were forced to reduce frequencies to try and fill the aircraft. As a result they lost passengers to airlines operating more frequent narrow body flights. The supposed widebody comfort which it was assumed passengers would demand was illusory. Eventually, Airbus had to build its own narrowbody aircraft (the A320) to compete with the [[Boeing 737]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]/[[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|MD-80]]. The savior of the A300 was the advent of [[ETOPS|Extended Range Twin Operations (ETOPS)]], a revised [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] rule which allows twin-engine jets to fly long-distance routes that were previously off-limits to them. This enabled Airbus to develop the aircraft as a medium/long range airliner.

In 1977, US carrier [[Eastern Air Lines]] leased four A300s as an in-service trial. [[Frank Borman]], ex-astronaut and the then CEO, was impressed that the A300 consumed 30% less fuel than his fleet of [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar|Tristars]] and then ordered 23 of the type (This order is often cited as the point at which Airbus came to be seen as a serious competitor to the large American aircraft-manufacturers [[Boeing]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]]). This was followed by an order from [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]. From then on, the A300 family sold well, eventually reaching a total of 878 delivered aircraft.<ref name="Airbus_Deliveries"/><ref name="planespotters">{{cite web|url=http://www.planespotters.net/Production_List/Airbus/A300/index.php?p=6|title=Airbus A300 Production List|accessdate=15 November 2012|publisher=planespotters.net}}</ref>

In December 1977, [[AeroCóndor]] [[Colombia]] became the first [[Airbus]] operator in [[Latin America]], leasing one Airbus A300, named "Ciudad de Barranquilla".

The aircraft found particular favor with Asian airlines, being bought by [[Japan Air System]], [[Korean Air]], [[China Eastern Airlines]], [[Thai Airways International]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Philippine Airlines]], [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[China Airlines]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]], [[Indian Airlines]], [[Trans Australia Airlines]] and many others. As Asia did not have restrictions similar to the FAA [[ETOPS/LROPS|60-minutes rule]] for twin-engine airliners which existed at the time, Asian airlines used A300s for routes across the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[South China Sea]].

[[File:M4H00496.theora.ogv|thumb|[[China Eastern Airlines]] A300B4-600R cabin in-flight]]

In 1977, the A300B4 became the first [[ETOPS]] compliant aircraft&nbsp;– its high performance and safety standards qualified it for Extended Twin Engine Operations over water, providing operators with more versatility in routing. In 1982 [[Garuda Indonesia]] became the first airline to fly the A300B4-200FF. By 1981, Airbus was growing rapidly, with over 300 aircraft sold and options for 200 more planes for over forty airlines. Alarmed by the success of the A300, Boeing responded with the new [[Boeing 767]].

The A300 provided Airbus the experience of manufacturing and selling airliners competitively. The basic fuselage of the A300 was later stretched ([[Airbus A330|A330]] and [[Airbus A340|A340]]), shortened (A310), or modified into derivatives ([[Airbus Beluga|A300-600ST ''Beluga'' Super Transporter]]).The largest freight operator of the A300 is [[FedEx Express]], which, as of January 2012, had 71 A300 aircraft in service. [[UPS Airlines]] also operates freighter versions of the A300. The final version was the A300-600R and is rated for 180-minute [[ETOPS]]. The A300 has enjoyed renewed interest in the secondhand market for conversion to freighters. The freighter versions&nbsp;– either new-build A300-600s or converted ex-passenger A300-600s, A300B2s and B4s&nbsp;– account for most of the world freighter fleet after the [[Boeing 747]] freighter.

In March 2006 Airbus announced the closure of the A300/A310 line<ref>{{Cite news | title = A300/A310 Final Assembly to be completed by July 2007 | publisher=Airbus | date = 7 March 2006 | url = http://www.airbus.com/en/presscentre/pressreleases/pressreleases_items/07_03_06_A300_final_assembly.html}}</ref> making them the first Airbus aircraft to be discontinued. The final production A300 made its initial flight on 18 April 2007<ref>{{Cite news | title = The last A300 makes its maiden flight | publisher=Airbus | date = 18 April 2007 | url = http://www.airbus.com/en/myairbus/newsbrief/index.jsp}}</ref> and was delivered on 12 July 2007. It was an A300F freighter for [[FedEx]]. [[Airbus]] has announced a support package to keep A300s flying commercially until at least 2025.

===A300B1===
Only two were built: the first prototype, registered F-WUAB, then F-OCAZ, and a second aircraft, F-WUAC, which was leased in November 1974 to [[Trans European Airways]] (TEA) and re-registered OO-TEF. TEA instantly subleased the aircraft for six weeks to [[Air Algérie]], but continued to operate the aircraft until 1990. It had accommodation for 300 passengers (TEA) or 323 passengers (Air Algérie) with a maximum weight of 132,000&nbsp;kg and two [[General Electric CF6|General Electric CF6-50A]] engines of 220&nbsp;kN thrust. The A300B1 was shorter than the later production versions, being only 50.95 m (167.2 ft) in length.

===A300B2===
The first production version. Powered by General Electric CF6 or [[Pratt & Whitney JT9D]] engines (the same engines that powered the Boeing 747-100, "the original jumbo jet") of between 227 and 236&nbsp;kN thrust, it entered service with Air France in May 1974. The prototype A300B2 made its first flight on 28 June 1973 and was certificated by the French and German authorities on 15 March 1974 and FAA approval followed on 30 May 1974. The first production A300B2 (A300 number 5) made its maiden flight on 15 April 1974 and was handed over to Air France a few weeks later on 10 May 1974. The A300B2 entered revenue service on 23 May 1974 between Paris and London.
* A300B2-100: 137 Metric Ton [[MTOW]]
* A300B2-200: 142 Metric Ton [[MTOW]], with [[Krüger flap]]s, first delivery to [[South African Airways]] in 1976
* A300B2-300: increased Maximum Landing Weight/Maximum Zero Fuel Weight

===A300B4===
[[File:Garuda Indonesian Airways Airbus A300B4-220 Rees.jpg|thumb|Garuda Indonesia is the launch customer of Airbus A300B4-200FF series in 1982]]
The major production version. Features a centre fuel tank for increased fuel capacity (47,500&nbsp;kg). Production of the B2 and B4 totalled 248. The first A300B4 (the 9th A300) flew on 25 December 1974 and was certified on 26 March 1975. The first delivery was made to Germanair (which later merged into [[Hapag Lloyd]]) on 23 May 1975.
* A300B4-100: 157.5 Metric Ton [[MTOW]], first delivery to [[Germanair]] in 1975.
* A300B4-200: 165 Metric Ton [[MTOW]], first delivery to [[Hapag-Lloyd Flug]] in 1980
* A300B4-200FF: An A300 with a "forward-facing" crew compartment. The world's first 2-crew widebody airliner. Includes some of the A310's and A300-600's digital avionics. First saw service with [[Garuda Indonesia]] in 1982, further customers were [[VASP]], [[Tunisair]] and [[Kar-Air]]/[[Finnair]].
* A300B4-600: Referred to as the A300-600. See Below.
* A300C4: Convertible freighter version, with a large cargo door on the port side. First delivered to [[South African Airways]] in October 1982.
* A300F4-200: Freighter version of the A300B4-200. First delivery occurred in 1986, but only very few were built as the A300F4-200 was soon replaced by the more capable A300-600F (official designation: A300F4-600).

===A300-600===
Officially designated A300B4-600, this version is nearly the same length as the B2 and B4 but has increased space because it uses the A310 rear fuselage and tail. It has higher power [[General Electric CF6|CF6-80]] or [[Pratt & Whitney PW4000]] engines and uses the [[Honeywell]] 331-250 [[auxiliary power unit]] (APU).<ref name=hw>{{Cite web|title=Honeywell 331-250 APU|url=http://www.honeywell.com/sites/portal?smap=aerospace&page=Power_Systems3&theme=T5&catID=CB6099334-14AB-C264-AB94-8E47224CA642&id=H544A09A8-A70B-FA73-F93C-6AEFB3D0FB6D&sel=4|accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref> The A300-600 entered service in 1983 with [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]] and a total of 313 A300-600s (all versions) have been sold. The A300-600 also has a similar cockpit to the A310, eliminating the need for a flight engineer. The FAA issues a single type rating which allows operation of both the A310 and A300-600.
* A300-600: (Official designation: A300B4-600) The baseline model of the −600 series.
* A300-620C: (Official designation: A300C4-620) A convertible freighter version. First delivery December 1985.
* A300-600F: (Official designation: A300F4-600) The freighter version of the baseline −600.
* A300-600R: (Official designation: A300B4-600R) The increased range −600, achieved by an additional trim fuel tank in the tail. First delivery in 1988 to [[American Airlines]]; all A300s built since 1989 (freighters included) are −600Rs. [[Japan Air System]] (later merged in [[Japan Airlines]]) took delivery of the last new-built passenger A300, an A300-622R, in November 2002.
* A300-600RF: (Official designation: A300F4-600R) The freighter version of the −600R. All A300s delivered between November 2002 and 12 July 2007 (last ever A300 delivery) were A300-600RFs.

===A300B10 (A310)===
{{Main|Airbus A310}}
Introduced a shorter fuselage, a new, higher [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] wing, smaller horizontal tail and two crew operation. It is available in standard −200 and the Extended range −300 with {{convert|9600|km|0|abbr=on}} range in both passenger and full cargo versions.

It is also available as a military tanker/transport serving the [[Canadian Forces]] and [[German Air Force]]. Sales total 260, although five of these (ordered by [[Iraqi Airways]]) were never built.

===A300-600ST===
{{Main|Airbus Beluga}}
Commonly referred to as the Airbus Beluga or "Airbus Super Transporter," these five airframes are used by Airbus to ferry parts between the company's disparate manufacturing facilities, thus enabling workshare distribution. They replaced the four Aero Spacelines Super Guppys previously used by Airbus.
