'''Casablanca''' (in [[Arabic]]: {{Lang|ar|الدار البيضاء}}, ''Addaar Albayḍaa''; in {{lang-ber|'''Anfa''', '''ⴰⵏⴼⴰ'''}}; local informal name: ''Kaẓa'') is the largest [[city]] of [[Morocco]], located in the northwestern part of the country on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is also the largest city in the [[Maghreb]], as well as one of the largest and most important cities in [[Africa]], both economically and demographically.

Casablanca is Morocco's chief [[port]] and one of the largest [[financial center]]s on the African continent. The 2012 census, adjusted with recent numbers, recorded a population of about 4 million in the prefecture of Casablanca. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, while the national [[Capital (political)|political capital]] is [[Rabat]].

The leading Moroccan companies and international corporations doing business there have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca retains its historical position as the main industrial zone of the country. The [[Port of Casablanca]] is one of the largest artificial ports in the world,<ref name="EotO">{{cite web|url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/casablan.htm |title=''Casablanca'' – ''Encyclopedia of the Orient'' |publisher=Lexicorient.com |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref> and the largest port of [[North Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-ata.org/mc_casablanca.htm |title=''Discovering Casablanca'' |publisher=Africa-ata.org |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> It is also the primary [[naval base]] for the [[Royal Moroccan Navy]].

== Etymology ==
The original name of the city was "Anfa", in [[Berber language]], by at least the 7th century BC. After the Portuguese took control of Anfa in the 15th century AD, they rebuilt it, changing the name to "Casa Branca". It derives from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word combination meaning "White house" (''{{lang|pt|branca}}'' "white", ''{{lang|pt|casa}}'' "house"). The present name, which is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version, came when the [[Portuguese kingdom]] was integrated to the Spanish kingdom. During the [[French protectorate in Morocco|French Protectorate]], the name remained Casablanca, pronounced " [kɑzɑblɑnkɑ] " (in French accent) by the French. In the 18th century AD, an earthquake destroyed most of the town. It had been rebuilt by the Sultan who changed the name into the local [[Arabic]] which is "A-ddar Al Baidaa". The city is still nicknamed ''Casa'' by many locals and outsiders to the city. In many other cities with a different dialect, it is called "A-ddar Al-Bida" instead of "A-ddar Al-Baidaa".

There's a whole famous boulevard inside Casablanca City, called "''Anfa Boulevard''". Anfa is generally considered the early "old original city" of Casablanca; it is legally a prefecture (district) with half a million city inhabitants.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Casablanca|Timeline of Casablanca}}

=== Early history ===
The area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by [[Berber people|Berbers]] by at least the 7th century BC.<ref name=JVL>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Casablanca.html |title='&#39;Casablanca'&#39; |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans.<ref name=lexic>{{cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://www.lexicorient.com/e.o/casablanca.htm |title=Casablanca – LookLex Encyclopaedia |publisher=Lexicorient.com |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> In his book "''[[Wasf Afriquia]]''", [[Al-Hassan al-Wazzan]] refers to ancient Casablanca as "[[Anfa]]", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of [[Barghawata]] in 744 AD. He believed Anfa was the most "prosperous city on the Atlantic coast because of its fertile land."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennesaw.edu/historymuseum/creatingcommunity.shtml |title=Museum of History & Holocaust Education: Creating Community Collaboration |publisher=Kennesaw.edu |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the [[Almoravid]]s in 1068. Following the defeat of the [[Barghawata]] in the 12th century, [[Arab]] tribes of [[Banu Hilal|Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym|Sulaym]] descent settled in the region, mixing with and the local [[Berber people|Berbers]], which had lead to a global Arabicizing.<ref name="Levy12">S. Lévy, ''Pour une histoire linguistique du Maroc'', in ''Peuplement et arabisation au Maghreb occidental: dialectologie et histoire'', 1998, pp.11-26 (ISBN 84-86839-85-8)</ref> During the 14th century, under the [[Merinid]]s, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids was ousted by a [[1465 Moroccan revolt|popular revolt]] in 1465.<ref name="VauchezDobson2000">{{cite book|last1=Vauchez|first1=André|last2=Dobson|first2=Richard Barrie|last3=Lapidge|first3=Michael|title=Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=om4olQhrE84C&pg=PA941|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2000|publisher=Editions du Cerf|isbn=978-1-57958-282-1|page=941}}</ref>

=== Portugal conquest and Spanish influence ===
[[File:Braun Anfa UBHD.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Casablanca in 1572, still called ''Anfa'' on this painting, by the time the Portuguese renamed it "Casa Branca" which would eventually became Casablanca]]
In the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, whom bombarded the town which had lead to its destruction in 1468.<ref name="Britain)1987">{{cite book|title=Guide to places of the world|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kQ9dAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=April 1987|publisher=Reader's Digest Association|page=133}}</ref> The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called "Casa Branca", meaning "white house" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Between 1580 and 1640, the Crown of Portugal was integrated to the Crown of Spain, and therefore Casablanca and all other areas occupied by the Portuguese were under Spanish control, even though maintaining an autonomous Portuguese administration. As Portugal broke ties with Spain in 1640, Casablanca came under fully Portuguese control once again.<ref name="Edition">{{cite book|author=The International City of Tangier, Second Edition|title=The International City of Tangier, Second Edition|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VGqmAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA5|accessdate=22 April 2012|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4351-8|page=5}}</ref> The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake]] which destroyed most of the town.<ref name="Aldosari">{{cite book|last=Aldosari|first=Ali|title=Middle East, western Asia, and northern Africa|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&pg=PA1254|accessdate=22 April 2012|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|page=1254}}</ref>

The town was finally reconstructed by [[Sultan]] [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] (1756–1790), the grandson of [[Moulay Ismail]] and an ally of [[George Washington]], with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called '''الدار البيضاء''' ''ad-Dār al-Bayḍāʼ'', the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation of the Spanish ''Casa Blanca'', meaning "white house".

=== French conquest ===

In the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing Morocco's now famous national drink, [[gunpowder tea]]).<ref name="Srhir2005">{{cite book|last=Srhir|first=Khalid Ben|title=Britain And Morocco During The Embassy Of John Drummond Hay, 1845–1886|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3Wf_Av7-hIoC&pg=PA126|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=19 April 2005|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=978-0-7146-5432-4|page=126}}</ref> By the 1860s, there were around 5,000 residents, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s.<ref>Pennel, CR: ''Morocco from Empire to Independence'', Oneworld, Oxford, 2003, p 121</ref> Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of [[French colonial empires|French colonialists]] in the town, at first administrators within a sovereign sultanate, in 1906. By 1921, this was to rise to 110,000,<ref>Pennel, CR: ''Morocco from Empire to Independence'', Oneworld, Oxford, 2003, p 149.</ref> largely through the development of [[shanty town]]s.

[[File:Casa didier55 019.jpg|thumb|200|Architecture of Casablanca, influenced by French styles]]

In June 1907, the French attempted to build a [[light railway]] near the port and passing through a graveyard. As act of resistance and protestation, the local attacked the French, riots ensued, caused only few wounded soldiers and one dead General. In order to revenge, the French attacked by ships, bombarding the city from the coast, and landing troops inside the town, which caused severe damage to the town and 15 000 dead and wounded bodies. The French claimed that it was to restore order there. Thus, it was just a catalyzing excuse to take control of Casablanca. This effectively began the process of colonization, although French control of Casablanca was not formalised until 1910. Under the French rule, there were Muslim Anti Jewish riots in 1908.<ref name="Hirschberg1981">{{cite book|author=H. Z(J. W.)

The famous 1942 film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' underlined the city's colonial status at the time—depicting it as the scene of a power struggle between competing European powers. The film has a cosmopolitan cast of characters (American, French, German, Italian, Czech, Norwegian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Russian and some other nationalities).

=== World War II ===
[[File:Immeuble Liberté à Casablanca.jpg|thumb|right|Immeuble Liberté, the first Skyscraper in Africa, built in 1949]]
[[Operation Torch]] (initially called [[Operation Gymnast]]) was the British-American invasion of [[French North Africa]] during the North African Campaign of [[World War II]], which started on 8 November 1942.

The [[Military history of the United States during World War II|Americans]] attacked at three different locations in French North Africa, one of the three being the [[Operation Torch#Casablanca|landings at Casablanca]] because of its important ports and the major administrative centers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Bevin|title=How Hitler Could Have Won World War II|year=2000|publisher=Three Rivers Press|pages=167, 169}}</ref>

Casablanca was an important strategic port during World War II and hosted the [[Casablanca Conference (1943)|Casablanca Conference]] in 1943, in which [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] discussed the progress of the war. Casablanca was the site of a large American air base, which was the staging area for all American aircraft for the [[European Theater of Operations]] during World War II.

=== Since independence ===
In October 1930, Casablanca hosted a Grand Prix, held at the new [[Ain-Diab Circuit|Anfa Racecourse]].<ref name="Carter2011">{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Anthony|title=Motor Racing: The Pursuit of Victory 1930–1962|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=46NYxwOmnDUC&pg=PA72|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=1 October 2011|publisher=Veloce Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-84584-279-6|page=72}}</ref> In 1958, the race was held at [[Ain-Diab]] circuit ''(see [[Moroccan Grand Prix]])''.

On 16 May 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a [[2003 Casablanca bombings|multiple suicide bomb attack]] carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to [[al-Qaeda]]. 12 suicide bombers struck five locations in the city.<ref name="DakwarWatch2004">{{cite book|last1=Dakwar|first1=Jamil|last2=Goldstein|first2=Eric|title=Morocco: Human Rights at a Crossroads|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OT9bK03HEZkC&pg=PA25|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2004|publisher=Human Rights Watch|page=25|id=GGKEY:WTWR4502X87}}</ref>

Only one person was injured aside from the bombers, but the Consulate was closed for more than a month.

As calls for reform spread through the Arab world in 2011, Moroccans joined in, but concessions by the ruler led to acceptance.  However, in December thousands of people demonstrated in several parts of the city, especially the city center near la fontaine, desiring more significant political reforms.

===Climate===

Casablanca has a very mild [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csb'') with Oceanic influence. The cool [[Canary Current]] off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate that is remarkably similar to that of [[Los Angeles]], with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 74 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to 427 millimeters per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are {{convert|40.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-2.7|°C|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is 178 millimeters (30 November 2010).

== Demographics ==
The population of Grand Casablanca was estimated in 2005 to be 3.85 million. 98% live in urban areas. Around 25% of them are under 15 and 9% are over 60 years old. The population of the city is about 11% of the total [[Demographics of Morocco|population of Morocco]]. [[Grand Casablanca]] is also the largest [[urban area]] in the [[Maghreb]]. The number of inhabitants is however disputed by the locals, who point to a number between 5 and 6 million{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, citing recent drought years as a reason for many people moving into the city to find work.
During the [[French protectorate in Morocco]] [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] [[Christians]] formed almost half the population.<ref name="A history of the Arab peoples"/> Later after the Independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially

=== Judaism in Casablanca ===
There was a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] community in Anfa up to its destruction by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750 the Rabbi Elijah [[Synagogue]] was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].<ref name=JVL/> Today the [[Jewish cemetery of Casablanca]] is one of the major cemeteries of the city.

== Main sites ==

The French period Ville Nouvelle (New Town) of Casablanca was designed by the French architect [[Henri Prost]], and was a model of a [[planned community|new town]] at that time. The main streets radiate south and east from Place des Nations Unies, previously the main market of Anfa. Former administrative buildings and modern hotels populate the area. Their style is a combination of [[Hispanic-Moorish style|Hispano-Moorish]] and [[Art Deco]].

Casablanca is home to the [[Hassan II Mosque]], designed by the French architect [[Michel Pinseau]]. It is situated on a [[promontory]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. The mosque has room for 25,000 worshippers inside, and a further 80,000 can be accommodated in the mosque's courtyard. Its [[minaret]] is the world's tallest at 210 metres. The mosque is also the largest in North Africa, and the third largest in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/sights/religious-spiritual/hassan-ii-mosque |title=Hassan II Mosque in Morocco, Morocco |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=28 August 2010 |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>

Work on the mosque started in 1980, and was intended to be completed for the 60th birthday of the former [[King of Morocco|Moroccan king]], [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]], in 1989. However, the building was not inaugurated until 1993. Authorities spent an estimated $800 million in the construction of the building.

The Parc de la Ligue Arabe (formally called Lyautey) is the city's largest [[public park]]. On its edge is the [[Casablanca Cathedral]] (Cathédrale Sacré-Coeur). It is no longer in use for religious purposes, but it is open to visitors and a splendid example of ''[[Moorish Revival|Mauresque]]'' architecture. [[The Old Medina]] (the part of town pre-dating the French [[protectorate]]) attracts fewer tourists than the [[Medina quarter|medinas]] of cities like [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] and [[Marrakech]]. However, it has undergone some restoration in recent years. Included in this project have been the western walls of the medina, its ''skala'', or [[bastion]], and its colonial-period clock tower.

A popular site among locals is the small island Marabout de Sidi Abderrahmane. It is possible to walk across to the rocky island at low tide. This outcrop contains the tomb of [[Sidi Abder Rahman El Thaelebi|Sidi Abderrhamane Thaalibi]], a [[Sufi]] from [[Baghdad]] and the founder of Algiers. He is considered a saint in Morocco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morocco.com/blog/visiting-the-venerated-site-of-marabout-de-sidi-abderrahmane |title=Visiting the Venerated Site of Marabout de Sidi Abderrahmane&nbsp;– English Blog &#124; By Morocco Channel |publisher=Morocco.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref> Because of this, many Moroccans make informal pilgrimages to this site "to reflect on life and to seek religious enlightenment". Some believe that the saint possessed magical powers and so his tomb still possesses these powers. People come and seek this magic in order to be cured. Non-Muslims may not enter the shrine.

Other sites include the [[Casablanca Technopark]], an [[information technology]] [[business cluster]] complex, as well as the Casablanca Marina.

== Shopping ==

[[File:Le Morocco Mall ouvre ses portes à Casablanca (6555301965).jpg|lright|thumb|[[Morocco Mall]]]]
There are several shopping centers in Casablanca, of which the largest is [[Morocco Mall]].  It is the largest shopping center in Africa with {{convert|250000|m²|0|abbr=on}} of floor space in Casablanca.  The mall, which opened on December 1, 2011, was designed by architect Davide Padoa of Design International, a global architecture boutique with its headquarters in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/actualite/depeche/afp/24/864782/le_plus_grand_centre_commercial_d_afrique_le_morocco_mall_ouvre_ses_portes.shtml |title=LLe plus grand centre commercial d'Afrique, le Morocco Mall ouvre ses portes |publisher=Le journal du net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>
The mall features a massive 1,000,000 litre aquarium that contains over 40 different species of fish. The aquarium is called "Aquadream" and was designed and built by International Concept Management (ICM). Visitors have the opportunity to take a ride through the center of the cylinder shaped aquarium with a 360-degree view of the sea life. Visitors can also go scuba diving with a professional instructor inside the aquarium. Anfaplace Shopping Center is a shopping center located on the Corniche of Casablanca.[[File:Voiturescasa.jpg|200px|thumb|Parking Anfa]]The [[Casablanca Twin Center]] is the new landmark of the business district of Casablanca. At over 100 meters in height, the twin towers dominate the skyline and the work environment are better co-ordinated and more dynamic which is, as evidenced by their design particularly studied in terms of technology, efficiency and comfort.

== Sports ==

===Hosting===
Casablanca staged the [[1961 Pan Arab Games]], the [[1983 Mediterranean Games]] and the [[1988 Africa Cup of Nations]]. Morocco was scheduled to host the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations|2015 African Nations Cup]], but decided to decline due to Ebola fears. Morocco was expelled and the tournament was held in Equatorial Guinea.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30059022</ref>

The [[Grand Stade de Casablanca]] is the proposed title of the planned football stadium to be built in the city. Once completed in 2014, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of [[Raja Casablanca]], [[Wydad Casablanca]] and the [[Morocco national football team]]. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 80,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the [[Stade Mohamed V]]. The initial idea of the stadium was for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], for which Morocco lost their bid to [[South Africa]]. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2014, ready for the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]].

=== Association football ===
Casablanca is home to two popular football clubs, [[Wydad Casablanca]]<ref name="African concord">{{cite book|title=African Concord|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BUsuAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=1989|publisher=Concord Press of Nigeria|page=43}}</ref> and [[Raja Casablanca]].<ref name="West Africa">{{cite book|title=West Africa|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V310AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2003|publisher=West Africa Publishing Company, Limited|page=38}}</ref> Raja's symbol is an eagle and Wydad's symbol is a goose. These two popular clubs have produced some of Morocco's best players such as: [[Salaheddine Bassir]], [[Abdelmajid Dolmy]], [[Baddou Zaki]], [[Aziz Bouderbala]] and [[Noureddine Naybet]]. There are other football teams on top of these two major teams that are based in the city of Casablanca are [[Rachad Bernoussi]], [[TAS de Casablanca]], [[Majd Al Madina]] and [[RAC Casablanca|Racing Casablanca]].

=== Tennis ===
Casablanca hosts The [[Grand Prix Hassan II]], a professional male tennis tournament of the ATP tour. It first began in 1986. It is played on clay courts type at [[Complexe Al Amal]].

Notable winners of the Hassan II Grand-Prix are: [[Thomas Muster]] in 1990, [[Hicham Arazi]] in 1997, [[Younes El Aynaoui]] in 2002 and [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] in 2010.

== Transport ==
[[File:Casablanca Tramway.jpg|thumb|[[Casablanca tramway]]]]

=== Tram ===
The [[Casablanca tramway]] is the rapid transit tram system in Casablanca in Morocco. The route is {{convert|31|km|0|abbr=on}} long, with 49 stops, and Y-shaped; further lines are planned in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/casablanca-tram-contracts-awarded.html|accessdate=17 November 2011|publisher=Railway Gazette|title=Casablanca tram contracts awarded}}</ref>

=== Air ===
Casablanca's main airport is [[Mohammed V International Airport]], Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]], [[Agadir]], [[Oujda]], and [[Tangier]], [[Laayoune]] as well as other cities.

Casablanca is well served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. [[New York City]], [[Montreal]], [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[Dubai]] are important primary destinations.

The older, smaller [[Casablanca-Anfa Airport]] to the west of the city, that served certain destinations including [[Damascus]], and [[Tunis]], was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It has been closed and destroyed to let build the future "[[Casablanca Finance City]]", the new heart of the city of Casablanca. [[Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport]] is located in the nearby community of [[Tit Mellil]].

=== Coaches ===
CTM coaches (intercity buses) and various private lines run services to most notable Moroccan towns as well as a number of European cities. These run from the Gare Routière on Rue Léon l'Africain in downtown Casablanca.

=== Metro ===
''See also: [[Al Bidaoui|Casablanca RER]] or [[Casablanca metro]]''

An [[Casablanca metro|underground railway system]] is currently being planned, which when constructed will potentially offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. The metro will not be ready before 2017, having a length of {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=off}} and costing 46.7 billion dirhams (approximately 5.8 billion USD).<ref>[http://www.casablanca.ma/index/docs/deplacement_urbain_casa.pdf PROBLEMATIQUE DES DEPLACEMENTS URBAINS A CASABLANCA - Cas du projet de transport en commun en site propre (TCSP)] Ministère de l’Intérieur – 13 novembre 2007.</ref> However, it should be noted that none of the preparatory works for this project have started.

=== Taxis ===
[[File:Petitaxi.jpg|thumb|right|''Petit taxis'' in Casablanca]]
{{See also|Taxicabs of Morocco}}
Registered [[Taxicab|taxis]] in Casablanca are coloured red and known as ''petit taxis'' (''small taxis''), or coloured white and known as ''grands taxis'' (''big taxis''). As is standard Moroccan practice, ''petits taxis,'' typically small-four door [[Dacia Logan]], [[Peugeot 207]] or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. ''Grands taxis,'' generally older [[Mercedes-Benz]] sedans, provide shared [[mini-bus]] like service within the city on pre-defined routes, or shared inter-city service. Grands Taxis may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.

=== Trains ===
Casablanca is served by three principal railway stations run by the national rail service, the [[ONCF]].

{{stnlnk|Casa-Voyageurs}} is the main inter-city station, from which trains run south to [[Marrakech]] or [[El Jadida]] and north to [[Mohammedia]] and [[Rabat]], and then on either to [[Tangier]] or [[Meknes]], [[Fes]], Taza and [[Oujda]]/[[Nador]]. A dedicated airport shuttle service to [[Mohammed V International Airport]] also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.
[[File:CasablancaTrainStation.jpg|thumb|left|Casa-Port railway station]]

{{stnlnk|Casa-Port}} serves primarily commuter trains such as the [[Train Navette Rapide]] (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca – [[Kenitra]] rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near to several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark [[Casablanca Twin Center]]. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction the station is still operational. From 2013 it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the [[Casablanca Tramway|city's new tram network]].

[[Oasis railway station|Casa-Oasis]] was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early twenty-first century, and officially re-opened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern inter-city train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to inter-city standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.
