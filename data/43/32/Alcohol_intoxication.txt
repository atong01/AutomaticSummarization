'''Alcohol intoxication''' (also known as '''drunkenness''' or '''inebriation''') is a physiological state (that may also include psychological alterations of consciousness) induced by the ingestion of [[ethanol]] (alcohol).

Alcohol intoxication is the result of alcohol entering the [[Blood alcohol content|bloodstream]] faster than it can be metabolized by the [[liver]], which breaks down the ethanol into non-intoxicating byproducts. Some effects of alcohol intoxication (such as [[euphoria]] and lowered [[social inhibition]]s) are central to alcohol's desirability [[alcoholic beverage|as a beverage]] and its history as one of the world's most widespread [[recreational drug]]s. Despite this widespread use and alcohol's legality in most countries, many medical sources tend to describe any level of alcohol intoxication as a form of [[poisoning]] due to ethanol's damaging effects on the body in large doses; some religions consider alcohol intoxication to be a [[sin]] while others utilize it in [[sacrament]].

Symptoms of alcohol intoxication include [[euphoria]], [[flushing (physiology)|flushed skin]] and decreased [[social inhibition]] at lower doses, with larger doses producing progressively severe impairments of balance, muscle coordination ([[ataxia]]), and [[decision-making]] ability (potentially leading to violent or erratic behavior) as well as [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]] from alcohol's disruptive effect on the [[semicircular canals]] of the [[inner ear]] and chemical irritation of the [[gastric mucosa]]. Sufficiently high levels of blood-borne alcohol will cause [[coma]] and death from the depressive effects of alcohol upon the [[central nervous system]].

== Pathophysiology ==
Alcohol is [[metabolized]] by a normal [[liver]] at the rate of about {{convert|50|ml|USfloz|abbr=on}} of [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] (roughly a typical drink-size serving of beer, wine, or spirits) every 90 minutes.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} An "abnormal" liver with conditions such as [[hepatitis]], [[cirrhosis]], [[gall bladder]] disease, and [[cancer]] are likely to result in a slower rate of metabolism.

[[Ethanol]] is metabolised to [[acetaldehyde]] by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH), which is found in many tissues, including the gastric mucosa. Acetaldehyde is metabolised to acetate by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which is found predominantly in liver mitochondria. Acetate is used by the muscle cells to produce [[acetyl-CoA]] using the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase, and the acetyl-CoA is then used in the [[citric acid cycle]].<ref>Smith, C., Marks, Allan D., Lieberman, Michael, 2005, ''Marks' Basic Medical Biochemistry: A Clinical Approach'', 2nd Edtn, Lippincott Williams & Williams, USA, p. 458</ref> It takes roughly 90 minutes for a healthy liver to metabolize a single ounce, approximately one hour per [[Unit of alcohol|standard unit]].
[[File:The wine is a mocker 1663-1664 Jan Steen.jpg|thumb|thumb|''Wine is a Mocker'' by Dutch artist [[Jan Steen]] c. 1663]]

Ethanol's acute effects are due largely to its nature as a central nervous system depressant, and are dependent on blood alcohol concentrations:
* 20–79&nbsp;mg/dL – Impaired coordination and [[euphoriant|euphoria]]
* 80–199&nbsp;mg/dL – Binge drinking: [[Ataxia]], poor judgement, [[labile mood]]. The [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) defines the term "[[binge drinking]]" as a pattern of drinking that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 g/dL or above.<ref name="cdc.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm|title=Alcohol & Public Health: Fact Sheets - Binge Drinking|date=7 November 2012|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>
* 200–299&nbsp;mg/dL – Marked ataxia, slurred speech, poor judgement, labile mood, nausea and vomiting
* 300–399&nbsp;mg/dL – [[General anaesthesia#Stages of anaesthesia|Stage 1 anaesthesia]], memory lapse, labile mood
* 400+ mg/dL – Respiratory failure, coma

As drinking increases, people become sleepy, or fall into a [[stupor]]. After a very high level of consumption, the respiratory system becomes depressed and the person will stop breathing.  Comatose patients may aspirate their vomit (resulting in vomitus in the lungs, which may cause "drowning" and later [[pneumonia]] if survived). CNS depression and impaired motor co-ordination along with poor judgement increases the likelihood of accidental injury occurring.<ref>{{cite journal | author = McArdle P | year = 2004 | title = Substance abuse by children and young people | url = | journal = Arch. Dis. Child | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 701–704 | doi=10.1136/adc.2003.040584}}</ref> It is estimated that about one third of alcohol-related deaths are due to accidents (32%), and another 14% are from intentional injury.<ref>The World Health Organisation (2007) Alcohol and Injury in Emergency Departments</ref>

In addition to respiratory failure and accidents caused by effects on the central nervous system, alcohol causes significant metabolic derangements. [[Hypoglycaemia]] occurs due to ethanol's inhibition of [[gluconeogenesis]], especially in children, and may cause [[lactic acidosis]], [[ketoacidosis]], and acute [[renal failure]]. Metabolic acidosis is compounded by respiratory failure. Patients may also present with hypothermia.

== Pharmacology ==
{{See also|Ethanol#Pharmacology}}
In the past, alcohol was believed to be a non-specific pharmacological agent affecting many [[neurotransmitter]] systems in the brain.<ref name=Vengeliene>{{cite journal|last=Vengeliene, V. Bilbao, A., Molander, A. & Spangel, R.|title=Neuropharmacology of alcohol addiction|journal=[[British Journal of Pharmacology]]|year=2008|volume=154|pages=299–315|doi=10.1038/bjp.2008.30|pmid=18311194|pmc=2442440|first1=V|last2=Bilbao|first2=A|last3=Molander|first3=A|last4=Spanagel|first4=R|issue=2}}</ref> However, molecular pharmacology studies have shown that alcohol has only a few primary targets. In some systems, these effects are facilitatory and in others inhibitory.

Among the neurotransmitter systems with enhanced functions are: [[GABAA|GABA<sub>A</sub>]],<ref name=Mihic>{{cite journal|title=Sites of alcohol and volatile anaesthetic action on GABA(A) and glycine receptors|journal=Nature|year=1997|volume=389|issue=6649|pages=385–389|doi=10.1038/38738|pmid=9311780|first1=S.

The result of these direct effects is a wave of further indirect effects involving a variety of other [[neurotransmitter]] and [[neuropeptide]] systems, leading finally to the behavioural or symptomatic effects of alcohol intoxication.<ref name=Vengeliene />

=== GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors===
{{See also|GABAA#Ligands}}
[[File:Ethanol and GABA Receptor.png|thumb|Ethanol binding to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]]
Many of the effects of activating [[GABA receptors|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]] have the same effects as that of ethanol consumption. Some of these effects include [[anxiolytic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[sedative]] and [[hypnotic]] effects, cognitive impairment, and motor incoordination.<ref name="first GABA">{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Sandeep|last2=Porcu|first2=Patrizia|last3=Werner|first3=David|last4=Matthews|first4=Douglas|last5=Diaz-Granados|first5=Jamie|last6=Helfand|first6=Rebecca|last7=Morrow|first7=Leslie|title=The role of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the acute and chronic effects of ethanol: a decade of progress|journal=Psychopharmacology|date=2009|volume=205|issue=4|pages=529–64|doi=10.1007/s00213-009-1562-z|pmid=19455309|pmc=2814770}}</ref> This correlation between activating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and the effects of ethanol consumption has led to the study of ethanol and its effects on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.

== Acute alcohol poisoning ==
"Acute alcohol poisoning" is a related medical term used to indicate a dangerously high concentration of alcohol in the blood, high enough to induce coma, [[respiratory depression]], or even death. It is considered a [[medical emergency]]. The term is mostly used by [[health care provider|healthcare providers]]. [[Toxicology|Toxicologists]] use the term "alcohol intoxication" to discriminate between alcohol and other [[toxin]]s.

The signs and symptoms of acute alcohol poisoning include:
* severe confusion, unpredictable behavior and [[stupor]]
* sudden lapses into and out of [[unconsciousness]] or semi-consciousness (with later [[Blackout (alcohol-related amnesia)|alcoholic amnesia]])
* vomiting while unconscious or semi-conscious<ref name=Hales>{{cite book|last=Hales|first=Dianne|title=An invitation to health|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-495-39192-0|pages=344|edition=Brief [ed]., 2010–2011}}</ref>
* [[seizures]]
* [[respiratory depression]] (fewer than eight breaths a minute)
* pale, bluish, cold and clammy skin due to insufficient oxygen<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alcohol-poisoning/Pages/Introduction.aspx NHS.uk]</ref>

=== Diagnosis ===
{{See also|Blood alcohol content}}
Definitive [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] relies on a blood test for alcohol, usually performed as part of a [[toxicology]] screen.

[[Law enforcement officers]] often use [[breathalyzer]] units and [[field sobriety test]]s as more convenient and rapid alternatives to blood tests.

There are also various models of breathalyzer units that are available for consumer use. Because these may have varying reliability and may produce different results than the tests used for law-enforcement purposes, the results from such devices should be conservatively interpreted.

Many informal intoxication tests exist, which, in general, are unreliable and not recommended as deterrents to excessive intoxication or as indicators of the safety of activities such as motor vehicle driving, heavy equipment operation, machine tool use, etc.

For determining whether someone is intoxicated by alcohol by some means other than a blood-alcohol test, it is necessary to rule out other conditions such as [[hypoglycemia]], [[stroke]], usage of other intoxicants, mental health issues, and so on. It is best if his/her behavior has been observed while the subject is sober to establish a baseline. Several well-known criteria can be used to establish a probable diagnosis. For a physician in the acute-treatment setting, acute alcohol intoxication can mimic other acute neurological disorders, or is frequently combined with other [[recreational drug]]s that complicate diagnosis and treatment.

=== Management ===
Acute alcohol poisoning is a [[medical emergency]] due to the risk of death from [[respiratory depression]] and/or [[aspiration pneumonia|inhalation of vomit]] if [[emesis]] occurs while the patient is unconscious and unresponsive. Emergency treatment for acute alcohol poisoning strives to stabilize the patient and maintain a patent airway and respiration, while waiting for the alcohol to metabolize. This can be done by removal of any vomitus or, if patient is unconscious or has impaired gag reflex, intubation of the trachea using an endotracheal tube to maintain adequate airway:<ref>{{cite journal | author = Devi G., Castro V. J., Huitink J., Buitelaar D., Kosten T., O'Connor P. | year = 2003 | title = Management of Drug and Alcohol Withdrawal | url = | journal = NEJM | volume = 349 | issue = | pages = 405–407 | pmid = 12878752 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200307243490420}}</ref>
Also:
* Treat [[hypoglycaemia]] (low blood sugar) with 50 ml of 50% dextrose solution and saline flush, as ethanol induced hypoglycaemia is unresponsive to glucagon.
* Administer the vitamin [[thiamine]] to prevent [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]], which can cause a [[seizure]] (more usually a treatment for chronic alcoholism, but in the acute context usually co-administered to ensure maximal benefit).
* Apply [[hemodialysis]] if the blood concentration is dangerously high (>400&nbsp;mg/dL), and especially if there is [[metabolic acidosis]].
* Provide oxygen therapy as needed via nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask.
Additional [[medicine|medication]] may be indicated for treatment of [[nausea]], [[tremor]], and [[anxiety]].

=== Prognosis ===
A normal liver detoxifies the blood of alcohol over a period of time that depends on the initial level and the patient's overall physical condition. An abnormal liver will take longer but still succeeds, provided the alcohol does not cause [[liver failure]].<ref>{{cite journal | author =  | year = 2003 | title = Management of alcoholic hepatitis | url = | journal = Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 49–52 | doi = 10.1136/dtb.2003.41749 }}</ref>

People having drunk heavily for several days or weeks may have [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal]] symptoms after the acute intoxication has subsided.<ref>{{cite journal | author = DeBellis R., Smith B. S., Choi S., Malloy M. | year = 2005 | title = Management of Delirium Tremens | url = | journal = J Intensive Care Med | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 164–173 | doi=10.1177/0885066605275353}}</ref>

A person consuming a dangerous amount of alcohol persistently can develop memory blackouts and idiosyncratic intoxication or pathological drunkenness symptoms.<ref>Gelder, M., Mayou, R. and Geddes, J. 2005. ''Psychiatry''. 3rd ed. New York: Oxford. pp. 186.</ref>

Long-term persistent consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol can cause liver damage and have other deleterious health effects.

== Society and culture ==
Alcohol intoxication is a [[risk factor]] in some cases of [[catastrophic injury]], in particular for unsupervised [[recreation]]al activity. A study in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Ontario]] based on [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] data from 1986, 1989, 1992, and 1995 states that 79.2% of the 2,154 catastrophic injuries recorded for the study were preventable, of which 346 involved alcohol consumption.<ref name="Tator">{{cite book|title=Catastrophic Injuries in Sports and Recreation: Causes and Prevention: A Canadian Study|editor-last=Tator|editor-first=Charles H.|edition=2|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2008|isbn=9780802089670}}</ref> The activities most commonly associated with alcohol-related catastrophic injury were [[snowmobiling]] (124), [[fishing]] (41), [[diving]] (40), [[boating]] (31) and [[canoeing]] (7), swimming (31), riding an [[all-terrain vehicle]] (24), and [[cycling]] (23).<ref name="Tator" /> These events are often associated with unsupervised young males, often inexperienced in the activity, and many result in [[drowning]].<ref name="Tator" />

=== Legal issues ===
[[File:Drunk driving simulator, Montreal by CAA of Quebec.jpg|thumb|right|A drunk-driving simulator in [[Montreal]].]]
Laws on drunkenness vary. In the United States, it is a criminal offence for a person to be [[Driving under the influence|drunk while driving a motorized vehicle]], except in [[Wisconsin]], where it is only a [[Civil infraction|fine]] for the first offence.<ref>[http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/346 Wis. Stat. §§ 346.63(1)(a) & 346.65(2)(am)(1)]</ref> It is also a criminal offence to fly an aircraft or (in some [[U.S. state|American states]]) to assemble or operate an [[amusement park]] ride while drunk.<ref>[http://law.onecle.com/texas/penal/49.065.00.html Texas Penal Code § 49.065]</ref> Similar laws also exist in the United Kingdom and most other countries.

In some countries, it is also an offence to serve alcohol to an already-intoxicated person,<ref>[http://www.camden.gov.uk/ccm/content/press/2007/february/booze-license-suspended-after-selling-alcohol-to-drunk-customers.en Camden.gov.uk]</ref> and, often, alcohol can be sold only by persons qualified to serve responsibly through [[alcohol server training]].

The [[Blood alcohol content#Limits by country (BAC: Blood Alcohol Content)|blood alcohol content]] (BAC) for legal operation of a vehicle is typically measured as a percentage of a unit volume of blood. This percentage ranges from 0.00% in Romania and the United Arab Emirates; to 0.05% in Australia, South Africa, and Germany; to 0.08% in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.icap.org/PolicyIssues/DrinkingandDriving/BACTable/tabid/199/Default.aspx Blood Alcohol Concentration Limits Worldwide]</ref>

The United States [[Federal Aviation Administration]] prohibits [[Aircrew|crew members]] from performing their duties with a BAC greater than 0.04% within eight hours of consuming an alcoholic beverage, or while under the influence of alcohol.<ref>[http://www.risingup.com/fars/info/part1-1-FAR.shtml Sec. 1.1 - General definitions.]</ref><ref>[http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/28757d8ae4d7d671862571960066be86!OpenDocument&Click= Part 91 General Operating and Flight Rules]</ref>

In the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, people are arrested for [[public intoxication]], called "being drunk and disorderly" or "being drunk and incapable."<ref>{{cite news |date=1872-08-10 |title=Licensing Act 1872 |periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament |volume=1872 |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1052305 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>

In some countries, there are special facilities, sometimes known as "[[drunk tanks]]", for the temporary detention of persons found to be drunk.

=== Religious views ===
Some religious groups permit the consumption of alcohol. Some permit consumption but prohibit intoxication, while others prohibit alcohol consumption altogether. In the [[Qur'an]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/004.qmt.html#004.043 |title=Qur'an: 4:43 |publisher=Usc.edu |date=|accessdate=2010-12-04| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20101204153931/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/004.qmt.html| archivedate=4 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/002.qmt.html#002.219 |title=Qur'an: 2:19 |publisher=Usc.edu |accessdate=2010-12-04| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20101204153812/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/002.qmt.html| archivedate=4 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/005.qmt.html#005.090 Qur'an: 5:90-91]</ref> there is a prohibition on the consumption of [[grape]]-based alcoholic beverages, and intoxication is considered as an abomination in the [[Hadith]]. [[Islam]]ic schools of law ([[Madh'hab]]) have interpreted this as a strict prohibition of the consumption of all types of alcohol and declared it to be [[haraam]] ("forbidden"), although other uses may be permitted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yilmaz|first=Ihsan|title=Muslim Laws, Politics And Society In Modern Nation States: Dynamic Legal Pluralisms In England, Turkey And Pakistan|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-7546-4389-0|page=158|chapter=Post-Modern Muslim Legality and its Consequences|chapterurl=http://books.google.ca/books?id=4OrGYg31fi0C&pg=PA158&lpg=PA158&dq=Madhhab+alcohol|year=2004|origyear=2005-01-31}}</ref>

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], alcohol consumption is forbidden,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/89 |title=Doctrine and Covenants 89}}</ref> and [[teetotalism]] has become a distinguishing feature of its members. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] allow moderate alcohol consumption among its members.

In [[Buddhism]], in general, the consumption of intoxicants is discouraged for both monastics and lay followers. Many followers of Buddhism observe a code of conduct known as the [[Five Precepts]], of which the fifth precept is an undertaking to refrain from the consumption of intoxicating substances (except for medical reasons). In the [[Bodhisattva vows|Bodhisattva Vows]] of the Brahma Net Sutra, observed by some monastic communities and some lay followers, distribution of intoxicants is likewise discouraged as well as consumption.

In the branch of [[Hinduism]] known as [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], one of the four regulative principles forbids the taking of intoxicants, including alcohol.

In [[Judaism]], the [[Babylonian Talmud]] says in Megillah 7b that "[[Rava (amora)|Rava]] said: A person is obligated to become intoxicated on [[Purim]] until he is unaware of the difference between 'Cursed be [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]]' and 'Blessed be [[Mordechai]].'" This is taken to mean that on the Jewish festival of Purim one is commanded to drink alcohol to the point of intoxication.<ref>[[Yanki Tauber]]: [http://www.chabad.org/global/popup/default_cdo/aid/2814/jewish/The-Purim-Drunk.htm Are Jews actually supposed to get drunk on Purim?] Chabad.org (referring to the Talmudic tractate Megillah (7b).</ref> During all other times of year, though, Judaism stresses moderation—not cutting out alcohol entirely, but not getting too drunk either.<ref>Menachem Posner: [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/581082/jewish/What-is-Judaisms-take-on-alcohol-consumption.htm What is Judaism's take on alcohol consumption?] on Chabad.org</ref>
