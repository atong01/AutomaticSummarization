The '''Explorers program''' is a United States space exploration program that provides flight opportunities for physics, [[geophysics]], [[heliophysics]], and [[astrophysics]] investigations from space.<ref name="Home">{{cite web|url=http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.html |title=Explorers Program |accessdate=2009-12-05 |year=2009 |work=Goddard Space Flight Center |publisher=NASA }}</ref>  Over 90 space missions have been launched since 1958, and it is still active. Starting with [[Explorer 6]], it has been operated by NASA, with regular collaboration with a variety of other institutions, including many international partners.

== History ==
[[File:Ignition of Jupiter-C with Explorer 1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Explorer 1's Jupiter rocket ignites]]
[[File:Sputnik 1.jpg|thumb|thumb|200px|left|''Sputnik'' caused an uproar in the West]]
The Explorers program was the [[United States]]'s first successful attempt to launch an [[satellite|artificial satellite]]. It began as a [[U.S. Army]] proposal ([[Project Orbiter]]) to place a scientific satellite into [[orbit]] during the [[International Geophysical Year]]; however, that proposal was rejected in favor of the U.S. Navy's [[Project Vanguard]]. The Explorers program was later reestablished to catch up with the [[Soviet Union]] after that nation's launch of [[Sputnik 1]] on October 4, 1957. (''See:'' [[Sputnik crisis]]) [[Explorer 1]] was launched on January 31, 1958. Besides being the first U.S. satellite, it is known for discovering the [[Van Allen radiation belt]].

The Explorers program was transferred to [[NASA]], which continued to use the name for an ongoing series of relatively small space missions, typically an artificial satellite with a specific science focus. Over the years, [[NASA]] has launched a series of Explorers [[spacecraft]] carrying a wide variety of scientific investigations.
[[File:M101 combined low.jpg|thumb|This artificially colored view of M101 maps ultraviolet light as blue while visible light is red since UV light does not have a "color" (the eye stopping at about violet). This view was taken by the Explorer SWIFT, which can also detect X-Rays, and has contributed to the study of Gamma-ray bursts and other topics]]
Explorers satellites have made many important discoveries on: Earth's [[magnetosphere]] and the shape of its [[Gravitational field|gravity field]]; the [[solar wind]]; properties of [[micrometeoroids]] raining down on the Earth; ultraviolet, cosmic, and X-rays from the Solar System and universe beyond; [[Ionosphere|ionospheric physics]]; [[Solar flare|Solar plasma]]; [[solar energetic particles]]; and atmospheric physics. These missions have also investigated air density, radio astronomy, geodesy, and [[gamma ray astronomy]]. Various space telescopes have made a variety of discoveries, including the first known [[Earth Trojan asteroid]].

The Explorers Program Office at Goddard Space Flight Center in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], provides management of the many operational scientific exploration missions in the program. The missions are characterized by relatively moderate costs and small to medium-sized missions that are capable of being built, tested, and launched in a short time interval compared to larger observatories.<ref>[http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/history.html Explorers Program History]</ref>

Explorers categories have included MIDEX (Medium Explorer), [[Small Explorer program|SMEX]] (Small Explorer), UNEX (University-Class Explorer), and others.<ref>[http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions.html Goddard Space Flight Center: Explorers]</ref> A subprogram called Missions of Opportunity (MO) has funded instruments on non-NASA missions.

Launchers used for these missions include [[Jupiter C]] ([[Juno I]]), [[Juno II]], various [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor]] rockets such as the [[Thor-Able]], [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout]], various Delta and [[Delta II]] rockets of the [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rocket family]], and [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]].

==Spacecraft by year==
Explorers name numbers can be found in the NSSDC master catalog, typically assigned to each spacecraft in a mission. These numbers were not officially assigned until after 1975.<ref>[http://www.planet4589.org/space/misc/explorer.html The NASA Explorers program of scientific satellites]</ref>

Many missions are proposed, but not selected. For example in 2011, the Explorers program received 22 full missions solicitations, 20 Missions of Opportunity, and 8 USPI.<ref>[http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/EX/ NASA - EX]</ref> Missions of Opportunity (MO) are small collaborative missions with spacecraft not operated by NASA, such as an additional instrument. Examples of this include [[Astro-H]], [[CINDI]], [[TWINS]], and [[HETE-2]]. Sometimes mission are only partially developed but must be stopped for financial, technological, or bureaucratic reasons. Some missions failed upon reaching orbit including WIRE and TERRIERS.

Examples of missions that were not developed or cancelled were:<ref>[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/explorer.htm Gunter's Space Page - Explorer Program]</ref> 
*Owl 1 	
*Owl 2 	 	
*MSS A 	 	
*CATSAT (STEDI 3) 	
*IMEX (UNEX 2) 	
*[[Full-sky Astrometric Mapping Explorer|FAME (MIDEX 4)]] 	 		
*SPIDR (SMEX 8)
*[[Gravity and Extreme Magnetism|GEMS (SMEX 13)]]
*TESS was eventually selected but was turned down for SMEX

Examples of recent missions conclusions, sometimes cancelled due to budget constraints:
*[[GALEX|Galaxy Evolution Explorer]] - 2013
*[[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer|Rossi XTE]] -  2012
*[[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]] - 2011 (Restarted in 2013 NEOWISE mission)
*[[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|Wilkinson MAP]] - 2010
*[[TRACE]] - 2010 (Solar observatory, see [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]])
*[[Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer|FAST]] - 2009
