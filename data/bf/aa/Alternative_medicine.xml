Any treatment whether conventional or alternative that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects. Attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the<space/><italics><link><target>appeal to nature</target></link></italics><space/>fallacy, i.e., &quot;that which is natural cannot be harmful&quot;.
