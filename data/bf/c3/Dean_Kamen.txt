===Inventions===
Kamen is best known for inventing the product that eventually became known as the [[Segway PT]], an electric, self-balancing human transporter with a computer-controlled [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] stabilization and control system. The device is balanced on two parallel wheels and is controlled by moving body weight. The machine's development was the object of much speculation and hype after segments of a book quoting [[Steve Jobs]] and other notable [[information technology|IT]] visionaries espousing its society-revolutionizing potential were leaked in December 2001.

Kamen has worked extensively on a project involving [[Stirling engine]] designs, attempting to create two machines; one that would generate power, and the [[Slingshot (water vapor distillation system)|Slingshot]] that would serve as a [[water purification]] system.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/03/colbert-and-kam/ Colbert and Kamen Solve the World’s Water Problems].

Kamen states that his company [[DEKA (company)|DEKA]] is now working on [[solar power]] inventions.<ref name="guardian" />

Kamen is also the co-inventor of a [[pneumatics|compressed air]] device that would launch a human into the air in order to quickly launch [[SWAT]] teams or other emergency workers to the roofs of tall, inaccessible buildings.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/16/man_slinger/ |title=DARPA plots emergency man-cannon |work=The Register |date=16 May 2006 |accessdate=2009-03-11 |first=Chris |last=Williams}}</ref><ref>{{USPTO Application|docnum=20060086349}}</ref>

Kamen was already a successful and wealthy inventor, after inventing the first drug infusion pump and starting a company, ''AutoSyringe'', to market and manufacture the pump.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Code Name Ginger: the story behind Segway and Dean Kamen's quest to invent a new world |page=13 |first=Steve |last=Kemper |publisher=Havard Business School Press |ISBN=1-57851-673-0}}</ref> His company DEKA also holds patents for the technology used in portable [[dialysis]] machines, an insulin pump (based on the drug infusion pump technology),<ref>{{Cite book |title=Code Name Ginger: the story behind Segway and Dean Kamen's quest to invent a new world |page=19 |first=Steve |last=Kemper |publisher=Havard Business School Press |ISBN=1-57851-673-0}}</ref> and an all-terrain electric [[wheelchair]] known as the [[iBOT]], using many of the same gyroscopic balancing technologies that later made their way into the Segway.

Kamen and DEKA also developed the DEKA Arm System or "[[Luke_Arm|Luke]]", a [[prosthetic]] arm replacement that offers its user much more fine motor control than traditional prosthetic limbs. It was approved for use by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in May 2014, and DEKA is looking for partners to mass-produce the prosthesis.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lawler |first=Richard |title=FDA approves a life-like prosthetic arm from the man who invented the Segway |url=http://www.engadget.com/2014/05/09/luke-bionic-arm-approved-by-fda/ |work=Engadget |accessdate=11 May 2014}}</ref>

===FIRST===
In 1989, Kamen founded [[FIRST]] (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a program for students to get people interested in science, technology, and engineering. One competition started and run by FIRST is the FRC or FIRST Robotics Competition. In 2011, it held 55 regional competitions around the globe, and one international competition in St. Louis, MO.<ref>{{cite web |title=FRC Regional Events |url=http://usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/regionalevents.aspx?id=430}}</ref> FIRST has gained a great deal of publicity from companies as well as many universities and colleges.

FIRST has many robotic programs, including the Jr.FLL ([[Junior FIRST Lego League]]) and the FLL ([[FIRST Lego League]]) for younger students, and the FTC ([[FIRST Tech Challenge]]) and the FRC ([[FIRST Robotics Competition]]) for high school aged students.<ref>[http://www.usfirst.org/ FIRST Official Website] – accessed December 23, 2009</ref>

Kamen says that the FIRST competition is the invention he is most proud of, and predicts that the 1 million students who have taken part in the contests so far will be responsible for some significant technological advances in years to come.<ref name="Economist">{{Cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/16295592?story_id=16295592 |title=Brain scan: Mr Segway's difficult path |first=Mark |last=Harris |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>

===Awards===
During his career Kamen has won numerous awards. He was elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 1997 for his biomedical devices and for making engineering more popular among high school students. In 1999 he was awarded the 5th Annual [[Heinz Award]] in Technology, the Economy and Employment,<ref>[http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/dean-kamen The Heinz Awards, Dean Kamen profile]</ref> and in 2000 received the National Medal of Technology from then [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] for inventions that have advanced medical care worldwide. In April 2002, Kamen was awarded the [[Lemelson-MIT Prize]] for inventors, for his invention of the Segway and of an infusion pump for diabetics. In 2003 his "Project Slingshot," a cheap portable [[water purification]] system, was named a runner-up for "coolest invention of 2003" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/research/fellows/asset_55323_1176.jsp |title=The Gartner Fellows: Dean Kamen's Interview |publisher=Gartner.com |date=2003-10-30 |accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref> In 2005 he was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] for his invention of the AutoSyringe.

==Personal life==
His residence is a [[hexagon]]al, [[shed style]] mansion he dubbed Westwind,<ref name="wired" /> located in [[Bedford, New Hampshire]], just outside of the larger city of [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]]. The house has at least four different levels and is very eclectically conceived, with such things as hallways resembling mine shafts, 1960s novelty furniture, a collection of vintage wheelchairs, spiral staircases and at least one secret passage, an observation tower, a fully equipped machine shop, and a huge cast-iron steam engine which once belonged to [[Henry Ford]] built into the center atrium of the house (which is actually small in comparison), which Kamen is working to convert into a [[Stirling engine]]-powered [[kinetic sculpture]]. Kamen owns and pilots an [[Embraer Phenom 300]] light jet aircraft<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=116DK |title=N-Number Inquiry Results |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref> and three Enstrom helicopters, including a [[Enstrom 280|280FX]], a [[Enstrom 480|480]], and a 480B.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=36DK |title=N-Number Inquiry Results |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref><ref name="aircraftinquiry1">{{Cite web |url=http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=46DK |title=N-Number Inquiry Results |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=56DK |title=N-Number Inquiry Results |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref> Kamen regularly commutes to work via his helicopters and had a hangar built into his house.<ref>''[[Iconoclasts]]'', Season 2, Show #10. Isabella Rossellini and Dean Kamen November 16, 2006</ref>

He is the main subject of ''Code Name Ginger: the Story Behind Segway and Dean Kamen's Quest to Invent a New World'', a nonfiction narrative book by journalist Steve Kemper published by Harvard Business School Press in 2003 (in paperback as ''Reinventing the Wheel'').

His company, DEKA, annually creates intricate mechanical presents for him. The company has created a robotic chess player, which is a mechanical arm attached to a chess board, and a vintage-looking computer with antique wood, and a converted typewriter as a keyboard. In addition, DEKA has received funding from [[DARPA]] to work on a brain-controlled prosthetic limb called the [[Luke Arm]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2008/06/new_luke_arm_video.html |title=New Luke Arm Video |publisher=Medgadget.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref>

Kamen is also a member of the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]]'s Advisory Board.<ref>http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors retrieved 2010-07-05</ref>

''[[Dean of Invention]]'', a TV show on [[Planet Green]] starring Kamen and correspondent [[Joanne Colan]], in which they investigate new technologies, premiered on October 22, 2010.<ref>[http://planetgreen.discovery.com/tv/dean-of-invention/about-the-show-2.html About Dean Of Invention: A New Show Dedicated To The World's Greatest Scientific Breakthroughs Of Today]</ref>
