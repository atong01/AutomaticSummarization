'''Bentley Motors Limited''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|t|l|i}}) is a British registered company that designs, develops, and manufactures Bentley luxury motorcars which are largely hand-built. It is a subsidiary of [[Volkswagen AG]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/10359364/Monday-Interview-Bentley-boss-on-whats-driving-demand-for-luxury-British-cars.html|title=Monday Interview: Bentley boss on what's driving demand for luxury British cars|accessdate=10 April 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=6 October 2013|location=London|first=Louise|last=Armitstead}}</ref>  Now based in [[Crewe]], England, Bentley Motors Limited was founded by [[W. O. Bentley]] on 18 January 1919 in Cricklewood, North London. 

Bentley cars are sold via franchised dealers worldwide, and as of November 2012, China was the largest market.<ref>{{cite news|last=Einhorn|first=Bruce|title=The Surge in China's Auto Sales May Soon Slow|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-05/chinas-auto-sales-surge-may-soon-slow#r=lr-fs|newspaper=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=5 April 2012}}</ref> 

Most Bentley cars are assembled at the Crewe factory, but a small number of Continental Flying Spurs are assembled at the [[Transparent Factory|factory]] in [[Dresden]], Germany.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pistonheads.com/news/default.asp?storyId=28854|title=BENTLEY: MADE IN GERMANY|accessdate=11 April 2014|publisher=[[PistonHeads]]|date=14 November 2013}}</ref> and bodies for the Continental are produced in [[Zwickau]], Germany. 

Bentley won the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in [[1924 24 Hours of Le Mans|1924]], [[1927 24 Hours of Le Mans|1927]], [[1928 24 Hours of Le Mans|1928]], [[1929 24 Hours of Le Mans|1929]], [[1930 24 Hours of Le Mans|1930]], and [[2003 24 Hours of Le Mans|2003]].

Iconic Bentley models include the [[Bentley 4½ Litre]], [[Bentley Speed Six]], [[Bentley R Type]] Continental, [[Bentley Turbo R]], and [[Bentley Arnage]]. As of 2015, Bentley produce the [[Bentley Continental Flying Spur|Continental Flying Spur]], [[Bentley Continental GT|Continental GT]], and [[Bentley Mulsanne (2010)|Mulsanne]].

[[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] bought Bentley from the receivers in 1931 and subsequently sold it to Vickers plc in 1980 when Rolls-Royce themselves went bankrupt. In 1998, Vickers sold it to Volkswagen AG. The sale included the vehicle designs, model nameplates, production and administrative facilities, the [[Spirit of Ecstasy]] and Rolls-Royce grille shape trademarks, but not the rights to the Rolls-Royce name or logo which are owned by Rolls-Royce Holdings plc and were licensed to [[BMW|BMW AG]].

==Cricklewood==
Before [[World War&nbsp;I]],  [[W. O. Bentley|Walter Owen Bentley]], and his brother, Horace Millner Bentley, sold French [[Doriot, Flandrin & Parant|DFP]] cars in Cricklewood, North London, but W.O, as Walter was known, always wanted to design and build his own cars. At the DFP factory, in 1913, he noticed an aluminum paperweight and thought that aluminum might be a suitable replacement for cast iron to fabricate lighter pistons. The first Bentley aluminum pistons were fitted to [[Sopwith Camel]] aero engines during [[World War&nbsp;I]]. 

In August 1919, W.O. registered Bentley Motors Ltd. and in October he exhibited a car chassis, with dummy engine, at the [[British International Motor Show|London Motor Show]].<ref name="Beaulieu">{{cite book |editor1-last=Georgano |editor1-first=Nick | authorlink=G.N.

By December the engine was built and running. Delivery of the first cars was scheduled for June 1920, but development took longer than estimated so the date was extended to September 1921.<ref name="Beaulieu" /> The durability of the first Bentley cars earned widespread acclaim and they competed in hill climbs and raced at [[Brooklands]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Bentley's first major event was the [[1922 Indianapolis 500]], a race, dominated by specialized cars with [[Duesenberg]] racing chassis. They entered a modified road car driven by works driver, [[Douglas Hawkes]], accompanied by riding mechanic, H. S. "Bertie" Browning.<ref name="IndyBrits">{{cite book |last1= Wagstaff|first1= Ian|title= The British at Indianapolis= |url= http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=aczKjoVLQn8C&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate= 11 October 2013|date=September 2010|publisher= Veloce Publishing|location= Dorchester, UK|isbn= 978-1-84584-246-8|pages=.26–27 |chapter= 3: The Not-So-Roaring Twenties|chapterurl= http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=aczKjoVLQn8C&pg=PA26&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false|quote= It was an event that was to prove a costly exercise for the Cricklewood-based company in sending both a professional driver and a mechanic with the car.|ref= IndyBrits}}</ref> Hawkes completed the full 500 miles and finished 13th with an average speed of 74.95&nbsp;mph after starting in 19th position.<ref name="AutocourseIndyTable">{{cite book |last1= Davidson|first1= Donald|last2= Schaffer|first2= Rick|title=Autocourse Official History of the Indianapolis 500|url= http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=CeCxyf0BpgUC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate= 9 October 2013|type= |year= 2006|publisher= MBI Publishing|location= St. Paul, MN USA|isbn= 1-905334-20-6|page= 327|chapter= Official Box Scores 1911–2006|chapterurl= |ref= AutocourseIndy}}</ref> The team was then rushed back to England to compete in the 1922 [[RAC Tourist Trophy]].<ref name="IndyBrits" /><ref name="AutocourseIndy60">[[#AutocourseIndy|Davidson, Donald, Schaffer, Rick, ''Autocourse Official History of the Indianapolis 500'']], page 60</ref>

===Captain Woolf Barnato===
In ironic reference to his [[heavyweight boxer]]'s stature, Captain [[Woolf Barnato]] was nicknamed [[List of motorsports people by nickname#B|"Babe"]]. In 1925, he acquired his first Bentley, a 3-litre. With this car he won numerous [[Brooklands]] races. Just a year later he acquired the Bentley business itself. 

The Bentley enterprise was always underfunded, but inspired by the 1924 Le Mans win by [[John Duff]] and [[Frank Clement (racing driver)|Frank Clement]], Barnato agreed to finance Bentley's business. Barnato had incorporated ''Baromans Ltd'' in 1922, which existed as his finance and investment vehicle. Via Baromans, Barnato initially invested in excess of £100,000, saving the business and its workforce. A financial reorganisation of the original Bentley company was carried out and all existing creditors paid off for £75,000. Existing shares were devalued from £1 each to just 1 shilling, or 5% or their original value. Barnato held 149,500 of the new shares giving him control of the company and he became chairman. Barnato injected further cash into the business: £35,000 secured by [[debenture]] in July 1927; £40,000 in 1928; £25,000 in 1929. With renewed financial input, W. O. Bentley was able to design another generation of cars.

===The Bentley Boys===
{{Main|Bentley Boys|Blue Train Races}}
[[File:1929 Bentley front 34 right.jpg|thumb|1929 Blower Bentley]]
The [[Bentley Boys]] were a group British motoring enthusiasts that included [[Woolf Barnato]], [[Henry Birkin|Sir Henry "Tim" Birkin]], [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeple chaser]] George Duller, [[aviator]] [[Glen Kidston]], automotive journalist [[S.C.H. "Sammy" Davis]], and [[Dudley Benjafield|Dr Dudley Benjafield]]. The [[Bentley Boys]], favored Bentley cars. Many were independently wealthy and often had a military background.  They kept the marque's reputation for high performance alive; Bentley was noted for its four consecutive victories at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] from 1927 to 1930.

In 1929, Tim Birkin developed the 4½ litre, lightweight [[Blower Bentley]] at Welwyn Garden City and produced five racing specials, starting with [[Bentley Blower No.1]] which was optimised for the Brooklands racing circuit. Birkin overruled W.O. and put the model on the market before it was fully developed. As a result, it was unreliable. 

In March 1930, during the [[Blue Train Races]], Woolf Barnato raised the stakes on [[Rover Company|Rover]] and its [[Rover Light Six]], having raced and beaten ''[[Le Train Bleu]]'' for the first time, to better that record with his 6½-litre [[Bentley Speed Six]] on a bet of £100. He drove against the train from [[Cannes]] to [[Calais]], then by ferry to [[Dover]], and finally London, travelling on public highways, and won.

Barnato drove his [[H.J. Mulliner & Co.|H.J. Mulliner]]–bodied [[sedan (automobile)|formal saloon]] in the race against the Blue Train. Two months later, on 21 May 1930, he took delivery of a Speed Six with streamlined fastback "Sportsman Coupé" by [[J Gurney Nutting & Co Limited|Gurney Nutting]]. Both cars became known as the "[[Blue Train Bentley]]s"; the latter is regularly mistaken for, or erroneously referred to as being, the car that raced the Blue Train, while in fact Barnato named it in memory of his race.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1698/Bentley-Speed-Six--Blue-Train-Special-.html |title=Bentley Speed Six 'Blue Train Special' |last=Melissen |first=Wouter |date=12 January 2004 |publisher=UltimateCarPage |accessdate=4 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://autoaficionado.net/issue/0101-38.html |title=The Slippery Shape of Power |last=Burgess-Wise |first=David |date=1 January 2006 |work=Auto Aficionado |accessdate=4 November 2008|deadurl= yes|archivedate= 24 March 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090324025849/http://autoaficionado.net/issue/0101-38.html}}</ref>  A painting by [[Terence Cuneo]] depicts the Gurney Nutting coupé racing along a road parallel to the Blue Train, which scenario never occurred as the road and railway did not follow the same route.

===Cricklewood Bentleys===

*1928–30 [[Bentley Speed Six|6½-litre Speed Six]]
*1930–31 [[Bentley 8 Litre|8-litre]]
*1931 [[Bentley 4 Litre|4-litre]]

The original model was the 3-litre, but as customers put heavier bodies on the chassis, a larger 4½-litre model followed. Perhaps the most iconic model of the period is the 4½-litre "Blower Bentley", with its distinctive [[supercharger]] projecting forward from the bottom of the grille. Uncharacteristically fragile for a Bentley it was not the racing workhorse the 6½-litre was, though in 1930 Birkin remarkably finished second  in the [[1930 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix at Pau]] in a stripped-down racing version of the "Blower Bentley", behind [[Philippe Etancelin]] in a [[Bugatti Type 35]].

The 4½-litre model later became famous in popular media as the vehicle of choice of [[James Bond]] in the original [[Ian Fleming|novels]], but this has been seen only briefly in the [[James Bond film series|films]]. [[John Steed]] in the television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' also drove a Bentley.

The new 8-litre was such a success that when Barnato's money seemed to run out in 1931 and Napier was planning to buy Bentley's business, Rolls-Royce purchased Bentley Motors to prevent it competing with their most expensive model, Phantom&nbsp;II.

Bentley withdrew from motor racing just after winning at Le Mans in 1930, claiming that they had learned enough about speed and reliability.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bentley Motors To Give Up Racing |work=Evening Telegraph |location= Angus, Scotland|date=1 July 1930 |accessdate=23 July 2014 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000563/19300701/068/0005| publisher = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}</ref>

===Liquidation===
The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the resulting [[Great Depression]] throttled the demand for Bentley's expensive motor cars. In July 1931, two mortgage payments were due which neither the company nor Barnato, the guarantor, were able to meet. On 10 July 1931 a [[receivership|Receiver]] was appointed.<ref>"Receiver Appointed Of Bentley Motors Limited Re Bentley Motors Limited; London Life Association Limited v. Bentley Motors Limited, And Woolf Barnato". ''The Times'', Saturday, 11 July 1931; pg. 4; Issue 45872</ref>

[[Napier & Son]] offered to buy Bentley with the purchase to be final in November 1931. Instead, British Central Equitable Trust made a winning sealed bid of £125,000.<ref name="BentleyDNA">{{cite book |last=Feast |first=Richard |title=The DNA of Bentley |url=http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=5l0PBEg9Ta0C |accessdate=26 March 2012 |year=2004 |publisher=[[MotorBooks International]] |location=St. Paul, MN |isbn=978-0-7603-1946-8 |pages=64–65 |chapter=When Barnato bought Bentley |chapterurl=http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=5l0PBEg9Ta0C&pg=PA64#v=twopage&f=false|ref=BentleyDNA }}</ref> British Central Equitable Trust later proved to be a [[Front organization|front]] for [[Rolls-Royce Limited]]. Not even Bentley himself knew the identity of the purchaser until the deal was completed.<ref name=Beaulieu/>

Barnato received £42,000 for his shares in Bentley Motors. By coincidence, he had bought a sizable stake in Rolls-Royce not long before Bentley Motors was liquidated.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In 1934 he was appointed to the board of the new Bentley Motors (1931) Ltd. In the same year Bentley confirmed that it would continue racing.

The attempted total obliteration of Bentley Motors [[W O Bentley#Lock-out|and its founder]] was an outcome of a long-standing [[feud|vendetta]] between [[Ernest Walter Hives, 1st Baron Hives|Hives]] and [[W O Bentley|Bentley]]. The two engineers had completely opposing natures. The conflict begun in 1914 when Bentley was made [[W O Bentley#Aero engines|official liaison]] between Government and aero engine manufacturers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Bentley may have been the better engineer,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} but his weaknesses were poor personal relationships and his inability to curb spending on development. The 8-Litre was acknowledged{{By whom|date=March 2012}} to be the better if more expensive car.  He became patron of the Bentley Drivers' Club when Woolf Barnato's term as its president ended.

==Derby and Rolls-Royce==
[[File:1935-bentley-archives.jpg|right|thumb|"The silent sports car"<br>1935 3½-litre Cabriolet by]]
Rolls-Royce took over the assets of Bentley Motors (1919) Ltd and formed a subsidiary, Bentley Motors (1931) Ltd. Rolls-Royce had acquired the Bentley showrooms in Cork Street, the service station at Kingsbury, the complex at Cricklewood and the services of Bentley himself. This last was disputed by Napier in court without success. Bentley had neglected to register their trademark so Rolls-Royce immediately did so. They also sold the [[Cricklewood]] factory in 1932. Production stopped for two years,<ref>{{cite news |title=Luxury of the long-distance cruiser |first=Ross |last=Finley |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YMBAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1aUMAAAAIBAJ&dq=bentley%20rolls%20royce%20takeover%201931&pg=3350%2C6839959 |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|Glasgow Herald]] |date=29 November 1985 |page=21 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref> before resuming at the Rolls-Royce works in Derby. Unhappy with his role at Rolls-Royce, when his contract expired at the end of April 1935 W.&nbsp;O. Bentley left to join [[Lagonda]].

When the new [[Bentley 3.5 Litre|Bentley 3½ litre]] appeared in 1933, it was a sporting variant of the [[Rolls-Royce 20/25]], which disappointed some traditional customers yet was well received by many others. W.&nbsp;O. Bentley was reported as saying, "Taking all things into consideration, I would rather own this Bentley than any other car produced under that name".<ref name=Beaulieu/> Rolls-Royce's advertisements for the {{fraction|3|1|2}}&nbsp;Litre called it "the silent sports car",<ref name="BentleyDNA77">[[#BentleyDNA|Feast, Richard, ''The DNA of Bentley'']], [http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=5l0PBEg9Ta0C&pg=PA71&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false Chapter 5&nbsp;– Togetherness: Rolls-Royce/Bentley], p. 77</ref> a slogan Rolls-Royce continued to use for Bentley cars until the 1950s.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Stein|first1= Ralph|title= Sports Cars of the World|url= http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=0RlXAAAAMAAJ&q|accessdate= 29 September 2013|year=1952|publisher= Scribner|isbn=|doi= |id= |page= 43|quote= These, known as "the silent sports car," have been successfully marketed for almost twenty years now in various models.|ref= }}</ref>

==Crewe and Rolls-Royce==
In preparation for war, Rolls Royce and the [[British Government]] searched for a location for a [[shadow factory]] to ensure production of aero-engines.<ref name=OllerheadnFlood/> <ref>Pugh 2000, pp. 192-198.</ref> Crewe, with its excellent road and rail links, as well as being located in the [[Northwest England|northwest]] away from the [[Airstrike|aerial bombing]] starting in mainland Europe, was a logical choice. Crewe also had extensive open farming land. Construction of the factory started on a 60-acre area on the [[potato]] fields of Merrill's Farm in July 1938, with the first [[Rolls Royce Merlin]] aero-engine rolling off the production line five months later. 25,000 Merlin engines <ref name=OllerheadnFlood/> were produced and at its peak, in 1943 during [[World War II]], the factory employed 10,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jackbarclayparts.co.uk/about-us/crewe-history/|title=Bentley Crewe History 1914 - 2006|publisher=Jack Barclay|accessdate=19 November 2010|deadurl= yes|archivedate= 5 March 2012|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20120305100743/http://www.jackbarclayparts.co.uk/about-us/crewe-history/}}</ref> With the war in Europe over and the general move towards the then new [[jet engine]]s, Rolls Royce concentrated its aero engine operations at [[Derby]] and moved motor car operations to Crewe.<ref name=OllerheadnFlood/>

===Standard saloons===
[[File:Bentley MK VI DE-14-32 pic3.JPG|right|thumb|[[Bentley Mark VI]] standard steel saloon, the first Bentley supplied by Rolls-Royce with a standard body.]]
Until some time after [[World War&nbsp;II]], most high-end motorcar manufacturers like Bentley and Rolls-Royce did not supply complete cars. They sold [[rolling chassis]], near-complete from the instrument panel forward. Each chassis was delivered to the coach builder of the buyer's choice. The biggest specialist car dealerships had coachbuilders build standard designs for them which were held in stock awaiting potential buyers.

[[File:Bentley MK VI project 4951122539.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The assembled pressings from Pressed Steel]]
To meet post-war demand, particularly UK Government pressure to export and earn overseas currency, Rolls-Royce developed an all steel body using pressings made by [[Pressed Steel Company|Pressed Steel]] to create a "standard" ready-to-drive complete saloon car. The first steel-bodied model produced was the [[Bentley Mark VI]]:  these started to emerge from the newly reconfigured Crewe factory early in 1946.<ref name=OllerheadnFlood>Crewe's Rolls-Royce Factory From Old Photographs by Peter Ollerhead and Tony Flood, republished electronically 2013 by Amberley Publishing of Stroud, Gloucestershire, England</ref><ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Crewe's Rolls-Royce Factory From Old Photographs|author=Ollerhead, P.|date=2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing|isbn=9781445627649|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CWSIAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>   Some years later, initially only for export, the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn]] was introduced, a standard steel Bentley but with a Rolls-Royce radiator grille for a small extra charge, and this convention continued.

Chassis remained available to coachbuilders until the end of production of the [[Bentley S3]], which was replaced for [[Paris Motor Show|October 1965]] by the chassis-less [[monocoque]] construction [[Bentley T-series|T series]].

===Bentley Continental===
[[File:Bentley SI Continental Fastback Coupe Mulliner.jpg|right|thumb|Bentley Continental, fastback coupé body by H J Mulliner]]
The Continental fastback coupé was aimed at the UK market, most cars, 164 plus a [[prototype]], being right-hand drive. The chassis was produced at the Crewe factory and shared many components with the standard R type. Other than the R-Type standard steel saloon, R-Type Continentals were delivered as rolling chassis to the [[coachbuilder]] of choice. Coachwork for most of these cars was completed by [[H.&nbsp;J. Mulliner & Co.]] who mainly built them in fastback coupe form. Other coachwork came from [[Park Ward]] (London) who built six, later including a drophead coupe version. [[Franay]] (Paris) built five, Graber (Wichtrach, Switzerland) built three, one of them later altered by Köng (Basel, Switzerland), and [[Pininfarina]] made one. [[James Young (coachbuilder)|James Young]] (London) built in 1954 a Sports Saloon for the owner of James Young's, James Barclay.

The early R&nbsp;Type Continental has essentially the same engine as the standard R&nbsp;Type, but with modified carburation, induction and exhaust manifolds along with higher gear ratios.<ref name=Autocar1969>{{cite journal |title = Used Car test: Bentley Continental| journal=Autocar| volume = 130 |issue=3824 | pages = 47–48| date = 29 May 1969}}</ref> After July 1954 the car was fitted with an engine, having now a larger bore of 94.62&nbsp;mm (3.7&nbsp;in) with a total displacement of {{convert|4887|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}}. The compression ratio was raised to 7.25:1.

[[File:Bentley Logo on White Car.jpg|thumb|The Bentley logo on a 1998 Arnage|upright=0.68]]
The problems of Bentley's owner with Rolls-Royce aero engine development, the [[RB211]], brought about the financial collapse of its business in 1970.

The motorcar division was made a separate business, Rolls-Royce Motors Limited, which remained independent until bought by [[Vickers plc]] in August 1980. By the 1970s and early 1980s Bentley sales had fallen badly; at one point less than 5% of combined production carried the Bentley badge.<ref name=Beaulieu/> Under Vickers, Bentley set about regaining its high-performance heritage, typified by the 1980 [[Bentley Mulsanne (1980–1992)|Mulsanne]]. Bentley's restored sporting image created a renewed interest in the name and Bentley sales as a proportion of output began to rise. By 1986 the Bentley:Rolls-Royce ratio had reached 40:60; by 1991 it achieved parity.<ref name=Beaulieu/>

===Volkswagen AG vs. BMW AG===
In October 1997, Vickers announced that it had decided to sell Rolls-Royce Motors. [[BMW|BMW AG]] seemed to be a logical purchaser because BMW already supplied engines and other components for Bentley and Rolls-Royce branded cars and because of BMW and Vickers joint efforts in building aircraft engines. BMW made a final offer of £340m, but was outbid by [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen AG]], which offered £430m. Volkswagen AG acquired the vehicle designs, model nameplates, production and administrative facilities, the Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grille shape trademarks, but not the rights to the use of the Rolls-Royce name or logo, which are owned by Rolls-Royce Holdings plc. In 1998, BMW started supplying components for the new range of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars—notably [[V8 engine]]s for the [[Bentley Arnage]] and [[V12 engine]]s for the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph]], however, the supply contract allowed BMW to terminate its supply deal with Rolls-Royce with 12 months' notice, which would not be enough time for Volkswagen to re-engineer the cars.

[[File:bentleyazure.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bentley Azure]] Mulliner 2003 Final Series]]
BMW paid [[Rolls-Royce plc]] £40m to license the Rolls-Royce name and logo. After negotiations, BMW and Volkswagen AG agreed that, from 1998 to 2002, BMW would continue to supply engines and components and would allow Volkswagen temporary use of the Rolls-Royce name and logo. All BMW engine supply ended in 2003 with the end of Silver Seraph production.

From 1 January 2003 forward, Volkswagen AG would be the sole provider of cars with the "Bentley" marque. BMW established a new legal entity, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited, and built a new administrative headquarters and production facility for Rolls-Royce branded vehicles in Goodwood, West Sussex, England.

After acquiring the business, Volkswagen spent [[Pound sterling|GBP]]500&nbsp;million (about US$845&nbsp;million) to modernise the Crewe factory and increase production capacity.<ref name=BW062410>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-06-23/porsche-development-head-duerheimer-said-to-succeed-paefgen-as-bentley-ceo |title=Volkswagen Said to Shuffle Porsche, Bentley Managers |date=24 June 2010 |first=Andreas |last=Cremer |work=BusinessWeek |accessdate=25 June 2010 }}</ref>
As of early 2010, there are about 3,500 working at Crewe, compared with about 1,500 in 1998 before being taken over by Volkswagen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/going-back-in-time-at-the-bentley-factory/|title=Going Back in Time at the Bentley Factory |date=10 May 2010 |first=Mark |last=Gillies |publisher=Car and Driver blog |accessdate=25 June 2010 }}</ref>
It was reported that Volkswagen invested a total of nearly US$2&nbsp;billion in Bentley and its revival.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2004-12-05/vw-steals-a-lead-in-luxury |title=VW Steals A Lead In Luxury |date=6 December 2004 |first=Gail |last=Edmondson |work=BusinessWeek |accessdate=25 June 2010 }}</ref>
As a result of upgrading facilities at Crewe the bodywork now arrives fully painted at the Crewe facility for final assembly, with the parts coming from Germany—similarly Rolls-Royce body shells are painted and shipped to the UK for assembly only.

In 2002, Bentley presented [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] with an official [[Bentley State Limousine|State Limousine]] to celebrate her [[Golden Jubilee]]. In 2003, Bentley's two-door convertible, the [[Bentley Azure]], ceased production, and Bentley introduced a second line, [[Bentley Continental GT]], a large luxury coupé powered by a [[W12 engine]] built in Crewe.

Demand had been so great that the factory at Crewe was unable to meet orders despite an installed capacity of approximately 9,500 vehicles per year; there was a waiting list of over a year for new cars to be delivered. Consequently, part of the production of the new [[Bentley Continental Flying Spur (2005)|Flying Spur]], a four-door version of the Continental GT, was assigned to the [[Transparent Factory]] (Germany), where the [[Volkswagen Phaeton]] luxury car is also assembled. This arrangement ceased at the end of 2006 after around 1,000 cars, with all car production reverting to the Crewe plant.

In April 2005, Bentley confirmed plans to produce a four-seat convertible model—the [[Bentley Azure|Azure]], derived from the [[Bentley Arnage|Arnage Drophead Coupé]] prototype—at Crewe beginning in 2006. By the autumn of 2005, the convertible version of the successful Continental GT, the [[Bentley Continental|Continental GTC]], was also presented. These two models were successfully launched in late 2006.

A limited run of a [[Zagato]] modified GT was also announced in March 2008, dubbed "GTZ".

A new version of the Bentley Continental was introduced at the 2009 [[Geneva Auto Show]]: The [[Bentley Continental Supersports|Continental Supersports]]. This new Bentley is a supercar combining extreme power with environmentally friendly FlexFuel technology, capable of using petrol (gasoline) and biofuel (E85 ethanol).

Bentley sales continued to increase, and in 2005 8,627 were sold worldwide, 3,654 in the United States. In 2007, the 10,000 cars-per-year threshold was broken for the first time with sales of 10,014. For 2007, a record profit of [[Euro|€]]155&nbsp;million was also announced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bentley reports record profit|last=Garlick|url=http://www.pistonheads.com/news/default.asp?storyId=17750|accessdate=18 March 2008}}</ref>
Bentley reported a sale of about 7,600 units in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=ajtqDKRS4Rno |title=Daimler Maybach Fails to Dent Rolls, Bentley Super-Luxury Lead |date=15 December 2009 |first=Chris |last=Reiter |first2=Mike |last2=Ramsey |publisher=Bloomberg }}</ref>
However, its global sales plunged 50 percent to 4,616 vehicles in 2009 (with the U.S. deliveries dropped 49% to 1,433 vehicles) and it suffered an operating loss of [[Euro|€]]194&nbsp;million, compared with an [[operating profit]] of [[Euro|€]]10&nbsp;million in 2008.<ref name=BW062410/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-14/volkswagen-s-bentley-targets-u-s-growth-with-mulsanne-sedan.html |title=Volkswagen's Bentley Targets U.S. Growth With Mulsanne Sedan |date=14 January 2010 |first=Andreas |last=Cremer |work=BusinessWeek |accessdate=25 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121025225117/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-14/volkswagen-s-bentley-targets-u-s-growth-with-mulsanne-sedan.html |archivedate=25 October 2012 }}</ref> As a result of the slump in sales, production at Crewe was shut down during March and April 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1126830/Bentley-announces-seven-week-production-shutdown-Jaguar-chief-calls-Government-aid.html |title=Bentley announces seven-week production shutdown while Jaguar chief calls for Government aid |first=Ray |last=Massey |date=23 January 2009 |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London}}</ref> Though vehicle sales increased by 11% to 5,117 in 2010, operating loss grew by 26% to [[Euro|€]]245&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://annualreport2010.volkswagenag.com/divisions/bentley.html |title=Volkswagen AG 2010 Annual Report |publisher=Annualreport2010.volkswagenag.com |date= |accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>
In Autumn 2010, workers at Crewe staged a series of protests over proposal of compulsory work on Fridays and mandatory overtime during the week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crewechronicle.co.uk/crewe-news/crewe-business-news/2010/11/24/bentley-protests-continue-in-crewe-over-changes-to-working-hours-96135-27702030/ |title=Bentley protests continue in Crewe over changes to working hours |date=24 October 2010 |first=Rhiannon |last=Cooke |newspaper=Crewe Chronicle }}</ref>

Vehicle sales in 2011 rose 37% to 7,003 vehicles, with the new Continental GT accounting for over one-third of total sales. The current workforce is about 4,000 people.

The business earned a profit in 2011 after two years of losses as a result of the following sales results:<ref>{{cite news|last=Rauwald|first=Christopher|title=Bentley Mulls Its Own SV|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=4 January 2012|page=B3}}</ref>
