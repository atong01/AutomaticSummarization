==History==
The site of the Empire State Building was first developed as the John Thompson Farm in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esbnyc.com/esb_story_historical_timeline.asp |title=Empire State Building : Official Internet Site |publisher=Esbnyc.com |accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref> At the time, a stream ran across the site, emptying into Sunfish Pond, located a block away. Beginning in the late 19th century, the block was occupied by the [[Waldorf–Astoria (New York, 1893)|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], frequented by [[Ward McAllister#"The Four Hundred"|The Four Hundred]], the social elite of New York.

The limestone for the Empire State Building came from the Empire Mill in Sanders, Indiana which is an unincorporated town adjacent to Bloomington, Indiana. The Empire Mill Land office is near State Road 37 and Old State Road 37 just south of Bloomington. The Bloomington, Bedford, and Oolitic area is known locally as the limestone capital of the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Design and construction===
[[File:Old timer structural worker2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A worker bolts beams during construction; the [[Chrysler Building]] can be seen in the background.]]

The Empire State Building was designed by [[William F. Lamb]] from the architectural firm [[Shreve, Lamb and Harmon]], which produced the building drawings in just two weeks, using its earlier designs for the [[Reynolds Building]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], North Carolina, and the [[Carew Tower]] in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio (designed by the architectural firm [[Walter W. Ahlschlager|W. W. Ahlschlager & Associates]]) as a basis.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090107082903/http://www.allbusiness.com/construction/construction-buildings/167637-1.html Reynolds Building].

Excavation of the site began on January 22, 1930, and construction on the building itself started symbolically on March 17—St. Patrick's Day—per Al Smith's influence as Empire State, Inc. president. The project involved 3,400 workers, mostly immigrants from Europe, along with hundreds of [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] iron workers, many from the [[Kahnawake]] reserve near [[Montreal]]. According to official accounts, five workers died during the construction.<ref>[http://history1900s.about.com/od/1930s/a/empirefacts.htm about.com]&nbsp;– Empire State Building Trivia and Cool Facts</ref> Governor Smith's grandchildren cut the ribbon on May 1, 1931.

The construction was part of an intense competition in New York for the title of "[[List of tallest buildings in the world|world's tallest building]]". Two other projects fighting for the title, [[40 Wall Street]] and the [[Chrysler Building]], were still under construction when work began on the Empire State Building. Each held the title for less than a year, as the Empire State Building surpassed them upon its completion, on April 11, 1931, 12 days ahead of schedule, just 410&nbsp;days after construction commenced.<ref name="gencon" />  The building was officially opened on May 1, 1931 in dramatic fashion, when United States President [[Herbert Hoover]] turned on the building's lights with the push of a button from Washington, D.C. Ironically, the first use of tower lights atop the Empire State Building, the following year, was for the purpose of signaling the victory of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] over Hoover in the presidential election of November 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esbnyc.com/tourism/tourism_history_towerlights.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005022339/http://www.esbnyc.com/tourism/tourism_history_towerlights.cfm?CFID=35467039&CFTOKEN=30788876|archivedate= October 5, 2009 |title=Tower Lights History | publisher = Empire State Building |accessdate=December 16, 2007}}</ref>

===Opening===
[[File:Empire State Building pano.jpg|thumb|left|175px|View of the building from the north]]
The building's opening coincided with the [[Great Depression]] in the United States, and as a result much of its office space was initially unrented. The building's vacancy was exacerbated by its poor location on 34th Street, which placed it relatively far from public transportation, as [[Grand Central Terminal]] and [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], built decades beforehand, are several blocks away, as is the more recently built [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]]. Other more successful skyscrapers, such as the [[Chrysler Building]], did not have this problem. In its first year of operation, the observation deck took in approximately 2&nbsp;million dollars, as much money as its owners made in rent that year. The lack of renters led New Yorkers to deride the building as the "Empty State Building".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/new-york/new-york-city/attractions.html |title=NYT Travel: Empire State Building |work=The New York Times |accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A Renters' Market in London |first=Adam |last=Smith |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1833243,00.html |magazine=Time |date=August 18, 2008 |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}</ref> The building only became profitable in 1950. The 1951 sale of the Empire State Building to [[Roger L. Stevens]] and his business partners was brokered by the prominent upper Manhattan real-estate firm Charles F. Noyes & Company for a record $51&nbsp;million. At the time, that was the highest price paid for a single structure in real-estate history.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100124184746/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/newyork/index.html]—''[[New York: A Documentary Film]]''.</ref>

====1945 plane crash====
{{Main|B-25 Empire State Building crash}}

At 9:40 am on Saturday, July 28, 1945, a [[B-25 Mitchell]] bomber, piloted in thick fog by [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] William Franklin Smith, Jr.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.457thbombgroup.org/New/750thSquad.html|title=750th Squadron 457th Bombardment Group: Officers&nbsp;– 1943 to 1945|accessdate=April 6, 2009}}</ref> crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building, between the 79th and 80th floors, where the offices of the [[National Catholic Welfare Council]] were located. One engine shot through the side opposite the impact and flew as far as the next block, where it landed on the roof of a nearby building, starting a fire that destroyed a penthouse. The other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft. The resulting fire was extinguished in 40&nbsp;minutes. Fourteen people were killed in the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/0112/News/News8-0112.html |title=Empire State Building Withstood Airplane Impact |publisher=Tms.org |accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elevator-world.com/magazine/archive01/9603-002.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710181241/http://www.elevator-world.com/magazine/archive01/9603-002.htm|archivedate= July 10, 2011 |title=Plane Hits Building&nbsp;– Woman Survives 75-Story Fall |publisher=Elevator-world.com |accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref> Elevator operator [[Betty Lou Oliver]] survived a plunge of 75 stories inside an elevator, which still stands as the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the longest survived elevator fall recorded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=53746 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317041607/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=53746 |archivedate=March 17, 2006 |title=ACTUAL ARTICLE TITLE BELONGS HERE! |publisher=guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref> Despite the damage and loss of life, the building was open for business on many floors on the following Monday. The crash helped spur the passage of the long-pending [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] of 1946, as well as the insertion of retroactive provisions into the law, allowing people to sue the government for the incident.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Day A Bomber Hit The Empire State Building |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92987873 |quote=Eight months after the crash, the U.S. government offered money to families of the victims.

On May 1, 1947, 23-year-old Evelyn McHale leapt to her death from the 86th floor observation deck and landed on a [[limousine]] parked at the curb. Photography student Robert Wiles took a photo of McHale's oddly intact corpse a few minutes after her death. The police found a suicide note among possessions she left on the observation deck: "He is much better off without me ... I wouldn’t make a good wife for anybody". The photo ran in the edition of May 12, 1947 of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite journal| title = Picture of the Week| url = http://books.google.com/?id=ZEgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA42| accessdate = October 11, 2010| date = May 12, 1947| pages = 42–43| issn = 0024-3019| journal = Life }}</ref> and is often referred to as "The Most Beautiful Suicide".

In December 1943, ex-[[United States Navy]] [[gunner's mate]] William Lloyd Rambo jumped to his death, landing amidst Christmas shoppers on the street below.

Only one person has jumped from the upper observatory: on November 3, 1932, Frederick Eckert, of [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]], ran past a guard in the enclosed 102nd floor gallery and jumped a gate leading to an outdoor catwalk intended for [[Airship|dirigible]] passengers. Eckert's body landed on the roof of the 86th floor observation promenade.<ref>{{cite news |title=Leaps to His Death Off Empire Tower |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0610FF355516738DDDAD0894D9415B828FF1D3 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 4, 1932 |accessdate=October 4, 2011}}</ref>

Two people have survived jumps, in both cases by not managing to fall more than a floor: On December 2, 1979, Elvita Adams jumped from the 86th floor, only to be blown back onto a ledge on the 85th floor by a gust of wind and left with a [[broken hip]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Douglas| first = George H.| title = Skyscrapers: A Social History of the Very Tall Building in America| url = http://books.google.com/?id=IxDUUqut-XkC&pg=PA173| accessdate = October 11, 2010| year = 2004| publisher = McFarland| location = London| isbn = 978-0-7864-2030-8| page = 173 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Broughton| first = Geoffrey| title = Expressions| year = 1987| publisher = Collins ELT| location = London| isbn = 0-00-370641-9| page = 32 }}</ref><ref>[[#Goldman|Goldman 1980]], p.63.</ref> On April 25, 2013, a man, <!-- do not put in name until '''reliable''' news sources report it --> who is presumed to have jumped, fell from the 86th floor observation deck but landed alive on an 85th floor ledge – where security guards managed to bring him inside; he suffered only minor injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sky-fall-man-tumbles-empire-state-building-article-1.1326967|title=SKY FALL!

====Shootings====
Two major shooting incidents have occurred at or in front of the Empire State Building.

On February 23, 1997, at about 5&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]], a gunman [[1997 Empire State Building shooting|shot seven people]] on the 86th floor observation deck. Abu Kamal, a 69-year-old Palestinian teacher, killed one person and wounded six others, supposedly in response to events happening in [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] and [[Israel]], before committing suicide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gunman shoots 7, kills self at Empire State Building |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9702/24/empire.shooting/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420005919/http://www.cnn.com/US/9702/24/empire.shooting/ |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=February 24, 1997 |accessdate=January 4, 2015 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

On August 24, 2012 at about 9&nbsp;a.m. EDT, on the sidewalk at the [[Fifth Avenue]] side of the building, a gunman [[2012 Empire State Building shooting|shot and killed a former co-worker]] from a workplace that had laid him off in 2011. When two police officers confronted the gunman, 58-year-old Jeffrey T. Johnson, he aimed his firearm at them. They responded by firing 16 shots at Johnson, killing him but also wounding nine bystanders, most of whom were hit by fragments, although three took direct hits from bullets.<ref name="CNN">{{cite news |title=Police: All Empire State shooting victims were wounded by officers |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/25/justice/new-york-empire-state-shooting/index.html |accessdate=January 4, 2015 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=August 24, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Looking Up at Empire State Building.JPG|thumb|right|A series of [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] causes the building to taper with height.]]

===Interior===
The Empire State Building rises to {{convert|1250|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} at the 102nd floor, and including the {{convert|203|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} pinnacle, its full height reaches {{convert|1453|ft|8+9/16|in}}. The building has 85 stories of commercial and office space representing {{convert|2158000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of rentable space. It has an indoor and outdoor observation deck on the 86th floor. The remaining 16 stories represent the [[Art Deco]] tower, which is capped by a 102nd-floor observatory. Atop the tower is the {{convert|203|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} pinnacle, much of which is covered by broadcast antennas, with a lightning rod at the very top.

The Empire State Building was the first building to have more than 100 floors. It has 6,500 windows and 73 elevators, and there are 1,860 steps from street level to the 102nd floor. It has a total floor area of {{convert|2768591|sqft|m2|0|abbr=on}}; the base of the Empire State Building is about {{convert|2|acre|m2|0|abbr=on}}. The building houses 1,000 businesses and has its own ZIP code, 10118. As of 2007, approximately 21,000 employees work in the building each day, making the Empire State Building the second-largest single office complex in America, after [[the Pentagon]]. The building was completed in one year and 45&nbsp;days. Its original 64 elevators are located in a central core;<ref>{{cite book| author = Bonnier Corporation| title = Popular Science| url = http://books.google.com/?id=8ycDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44| date = April 1931| publisher = Bonnier Corporation| isbn = | page = 44 }}</ref> today, the Empire State Building has 73 elevators in all, including service elevators. It takes less than one minute by elevator to get to the 80th floor, which contains a gift shop and an exhibit detailing the building's construction. From there, visitors can take another elevator or climb the stairs to the 86th floor, where an outdoor observation deck is located. The building has {{convert|70|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} of pipe, {{convert|2500000|ft|m|abbr=on}} of electrical wire,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esbnyc.com/tourism/tourism_facts.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108015050/http://www.esbnyc.com/tourism/tourism_facts.cfm?CFID=35912131&CFTOKEN=20453790|archivedate= November 8, 2009 |title=Facts & Trivia | publisher = Empire State Building |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}</ref> and about 9,000 faucets.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} It is heated by low-pressure steam; despite its height, the building only requires between {{convert|2|and|3|psi|abbr=on}} of steam pressure for heating. It weighs approximately {{convert|370000|ST|t|abbr=on}}. The exterior of the building was built using [[Indiana limestone]] panels.

The Empire State Building cost $40,948,900 to build<ref name="cost">{{cite web |url=http://history1900s.about.com/od/1930s/a/empirefacts.htm |title=Empire State Building Trivia and Cool Facts |last=Rosenberg |first=Jennifer |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=November 8, 2008}}</ref> (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|40,948,900|1931|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{currentyear}}). Long-term forecasting of the life cycle of the structure was implemented at the design phase to ensure that the building's future intended uses were not restricted by the requirements of previous generations. This is particularly evident in the over-design of the building's electrical system.

Unlike most of today's skyscrapers, the Empire State Building features an [[art deco]] design, typical of pre–World War II architecture in New York. The modernistic [[stainless steel]] canopies of the entrances on 33rd and 34th Streets lead to two story-high corridors around the elevator core, crossed by stainless steel and glass-enclosed bridges at the second-floor level. The elevator core contains 67 elevators.<ref name="AIA" />

The lobby is three stories high and features an aluminum relief of the skyscraper without the antenna, which was not added to the spire until 1952. The north corridor contained eight illuminated panels, created by Roy Sparkia and Renée Nemorov in 1963 in time for the [[1964 World's Fair]], which depicts the building as the [[Eighth Wonder of the World]], alongside the traditional seven. These panels were eventually moved near a ticketing line for the observation deck.

Up until the 1960s, the ceilings in the lobby had a shiny art deco mural inspired by both the sky and the [[Machine Age]], until it was covered with ceiling tiles and fluorescent lighting. Because the original murals, designed by an artist named Leif Neandross, were damaged, reproductions were installed. Over 50 artists and workers used 15,000 square feet of aluminum and 1,300 square feet of 23-carat gold leaf to re-create the mural. Renovations to the lobby alluded to original plans for the building; replacing the clock over the information desk in the Fifth Avenue lobby with an [[anemometer]], as well as installing two chandeliers originally intended to be part of the building when it first opened.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/nyregion/23empire.html |title=Overhead, a Lobby Is Restored to Old Glory |work=The New York Times |author=Barron, James |authorlink=James Barron (journalist) |date=September 22, 2009 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100515151755/http://www.nytimes.com:80/2009/09/23/nyregion/23empire.html |archivedate=15 May 2010 }}</ref>  In 2000, the building's owners installed a series of paintings by the New York artist [[Kysa Johnson]] in the concourse level.

The building's lobbies and common areas received a $550 million renovation in 2009, which included new air conditioning, waterproofing, and renovating the observation deck; moving the gift shop to the 80th floor.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=Empire State Building |date=September 23, 2009 |title=Empire State ReBuilding Transforms World's Most Famous Office Building |url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/mnr/empirestatebuilding/40200/ |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110220091721/http://www.prnewswire.com/mnr/empirestatebuilding/40200/ |archivedate=20 February 2011 }}</ref>  Of this, $120&nbsp;million was spent in an effort to transform the building into a more [[efficient energy use|energy efficient]] and eco-friendly structure.<ref name="esbnyc1"/> For example, the 6,500 windows were remanufactured onsite into [[superwindows]] which block heat but pass light.

====Broadcast stations====
New York City is the largest media market in the United States. Since the September 11 attacks, nearly all of the city's commercial broadcast stations (both television and FM radio) have transmitted from the top of the Empire State Building, although a few FM stations are located at the nearby [[Condé Nast Building]]. Most New York City [[AM broadcasting|AM stations]] broadcast from sites across the [[Hudson River]] in [[New Jersey]] or from other surrounding areas.

[[File:Empirestatebuilding29122005.JPG|thumb|left|Antennae for broadcast stations are located at the top of the Empire State Building.]]

Broadcasting began at the Empire State Building on December 22, 1931, when [[RCA]] began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the spire. They leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there, and—in 1934—RCA was joined by [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] in a cooperative venture to test his FM system from the building's antenna. When Armstrong and RCA fell out in 1935 and his FM equipment was removed, the 85th floor became the home of RCA's New York television operations, first as experimental station W2XBS channel 1, which eventually became (on July 1, 1941) commercial station WNBT, channel 1 (now [[WNBC-TV]] channel 4). NBC's FM station (WEAF-FM, now WQHT) began transmitting from the antenna in 1940. NBC retained exclusive use of the top of the building until 1950, when the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] ordered the exclusive deal broken, based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the (now) seven New York-area television stations (five licensed to New York City, NY, one licensed to Newark, NJ, and one licensed to Secaucus, NJ) to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted. Construction on a giant tower began. Other television broadcasters then joined RCA at the building, on the 83rd, 82nd, and 81st floors, frequently bringing sister FM stations along for the ride. Multiple transmissions of TV and FM began from the new tower in 1951. In 1965, a separate set of FM antennas was constructed ringing the 103rd floor observation area. When the World Trade Center was being constructed, it caused serious reception problems for the television stations, most of which then moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed. This made it possible to renovate the antenna structure and the transmitter facilities for the benefit of the FM stations remaining there, which were soon joined by other FMs and UHF TVs moving in from elsewhere in the metropolitan area. The destruction of the World Trade Center necessitated a great deal of shuffling of antennas and transmitter rooms to accommodate the stations moving back uptown.

As of 2012, the Empire State Building is home to the following stations:
* [[Television broadcasting]]: [[WCBS-TV|WCBS-2]], [[WNBC-TV|WNBC-4]], [[WNYW|WNYW-5]], [[WABC-TV|WABC-7]], [[WWOR-TV|WWOR-9]] [[Secaucus, New Jersey|Secaucus]], [[WPIX|WPIX-11]], [[WNET|WNET-13]] [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[WNYE-TV|WNYE-25]], [[WPXN-TV|WPXN-31]], [[WXTV-DT|WXTV-41]] [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[WNJU|WNJU-47]] [[Linden, New Jersey|Linden]] and [[WFUT-DT|WFUT-68]] [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]

====Observation decks====
The Empire State Building has one of the most popular outdoor observatories in the world, having been visited by over 110&nbsp;million people. The 86th-floor observation deck offers impressive 360-degree views of the city. There is a second observation deck on the 102nd floor that is open to the public. It was closed in 1999, but reopened in November 2005. It is completely enclosed and much smaller than the first one; it may be closed on high-traffic days. Tourists may pay to visit the observation deck on the 86th floor and an additional amount for the 102nd floor.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=https://www.esbnyc.com/tickets/index.cfm |title=ESB Tickets | publisher = Empire State Building |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}</ref> The lines to enter the observation decks, according to [[Condé Nast Traveler|Concierge.com]], are "as legendary as the building itself:" there are five of them: the sidewalk line, the lobby elevator line, the ticket purchase line, the second elevator line, and the line to get off the elevator and onto the observation deck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concierge.com/ideas/hotspots/tours/500723?page=3 |title=Ten Things Not to Do in New York |publisher=Concierge.com |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}</ref> For an extra fee tourists can skip to the front of the line.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The Empire State Building makes more money from tickets sales for its observation decks than it does from renting office space.<ref name = "DaRo 23Apr2012">{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/construction-property/article3391920.ece |title= No threat from large gorillas |author= David Robertson |date= April 23, 2012 |newspaper= The Times |accessdate= April 21, 2012 |quote= According to details prepared for the proposed initial public offering of Empire State Realty Trust, the skyscraper earned $62.9 million from its observation deck in nine months last year, compared with $62.6 million from the rental of office space. }}</ref>

The skyscraper's observation deck plays host to several cinematic, television, and literary classics including, ''[[An Affair To Remember]]'', ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'', ''[[Love Affair (1994 film)|Love Affair]]'' and ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]''. In the Latin American literary classic, Giannina [[Braschi's Empire of Dreams]] the observation deck is the site of a pastoral revolution; shepherds take over the City of New York.<ref name="Marting 167–182">{{Citation|last=Marting|first1=Diane|title= New/Nueva York in Giannina Braschi's 'Poetic Egg': Fragile Identity, Postmodernism, and Globalization|place=Indiana|publisher=The Global South|pages=167–182|date=2010}}.</ref>  The deck was also the site of a publicity-stunt Martian invasion in an episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' ("Lucy Is Envious", season 3, episode 25).

====New York Skyride====
The Empire State Building also has a [[motion simulator]] attraction located on the 2nd floor. Opened in 1994 as a complement to the observation deck, the New York Sky ride (or NY Sky ride) is a simulated aerial tour over the city. The cinematic presentation lasts approximately 25&nbsp;minutes. As of May 2013, tickets are Adults $57, Children $42, Seniors $49.

Since its opening, the ride has gone through two incarnations. The original version, which ran from 1994 until around 2002, featured [[James Doohan]], ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek's]]'' [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]], as the airplane's pilot, who humorously tried to keep the flight under control during a storm, with the tour taking an unexpected route through the subway, Coney Island, and FAO Schwartz, among other places. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, however, the ride was closed, and an updated version debuted in mid-2002 with actor [[Kevin Bacon]] as the pilot. The new version of the narration attempted to make the attraction more educational, and included some minor post-9/11 patriotic undertones with retrospective footage of the World Trade Center. The new flight also goes haywire, but this segment is much shorter than in the original.

====Lights====
In 1964, floodlights were added to illuminate the top of the building at night.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Empire State to Glow at Night |last=Lelyveld |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Lelyveld |date=February 23, 1964 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B11FE385F137A8EDDAA0A94DA405B848AF1D3 |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}</ref> Since 1976 the spire has been lit in colors chosen to match seasonal and other events, such as [[St. Patrick's Day]], [[Christmas]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] and [[Bastille Day]].

During 2012, the building's [[Metal-halide lamp|metal halide]] lamps and floodlights were replaced with [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] fixtures, increasing the available colors from nine to over 16 million. The computer-controlled system allows the building to be illuminated in ways that were unable to be done previously with plastic gels. For instance, on November 6, 2012, [[CNN]] used the top of the Empire State Building as a scoreboard for the [[2012 United States presidential election]]. When incumbent president [[Barack Obama]] had reached the 270 electoral votes necessary to win re-election, the lights turned blue. Had Republican challenger [[Mitt Romney]] won, the building would have been lit red.<ref>{{cite news |title=Empire State Building lights up to broadcast election results |first=Charlie |last=Wells |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/new-york-state-building-displays-election-results-article-1.1197707 |newspaper=Daily News |location=New York |date=November 6, 2012 |accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref> Also, on November 26, 2012, the building had its first ever synchronized light show, using music from recording artist [[Alicia Keys]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Empire State Building Light Show: LED Display Synchronized To Two Alicia Keys Songs Over Manhattan|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/empire-state-building-light-show-alicia-keys-led-display-new-york-city_n_2198200.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=November 27, 2012|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colorkinetics.com/ESB/ |title=Philips Color Kinetics & Empire State Building Partnership |publisher=Philips Color Kinetics |accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref> Those wishing to hear the music could tune to certain radio stations in the New York area.

===Height records and comparisons===

[[File:Building and ship comparison to the Pentagon2.svg|thumb|250px|Size comparison in relation to [[The Pentagon]]. The Pentagon is {{convert|431|m|ft|sp=us}} for comparison. The Empire State Building is in light gray.]]
The Empire State Building remained the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|tallest man-made structure]] in the world for 23&nbsp;years before it was surpassed by the [[Griffin Television Tower Oklahoma]] (KWTV Mast) in 1954. It was also the [[List of tallest freestanding structures in the world|tallest free-standing structure in the world]] for 36&nbsp;years before it was surpassed by the [[Ostankino Tower]] in 1967.

The longest world record held by the Empire State Building was for the tallest skyscraper (to structural height), which it held for 42&nbsp;years until it was surpassed by the [[One World Trade Center#Original building|North Tower]] of the World Trade Center in 1972. An early-1970s proposal to dismantle the spire and replace it with an additional 11 floors, which would have brought the building's height to 1,494&nbsp;feet (455&nbsp;m) and made it once again the world's tallest at the time, was considered but ultimately rejected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F10FF3E591A7493C3A8178BD95F468785F9|title=11 Floors May Be Added to the Empire State|last=Carmody|first=Deirdre|work=The New York Times|date=October 11, 1972}}</ref>

With the destruction of the World Trade Center in the [[September 11 attacks]], the Empire State Building again became the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|tallest building in New York City]], and the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|second-tallest building in the Americas]], surpassed only by the [[Willis Tower]] in Chicago. It is currently the fifth-tallest, surpassed by the Willis Tower, the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)]], [[432 Park Avenue]] and the [[One World Trade Center#New building|new One World Trade Center]]. One World Trade Center surpassed the roof height of the Empire State Building on April 30, 2012, and became the tallest building in New York City—on the way toward becoming the tallest building in the Americas at a planned 1,776&nbsp;feet (541&nbsp;m).

The Empire State Building is currently the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|fifth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States]], after the [[One World Trade Center]], [[432 Park Avenue]] in New York City, the [[Willis Tower]] and [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]], both in [[list of tallest buildings in Chicago|Chicago]].  It is also the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|25th-tallest in the world]], the tallest now is [[Burj Khalifa]], located in Dubai. It is also the [[List of tallest freestanding structures in the world|fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas]].

On clear days, the building can be seen from much of the [[New York Metropolitan Area]], and as far away as [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Morristown, New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Neighboring Midtown Manhattan landmarks===

The Empire State Building anchors an area of Midtown which features other major Manhattan landmarks as well, including [[Macy's Herald Square]], [[Koreatown, Manhattan|Koreatown]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/realestate/19livi.html?pagewanted=all|title=Living In Koreatown Exotic Flavor, Beyond Just the Food|first=Deborah|last=Baldwin|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 17, 2008|accessdate=September 25, 2011}}</ref> [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], [[Madison Square Garden]], and the Flower District.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=4364|title=The Jungles of West 28th Street – Exploring New York’s Flower District|publisher= Scouting NY |date=August 22, 2011|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> Together, these sites contribute to a significant volume of [[commuter]] and tourist [[pedestrian]] traffic traversing the southern portion of Midtown Manhattan.

* Perhaps the most famous popular culture representation of the building is in the 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', in which the title character, a giant ape, climbs to the top to escape his captors but falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes. In 1983, for the 50th anniversary of the film, a huge {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=on}} tall inflatable King Kong was placed on the building mast above the observation deck by artist Robert Vicino.<ref name=WashPo1>{{cite web|last=De Moraes|first=Lisa|title=Spike TV’s ‘Last Family on Earth’: Coming to a bunker near you|url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-06-05/lifestyle/35459934_1_bunker-families-producers|publisher=Washington Post|date=June 5, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2013|quote=the bunker space is being provided by the doomsday-shelter-building outfit Vivos, which is headed by Del Mar, Calif., developer Robert Vicino. He’s the same guy who, way back in ’83, installed an inflatable 10-story King Kong on the Empire State Building, to celebrate the original "King Kong" flick’s 50th anniversary.}}</ref> In 2005, a remake of ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' was released, set in 1930s New York City, including a final showdown between Kong and biplanes atop a greatly detailed Empire State Building. (The 1976 remake of ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' was set in a contemporary New York City and held its climactic scene on the towers of the World Trade Center.)
* The 1939 romantic drama film ''[[Love Affair (1939 film)|Love Affair]]'' involves a couple who plan to meet atop the Empire State Building, a rendezvous that is prevented by an automobile accident. The film was remade in 1957 (as ''[[An Affair to Remember]]'') and in 1994 (again as ''[[Love Affair (1994 film)|Love Affair]]''). The 1993 film ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'', a romantic comedy partially inspired by ''An Affair to Remember'', climaxes with scenes in the Empire State Building's lobby and observatory.
* In the [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon "Much Ado About Nutting", a squirrel has so much difficulty opening a coconut he carries it to the Empire State Building's observation deck and tosses it over the edge.  While the street is damaged by the impact, the coconut remains intact.
* In the 1946 [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon ''[[Baseball Bugs]]'', [[Bugs Bunny]] is pitching in the [[Polo Grounds]] against the Gashouse Gorillas.  In the bottom of the ninth, with two outs and Bugs protecting a one run lead, the opposition hits the ball out of the park for an apparent game-winning two-run homer.  Bugs pursues the ball through New York City.  The chase culminates at the "Umpire State Building".  Bugs ascends to the top of the building by elevator and catches the ball for the third out, winning the game.
* In the [[Tom and Jerry]] cartoon "[[Mouse in Manhattan]]", Jerry walks by and views the Empire State Building, along with other landmarks, including the [[Statue of Atlas]] at [[Rockefeller Center]] and [[Grand Central Terminal]].
* [[Andy Warhol]]'s 1964 silent film ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' is one continuous, eight-hour black-and-white shot of the Empire State Building at night. In 2004, the [[National Film Registry]] deemed its cultural significance worthy of preservation in the [[Library of Congress]].
* In the film ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief]]'', Mount Olympus is located over the Empire State Building, and there is a special elevator in the building to the "600th floor", which is supposed to be Olympus, just like in the [[Percy Jackson & the Olympians|book series]].
* The building is chosen as Ground Zero for the target of a nuclear bomb that is dropped on New York in the film ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail-Safe]]''.
* Both [[Zero Mostel]] and [[Gene Wilder]] go to the Observation Deck of the building in the original [[Mel Brooks]] film ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]''.
* In the 2002 film ''[[The Time Machine (2002 film)|The Time Machine]]'', the Empire State Building is still standing in the year 2030, but dwarfed by several larger skyscrapers around it. It is not visible in later scenes set in a post-apocalyptic New York.
* In the 2004 film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'', the top of the building serves its original purpose of being a docking station for dirigibles, and the ''Hindenburg III'' docks at it on its maiden voyage.
* The building starred in the 2007 Disney film ''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]'' which Giselle tried to rescue Robert Phillips from Queen Narissa in her dragon form.
* Many films have opened with the Empire State Building, such as ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[Step Up 3D]]'', and ''[[The Other Guys]]''.
* The building has been destroyed in some [[disaster films]], such as ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' and ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]''.
* In the movie ''[[The Divide (film)|The Divide]]'', the building is destroyed by a nuclear bomb detonated on New York. It was heavily featured on posters promoting the film.
* In "[[Superman II]]", [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] ([[Sarah Douglas]]) uses a flagpole to knock [[Superman]] ([[Christopher Reeve]]) into the tower of the [[Chrysler Building]].  He ducks with [[Non (comics)|Non]] ([[Jack O'Halloran]]) taking the blast.  However, scenes showing the tower falling and being flown back to the top by Superman are of the Empire State Building.
* Many other movies that feature the Empire State Building are listed on the building's own website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esbnyc.com/esb_story_movies.asp |title=ESB in the Movies | publisher = Empire State Building |accessdate=October 19, 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/684dPu5pU | archivedate = May 31, 2012| deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Television===
* In the 1965 four-part ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'' cartoon serial "The Phoney Booths" (episodes 49-52), [[List of Underdog characters#Underdog|Underdog]] falls under the mental control of mad scientist [[Simon Bar Sinister]].  Simon orders Underdog to use his super powers to bring him valuable objects - including the Empire State Building, which Underdog lifts whole to bring it to Simon.  In the end, circumstances release Underdog from Simon’s control.  He defeats the evil scientist and puts back the Empire State Building.
* The Empire State Building featured in the 1966 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]'', in which the [[TARDIS]] lands on the roof of the building; [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] and his companions leave quite quickly, however, because [[Dalek|The Daleks]] are close behind them. A Dalek is also seen on the roof of the building while it interrogates a human. In 2007, ''Doctor Who'' episodes "[[Daleks in Manhattan]]" and "[[Evolution of the Daleks]]" also featured the building, which [[Dalek|the Daleks]] are constructing to use as a lightning conductor. [[Russell T Davies]] said in an article that "in his mind", the Daleks remembered the building from their last visit.
* In the science fiction drama series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', the observation deck of the Empire State Building serves its primary purpose as a docking station for zeppelins in the parallel universe shown in the second season episode ''[[Peter (Fringe)#Cultural references|Peter]]''.
* The [[Discovery Channel]] show ''[[MythBusters (2003 season)#Penny Drop|MythBusters]]'' tested the urban myth which claims that if one drops a penny off the top of the Empire State Building, it could kill someone or put a crater in the pavement. The outcome was that, by the time the penny hits the ground, it is going roughly {{convert|65|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} ([[terminal velocity]] for an object of its mass and shape), which is not fast enough to inflict lethal injury or put a crater into the pavement. The urban legend is a joke in the 2003 musical ''[[Avenue Q]]'', where a character waiting atop the building for a rendezvous tosses a penny over the side—only to hit her rival.
* In [[Gerry Anderson]]'s popular puppet series ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]],'' the episode ''[[Terror in New York City]]'', the Empire State Building is being moved to a new location as the site around it is set for redevelopment. However, something goes wrong and the building collapses, trapping a reporter and his cameraman underneath the rubble. Their rescue is the focus of the rest of the episode.
* The music video of the song "Everything is Everything" (by singer [[Lauryn Hill]]) prominently features the Empire State Building as the center of a city (record) turntable.
* In the episode "[[First Time in New York]]" of the television series ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' (originally aired on January 8, 2007), the gang takes Robin's sister Katie to the Empire State Building. On the first day, they only got to the lobby, but they eventually went to the top the next day.

===Literature===
* [[H.G. Wells]]' 1933 science fiction novel ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', written in the form of a [[future history|history book published in the far future]], includes the following passage: "Up to quite recently Lower New York has been the most old-fashioned city in the world, unique in its gloomy antiquity. The last of the ancient skyscrapers, the Empire State Building, is even now under demolition in C.E. 2106!".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0301391h.html |title=The Shape Of Things To Come |publisher=Gutenberg.net.au |accessdate=October 23, 2010| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5qOVGjDSa | archivedate = June 10, 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref>
* [[David Macaulay]]'s 1980 illustrated book ''Unbuilding'' depicts the Empire State Building being purchased by a Middle Eastern billionaire and disassembled piece by piece, to be transported to Saudi Arabia and rebuilt there. The mooring mast is rebuilt in New York, while the remainder of the building is lost at sea.
* Giannina [[Braschi's Empire of Dreams]], a Latin American poetry epic published in 1988, featured a pastoral revolution on the top floor of the Empire State Building, where shepherds danced and sang songs of revolution.<ref name="Marting 167–182"/><ref>{{cite web|title =Modern Language Association Presents Giannina Braschi|quote =’Considered one of the most revolutionary Latin American poets writing today, Giannina Braschi, author of the epic prose poem Empire of Dreams’|url=http://circumferencemag.org/?event=modern-language-association-presents-giannina-braschi|website=Circumference Magazine: Poetry in Translation, Academy of American Poets|date =January 1, 2013}}</ref>  
* The Empire State Building is featured prominently as both a setting and integral plot device throughout much of [[Michael Chabon]]'s 2000 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel, ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay]]''.
* In his "biography", ''[[Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life]]'', [[Philip Jose Farmer]] theorizes that the skyscraper in which [[Doc Savage]] lived and where he met with his comrades, had his laboratories, ''etc.'', was the Empire State Building. Since the 86th Floor (mentioned in the Savage stories as his floor) was the Observatory, one may presume that Doc "actually" lived on another floor.
* In the series, "[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]]", [[Rick Riordan]] shows the Empire State Building as the headquarters of the [[Olympian Gods]], where the Greek Gods live and also hold their meetings.
* In the 1961 children's novel ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' by [[Roald Dahl]], the giant peach is dropped onto the lightning rod of the Empire State Building at the end. This novel was later adapted in a [[James and the Giant Peach (film)|film under the same name]] in 1996, which features the same part where the peach falls on to the Building's antenna. 
* In the sci-fi/alternate history series of novels [[Wild Cards]], the 86th floor is the location of New York's premier chic restaurant, Aces High, a very popular hangout for the superpowered aces.

===Other===
* A {{convert|7.6|ft}} scale model built from 12,000 LEGO bricks over 250 hours is featured along with other notable buildings in the ''LEGO Architecture: Towering Ambition'' exhibition at the [[National Building Museum]] in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/lego-architecture.html |title=National Building Museum.

*The Empire State Building Run-Up is a foot race from ground level to the 86th-floor observation deck that has been held annually since 1978. Its participants are referred to both as runners and as climbers, and are often [[tower running]] enthusiasts. The race covers a vertical distance of 1,050&nbsp;feet (320&nbsp;m) and takes in 1,576 steps. The record time is 9&nbsp;minutes and 33&nbsp;seconds, achieved by Australian professional cyclist [[Paul Crake]] in 2003,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.nyrr.org/races/pro/esbru/07story01.asp|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716112650/http://www.nyrr.org/races/pro/esbru/07story01.asp|archivedate= July 16, 2011 |title=NYRR Empire State Building Run-Up Crowns Dold and Walsham as Champions |work=New York Road Runners |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esbnyc.com/tourism/tourism_specialevents_runup_previous.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102185933/http://esbnyc.com/tourism/tourism_specialevents_runup_previous.cfm|archivedate= January 2, 2010 |title=Past Race Winners | publisher = Empire State Building |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}</ref> at a climbing rate of {{convert|6593|ft|0|abbr=on}} per hour.
