A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced to the people of Athens. They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.theoi.com/Cult/ArtemisCult.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Cult<space/></arg><arg name="author"><space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="work"><space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><bold><link><target>Boar</target></link></bold></listitem></list><paragraph>The boar is one of the favorite animals of the hunters, and also hard to tame.
