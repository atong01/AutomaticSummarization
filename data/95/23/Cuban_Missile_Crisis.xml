Publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a U.S. public declaration and agreement never to invade Cuba without direct provocation.

For this reason, among others, Khrushchev made<space/><link><target>West Berlin</target></link><space/>the central battlefield of the Cold War. Khrushchev believed that if the U.S. did nothing over the missile deployments in Cuba, he could muscle the West out of Berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western counter-measures in Berlin. If the U.S. tried to bargain with the Soviets after becoming aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for West Berlin. Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the trade would be a win for Khrushchev.

The aircraft was shot down and Anderson was killed. The stress in negotiations between the USSR and the U.S. intensified, and only later was it learned that the decision to fire the missile was made locally by an undetermined Soviet commander acting on his own authority. Later that day, at about 3:41&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, several U.S. Navy<space/><link><target>F8U Crusader</target><part>RF-8A Crusader</part></link><space/>aircraft on low-level<space/><link><target>photoreconnaissance</target></link><space/>missions were fired upon.</paragraph><paragraph>At 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, Kennedy recalled members of EXCOMM to the White House and ordered that a message immediately be sent to U Thant asking the Soviets to suspend work on the missiles while negotiations were carried out. During this meeting, General<space/><link><target>Maxwell Taylor</target></link><space/>delivered the news that the U-2 had been shot down. Kennedy had earlier claimed he would order an attack on such sites if fired upon, but he decided to not act unless another attack was made. In an interview 40 years later, McNamara said:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg name="text"><space/>We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational. We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did—we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict. And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack. It was shot down on Friday.&nbsp;... Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought "Well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack." Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation. And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2.<ref name</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Drafting the response</heading><paragraph>Emissaries sent by both Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev agreed to meet at the Yenching Palace Chinese restaurant in the<space/><link><target>Cleveland Park</target></link><space/>neighborhood of Washington D.C. on the evening of October 27.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/13/AR2007011301272.html</arg><arg name="title">At Yenching Palace, Five Decades of History to Go</arg><arg name="last">Frey</arg><arg name="first">Jennifer<space/></arg><arg name="date">January 14, 2007</arg><arg name="work">Washington Post</arg><arg name="accessdate">December 27, 2008</arg></template></extension><space/>Kennedy suggested that they take Khrushchev's offer to trade away the missiles.

Scali said that he did not think anyone would believe him, but he agreed to deliver the message.

During the standoff, US President John F. Kennedy thought the chance of escalation to war was "between 1 in 3 and even," and what we have learned in later decades has done nothing to lengthen those odds. We now know, for example, that in addition to nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union had deployed 100 tactical nuclear weapons to Cuba, and the local Soviet commander there could have launched these weapons without additional codes or commands from Moscow. The US air strike and invasion that were scheduled for the third week of the confrontation would likely have triggered a nuclear response against American ships and troops, and perhaps even Miami.

While in Havana, Mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of Castro, who was convinced that Moscow had made the agreement with the U.S. at the expense of Cuba's defense. Mikoyan, on his own initiative, decided that Castro and his military not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs under any circumstances. He defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22, 1962. During a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan convinced Castro that despite Moscow's desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law (which didn't actually exist) to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. Castro was forced to give way and much to the relief of Khrushchev and the whole Soviet government the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.<extension extension_name='ref' name="MatthewsBBC20121013"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Memories in the media</heading><paragraph>The American popular media, especially television, made heavy use of the events of the missile crisis and both fictional and documentary forms.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Priscilla Roberts</arg><arg name="title">Cuban Missile Crisis: The Essential Reference Guide</arg><arg name="url">https://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="year">2012</arg><arg name="publisher">ABC-CLIO</arg><arg name="page">267</arg></template></extension><space/>Jim Willis includes the Crisis as one of the 100 &quot;media moments that changed America.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Jim Willis</arg><arg name="title">100 Media Moments that Changed America</arg><arg name="year">2010</arg><arg name="publisher">ABC-CLIO</arg><arg name="pages">97–99</arg></template></extension><space/>Sheldon Stern finds that a half century later there are still many &quot;misconceptions, half-truths, and outright lies&quot; that have shaped media versions of what happened in the White House during those harrowing two weeks.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Sheldon Stern</arg><arg name="title">The Cuban Missile Crisis in American Memory: Myths versus Reality</arg><arg name="year">2012</arg><arg name="publisher">Stanford University Press</arg><arg name="page">viii</arg></template></extension><space/>According to William Cohn, television programs are typically the main source used by the American public to know about and interpret the past.<extension extension_name='ref'>William H.
