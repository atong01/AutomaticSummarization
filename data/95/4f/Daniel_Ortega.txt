'''José Daniel Ortega Saavedra''' ({{IPA-es|ðaˈnje̞l o̞rˈte̞ɣa|lang}}; born November 11, 1945) is a [[Nicaragua]]n politician who has been [[President of Nicaragua]] since 2007; previously he was leader of Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990, first as Coordinator of the [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] (1979–1985) and then as President (1985–1990). A leader in the [[socialism|socialist]] [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (''Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional'', ''FSLN''), his policies in government have seen the implementation of leftist reforms across Nicaragua.

Born into a working-class family, from an early age Ortega opposed ruling President [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], widely recognized as a [[dictator]], and became involved in the underground movement against his regime. Joining the Sandinistas, he also travelled to Cuba to receive training in [[guerilla warfare]] from [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] government. After the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] resulted in the overthrow and exile of Somoza's government, Ortega became leader of the ruling multipartisan [[Junta of National Reconstruction]]. A [[Marxist-Leninist]], his first period in office was characterized by a controversial program of nationalization, [[land reform]], [[wealth redistribution]] and [[Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign|literacy programs]].

Ortega's relationship with the United States was never very cordial, due to U.S. support for Somoza prior to the revolution.<ref>{{cite book|last=McClintock|first=Michael|title=The American Connection|year=1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Turning the Tide|year=1985|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts}}</ref> Although the U.S. supplied post-revolution Nicaragua with ten of millions of dollars in economic aid,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/02/world/us-halts-economic-aid-to-nicaragua.html "U.S. halts economic aid to Nicaragua"], ''The New York Times'', 2 April 1981.</ref> relations broke down when the Sandinistas supplied weapons to leftist El Salvadoran rebels (something which Ortega later admitted occurred).<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/world/salvador-rebels-where-do-they-get-the-arms.html "Salvador Rebels: Where Do They Get the Arms"], ''The New York Times'', 24 November 1988,</ref> The [[Reagan administration]] of the United States funded the opposing rebel groups, known as the [[Contras]], resulting in a vicious civil war. There was a UN brokered peace settlement in 1990, after which democratic elections were held. Ortega was defeated by [[Violeta Chamorro]] in the [[Nicaraguan general election, 1990|1990 presidential election]], but he remained an important figure in Nicaraguan opposition politics, gradually moderating in his political position from Marxism–Leninism to [[democratic socialism]]. He was an unsuccessful candidate for president in 1996 and 2001, before winning the [[Nicaraguan general election, 2006|2006 presidential election]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6117704.stm "Ortega wins Nicaraguan election"], BBC News, 8 November 2006.</ref> In office, he made alliances with fellow Latin American socialists, such as Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]], and under his leadership, Nicaragua joined the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]].

==Personal life==

===Early years===
Ortega was born in [[La Libertad, Chontales|La Libertad]], department of [[Chontales Department|Chontales]], [[Nicaragua]]. His parents, Daniel Ortega Cerda and Lidia Saavedra, were opposed  to the regime of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]]. His mother was imprisoned by Somoza's National Guard  for being in possession of "love letters" which the police stated were coded political missives. He has two brothers, [[Humberto Ortega]], former [[General]], military leader and published writer, and Camilo Ortega, who died during combat in 1978.  He also had a sister named Germania who is also deceased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diario.lajornadanet.com/archivo/2005/mayo/05_05_05.html|title=La Jornada – Jueves, 5 de Mayo de 2005|work=lajornadanet.com}}</ref>

When Somoza was overthrown by the FSLN in July 1979, Ortega became a member of the five-person [[Junta of National Reconstruction]], which also included Sandinista militant [[Moisés Hassan]], novelist [[Sergio Ramírez]], businessman [[Alfonso Robelo]], and [[Violeta Barrios de Chamorro]], the widow of a murdered journalist. The FSLN came to dominate the junta, Robelo and Chamorro resigned, and in 1981 Ortega became the coordinator of the Junta.<ref>
{{citation|contribution=Daniel Ortega|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica|year=1993|edition=15th}}
</ref> As the only member of the FSLN National Directorate in the Junta, he was the effective leader of the country. The FSLN embarked upon an ambitious programme of social reform upon attaining power. 5 million acres of land were redistributed to about 100,000 families, a literacy drive was launched, and health improvements were carried out which got rid of polio and reduced other diseases.<ref>Mastering Modern World History by Norman Lowe, second edition</ref> The Sandinista government implemented a policy of forced conscription for all men aged 17 to 35. The Sandinistas used this army to help guerrilla groups throughout [[Central America]]. Ortega pursued a policy of centrally planned economy and nationalization. Ortega took a very hard line against opposition to his policies: On 21 February 1981, the Sandinista army killed 7 Miskito Indians and wounded 17.<ref name=OAS>[http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/Miskitoeng/part1.htm "ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTROVERSY"], Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.

They were joined in the north by Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) and in the south by former Sandinistas and peasantry who under the leadership of [[Edén Pastora]] were resisting forced collectivization.<ref name="OAS"/>

In 1981, United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] accused the FSLN of joining with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed [[Cuba]] in supporting [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary movements in other [[Latin America]]n countries such as [[El Salvador]]. People within the [[Reagan administration]] authorized the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to begin financing, arming and training rebels, some of whom were former officers from Somoza's National Guard, as anti-Sandinista guerrillas. These were known collectively as the [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]]. This also led to one of the largest political scandals in US history, (the [[Iran Contra Affair]]), when [[Oliver North]] and several members of the Reagan administration defied the [[Boland Amendment]], selling arms to [[Iran]] and then using the proceeds to fund the [[Contras]]. Soon the country was in a civil war that claimed 30,000 Nicaraguan lives.<ref>Thomas Walker, ''Nicaragua: Living in the Shadow of the Eagle'', 4th Ed. (Westview Press, 2003)</ref>

The tactics used by the Sandinista government to fight the resistance have been criticized by some historians for their suppression of civil rights. On 15 March 1982, the Junta declared a state of siege, which allowed it to close independent radio stations, suspend the right of association and limit the freedom of trade unions. However, it has also been pointed out that the Human Rights Record of the Contras during the same period was far poorer, with documented cases of murder, rape, torture, used to terrorize the rural population. There is also evidence that the Contras engaged in destruction of schools, hospitals, and other infrastructure, in order to disrupt the social reform programs of the Sandinistas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Turning the Tide|year=1985|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston, MA}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Grandin & Joseph|first=Greg & Gilbert|title=A Century of Revolution|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press}}</ref>

At the [[Nicaraguan general election, 1984|1984 general election]] Ortega won the presidency with 67% of the vote and took office on 10 January 1985.  International observers judged the election to be the first free election held in the country in more than half a century.  A report by an [[Irish government]]ary delegation stated: "The electoral process was carried out with total integrity. The seven parties participating in the elections represented a broad spectrum of political ideologies." The general counsel of New York's [[Human Rights Commission]] described the election as "free, fair and hotly contested." A study by the US [[Latin American Studies Association]] (LASA) concluded that the FSLN (Sandinista Front) "did little more to take advantage of its incumbency than incumbent parties everywhere (including the U.S.) routinely do." However some people described the election as "rigged". According to a detailed study, since the 1984 election was for posts subordinate to the Sandinista Directorate, the elections were no more subject to approval by vote than the Central Committee of the Communist Party is in countries of the East Bloc.<ref>Martin Kriele, “Power and Human Rights in Nicaragua,” German Comments, April 1986, pp56-7,63–7, a chapter excerpted from his Nicaragua: Das blutende Herz Amerikas (Piper, 1986).

33 percent of the Nicaraguan voters cast ballots for one of six opposition parties—three to the right of the Sandinistas, three to the left—which had campaigned with the aid of government funds and free TV and radio time. Two conservative parties captured a combined 23 percent of the vote. They held rallies across the country (a few of which were disrupted by FSLN supporters) and blasted the Sandinistas in harsh terms. Most foreign and independent observers noted this pluralism in debunking the Reagan administration charge—ubiquitous in the [[US media]]—that it was a "Soviet-style sham" election.<ref>[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2479 'The Sandinistas won't submit to free elections'] Article from "Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting".

==Interim years (1990–2006)==
In the 1990 presidential election, Ortega lost to [[Violeta Barrios de Chamorro]], his former colleague in the junta. Chamorro was supported by the US and a 14-party anti-Sandinista alliance known as the [[National Opposition Union]] (Unión Nacional Oppositora, UNO), an alliance that ranged from conservatives and liberals to communists. Contrary to what most observers expected,<ref>Alma Guillermoprieto, The Heart That Bleeds: Latin America Now, pp. 23–25</ref> Chamorro shocked Ortega and won the election. In Ortega's concession speech the following day he vowed to keep "ruling from below" a reference to the power that the FSLN still wielded in various sectors. He also stressed his belief that the Sandinistas had the goal of bringing "dignity" to Latin America, and not necessarily to hold on to government posts.

Ortega ran for election again, in October 1996 and November 2001, but lost on both occasions to [[Arnoldo Alemán]] and [[Enrique Bolaños]], respectively. In these elections, a key issue was the allegation of corruption. In Ortega's last days as president, through a series of legislative acts known as "The [[Piñata]]", estates that had been seized by the Sandinista government (some valued at millions and even billions of US dollars) became the private property of various FSLN officials, including Ortega himself.<ref>{{cite web|author=Shirley Christian |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/08/world/managua-journal-victor-s-lament-to-the-losers-belong-the-spoils.html |title=Managua Journal; Victor's Lament: To the Losers Belong the Spoils – New York Times |location=Nicaragua |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>

Ortega's policies became more moderate during his time in opposition, and he gradually changed much of his former [[Marxist]] stance in favor of an agenda of [[democratic socialism]]. His [[Roman Catholic]] faith has become more public in recent years as well, leading Ortega to embrace a variety of [[socially conservative]] policies; in 2006 the FSLN endorsed a strict law banning all [[abortion]]s in Nicaragua.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/20/world/americas/20nicaragua.html?_r=0</ref>

Ortega was instrumental in creating the controversial strategic pact between the FSLN and the [[Constitutional Liberal Party]] (Partido Liberal Constitucionalista, PLC). The controversial alliance of Nicaragua's two major parties is aimed at distributing power between the PLC and FSLN, and preventing other parties from rising. ''"El Pacto,"'' as it is known in Nicaragua, is said to have personally benefited former presidents Ortega and Alemán greatly, while constraining then-president Bolaños. One of the key accords of the pact was to lower the percentage necessary to win a presidential election in the first round from 45% to 35%, a change in electoral law that would become decisive in Ortega's favor in the 2006 elections{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

===2006 Presidential election===
{{Main|Nicaraguan general election, 2006}}
In 2006, Daniel Ortega was elected president with 38% of the vote. This occurred despite the fact that the breakaway [[Sandinista Renovation Movement]] continued to oppose the FSLN, running former Mayor of Managua  [[Herty Lewites]] as its candidate for president. However, Lewites died several months before the elections.

The FSLN also won 38 seats in the congressional elections, becoming the party with the largest representation in parliament. The split in the Constitutionalist Liberal Party helped to allow the FSLN to become the largest party in Congress, however it should be noted that the Sandinista vote had a minuscule split between the FSLN and MRS, and that the liberal party combined is larger than the Frente Faction. In 2010, several liberal congressmen raised accusations about the FSLN presumably attempting to buy votes in order to pass constitutional reforms that would allow Ortega to run for office for the 6th time since 1984.<ref>News  Paper Article: La Prensa http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/06/15/politica/27852</ref>

With the [[late-2000s recession]], Ortega said that [[capitalism]] is in its "death throes" and the [[Bolivarian Alternative for the People of Our America]] (ALBA) is the most advanced, Christian and fairest project. He also said God was punishing the United States with the [[financial crisis]] for trying to impose its economic principles on poor countries and said God was rewarding Nicaragua with an increase in [[GDP (PPP)]] to $2,600 per-capita from $1,800 a decade ago. "It's incredible that in the most powerful country in the world, which spends billions of dollars on brutal wars ... people do not have enough money to stay in their homes."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUKTRE4997KH20081010 | work=Reuters | title=Nicaragua's Ortega says crisis is God punishing U.S | date=10 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidecostarica.com/dailynews/2008/october/11/reg01.htm|title=Ortega Says Capitalism In Its Death Throes|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref>

During an interview with [[David Frost]] for the [[Al Jazeera English]] programme ''[[Frost Over The World]]'' in March 2009, Ortega suggested that he would like to change the constitution to allow him to run again for president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/frostovertheworld/2009/03/2009378501399631.html|title=Daniel Ortega|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> In Judicial Decision 504, issued on October 19, 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice of Nicaragua declared portions of Articles 147 and 178 of the Constitution of Nicaragua inapplicable; these provisions concerned the eligibility of candidates for President, Vice-President, Mayor, and Vice-Mayor—a decision that had the effect of allowing Ortega to run for reelection in 2011.<ref>[http://content.glin.gov/summary/224071 Global Legal Information Network<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

While supporting [[abortion rights]] during his presidency during the 1980s, Ortega has since embraced the [[Catholic Church]]'s position of strong opposition.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6161396.stm Nicaragua brings in abortion ban: Nicaraguan President [[Enrique Bolaños]] has signed into law a ban on all abortions, even in cases when a woman's life is judged to be at risk] 18 November 2006</ref> While non-emergency abortions have long been illegal in Nicaragua, recently even abortions "in the case where the pregnancy endangers the mother's life", otherwise known as [[therapeutic abortions]] have been made illegal in the days before the election, with a six-year prison term in such cases, too—a move supported by Ortega.<ref>[http://upsidedownworld.org/main/content/view/472/1/ Abortion Outlawed in Nicaragua Ten Days Before Controversial Elections] 27 October 2006</ref>

[[File:Comandante Daniel Ortega celebrando su triunfo Presidencial.jpg|Ortega and his supporters celebrating his victory in the 2011 elections.|thumb]]
Ortega himself denies that the abortion legislation outlaws medical procedures necessary to save the woman's life if they result in the termination of pregnancy. "The medical Procedural Code, he says, is not affected by the law, and requires doctors to do what is necessary to save a woman's life if it is threatened by conditions related to her pregnancy."{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} He claims that the accusations that the abortion laws outlaw medical procedures necessary to save the life of the mother are part of "a media war".<ref>http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/jan/08010804.html{{Dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>

Ortega was re-elected president with a vote on November 6 and confirmation on November 16, 2011.

On 6 March 2008, following the [[2008 Andean diplomatic crisis]], Ortega announced that Nicaragua was breaking diplomatic ties with [[Colombia]] "in solidarity with the [[Ecuador]]an people".<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/03/06/nic.colombia/index.html "Nicaragua breaks diplomatic relations with Colombia"] 6 March 2008 ''[[CNN]]''</ref> Ortega also stated, "We are not breaking relations with the Colombian people.

At the summit Colombia's [[Álvaro Uribe]], Ecuador's [[Rafael Correa]], Venezuela's [[Hugo Chávez]] and Ortega publicly shook hands in a show of good will. The handshakes, broadcast live throughout Latin America, appeared to be a signal that a week of military buildups and diplomatic repercussions was over. After the handshakes, Ortega said he would re-establish diplomatic ties with Colombia. Uribe then quipped that he would send him the bill for his ambassador's plane fare.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://voanews.com/english/2008-03-07-voa73.cfm |title=Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela Agree to End Border Crisis |publisher=[[VOA]] |date=2008-03-07 |accessdate=2008-03-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080309093506/http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-03-07-voa73.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-09}}</ref><ref>

On 25 May 2008, Ortega, upon learning of the death of [[FARC]] guerrilla leader [[Manuel Marulanda]] in Colombia, expressed condolences to the family of Marulanda and solidarity with the FARC and called Marulanda an extraordinary fighter who battled against profound inequalities in Colombia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/519/story/546814.html |title=Colombian rebels' loss of leader ends an era |first=Tyler |last=Bridges |publisher=Miami Herald |date=2008-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://espanol.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/080525/latinoamerica/latinoamerica_farc_marulanda_ortega_sol |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-05-25 |language=spanish |title=Ortega expresa condolencias a FARC por muerte líder}}</ref> The declarations were protested by the [[Colombian government]] and criticized in the major Colombian media outlets.

On 2 September 2008, during ceremonies for the 29th anniversary of the founding of the [[Sandinista Popular Army|Nicaraguan army]], Ortega announced that "Nicaragua recognizes the independence of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]] and fully supports the [[Russian government]]'s position." Ortega's decision made Nicaragua the second country after [[Russia]] to recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20080904/116538071.html|title=Nicaragua recognizes South Ossetia and Abkhazia|work=rian.ru}}</ref> A day after [[Venezuela]] recognised the two Republics, Nicaragua established diplomatic relations with Abkhazia, and followed this by establishing diplomatic links with South Ossetia.

When getting in office, Ortega was threatened to cut ties with the [[Republic of China]]([[Taiwan]]) in order to restore relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] (like 1985–1990). But he did not do so. Ortega met with Taiwan's president [[Ma Ying-jeou]] in 2009 and both agreed to improve the diplomatic ties between both countries.<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/joe-hung/2009/06/09/211402/Ma-Ying-jeou.htm Ma Ying-jeou shouldn't meet Daniel Ortega, China Post, June 9, 2009.]</ref> However, with a trade show from China in Managua in 2010, he is attempting a two-track policy to get benefits from both sides.<ref>{{citation|url=http://solpropertygroup.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/nicaragua-seeks-economic-relations-with-china-the-nica-times-the-nica-times-costa-rica-newspaper-the-tico-times/|title=Nicaragua seeks economic relations with China|author=Tim Rogers|date=14 Jan 2011}}</ref>

In September 2010, after a US report listed Nicaragua as a "major" drug-trafficking centre, with Costa Rica and Honduras, Ortega urged the US Congress and [[Obama administration]] to allocate more resources to assist the fight against drug trafficking.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/09/21/1834482/us-adds-three-nations-to-drug.html U.S. adds three nations to drug-traffic-hub list – Americas – MiamiHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>"transshipment point for cocaine destined for the US and transshipment point for arms-for-drugs dealing" {{citation|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2086.html|title=Field Listing :: Illicit drugs|publisher=CIA|accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref>
