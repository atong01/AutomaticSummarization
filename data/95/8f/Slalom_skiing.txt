'''Slalom''' is an [[alpine skiing]] and [[alpine snowboarding]] discipline, involving skiing between poles or gates. These are spaced more closely than those in [[giant slalom]], [[super-G|super giant slalom]] and [[downhill]], necessitating quicker and shorter turns.  Internationally, the sport is contested at the [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships]], and at the [[Winter Olympic Games]].

The term may also refer to [[Waterskiing#Slalom skiing|waterskiing on one ski]].

== History ==

The word "slalom" is from the [[Morgedal]]/[[Seljord]] dialect of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] slalåm: "sla," meaning slightly inclining hillside, and "låm," meaning track after skis.  The inventors of modern skiing classified their trails according to their difficulty.  ''Slalåm'' was a trail used in [[Telemark]] by boys and girls not yet able to try themselves on the more challenging runs.  ''Ufsilåm'' was a trail with one obstacle (''ufse'') like a jump, a fence, a difficult turn, a gorge, a cliff (often more than {{convert|10|m}} high) and more. ''Uvyrdslåm'' was a trail with several obstacles.<ref>[http://www.stolaf.edu/naha/pubs/nas/volume29/vol29_12.htm NAHA // Norwegian-American Studies<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The rules for the modern slalom were developed by [[Arnold Lunn]] in 1922 for the British National Ski Championships, and adopted for [[alpine skiing at the 1936 Winter Olympics]]. Under these rules gates were marked by pairs of flags rather than single ones, were arranged so that the racers had to use a variety of turn lengths to negotiate them, and scoring was on the basis of time alone, not time and style.

==The course==
A course is constructed by laying out a series of gates, formed by alternating pairs of red and blue poles. The skier must pass between the two poles forming the gate, with the tips of both skis and the skier's feet passing between the poles.  A course has 55 to 75 gates for men and 40 to 60 for women. The vertical drop for a men's course is {{convert|180|to|220|m|0|abbr=on}} and slightly less for women.<ref name=alevcn>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y6VAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rwYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6656%2C9104829 |newspaper=Ocala (FL) Star-Banner |agency=Universal Press Syndicate |last=Slade |first=Daryl |title=Alpine evolution continues |date=February 12, 1988 |page=4E }}</ref> The gates are arranged in a variety of configurations to challenge the competitor.

Because the offsets are relatively small in slalom, ski racers take a fairly direct line and often knock the poles out of the way as they pass, which is known as blocking.  (The main blocking technique in modern slalom is cross-blocking, in which the skier takes such a tight line and angulates so strongly that he or she is able to block the gate with the outside hand.) In modern slalom, a variety of protective equipment is used such as shin pads, hand guards, helmets and face guards.

==Clearing the gates==
Traditionally, bamboo poles were used for gates, the rigidity of which forced skiers to maneuver their entire body around each gate.<ref name=stonslrg>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZYFeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=52ENAAAAIBAJ&pg=5266%2C3522138|newspaper=Observer-Reporter|location=[[Washington, Pennsylvania]] |title=Alpine skiing: Stenmark on slalom |agency=Associated Press |date=February 13, 1994 |page=C7 }}</ref> The early 1980s, rigid poles were replaced by hard plastic poles, hinged at the base with a [[universal joint]] designed and patented by Peter Laehy and Stefan Dag in Aspen, CO. USA.

By 1989 most of the top technical skiers in the world had adopted the cross-block technique.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gurshman|first1=Greg|title=To Cross-Block or Not To Cross-Block?|url=http://www.youcanski.com/en/coaching/slalom.htm|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>

The new gates allow a more direct path down a slalom course through the process of cross-blocking or shinning the gates.<ref name=ghnlisp>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FfY9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=FEkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5992%2C5715078 |newspaper=Glasgow Herald |last=McMillan |first=Ian |title=A new line in slalom poles |date=February 28, 1984|page=24 }}</ref> Cross-blocking is a technique in which the legs go around the gate with the upper body inclined toward, or even across, the gate; in this case the racer's outside pole and shinguards hit the gate, knocking it down and out of the way. Cross-blocking is done by pushing the gate down with the arms, hands, or shins.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Martin|title=A matter of course|url=http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2001/mar/24/wintersportsholidays.wintersports.guardiansaturdaytravelsection1|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>

== Equipment ==
With the innovation of shaped skis around the turn of the 21st century, equipment used for slalom in international competition changed drastically. [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|World Cup]] skiers commonly skied on slalom skis at a length of {{convert|203|-|207|cm|1}} in the 1980s and 1990s but by the [[Alpine skiing at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], the majority of competitors were using skis measuring {{convert|160|cm|1|abbr=on}} or less.

The downside of the shorter skis was that athletes found that recoveries were more difficult with a smaller platform underfoot. Over concern for the safety of athletes, the [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] began to set minimum ski lengths for international slalom competition. The minimum was initially set at {{convert|155|cm|1|abbr=on}} for men and {{convert|150|cm|1|abbr=on}} for women, but was increased to {{convert|165|cm|1|abbr=on}} for men and {{convert|155|cm|1|abbr=on}} for women for the [[2004 Alpine Skiing World Cup|2003-2004 season]].

American [[Bode Miller]] hastened the shift to the shorter, more radical sidecut skis when he achieved unexpected success after becoming the first [[AAU Junior Olympic Games|Junior Olympic]] athlete to adopt the equipment in giant slalom and super G in 1996. A few years later, the technology was adapted to slalom skis as well.
