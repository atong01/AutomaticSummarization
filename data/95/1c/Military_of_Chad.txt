The '''[[Military]] of [[Chad]]''' consists of the Armed Forces (includes [[Chadian ground forces|Ground Forces]], [[Chad Air Force|Air Force]], and Gendarmerie), Republican Guard, Rapid Intervention Force, [[Police]], and [[National and Nomadic Guard]] (GNNT). Currently the main task of the Chadian military is to combat the various rebel forces inside the country.

{{Main|History of the military of Chad}}
From independence through the period of the presidency of Félix Malloum (1975–79), the official national army was known as the [[Chadian Armed Forces]] (Forces Armées Tchadiennes—FAT). Composed mainly of soldiers from southern Chad, FAT had its roots in the army recruited by France and had military traditions dating back to World War I. FAT lost its status as the legal state army when Malloum's civil and military administration disintegrated in 1979. Although it remained a distinct military body for several years, FAT was eventually reduced to the status of a regional army representing the south.

After Habré consolidated his authority and assumed the presidency in 1982, his victorious army, the Armed Forces of the North (Forces Armées du Nord—FAN), became the nucleus of a new national army. The force was officially constituted in January 1983, when the various pro-Habré contingents were merged and renamed FANT.

The Military of Chad was dominated by members of [[Toubou]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], [[Kanembu people|Kanembou]], [[Hadjerai]], and [[Massa (African ethnic group)|Massa]] ethnic groups during the presidency of [[Hissène Habré]]. Current [[Chad]]ian president [[Idriss Déby]], revolted and fled to the [[Sudan]], taking with him many Zaghawa and Hadjerai soldiers in 1989.

Chad's armed forces numbered about 36,000 at the end of the Habré regime, but swelled to an estimated 50,000 in the early days of Déby's rule. With [[France|French]] support, a reorganization of the armed forces was initiated early in 1991 with the goal of reducing its numbers and making its ethnic composition reflective of the country as a whole. Neither of these goals was achieved, and the military is still dominated by the Zaghawa.

In 2004, the government discovered that many of the soldiers it was paying did not exist and that there were only about 19,000 soldiers in the army, as opposed to the 24,000 that had been previously believed. Government crackdowns against the practice are thought to have been a factor in a failed military mutiny in May 2004.

The current conflict, in which the Chadian military is involved, is the civil war against Sudanese-backed rebels. Chad successfully manages to repel the rebel movements, but recently, with some losses (see [[Battle of N'Djamena (2008)]]). The army uses its [[artillery]] systems and tanks, but well-equipped insurgents have probably managed to destroy over 20 of Chad's 60 [[t-55]] tanks, and probably shot down a [[Mi-24 Hind]] [[gunship]], which bombed enemy positions near the border with [[Sudan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnBAN032261.html|title=Reuters - Rebels down a Chadian gunship|publisher=}}</ref> In November 2006 [[Libya]] supplied Chad with four [[Aermacchi SF.260]]W light attack planes.

==Spending==
The CIA World Factbook estimates the military budget of Chad to be 4.2% of GDP as of 2006.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cd.html]. Given the then GDP ($7.095 bln) of the country, military spending was estimated to be about $300 million. This estimate however dropped after the end of the [[Civil war in Chad (2005–2010)]] to 2.0%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS|title=Military expenditure (% of GDP)|publisher=}}</ref> as estimated by the [[World Bank]] for the year 2011. There aren't any more recent estimates available for 2012, 2013.

==External Deployments==
*UN missions
*non UN missions
Chad participated in a peace mission under the authority of African Union in the neighboring [[Central African Republic]] to try to pacify the recent conflict, but has chosen to withdraw after its soldiers were accused of shooting into a marketplace, unprovoked, according to BBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26884196|title=BBC News - CAR crisis: UN says Chad troops fired into market|work=BBC News}}</ref> 
*Brigade Chado-Cameroonian
"Currently, Cameroon has an ongoing military-military relationship with Chad, which includes associates training for Chadian military in Cameroon.
