Composed mainly of soldiers from southern Chad, FAT had its roots in the army recruited by France and had military traditions dating back to World War I. FAT lost its status as the legal state army when Malloum's civil and military administration disintegrated in 1979. Although it remained a distinct military body for several years, FAT was eventually reduced to the status of a regional army representing the south.</paragraph><paragraph>After Habr consolidated his authority and assumed the presidency in 1982, his victorious army, the Armed Forces of the North (Forces Armes du NordFAN), became the nucleus of a new national army. The force was officially constituted in January 1983, when the various pro-Habr contingents were merged and renamed FANT.</paragraph><paragraph>The Military of Chad was dominated by members of<space/><link><target>Toubou</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Zaghawa people</target><part>Zaghawa</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Kanembu people</target><part>Kanembou</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Hadjerai</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Massa (African ethnic group)</target><part>Massa</part></link><space/>ethnic groups during the presidency of<space/><link><target>Hissne Habr</target></link>.

With<space/><link><target>France</target><part>French</part></link><space/>support, a reorganization of the armed forces was initiated early in 1991 with the goal of reducing its numbers and making its ethnic composition reflective of the country as a whole. Neither of these goals was achieved, and the military is still dominated by the Zaghawa.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2004, the government discovered that many of the soldiers it was paying did not exist and that there were only about 19,000 soldiers in the army, as opposed to the 24,000 that had been previously believed. Government crackdowns against the practice are thought to have been a factor in a failed military mutiny in May 2004.</paragraph><paragraph>The current conflict, in which the Chadian military is involved, is the civil war against Sudanese-backed rebels. Chad successfully manages to repel the rebel movements, but recently, with some losses (see<space/><link><target>Battle of N'Djamena (2008)</target></link>). The army uses its<space/><link><target>artillery</target></link><space/>systems and tanks, but well-equipped insurgents have probably managed to destroy over 20 of Chad's 60<space/><link><target>t-55</target></link><space/>tanks, and probably shot down a<space/><link><target>Mi-24 Hind</target></link><space/><link><target>gunship</target></link>, which bombed enemy positions near the border with<space/><link><target>Sudan</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnBAN032261.html</arg><arg name="title">Reuters - Rebels down a Chadian gunship</arg><arg name="publisher"></arg></template></extension><space/>In November 2006<space/><link><target>Libya</target></link><space/>supplied Chad with four<space/><link><target>Aermacchi SF.260</target><trail>W</trail></link><space/>light attack planes.
