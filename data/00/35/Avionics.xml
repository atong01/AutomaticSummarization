Navigation systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays.

A &quot;glass&quot; cockpit refers to the use of computer monitors instead of gauges and other analog displays. Aircraft were getting progressively more displays, dials and information dashboards that eventually competed for space and pilot attention. In the 1970s, the average aircraft had more than 100 cockpit instruments and controls.<extension extension_name='ref' name="three"><italics>Avionics: Development and Implementation</italics><space/>by Cary R.

In<space/><link><target>helicopter</target><trail>s</trail></link>, auto-stabilization was used in a similar way. The first systems were electromechanical. The advent of<space/><link><target>fly by wire</target></link><space/>and electro-actuated flight surfaces (rather than the traditional hydraulic) has increased safety. As with displays and instruments, critical devices that were electro-mechanical had a finite life. With safety critical systems, the software is very strictly tested.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Collision-avoidance systems</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Aircraft collision avoidance systems</arg></template>To supplement<space/><link><target>air traffic control</target></link>, most large transport aircraft and many smaller ones use a<space/><link><target>TCAS</target><part>traffic alert and collision avoidance system</part></link><space/>(TCAS), which can detect the location of nearby aircraft, and provide instructions for avoiding a midair collision. Smaller aircraft may use simpler traffic alerting systems such as TPAS, which are passive (they do not actively interrogate the<space/><link><target>transponder</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>of other aircraft) and do not provide advisories for conflict resolution.</paragraph><paragraph>To help avoid controlled flight into terrain (<link><target>CFIT</target></link>), aircraft use systems such as<space/><link><target>GPWS</target><part>ground-proximity warning systems</part></link><space/>(GPWS), which use radar altimeters as a key element. One of the major weaknesses of GPWS is the lack of &quot;look-ahead&quot; information, because it only provides altitude above terrain &quot;look-down&quot;. In order to overcome this weakness, modern aircraft use a terrain awareness warning system (<link><target>TAWS</target></link>).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Black Boxes</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Flight recorder</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Commercial aircraft cockpit data recorders, commonly known as a &quot;black box&quot;, store flight information and audio from the<space/><link><target>cockpit</target></link>.

Heavy precipitation (as sensed by radar) or severe<space/><link><target>Clear-air turbulence</target><part>turbulence</part></link><space/>(as sensed by lightning activity) are both indications of strong convective activity and severe turbulence, and weather systems allow pilots to deviate around these areas.</paragraph><paragraph>Lightning detectors like the Stormscope or Strikefinder have become inexpensive enough that they are practical for light aircraft. In addition to radar and lightning detection, observations and extended radar pictures (such as<space/><link><target>NEXRAD</target></link>) are now available through satellite data connections, allowing pilots to see weather conditions far beyond the range of their own in-flight systems.
