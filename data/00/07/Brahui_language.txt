'''Brahui'''<ref name="University of Balochistan"/> {{IPAc-en|b|r|ə|ˈ|h|uː|i}}<ref>{{OED|Brahui}}</ref> (Brahui: براہوئی) is a [[Dravidian language]] spoken by the [[Brahui people]] in the central [[Balochistan]] region of [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and by expatriate Brahui communities in [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Iraq]], and [[Iran]].<ref>[https://books.google.nl/books?id=bCkaAQAAIAAJ&q=brahui+language+gulf+states&dq=brahui+language+gulf+states&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=PbCVVZSpJoO9ygPxw4SwCg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA "International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics, Volumes 36-37"] department of linguistics, University of Kerala</ref> It is isolated from the nearest Dravidian-speaking neighbour population of [[South India]] by a distance of more than {{convert|1500|km}}.<ref name="Parkin37">{{harvnb|Parkin|1989|p=37}}</ref> [[Kalat District|Kalat]], [[Mastung District|Mastung]], and [[Khuzdar District|Khuzdar]] districts of Balochistan are predominantly Brahui-speaking.

==Distribution==
Brahui is spoken in the central part of Pakistani Balochistan, mainly in [[Kalat District|Kalat]], [[Mastung District|Mastung]], and [[Khuzdar District|Khuzdar]] districts but also in smaller numbers in neighboring districts, as well as in [[Afghanistan]] which borders Pakistani Balochistan; however, many members of the ethnic group [[language attrition|no longer speak]] Brahui.<ref name="Parkin37"/> The 2013 edition of [[Ethnologue]] reports that there are some 4 million speakers. Nearly all live in Pakistan, mainly in the province of Balochistan.<ref name="e18"/> There are also an unknown very small number of expatriate Brahuis in the Arab States of the [[Persian Gulf]], Iranian Balochistan, and Turkmenistan.<ref>[https://books.google.nl/books?id=bCkaAQAAIAAJ&q=brahui+language+gulf+states&dq=brahui+language+gulf+states&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=PbCVVZSpJoO9ygPxw4SwCg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA "International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics, Volumes 36-37"] department of linguistics, University of Kerala</ref>

==Classification==
Brahui belongs, with [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]] (Oraon) and [[Malto language|Malto]], to the northern subfamily of the Dravidian family of languages. It has been influenced by the [[Iranian languages]] spoken in the area, especially [[Balochi language|Balochi]].<ref>{{harvnb|Emeneau|1962}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

==Dialects==
There are no important dialectical differences. Jhalawani (southern, centered on [[Khuzdar]]) and Sarawani (northern, centered on [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]]) dialects are distinguished by the pronunciation of *h, which is only retained in the north. (Elfenbein 1997)

==Phonology==
The vowels are the same as Balochi:  long ''a e i o u'', short ''a i u'', diphthongs ''aj, aw''.  Stress has also been borrowed from Balochi, and occurs on the first long vowel or diphthong, or on the first syllable if all vowels are short.

Consonants are also very similar to those of Balochi, but Brahui has more fricatives and nasals (Elfenbein 1993).

==Orthography==
Brahui is the only [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] which has not been written in a [[Brahmic family of scripts|Brahmi]]-based script; instead, it is written in the [[Arabic script]] since the second half of the 20th century.<ref>http://www.worklib.ru/dic/%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B3%D1%83%D0%B8/ "Бесписьменный язык Б."</ref> More recently, a Roman-based orthography named [[Brolikva]] (an abbreviation of ''Brahui Roman Likvar'') was developed by the Brahui Language Board of the [[University of Balochistan]] in Quetta, and adopted by the newspaper [[Talár]].

The letters with diacritics are the long vowels, post-alveolar and retroflex consonants, the voiced velar fricative and the voiceless lateral fricative.

==Endangerment==
{{See also|List of endangered languages in Asia}}
According to a 2009 [[UNESCO]] report, Brahui is one of the 27 [[languages of Pakistan]] that are facing the [[endangered language|danger]] of [[extinct language|extinction]]. They classify it in "unsafe" status, the least endangered level out of the five levels of concern (Unsafe, Definitely Endangered, Severely Endangered, Critically Endangered, and Extinct).<ref>{{harvnb|Moseley|2009}}</ref>

===Publications===
[[Talár]] is the first daily newspaper in the Brahui language.  It uses the new Roman orthography, and is "an attempt to standardize and develop [the] Brahui language to meet the requirements of modern political, social and scientific discourse."<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.talarpub.tk/|publisher=Talár Publications|title=Haftaí Talár|accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref>

==History==
There is no consensus as to whether Brahui is a relatively recent language introduced into Balochistan or remnant of an older widespread Dravidian language family. Some scholars see it as a recent migrant language to its present region. They postulate, that Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from [[central India]] after 1000 CE. The absence of any older Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a [[Northwestern Iranian language]], and moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE.<ref>{{harvnb|Witzel|1998|p=1}}, which cites {{harvnb|Elfenbein|1987}}</ref> One scholar places the migration аs late as the 13th or 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Sergent|1997|pp=129–130}}</ref>
