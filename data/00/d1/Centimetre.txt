A '''centimetre''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|international spelling]] as used by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]; symbol '''cm''') or '''centimeter''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|American spelling]]) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[length]] in the [[metric system]], equal to one hundredth of a [[metre]], ''centi'' being the [[SI prefix]] for a factor of {{frac|100}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html |title=Decimal multiples and submultiples of SI units |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |year=2014 |accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref> The centimetre was the base unit of length in the now deprecated [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|centimetre–gram–second]] (CGS) system of units.

Though for many physical quantities, [[SI prefix]]es for factors of 10<sup>3</sup>—like ''milli-'' and ''kilo-''—are often preferred by technicians, the centimetre remains a practical unit of length for many everyday measurements. A centimetre is approximately the width of the fingernail of an average adult person.

One cubic centimetre is equal to 1 [[litre|millilitre]], under the current [[SI]] system of units.

==Other uses==
In addition to its use in the measurement of [[length]], the centimetre is used:
* sometimes, to report the level of rainfall as measured by a [[rain gauge]] <ref>[http://www.weathershack.com/education/rain-measurement.html Rain Measurement, Rain Gauge, Wireless Rain Gauge, Rain Gage, Rain Gauge Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* in the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS system]], the centimetre is used to measure [[capacitance]], where 1&nbsp;cm of capacitance = {{val|1.113|e=-12}} [[farad]]s<ref>[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Capacitance.html Capacitance - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* in  maps, centimetres are used to make conversions from map scale to real world scale (kilometres)
* to represent second moment of areas (cm<sup>4</sup>)
* as the inverse of the kayser, a CGS unit, and thus a non-SI metric unit of [[wavenumber]]:  1 kayser = 1 wave per centimetre; or, more generally, (wavenumber in kaysers) = 1/([[wavelength]] in centimetres). The SI unit of wavenumber is the inverse metre, m<sup>−1</sup>.

==Unicode symbols==
For the purposes of compatibility with [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korea]]n ([[CJK]]) characters, [[Unicode]] has symbols for:<ref>[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3300.pdf] CJK Compatibility excerpt from The Unicode Standard, Version 4.1.</ref>
* centimetre (㎝) – code 339D
* square centimetre (㎠) – code 33A0
* cubic centimetre (㎤) – code 33A4

They are mostly used only with East Asian fixed-width [[CJK]] fonts, because they are equal in size to one Chinese character.
