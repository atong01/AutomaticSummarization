It is {{convert|34|km|mi}} in length and up to {{convert|23|km|mi}} in width, covering an area of {{convert|432|km2}}. It is situated in the western area of the North Atlantic and 100 kilometres (62&nbsp;mi) east of the [[Windward Islands]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]];<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cx0103) Chapter 4 – The Windward Islands and Barbados] – U.S. Library of Congress</ref> therein, it is about {{convert|168|km|mi}} east of the islands of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] and {{convert|400|km|mi}} north-east of [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Barbados is outside of the principal Atlantic [[hurricane belt]].

Inhabited by [[Island Caribs|Kalingo]] people since the 13th century, and prior to that by other [[Amerindian]]s, Barbados was visited by Spanish navigators in the late 15th century and claimed for the [[Spanish Crown]].

In 1966, Barbados became an independent state and [[Commonwealth realm]] with the British Monarch (presently Queen [[Elizabeth II]]) as hereditary [[head of state]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/TheQueenandBarbados/Historyandpresentgovernment.aspx |title=History and present government – Barbados |author=HRM Queen Elizabeth II |year=2010 |publisher=[[Monarchy of Barbados|The Royal Household]] |accessdate=10 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420043349/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/TheQueenandBarbados/Historyandpresentgovernment.aspx| archivedate= 20 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> It has a population of 277,821 people, mostly of African descent.<ref name="geo" /> Despite being classified as an Atlantic island, Barbados is considered to be a part of the Caribbean, where it is ranked as a leading tourist destination. In 2014, Barbados ranked second in [[the Americas]] (after [[Canada]]) and 17th globally (after [[Belgium]] and [[Japan]]) on [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perception Index]].<ref>[http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results]. Transparency International.</ref>

== Etymology ==<!--linked-->
The origin of the name Barbados is either the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''Barbados'' or the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] equivalent ''los Barbados'', both meaning "the bearded ones" It is unclear whether "bearded" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree (''[[Ficus citrifolia]]''), indigenous to the island; or to the allegedly bearded [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] once inhabiting the island; or, more fancifully, to a visual impression of a beard formed by the sea foam that sprays over the outlying reefs. In 1519, a map produced by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] mapmaker [[Visconte Maggiolo]] showed and named Barbados in its correct position. Furthermore, the island of [[Barbuda]] in the [[Leeward Islands|Leewards]] is very similar in name and was once named Las Barbudas by the Spanish.

It is uncertain which European nation arrived first in Barbados. According to some sources it was the Spanish during the early [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Others believe the [[History of Portugal (1415-1542)|Portuguese]], en route to [[Brazil]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbados.org/history1.htm |title=AXSES Systems Caribbean Inc., The Barbados Tourism Encyclopaedia |publisher=Barbados.org |date=8 February 2007 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/52655/Barbados/54603/History |title=''Britannica Encyclopaedia'': History of Barbados |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> were the first Europeans to come upon the island.

The original name for Barbados in the Pre-Columbian era was ''Ichirouganaim'' according to accounts by descendants of the indigenous [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]-speaking tribes in other regional areas, with possible translations including "Red land with white teeth",<ref>{{Cite book |title=Barbados the Red Land with White Teeth: Home of the Amerindians|url=http://www.barbmuse.org.bb/ |accessdate=14 May 2010 |publisher=Barbados Museum & Historical Society| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505161730/http://www.barbmuse.org.bb/| archivedate= 5 May 2010 | deadurl= no |quote=A temporary exhibit which examined some of the preliminary excavations conducted at the dig site at Heywoods, St. Peter.}}</ref> "Redstone island with teeth outside (reefs)",<ref>{{Cite book |title=Barbados – Geography / History |url=http://www.coucouandflyingfish.com/where.php |accessdate=14 May 2010 |year=2008 |publisher=Fun 'N' Sun Publishing Inc.}}</ref> or simply "Teeth".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/News/pdf/guyana_consul_visit.pdf |title=Guyana Consul (Barbados) Visit to Former Amerindian Village Site in B'dos |first=Norman |last=Faria |date=17 June 2009 |work=Guyana Chronicle |publisher=Pan-Tribal Confederacy of Indigenous Tribal Nations |page=2 |accessdate=14 May 2010 |quote=Adjacent to the park, there is still a fresh water stream. This as a main reason the village was here. A hundred or so metres away is the sea and a further five hundred metres out across a lagoon was the outlying reef where the Atlantic swells broke on the coral in shallow waters. As an aside, the word "Ichirouganaim", said to be an Arawak word used by the Amerindians to describe Barbados, is thought to refer to the imagery of "teeth" imagery of the waves breaking on the reefs off most of southern and eastern coasts. }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Drewett |first1=Peter|title=Prehistoric Barbados|publisher=Barbados Museum and Historical Society |year=1991|isbn=1-873132-15-8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Drewett |first1= Peter|title=Prehistoric Settlements in the Caribbean: Fieldwork on Barbados, Tortola and the Cayman Islands |accessdate=14 May 2010 |date= 2000 |publisher=Archetype Publications Ltd. |isbn=1-873132-22-0}}</ref>

Other names or nicknames associated with Barbados include "Bim" and "Bimshire". The origin is uncertain but several theories exist. The [[National Cultural Foundation]] of Barbados says that "Bim" was a word commonly used by [[slave]]s and that it derives from the [[Igbo language|Igbo]] term ''bém'' from ''bé mụ́'' meaning 'my home, kindred, kind',<ref name="Carrington, Sean 2007 25">{{Cite book |author=Carrington, Sean |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean Publishers Limited|page=25 |isbn=0-333-92068-6}}</ref> the Igbo phoneme /e/ in the Igbo orthography is very close to [ ɪ ].<ref name=christmas>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage |first=Richard |last=Allsopp |author2=Jeannette Allsopp |page=101 |publisher=University of the West Indies Press |year=2003 |isbn= 9766401454}}</ref> The name could have arisen due to the relatively large percentage of enslaved [[Igbo people]] from modern-day southeastern [[Nigeria]] arriving in Barbados in the 18th century.<ref name=christmas>{{cite book|title=Routes to Slavery: Direction, Ethnicity, and Mortality in the Transatlantic Slave Trade |first=David |last=Eltis |author2=David Richardson |page=87 |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |accessdate=2008-11-24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuXEzQZQmawC&pg=PA87&dq | isbn=978-0-7146-4820-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Black Experience and the Empire |first=Philip D. |last=Morgan |author2=Sean Hawkins |isbn=0-19-926029-X |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |page=416 |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kG824iVy1BsC&pg=PA82}}</ref>

The words 'Bim' and 'Bimshire' are recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and ''[[Chambers Dictionary|Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionaries]]''. Another possible source for 'Bim' is reported to be in the ''Agricultural Reporter'' of 25 April 1868, where the Rev. N. Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, [[Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge]]) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were "Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire and Bimshire".<ref name="Carrington, Sean 2007 25" /> Lastly, in the ''Daily Argosy'' (of Demerara, i.e. Guyana) of 1652 there is a reference to Bim as a possible corruption of 'Byam', the name of a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as 'Bims' and that this became a word for all Barbadians.<ref name="Carrington, Sean 2007 25" />

The Spanish and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] briefly claimed Barbados from the late 16th to the 17th centuries. The Arawaks are believed to have fled to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Spanish and Portuguese made little impact and left the island uninhabited. Some Arawaks migrated from [[British Guiana]] (modern-day Guyana) in the 19th century and continue to live in Barbados.<ref name="UCTP"/><ref>[http://www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/history.php "Origin of the Eagle Clan"], Pan-Tribal Confederacy of Indigenous Tribal Nations.</ref><ref>[http://www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/pdf/marion_desc.pdf Descendants of Princess Marian]. (PDF). Retrieved 19 February 2012.</ref>

From the arrival of the first English settlers in 1627–1628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted English and later British governance and was the only Caribbean island that did not change hands during the colonial period. In the very early years, the majority of the population was [[white people|white]] and male, with African slaves providing little of the workforce. Cultivation of tobacco, cotton, [[ginger]] and [[indigo]] was handled primarily by European indentured labour until the start of the [[sugar cane]] industry in the 1640s. As Barbados' economy grew, Barbados developed a large measure of local autonomy through its founding as a [[proprietary colony]]. Its [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] began meeting in 1639. Among the island's earliest leading figures was the Anglo-Dutch [[William Courten|Sir William Courten]].

The [[Great Hurricane of 1780|1780 hurricane]] killed over 4,000 people on Barbados. In 1854, a [[cholera]] epidemic killed over 20,000 inhabitants.<ref>"[http://countrystudies.us/caribbean-islands/83.htm Barbados]". [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].</ref> At emancipation in 1833, the size of the slave population was approximately 83,000.

== Geography and climate ==
{{Main|Geography of Barbados}}
[[File:Barbados.png|right|thumb|350px|A map of Barbados]]

Barbados is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, east of the other [[West Indies]] Islands. Barbados is the easternmost island in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It is flat in comparison to its island neighbours to the west, the [[Windward Islands]]. The island rises gently to the central highland region, with the high point of the nation being [[Mount Hillaby]] in the geological Scotland District {{convert|340|m|ft}} above sea level.

In the parish of [[Saint Michael, Barbados|Saint Michael]] lies Barbados' capital and main city, [[Bridgetown]]. Other major towns scattered across the island include [[Holetown]], in the parish of [[Saint James, Barbados|Saint James]]; [[Oistins]], in the parish of [[Christ Church, Barbados|Christ Church]]; and [[Speightstown]], in the parish of [[Saint Peter, Barbados|Saint Peter]].

=== Geology ===
Barbados lies on the boundary of the [[South American plate|South American]] and the [[Caribbean Plate]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Geologic History of Barbados Beaches |first=Gabi |last=Logan|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/geologic-history-barbados-beaches-57660.html |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher= |accessdate=2 July 2011|quote=Barbados lies directly over the intersection of the Caribbean plate and the South American plate in a region known as a subduction zone. Beneath the ocean floor, the South American plate slowly slides below the Caribbean plate. }}</ref> The [[subduction]] of the South American plate beneath the Caribbean plate scrapes sediment from the South American plate and deposits it above the subduction zone forming an [[Accretionary wedge|accretionary prism]]. The rate of this depositing of material allows Barbados to rise at a rate of about {{convert|25|mm|in}} per 1,000 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barbadosbeachhouse.com/barbados_sightseeing_animal_flower_cave.php |title=Barbados Sightseeing – Animal Flower Cave |year=2010 |work=Leigh Designs |publisher=Little Bay House|accessdate=10 July 2011 |quote=The Animal flower Cave is the island's lone accessible sea-cave and was discovered from the sea in 1780 by two English explorers. The cave's coral floor is estimated to be 400,000 to 500,000 years old and the "younger" coral section above the floor is about 126,000 years old. The dating was carried out by the German Geographical Institute, and visitors can see a "map" of the dating work in the bar and restaurant. The cave now stands some six feet above the high tide mark even though it was formed at sea level. This is because Barbados is rising about one inch per 1,000 years, which is yet another indication of the cave's age. }}</ref> This subduction means [[Geology|geologically]] the island is composed of [[coral]] roughly ({{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} thick), where reefs formed above the sediment. The land slopes in a series of "terraces" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. A large proportion of the island is circled by [[coral reefs]].

The erosion of limestone rock in the North East of the island, in the Scotland District, has resulted in the formation of various caves and [[Gully|gullies]], some of which have become popular tourist attractions such as [[Harrison's Cave]] and Welchman Hall Gully. On the [[Atlantic]] East coast of the island [[coastal landforms]], including stacks, have been created due to the limestone composition of the area.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Bathsheba, Barbados 08.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Bathsheba, Saint Joseph, Barbados|Bathsheba]] on the east coast of the island.]]
The country generally experiences two seasons, one of which includes noticeably higher rainfall. Known as the "[[wet season]]", this period runs from June to November. By contrast, the "[[dry season]]" runs from December to May. Annual precipitation ranges between {{convert|40|and|90|in|mm}}.
From December to May the average temperatures range from {{convert|21|to|31|C|F}}, while between June and November, they range from {{convert|23|to|31|C|F}}.<ref name="weather1">{{cite web | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003280 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070220165443/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003280 | archivedate =20 February 2007 | title =Average and Record Conditions at Bridgetown, Barbados| accessdate =10 September 2009 | publisher =BBC Weather}}</ref>

On the [[Köppen climate classification]] scale, much of Barbados is regarded as a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (Am). However, gentle breezes of 12–16 kilometres per hour (8–10&nbsp;mph) abound throughout the year and give Barbados a civilised [[climate]] which is moderately tropical.

Infrequent natural hazards include earthquakes, [[landslip]]s and [[hurricanes]]. Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's [[tropical storm]]s and [[hurricanes]] during the rainy season. Its location in the south-east of the Caribbean region puts the country just outside the principal [[hurricane strike zone]]. On average, a major hurricane strikes about once every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was [[Hurricane Janet]] in 1955; in 2010 the island was struck by [[Hurricane Tomas]], but this caused only minor damage across the country.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11660080 "Hurricane Tomas lashes Caribbean islands"]. BBC News, 30 October 2010.</ref>

=== Environmental issues ===

== Government and politics ==
[[File:Bridgetown barbados parliament building.jpg|thumb|300px|The parliament building in Bridgetown.]]
{{Main|Government of Barbados|Politics of Barbados}}
Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]] modelled on the British [[Westminster system]]. The [[Monarchy of Barbados|British and Barbadian monarch]] — Queen [[Elizabeth II]] — is [[head of state]] and is represented locally by the [[Governor-General of Barbados]] — presently [[Elliott Belgrave]]. Both are advised on matters of the Barbadian state by the [[Prime Minister of Barbados]], who is [[head of government]]. There are 30 representatives within the [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]].

The [[Constitution of Barbados]] is the supreme law of the nation.<ref>[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Barbados/barbados66.html The official Constitution of Barbados] (1966) version.</ref> The Attorney General heads [[Judiciary of Barbados|the independent judiciary]]. New Acts are passed by the Barbadian Parliament and require [[royal assent]] by the governor-general to become law.

During the 1990s at the suggestion of [[Trinidad and Tobago]]'s [[Patrick Manning]], Barbados attempted a [[political union]] with Trinidad and Tobago and [[Guyana]]. The project stalled after the then prime minister of Barbados, [[Lloyd Erskine Sandiford]], became ill and his [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] lost the next general election.<ref>{{Wayback |date=20090624141705 |url=http://jamaicaobserver.com/columns/html/20030720T080000-0500_46578_OBS_CHASING_AFTER_AN_ELUSIVE_UNION.asp |title=Chasing after an elusive union }}.

NationNews.com. 14 July 2003</ref> Barbados continues to share close ties with Trinidad and Tobago and with Guyana, claiming the highest number of Guyanese immigrants after the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

=== Political culture ===
[[File:Freundel Stuart and clinton.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Freundel Stuart]] is the Prime Minister of Barbados.]]

Barbados functions as a [[two-party system]]. The dominant political parties are the [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] and the opposition [[Barbados Labour Party]]. Since Independence the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) has governed from 1976 to 1986 and from September 1994 to 2008. The Democratic Labour Party (DLP) held office 1966 to 1976, from 1986 to 1994, and has formed the government from January 2008 to present.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Barbados}}
Barbados is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME), and the [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS).<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060228195122/http://www.barbadosbusiness.gov.bb/miib/Barbados/regional_links.cfm BarbadosBusiness.gov.bb], The Barbados government's Regional and International affiliations</ref> [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados, [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]]. In 2001 the Caribbean Community heads of government voted on a measure declaring that the region should work towards replacing the UK's [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] with the Caribbean Court of Justice.

Barbados is an original member (1995) of the [[World Trade Organisation]] (WTO) and participates actively in its work. It grants at least MFN treatment to all its trading partners. As of December 2007, Barbados is linked by an [[Economic Partnership Agreement]] with the [[European Commission]]. The pact involves the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) subgroup of the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States]] (ACP). CARIFORUM is the only part of the wider ACP-bloc that has concluded the full regional trade-pact with the [[European Union]].

Trade policy has also sought to protect a small number of domestic activities, mostly food production, from foreign competition, while recognising that most domestic needs are best met by imports.

In 2013, CARICOM called for European nations to pay [[reparations for slavery]] and established an official reparations commission.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21587236-pressure-grows-compensation-caribbean-trade-blood-money |title=Slavery reparations: Blood money |work=[[The Economist]] |date=5 October 2013}}</ref>

=== Military ===
The [[Barbados Defence Force]] has roughly 600 members. Within it, 12- to 18-year-olds make up the Barbados Cadet Corps. The defence preparations of the island nation are closely tied to defence treaties with the United Kingdom, the United States, and the People's Republic of China.<ref>{{cite news|title=Barbados turns to China for military assistance |author=Staff writer |url=http://www.caribbean360.com/index.php/news/10902.html#axzz1sAeflTOu |publisher=Caribbean360.com |date=7 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130917012432/http://www.caribbean360.com:80/index.php/news/10902.html |archivedate=17 September 2013 }}</ref>

The [[Royal Barbados Police Force]] is the sole law enforcement agency on the island of Barbados.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on [[sugarcane]] cultivation and related activities, but since the late 1970s and early 1980s it has diversified into the manufacturing and tourism sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. Since the 1990s the Barbados Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The island saw a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes. This slowed during the 2008 economic crisis.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18723928|title=BBC News – Barbados profile – Overview |accessdate=6 April 2014 |date=22 December 2013|work=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>

Recent government administrations have continued efforts to reduce unemployment, encourage [[foreign direct investment]], and privatise remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment was reduced to 10.7% in 2003.<ref name="cia"/>

The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]], but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004.<ref name="cia"/> Traditional trading partners include Canada, the [[Caribbean Community]] (especially [[Trinidad and Tobago]]), the United Kingdom and the United States.

Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada [[Canadian dollar|CA$]] 25&nbsp;billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian foreign direct investment (FDI). Businessman [[Eugene Melnyk]] of Toronto, Canada, is said to be one of Barbados' richest permanent residents.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/melnyk-one-of-the-wealthiest/|title=Melnyk – one of the wealthiest |accessdate=6 April 2014 |date=29 October 2011|work=NationNews.com}}</ref>

[[File:Barbados bus stop.jpg|thumb|300px|A bus stop in Barbados.]]

Barbados has a population of about 281,968 and a population growth rate of 0.33% (Mid-2005 estimates).

=== Ethnic groups ===
Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as "Bajan") are of [[Afro-Caribbean]] descent ("[[Afro-Barbadian|Afro-Bajans]]") and mixed-descent. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans ("Anglo-Bajans" / "Euro-Bajans") mainly from the United Kingdom and Ireland, along with Asians, mostly Chinese and Indians (both Hindu and Muslim).
Other groups in Barbados include people from the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. Barbadians who return after years of residence in the United States and children born in America to Bajan parents are called "Bajan Yankees", a term considered derogatory by some.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Byfield, Judith Ann-Marie; Denzer, LaRay and Morrison, Anthea |title=Gendering the African diaspora: women, culture, and historical change in the Caribbean and Nigerian hinterland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6_aWWN5aoUC&pg=PA39|year=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-22153-7|pages=39–}}</ref> Generally, Bajans recognise and accept all "children of the island" as Bajans, and refer to each other as such.

The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:

# The [[Indo-Guyanese]], an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country [[Guyana]]. There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and [[India]].  Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, they are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana.
# Euro-Bajans (4% of the population)<ref name="cia">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bb.html Barbados] CIA World Factbook</ref> have settled in Barbados since the 17th century, originating from England, Ireland and [[Scotland]]. In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population).<ref>Karl Watson, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/barbados_01.shtml "Slavery and Economy in Barbados"], BBC. Last updated 17 February 2011.</ref> More commonly they are known as "[[White Barbadian|White Bajans]]". Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as [[Irish music]] and Highland music, and certain place names, such as "Scotland", a mountainous region. Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as [[Redlegs]]; the descendants of [[Irish people|Irish]] indentured labourers and prisoners imported to the island.<ref>Nini Rodgers, [http://www.irlandeses.org/0711rodgers2.htm "The Irish in the Caribbean 1641–1837: An Overview"], Society for Irish Latin American Studies</ref> Many additionally moved on to become the earliest settlers of modern-day [[Province of Carolina|North]] and [[Colonial period of South Carolina|South Carolina]] in the United States.
# Chinese-Barbadians are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics. Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the [[Second World War]]. Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.
# Lebanese and Syrians form the [[Arab]] community on the island, and the Muslim minority among them make up a small percentage of the Muslim population. The majority of the Lebanese and Syrians arrived in Barbados through trade opportunities. Their numbers are falling due to emigration to other countries.
# [[Jews]] arrived in Barbados just after the first settlers in 1627. Bridgetown is the home of [[Nidhe Israel Synagogue]], the oldest Jewish synagogue in the Americas, dating from 1654, though the current structure was erected in 1833 replacing one ruined by the hurricane of 1831. Tombstones in the neighbouring cemetery date from the 1630s. Now under the care of the Barbados National Trust, the site was deserted in 1929 but was saved and restored by the Jewish community beginning in 1986.
# The Muslim-Indian Barbadian community is largely of [[Gujarat]]i ancestry. Many small businesses in Barbados are run and operated by Muslim-Indian Bajans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
# [[Romani people]] (Gypsies) from [[England]] who were expelled and deported to Barbados.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=URwaEhptDoUC&pg=PA74&dq=gypsies+england+in+barbados&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UPaZVcy1JJLdoATPtZPADw&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=gypsies%20england%20in%20barbados&f=false Questioning Gypsy Identity: Ethnic Narratives in Britain and America - Page 74]</ref>

=== Languages ===
English is the [[official language]] of Barbados, and is used for communications, administration, and public services all over the island. In its capacity as the official language of the country, the standard of English tends to conform to the vocabulary, pronunciations, spellings, and conventions akin to, but not exactly the same as, those of [[British English]].

A regional variant of English, referred to locally as [[Bajan Creole|Bajan]], is spoken by most Barbadians in everyday life, especially in informal settings. In its full-fledged form, Bajan sounds markedly different from the Standard English heard on the island. The degree of intelligibility between Bajan and general English, for the general English speaker, depends on the level of creolised vocabulary and idioms. A Bajan speaker may be completely unintelligible to an English speaker from another country. Bajan is influenced by other [[Caribbean English]] dialects.

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Barbados}}
Most Barbadians of African and European descent are Christians (95%), the largest denomination being [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] (40%). Other Christian denominations with significant followings in Barbados are the Catholic Church (which has its [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgetown]] on the island), Pentecostals (Evangelicals) [[Jehovah's Witness]]es, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and [[Spiritual Baptist]]s. The [[Church of England]] was the official state religion until its legal disenfranchisement by the Parliament of Barbados following independence.<ref>{{cite web|author=Singh, Rajkumar |url=http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=179Barbados |title=Parliament: Act of Parliament concerning the Anglican church |publisher=Caricomlaw.org |date=20 January 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110718104705/http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=179Barbados |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}</ref>

The crude birth rate is 12.23 births per 1,000 people, and the crude death rate is 8.39 deaths per 1,000 people. The infant mortality rate is 11.63 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.

All Barbadian citizens are covered by [[national healthcare]].  Barbados has over twenty [[polyclinic]]s throughout the country in addition to the main [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Bridgetown|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] (General Hospital) located in Bridgetown. In 2011, the Government of Barbados signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] to lease its 22-acre Saint Joseph Hospital site to the Denver, Colorado-based America World Clinics. Under the deal, the group will use Barbados as one of its main destinations for [[medical tourism]] at that facility. The government also announced it would begin constructing a new $900 million state-of-the-art hospital to replace the QEH.

The government of Barbados spends 6.7% of its GDP on education (2008).<ref name="cia"/>

All young people in the country must attend school until age 16. Barbados has over 70 primary schools and over 20 secondary schools throughout the island. There are a number of private schools, including [[Montessori]] and the [[International Baccalaureate]]. Student enrolment at these schools represents less than 5% of the total enrolment of the public schools.

Degree-level education in the country is provided by the [[Barbados Community College]], the Samuel Jackman Prescod Polytechnic, and the [[Cave Hill, Saint Michael, Barbados|Cave Hill campus]] and Open Campus of the [[University of the West Indies]].  

====Educational testing====
Barbados Secondary School Entrance Examination: Children who are 11 years old but under 12 years old on September 1 in the year of the examination are required to write the examination as a means of allocation to secondary school.

Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) examinations are usually taken by students after five years of secondary school and mark the end of standard secondary education. The CSEC examinations are equivalent to the Ordinary Level (O-Levels) examinations and are targeted toward students 16 and older.

Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE) are taken by students who have completed their secondary education and wish to continue their studies. Students who sit for the CAPE usually possess CSEC or an equivalent certification. The CAPE is equivalent to the British Advanced Levels (A-Levels), voluntary qualifications that are intended for university entrance.<ref>http://businessbarbados.com/investor-guide/relocating-to-barbados/education/</ref>

== Culture ==
[[File:RihannaPerformingSingapore.png|thumb|International [[Celebrity|pop star]] [[Rihanna]], a native of Barbados.]]
{{Main|Culture of Barbados}}   Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including [[Garfield Sobers|Sir Garfield Sobers]] and [[Frank Worrell|Sir Frank Worrell]].

Citizens are officially called Barbadians. The term "Bajan" (pronounced BAY-jun) may have come from a localised pronunciation of the word Barbadian, which at times can sound more like "Bar-bajan".

The largest [[carnival]]-like cultural event that takes place on the island is the [[Crop Over]] festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries, Crop Over is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to there to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities, and features the majority of the island's homegrown [[calypso music|calypso]] and [[soca music]] for the year. The male and female Barbadians who harvested the most sugarcane are crowned as the King and Queen of the crop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2camels.com/crop-over-festival.php |title=Crop Over Festival |publisher=2camels.com |accessdate=30 July 2009}}</ref> Crop Over gets under way at the beginning of July and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.

=== Music ===
{{Further|Music of Barbados}}
In music, [[Grammy awards|eight-time Grammy Award winner]] [[Rihanna]] (born in Saint Michael) is one of Barbados' best-known artists. In 2009 she was appointed as an Honorary Ambassador of youth and culture for Barbados by the late Prime Minister, [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]].

Singer-songwriter [[Shontelle]], the band [[Cover Drive]], musician [[Rupee (musician)|Rupee]] and [[Mark Morrison]], singer of Top 10 hit [[Return of the Mack]] also originate from Barbados.

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Barbados}}

[[File:Garfield Sobers Pavilion.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kensington Oval]] in [[Bridgetown]] hosted the 2007 Cricket World Cup final. Cricket is one of the most followed games in Barbados and Kensington Oval is often referred to as the "Mecca in Cricket" due to its significance and contributions to the sport.]]

As in other Caribbean countries of British colonial heritage, [[cricket]] is very popular on the island. The [[West Indies cricket team]] usually includes several Barbadian players. In addition to several warm-up matches and six "Super Eight" matches, the country hosted the final of the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. Barbados has produced many great cricketers including [[Sir Garfield Sobers]], [[Sir Frank Worrell]], [[Sir Clyde Walcott]], [[Sir Everton Weekes]], [[Gordon Greenidge]], [[Wes Hall]], [[Charlie Griffith]], [[Joel Garner]] and [[Malcolm Marshall]].

[[Horse racing]] takes place at the [[Garrison Savannah Racetrack|Historic Garrison Savannah]] close to Bridgetown. Spectators can pay for admission to the stands, or else can watch races from the public "rail", which encompasses the track.

[[Obadele Thompson]] is a world-class [[sprint (running)|sprinter]] from Barbados; he won a bronze medal at the Olympic Games of 2000 in the 100m sprint. [[Ryan Brathwaite]], a hurdler, reached the [[2008 Olympic]] semi-finals in Beijing. Brathwaite also earned Barbados its first ever medal at the world championships in Berlin, Germany on 20 August 2009, when he won the men's 110 meter hurdles title. The 21-year-old timed a national record of 13.14 seconds to win the Gold Medal.

[[Basketball]] is an increasingly popular sport, played at school or college. [[Barbados national basketball team|Barbados' national team]] has shown some unexpected results as in the past it beat many much larger countries.

[[Polo]] is very popular amongst the rich elite on the island and the "High-Goal" Apes Hill team is based at the St James's Club.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ape hills polo |url=http://www.apeshillclub.com/Polo/ |website=Ape hills Club |accessdate=2 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20150112201200/http://www.apeshillclub.com/Polo/ |archivedate=12 January 2015 }}</ref> It is also played at the private [[Holders Festival]] ground.

In golf, the [[Barbados Open]] is an annual stop on the [[European Seniors Tour]]. In December 2006 the [[WGC-World Cup]] took place at the country's [[Sandy Lane (resort)|Sandy Lane]] resort on the Country Club course, an 18-hole course designed by [[Tom Fazio]]. The Barbados Golf Club is the other main course on the island. Sanctioned by the PGA European Tour to host a PGA Seniors Tournament in 2003 and it has also hosted the Barbados Open on several occasions.

[[Volleyball]] is also popular, though volleyball is mainly played indoors.

[[Tennis]] is gaining popularity and Barbados is home to [[Darian King]], currently ranked 270th in the world and is the 2nd highest ranked player in the Caribbean.

[[Motorsports]] also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar. Also, the [[Bushy Park, Barbados|Bushy Park Circuit]] hosted the [[Race of Champions]] and [[Global RallyCross Championship]] in 2014.

The presence of the trade winds along with favourable swells make the southern tip of the island an ideal location for wave sailing (an extreme form of the sport of [[windsurfing]]).

[[Netball]] is also popular with women in Barbados.

{{Trivia|date=June 2007}}
*Imperial Palm trees found conveniently planted on the island are not indigenous to Barbados but were imported and strategically placed to be used as land markers for the sugar mill plantations. They can be seen from great distances across the relatively flat terrain.
*Although it has been declared the "most British" island in the Caribbean, Barbados was named by the Portuguese-explorer called Pedro Campos. British settlers first arrived 84 years after the Portuguese had left to continue their exploration of South America (Brazil).
*One of the signatures on the original United States constitution was a Barbadian, as was the printer of the document.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbados.org/usa_bdos.htm|title=USA - Barbados Ties|publisher=}}</ref>

== Transport ==
{{Main|Transport in Barbados}}

[[File:BM322Nov95.jpg|thumb|300px|An old Barbados Transport Board bus in Bridgetown.]]
Although Barbados is only about {{convert|34|km|mi}} at its widest point, a car journey from Six Cross Roads in St. Philip (south-east) to North Point in St. Lucy (north-central) can take one and a half hours or longer due to poor roads. Barbados has half as many registered cars as citizens.

Public transport on the island is relatively convenient with "[[share taxis|route taxis]]" called "ZRs" (pronounced "[[Z]]ed-Rs") travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down regardless of the number. They will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital [[Bridgetown]] or from [[Speightstown, Barbados|Speightstown]] in the northern part of the island.

Including the ZRs, there are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays). There are ZRs, the yellow minibuses and the blue [[Barbados Transport Board|Transport Board buses]]. A ride on any of them costs BBD$2.00. The smaller buses from the two privately owned systems ("ZRs" and "minibuses") can give change; the larger blue buses from the government-operated [[Barbados Transport Board]] system cannot, but do give receipts. Children in school uniform ride for free on the government buses and for $1.50 on the minibuses and ZRs. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.

Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally owned and operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national companies.

The island's lone airport is the [[Grantley Adams International Airport]]. It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the eastern Caribbean. In the first decade of the 21st century it underwent a US$100&nbsp;million upgrade and expansion.

There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and maritime traffic is regulated by the [[Barbados Port Authority]].
