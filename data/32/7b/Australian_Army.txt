The '''Australian Army''' is Australia's military land force. It is part of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) along with the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. While the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] (CDF) commands the ADF, the Army is commanded by the [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of Army]] (CA). The CA is therefore subordinate to the CDF, but is also directly responsible to the [[Minister of Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/da190356/s9.html| title=Defence Act (1903) – SECT 9 Command of Defence Force and arms of Defence Force| publisher= Australasian Legal Information Institute| accessdate=19 October 2010}}</ref> Although Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout its history, only in [[World War II]] has Australian territory come under direct attack.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Australian Army}}
The history of the Australian Army can be divided into two periods:
* 1901–47, when limits were set on the size of the regular Army, the vast majority of peacetime soldiers were in reserve units of the [[Citizens Military Force]] (also known as the CMF or Militia), and [[Australian Imperial Force (disambiguation)|Australian Imperial Force]]s were formed to serve overseas,{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=88 & 147}}{{sfn|Odgers|1988|p=5}}  and
* Post-1947, when a standing peacetime regular [[infantry]] force was formed and the CMF (known as the Army Reserve after 1980) began to decline in importance.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=200–201}}{{sfn|Odgers|1988|p=5}}

[[File:Cavalry scout Iraq.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Australian Cavalry Scout in Iraq, 2007]]

During its history the Australian Army has fought in a number of major wars, including: [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), [[First World War]] (1914–18), the [[Second World War]] (1939–45), [[Korea War]] (1950–53), [[Malayan Emergency]] (1950–60), [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]] (1962–66), [[Vietnam War]] (1962–73),{{sfn|Odgers|1988|p=}} and more recently in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] (2001 – present) and [[Iraq]] (2003–2009).{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=284–285}} Since 1947 the Australian Army has also been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the United Nations, however the non United Nations sponsored [[Multinational Force and Observers]] in the Sinai is a notable exception. Australia's largest peacekeeping deployment began in 1999 in [[International Force for East Timor|East Timor]], while other ongoing operations include peacekeeping on [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], in the [[Multinational Force and Observers|Sinai]], and in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Humanitarian relief after [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] in [[Aceh]] Province, [[Indonesia]], [[Operation Sumatra Assist]], ended on 24 March 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/peacekeeping/ |title=Australian War Memorial Official History of Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations |accessdate=4 April 2009}}</ref>

{{Further2|[[Structure of the Australian Army]]|[[Australian Army Reserve]]}}

[[File:Australia Land Forces 2012.png|thumb|center|620px|<div class="center">The Australian Army's structure in 2012</div>]]

The [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]] comprises a deployable headquarters, while [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]] under the command of [[Forces Command (Australia)|Forces Command]] is the main home-defence formation, containing Army Reserve units. 2nd Division's headquarters only performs administrative functions. The Australian Army has not deployed a divisional-sized formation since 1945 and does not expect to do so in the future.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=195}}

===1st Division===
'''[[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]]''' carries out high-level training activities and deploys to command large-scale ground operations. It does not have any combat units permanently assigned.
[[File:Machine gun team from 1 RAR during RIMPAC 2012.JPG|thumb|[[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|1 RAR]] machine-gun team training in [[Hawaii]] during RIMPAC 2012]]

===Forces Command===
[[Forces Command (Australia)|Forces Command]] controls for administrative purposes all non-[[special forces|special-forces]] assets of the Australian Army. It is neither an operational nor a deployable command.
* '''[[1st Brigade (Australia)|1 Brigade]]''' – Mechanised brigade based in Darwin.
* '''[[3rd Brigade (Australia)|3 Brigade]]''' – Light-infantry brigade based in Townsville.
* '''[[6th Brigade (Australia)|6 Brigade (CS&ISTAR)]]''' – Mixed brigade based in Sydney.
* '''[[7th Brigade (Australia)|7 Brigade]]''' – Motorised brigade based in Brisbane.
* '''[[16th Aviation Brigade (Australia)|16 Aviation Brigade]]''' – Army Aviation brigade based in [[Enoggera Barracks|Enoggera]], Brisbane.
* '''[[17th Combat Service Support Brigade (Australia)|17 Combat Service Support Brigade]]''' – Logistic brigade based in Sydney.
* '''[[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]]''' administers the reserve forces from its headquarters located in Sydney
** '''[[4th Brigade (Australia)|4 Brigade]]''' – based in Victoria.
** '''[[5th Brigade (Australia)|5 Brigade]]''' – based in New South Wales.
** '''[[8th Brigade (Australia)|8 Brigade]]''' – based in New South Wales.
** '''[[9th Brigade (Australia)|9 Brigade]]''' – based in South Australia and Tasmania.
** '''[[11th Brigade (Australia)|11 Brigade]]''' – based in Queensland.
** '''[[13th Brigade (Australia)|13 Brigade]]''' – based in Western Australia.

Additionally, Forces Command includes the following training establishments:
* [[Army Recruit Training Centre]] at Kapooka, NSW; 
* [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]]; 
* [[Combined Arms Training Centre (Australia)|Combined Arms Training Centre]] at [[Puckapunyal]], Vic; 
* [[Army Logistic Training Centre (Australia)|Army Logistic Training Centre]] at Bonegilla, Vic and Bandiana, Vic; and 
* [[Oakey Army Aviation Centre|Army Aviation Training Centre]] at Oakey, QLD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/Who-we-are/Divisions-and-Brigades/Forces-Command |title=Forces Command |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=11 September 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Australian SOTG patrol Oct 2009.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Australian special forces in Afghanistan, 2009]]

===Special Forces===
[[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]] comprises a command formation of equal status to the other commands in the ADF. It is a brigade-sized formation responsible for all of Australia's [[special forces|special-forces]] assets.

===Planned restructuring===
Under a restructuring program known as [[Plan Beersheba]] announced in late 2011, the 1st, 3rd and 7th Brigades will be re-formed as combined-arms multi-role manoeuvre brigades with the [[2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (part of the 3rd Brigade) forming the core of a future amphibious force<ref>

==Colours, standards and guidons==
{{Main|Colours, standards and guidons}}
[[File:AustArmyColours.jpg|thumb|left|300px|All colours of the Army were on parade for the centenary of the Army, 10 March 2001.]]
[[File:Australian and Afghan soldiers wait for US Black Hawks.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Australian soldiers wearing the [[Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform]] alongside Afghan National Army soldiers in Afghanistan]]
Infantry, and some other combat units of the Australian Army carry flags called the Queen's Colour and the Regimental Colour, known as "the Colours".{{sfn|Jobson|2009|p=53}} Armoured units carry Standards and Guidons – flags smaller than Colours and traditionally carried by Cavalry, Lancer, Light Horse and Mounted Infantry units. The 1st Armoured Regiment is the only unit in the Australian Army to carry a Standard, in the tradition of heavy armoured units. Artillery units' guns are considered to be their Colours, and on parade are provided with the same respect.{{sfn|Jobson|2009|pp=55–56}} Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, as Colours are battle flags and so are only available to combat units. As a substitute, many have Standards or Banners.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Flags, Military Flags, & Queens and Regimental Colours |publisher=Digger History |url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-flags/0-flag-cat-index.htm |accessdate=3 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070405154849/http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-flags/0-flag-cat-index.htm| archivedate= 5 April 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Units awarded [[battle honours]] have them emblazoned on their Colours, Standards and Guidons. They are a link to the unit's past and a memorial to the fallen. Artillery do not have Battle Honours – their single Honour is "Ubique" which means "Everywhere" – although they can receive Honour Titles.{{sfn|Jobson|2009|p=58}}

The Army is the guardian of the [[Flag of Australia|National Flag]] and as such, unlike the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], does not have a flag or Colours. The Army, instead, has a banner, known as the Army Banner. To commemorate the centenary of the Army, the Governor General [[Sir William Deane]], presented the Army with a new Banner at a parade in front of the [[Australian War Memorial]] on 10 March 2001. The Banner was presented to the [[Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (Australia)|Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A)]], Warrant Officer Peter Rosemond.

The Army Banner bears the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Australian Coat of Arms]] on the obverse, with the dates "1901–2001" in gold in the upper hoist. The reverse bears the [[Rising Sun (badge)|"rising sun" badge]] of the Australian Army, flanked by seven [[Battle honours|campaign honours]] on small gold-edged scrolls: [[Second Boer War|South Africa]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Korean War|Korea]], [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya-Borneo]], [[Vietnam War|South Vietnam]], and Peacekeeping. The banner is trimmed with gold fringe, has gold and crimson cords and tassels, and is mounted on a pike with the usual British royal crest finial.<ref>{{cite web |title=Army Flags (Australia) |publisher=Flags of the World |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/au%5Earmy.html |accessdate=3 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070403011109/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/au%5Earmy.html| archivedate= 3 April 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Personnel==

===Strength===
In the 2010–11 financial year the Army had an average strength of 47,135 personnel: 30,235 permanent (regular) and 16,900 active reservists (part-time).<ref name=DefPBS>{{Cite book|title=Portfolio Budget Statements 2011–12: Defence Portfolio|year=2011|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|isbn=978-0-642-29739-6|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/11-12/pbs/2011-2012_Defence_PBS_Complete.pdf|author=Department of Defence|location=Canberra|page=39}}</ref> In addition, there are another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.<ref>{{cite book |last=Australian National Audit Office |title=Army Reserve Forces |publisher=Australian National Audit Office |location=Canberra |year=2009 |series=Audit Report No.31 2008–09 |isbn=0-642-81063-X |url=http://www.anao.gov.au/uploads/documents/2008-09_Audit_Report_No.31.pdf}}</ref> The regular Army is targeted to expand to 31,000 personnel by 2014–15.<ref name=DefPBS/> Personnel numbers have trended downwards since a peak in 2010&ndash;11 with an actual strength of 28,568 full-time personnel. Army Reserve numbers are 14,662, which does not include Standby Reserves. This gives the Army a combined strength of 43,230 active personnel for the year 2013&ndash;14.<ref name=DAR13-14/>

===Rank and insignia===
{{Main|Australian Army officer rank insignia|Australian Army enlisted rank insignia}}
The ranks of the Australian Army are based on the ranks of the [[British Army]], and carry mostly the same actual [[Australian Army officer rank insignia|insignia]]. For [[officer (armed forces)|officer]]s the ranks are identical except for the shoulder title "Australia". The [[Non-Commissioned Officer]] [[Australian Army enlisted rank insignia|insignia]] are the same up until [[Warrant Officer]] ranks, where they are stylised for Australia (for example, using the Australian, rather than the British coat of arms).
The ranks of the Australian Army are as follows:
# Private (PTE) – OR-2
# Private Proficient (PTE(P)) Also used within the Private equivalent ranks – OR-3
# Lance Corporal or Lance Bombardier (LCPL or LBDR) – OR-4
# Corporal or Bombardier (CPL or BDR) – OR-5
# Sergeant (SGT) – OR-6
# Staff Sergeant (SSGT) – OR-7 (SSGT is being phased out of the Australian Army)
# Warrant Officer Class Two (WO2) – OR-8
# Warrant Officer Class One (WO1) – OR-9
# Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A) – OR-9 (This is an appointment rather than a rank)
# Second Lieutenant (2LT) – OF-1
# Lieutenant (LT) – OF-2
# Captain (CAPT) – OF-3
# Major (MAJ) – OF-4
# Lieutenant Colonel (LTCOL) – OF-5
# Colonel (COL) – OF-6
# Brigadier (BRIG) – OF-7. Like the United Kingdom, prior to 1922 Australia used the rank Brigadier General
# Major General (MAJGEN) – OF-8
# Lieutenant General (LTGEN) – OF-9
# General (GEN) – OF-10
# Field Marshal (FM) – OF-11. This rank is generally reserved for wartime and ceremonial purposes; there are no regular appointments to the rank. Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] is the only Australian-born officer promoted to the rank. [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], is currently the only living holder of the rank of Field Marshal in the Australian Army. The Duke, however, does not have any active role in the Australian command structure.

==Australian Army Journal==
Since 1948, the Australian Army has published its own journal titled the ''Australian Army Journal''. Covering a broad range of topics including essays, book reviews and editorials, with submissions from serving members as well as professional authors, the journal's stated goal is to provide "...the primary forum for Army's professional discourse... [and to facilitate]... debate within the Australian Army ...[and raise] ...the quality and intellectual rigor of that debate by adhering to a strict and demanding standard of quality".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/Our-future/Publications/Australian-Army-Journal |title=Australian Army Journal |work=Publications |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> In 1976, the journal was placed on hiatus; however, publishing began again in 1999 and since then the journal has been published largely on a quarterly basis, with only minimal interruptions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/Our-future/Publications/Australian-Army-Journal/Archive |title=Past editions: Australian Army Journal |work=Publications |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref>
