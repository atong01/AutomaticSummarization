'''Cadmium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Cd''' and [[atomic number]] 48. This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in [[group 12 element|group 12]], [[zinc]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Like zinc, it prefers [[oxidation state]] +2 in most of its compounds and like mercury it shows a low melting point compared to [[transition metal]]s. Cadmium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] are not always considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by [[Friedrich Stromeyer|Stromeyer]] and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann|Hermann]], both in Germany, as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]].

Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and therefore is a byproduct of zinc production. It was used for a long time as a [[pigment]] and for corrosion-resistant plating on [[steel]], whereas cadmium compounds were used to stabilize [[plastic]]. The use of cadmium is generally decreasing due to its [[toxicity]] (it is specifically listed in the European [[ROHS|Restriction of Hazardous Substances]] <ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book

Although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent [[carbonic anhydrase]] has been found in marine [[diatom]]s.

===Isotopes===
[[File:Cadmium cutoff.png|thumb|left|The cadmium-113 total cross section clearly showing the cadmium cut-off]]
{{Main|Isotopes of cadmium}}
Naturally occurring cadmium is composed of 8 [[isotope]]s. Two of them are [[radionuclide|naturally radioactive]], and three are expected to [[radioactive decay|decay]] but have not been experimentally confirmed to do so. The two natural radioactive isotopes are <sup>113</sup>Cd ([[beta decay]], half-life is 7.7 × 10<sup>15</sup> years) and <sup>116</sup>Cd (two-neutrino [[double beta decay]], half-life is 2.9 × 10<sup>19</sup> years). The other three are <sup>106</sup>Cd, <sup>108</sup>Cd (both [[double electron capture]]), and <sup>114</sup>Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on their half-life times have been set. At least three isotopes&nbsp;– <sup>110</sup>Cd, <sup>111</sup>Cd, and <sup>112</sup>Cd&nbsp;– are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are <sup>109</sup>Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and <sup>115</sup>Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 2.5 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5 minutes. Cadmium has 8 known [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being <sup>113m</sup>Cd (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 14.1 years), <sup>115m</sup>Cd (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 44.6 days), and <sup>117m</sup>Cd (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 3.36 hours).<ref name="NUBASE">

The known isotopes of cadmium range in [[atomic mass]] from 94.950 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (<sup>95</sup>Cd) to 131.946 u (<sup>132</sup>Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112 u, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] and the dominant [[decay product]] is element 47 ([[silver]]). Heavier isotopes decay mostly through [[beta emission]] producing element 49 ([[indium]]).<ref name="NUBASE"/>

One isotope of cadmium, <sup>113</sup>Cd, absorbs neutrons with very high probability if they have an energy below the ''cadmium cut-off'' and transmits them otherwise. The cadmium cut-off is about 0.5 eV. Neutrons with energy below the cut-off are deemed slow neutrons, distinguishing them from intermediate and fast neutrons.<ref>

[[File:Friedrich Strohmeyer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Friedrich Stromeyer]]]]
Cadmium ([[Latin]] ''cadmia'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''καδμεία'' meaning "[[calamine]]", a cadmium-bearing mixture of minerals, which was named after the Greek mythological character Κάδμος, [[Cadmus]], the founder of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]) was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] simultaneously in 1817 by [[Friedrich Stromeyer]]<ref>

The metal was named after the Latin word for calamine, because it was found in this zinc compound. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not. He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and reduction of the [[cadmium sulfide|sulfide]]. The possibility to use cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the 1840s but the lack of cadmium limited this application.<ref>

[[File:Cadmium sulfide.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Cadmium sulfide]]
In paint pigments, cadmium forms various [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], with CdS being the most common. This sulfide is used as a [[Cadmium pigments|yellow pigment]]. [[Cadmium selenide]] can be used as red pigment, commonly called ''cadmium red''. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium yellows, oranges, and reds are the most brilliant and long-lasting colors to use. In fact, during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders, or blended into [[watercolor]]s, [[gouache]]s, [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]], and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, it is recommended to use a [[barrier cream]] on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin when working with them<ref name="colors">{{cite book|chapter = Cadmium Pigments|url = http://books.google.com/?id=_OrB0ew_HgAC&pg=PA121|pages = 121–123|isbn = 978-3-527-30363-2|publisher = Wiley-VCH|date = 2005|title =Industrial inorganic pigments|first1 = Gunter|last1 = Buxbaum|first2 = Gerhard|last2 = Pfaff}}</ref> even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is usually reported to be less than 1%.<ref name = "ATSDR"/>

Cadmium is a component of some compound [[semiconductor]]s, such as cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and [[cadmium telluride]], which can be used for light detection or [[solar cell]]s. [[HgCdTe]] is sensitive to [[infrared]]<ref name="HgCdPb"/> light and therefore may be utilized as an infrared detector or switch for example in remote control devices.

In molecular biology, cadmium is used to block voltage-dependent calcium channels from fluxing calcium ions, as well as in [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] research to stimulate [[proteasome]]-dependent degradation of [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|Hif-1α]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal = European Journal of Biochemistry|volume = 267|issue = 13|pages = 4198–4204|date = 2000|doi = 10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01453.x|title = Cadmium blocks hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1-mediated response to hypoxia by stimulating the proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha|first = Chun Y.

The victims of this poisoning were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's [[ROHS|Restriction on Hazardous Substances]] (RoHS) directive, which bans certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.<ref>{{cite web |title=European Commission Decision of 12 October 2006 amending, for the purposes of adapting to technical progress, the Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards exemptions for applications of lead and cadmium (notified under document number C(2006) 4790) |date=14 October 2006|publisher=Journal of the European Union|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:283:0048:0049:EN:PDF}}</ref>
The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans.<ref>IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 58</ref> Although occupational exposure to cadmium is linked to lung and prostate cancer, there is still a substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low, environmental exposure.

Although some epidemiological studies show a significant correlation between cadmium exposure and occurrence of disease conditions in human populations, a causative role for cadmium as the factor behind these effects remains yet to be shown. In order to prove a causative role, it will be important to define the molecular mechanisms through which cadmium in low exposure can cause adverse health effects. One hypothesis is that cadmium works as an [[endocrine disruptor]] because some experimental studies have shown that it can interact with different [[Hormone|hormonal]] signaling pathways. For example, cadmium can bind to the [[estrogen receptor]] alpha,<ref>{{Cite journal

Tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population. It has been estimated that about 10% of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking. The absorption of cadmium from the lungs is much more effective than that from the gut, and as much as 50% of the cadmium inhaled via cigarette smoke may be absorbed.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1146/annurev.pu.04.050183.002055|journal = Annual Review of Public Health|volume = 4|pmid = 6860444|pages = 367–367|date = 1983|title = Cadmium|first = L.|last = Friberg}}</ref>
On average, smokers have 4–5 times higher blood cadmium concentrations and 2–3 times higher kidney cadmium concentrations than non-smokers. Despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke, there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from [[passive smoking]]. No significant effect on blood cadmium concentrations has been detected in children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health|volume = 24|pages = 11–51|date = 1998|title = Health effects of cadmium exposure—a review of the literature and a risk estimate|first = L.|last = Jarup}}</ref>

In the non-smoking part of the population food is the biggest source of exposure to cadmium. High quantities of cadmium can be found for example in crustaceans, molluscs, offals, and algal products. However, due to the higher consumption the most significant contributors to the dietary cadmium exposure are grains, vegetables, and starchy roots and tubers.<ref name="efsa.europa.eu">http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2551.htm</ref>

Cadmium exposure is a risk factor associated with early atherosclerosis and hypertension, which can both lead to cardiovascular disease.<ref>[http://www.medinewsdirect.com/?p=704 Cadmium Exposure can Induce Early Atherosclerotic Changes], Medinews Direct, 7 September 2009</ref>

===Regulations===
Due to the adverse effects on the environment and human health, the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in Europe under the [[REACH Regulation]].<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm EUR-Lex]. Eur-lex.europa.eu (18 April 2011). Retrieved on 5 June 2011.</ref>

The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain has set 2.5 μg/kg body weight as a tolerable weekly intake for humans.<ref name="efsa.europa.eu"/> In comparison, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has established 7 μg/kg bw as a provisional tolerable weekly intake level.<ref>http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jeceval/jec_297.htm</ref>

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set a [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) for cadmium at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.005 ppm. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has not set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) and has designated it as a known human carcinogen. The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) level for cadmium is 9 mg/m<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{PGCH|0087}}</ref>
