'''Carinatae''' is the group of all [[bird]]s and their extinct relatives to possess a keel, or "carina", on the underside of the [[breastbone]] used to anchor large flight muscles.

===Definition===
Traditionally, Carinatae were defined as all birds whose [[sternum]] (breast bone) has a [[keel (bird)|keel]] (''carina''). The keel is a strong median ridge running down the length of the sternum. This is an important area for the attachment of flight muscles. Thus, all flying birds have a pronounced keel. [[Ratite]]s, all of whom are flightless, lack a strong keel. Thus, living birds were divided into carinates (keeled) and ratites (from ''ratis'', "raft", referring to the flatness of the sternum). The difficulty with this scheme [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] was that some flightless birds, without strong carinae, are descended directly from ordinary flying birds with carinae. Examples include the [[kakapo]], a flightless [[parrot]], and the [[dodo]], a columbiform (the [[pigeon]] family). None of these birds are ratites. Thus, this supposedly distinctive feature was easy to use, but had nothing to do with actual phylogenic relationship.

Beginning in the 1980s, Carinatae was given several [[phylogenetic]] definitions. The first was as a node-based [[clade]] uniting ''[[Ichthyornis]]'' with modern birds.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cracraft |first=Joel |authorlink= |year=1986 |month= |title=The origin and early diversification of birds |journal=[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=pp. 383–399 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> However, in many analyses, this definition would be synonymous with the more widely-used name [[Ornithurae]]. An alternate definition was provided in 2001, naming Carinatae an [[apomorphy]]-based clade defined by the presence of a keeled sternum.<ref name=gauhthier2001>Gauthier, J., & De Queiroz, K. (2001).

The most primitive known bird relative with a keeled breastbone is ''[[Confuciusornis]]''. While some specimens of this stem-bird have flat breastbones, some show a small ridge that may have supported a cartilaginous keel.<ref>Chiappe, L. M., Ji, S. A., Ji, Q., & Norell, M. A. (1999).
