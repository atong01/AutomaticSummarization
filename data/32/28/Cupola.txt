The cupola is a development during the Renaissance of the [[oculus]], an ancient device found in Roman architecture, but being weatherproof was superior for the wetter climates of northern Europe. {{cn|date=February 2015}} The [[chhatri]], seen in [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]], fits the definition of a cupola when it is used atop a larger structure.{{cn|date=February 2015}}
