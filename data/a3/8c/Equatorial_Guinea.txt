Formerly the colony of [[Spanish Guinea]], its post-independence name evokes its location near both the [[Equator]] and the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. Equatorial Guinea is the only sovereign African state in which [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is an official language. As of 2012, the country has a population of 1.6 million.<ref name=unpop>[http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/estadistica.php GUINEA ECUATORIAL, Página Oficial del Gobierno de la República de Guinea Ecuatorial]. Evolución de la población de Guinea Ecuatorial</ref>

Equatorial Guinea consists of two parts, an insular and a mainland region. The [[Islands of Equatorial Guinea|insular region]] consists of the islands of [[Bioko]] (formerly ''Fernando Pó'') in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and [[Annobón Province|Annobón]], a small volcanic island south of the [[equator]]. Bioko Island is the northernmost part of Equatorial Guinea and is the site of the country's capital, [[Malabo]]. The island nation of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] is located between Bioko and Annobón. The mainland region, [[Río Muni]], is bordered by [[Cameroon]] on the north and [[Gabon]] on the south and east. It is the location of [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]], Equatorial Guinea's largest city, and [[Oyala]], the country's planned future capital. Rio Muni also includes several small offshore islands, such as [[Corisco]], [[Elobey Grande]], and [[Elobey Chico]].

Since the mid-1990s, Equatorial Guinea has become one of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]'s largest oil producers. With a population of almost two million, it is the richest country per capita in Africa,<ref>[http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?c=mr&v=67 GDP – per capita (PPP) – Country Comparison]. Indexmundi.com. Retrieved on 5 May 2013.</ref> and its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranks 69th in the world;<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html GDP – per capita (PPP)], [[The World Factbook]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]].</ref> However, the wealth is distributed very unevenly and few people have benefited from the oil riches. The country ranks 144th on the UN's 2014 [[Human Development Index]]. The UN says that less than half of the population has access to clean drinking water and that 20% of children die before reaching five.

The authoritarian [[regime]] ruling Equatorial Guinea has one of the worst human rights records in the world, consistently ranking among the "worst of the worst" in [[Freedom House]]'s [[Freedom in the World|annual survey of political and civil rights]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20101122180016/http://freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/88.pdf Worst of the Worst 2010.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Equatorial Guinea}}
Equatorial Guinea is in west central Africa. The country consists of a mainland territory, [[Río Muni]], which is bordered by Cameroon to the north and Gabon to the east and south, and five small islands, [[Bioko]], [[Corisco]], [[Annobón]], [[Elobey Chico]] (Small Elobey), and [[Elobey Grande]] (Great Elobey). Bioko, the site of the capital, Malabo, lies about {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} off the coast of Cameroon. Annobón Island is about {{convert|350|km|sp=us}} west-south-west of [[Cape Lopez]] in Gabon. Corisco and the two Elobey islands are in Corisco Bay, on the border of Río Muni and Gabon.

Equatorial Guinea lies between latitudes [[4th parallel north|4°N]] and [[2nd parallel south|2°S]], and longitudes [[5th meridian west|5°]] and [[12th meridian east|12°E]]. Despite its name, no part of the country's territory lies on the equator—it is in the northern hemisphere, except for the insular [[Annobón Province]], which is about 155&nbsp;km south of the equator.

===Climate===
Equatorial Guinea has a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. From June to August, Río Muni is dry and Bioko wet; from December to February, the reverse occurs. In between there is gradual transition. Rain or mist occurs daily on Annobón, where a cloudless day has never been registered. The temperature at Malabo, Bioko, ranges from {{convert|16|C}} to {{convert|33|C}}, though on the southern Moka Plateau normal high temperatures are only {{convert|21|C}}. In Río Muni, the average temperature is about {{convert|27|C}}. Annual rainfall varies from {{convert|1930|mm|abbr=on}} at Malabo to {{convert|10920|mm|abbr=on}} at [[San Antonio de Ureca|Ureka]], Bioko, but Río Muni is somewhat drier.<ref>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Equatorial-Guinea-CLIMATE.html Nations Encyclopedia]. Nations Encyclopedia (10 April 2011). Retrieved on 5 May 2013.</ref>

=== Ecology ===
Equatorial Guinea spans several [[ecoregion]]s. Río Muni region lies within the [[Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests]] ecoregion except for patches of [[Central African mangroves]] on the coast, especially in the [[Muni River]] estuary. The [[Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests]] ecoregion covers most of Bioko and as well as the adjacent portions of [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]] on the African mainland, and the [[Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests]] ecoregion covers the highlands of Bioko and nearby [[Mount Cameroon]].

The [[São Tomé, Príncipe, and Annobón moist lowland forests]] ecoregion covers all of Annobón, as well as São Tomé and Príncipe.

== History ==
{{main|History of Equatorial Guinea}}
In the continental region that is now Equatorial Guinea, pygmies likely formerly lived, of whom only isolated pockets now remain in southern Río Muni. [[Bantu people|Bantu]] migrations between the 18th and 19th centuries brought the coastal ethno-linguistic groups as well as the [[Beti-Pahuin#Fang|Fang]]. Elements of the latter may have generated the [[Bubi people|Bubi]], who migrated from Cameroon to Rio Muni and Bioko in several waves and succeeded former Neolithic populations. The Annobón population, native to [[Angola]], was introduced by the Portuguese via [[São Tomé island]].

=== First European contact (1472) ===
The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese explorer]] [[Fernão do Pó|Fernando Pó]], seeking a path to [[India]], is credited as being the first European to discover the island of Bioko in 1472. He called it ''Formosa'' ("Beautiful"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. The islands of Fernando Pó and Annobón were colonized by [[Portugal]] in 1474.

In 1778, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and King [[Charles III of Spain]] signed the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]] which ceded the Bioko, adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the Bight of Biafra between the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Ogoue River|Ogoue]] rivers to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Spain had thereby tried to gain access to a source of slaves controlled by British merchants. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of Equatorial Guinea was administered by the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], based in [[Buenos Aires]].

From 1827 to 1843, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] had a base on [[Bioko]] to combat the [[slavery|slave trade]],<ref>"Fernando Po", Encyclopædia Britannica, 1911.</ref> which was then moved to [[Sierra Leone]] upon agreement with Spain in 1843. In 1844, on restoration of Spanish sovereignty, it became known as the ''Territorios Españoles del Golfo de Guinea''. Spain had neglected to occupy the large area in the Bight of Biafra to which it had Treaty rights, and the French had been busily expanding their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain. The [[Treaty of Paris (1900)|treaty of Paris]] in 1900 left Spain with the continental enclave of Rio Muni, a mere 26,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> out of the 300,000 stretching east to the [[Ubangi River|Ubangi river]] which the Spaniards had initially claimed

At the turn of the century, the plantations of Fernando Po were largely in the hands of a black Creole elite, later known as [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]]. The British had settled some 2,000 Sierra Leoneans and freed slaves during their brief occupation of the island in the early nineteenth century, and a small current of immigration from West Africa and the West Indies continued after the departure of the British. To this core of settlers were added Cubans, Filipinos and Spaniards of various colours deported for political or other crimes, as well as some assisted settlers.

There was also a trickle of immigration from the neighbouring Portuguese islands, in the form of escaped slaves and prospective planters. Although a few of the [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]] were Catholic and Spanish-speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and English-speaking on the eve of the First World War, and [[pidgin English]] was the lingua franca of the island. The Sierra Leoneans were particularly well placed as planters while labour recruitment on the Windward coast continued, for they kept family and other connections there and could easily arrange labour supplies.

From the opening years of the twentieth century, the Fernandinos were put on the defensive by a new generation of Spanish immigrants. New land regulations in 1904-1905 favoured Spaniards, and most of the big planters of later years arrived in the islands from Spain following these new regulations. The Liberian labour agreement of 1914 favoured wealthy men with ready access to the state, and the shift in labour supplies from Liberia to Rio Muni increased this advantage. In 1940, it was estimated that only 20 per cent of the colony's cocoa production came from African land, nearly all of it in the hands of Fernandinos.

[[File:Corisco-Saliendo de misa-1910.jpg|thumb|[[Corisco]], 1910]]
The greatest constraint to economic development was a chronic shortage of labour. The indigenous [[Bubi people|Bubi]] population of [[Bioko]], pushed into the interior of the island and decimated by alcoholic addiction, venereal disease, smallpox and sleeping- sickness, refused to work on plantations. Working their own little cocoa farms gave them a considerable degree of autonomy. Moreover, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters from the late nineteenth century by the Spanish [[Claretians|Claretian]] missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into little mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous Jesuit [[Reducciones|Reductions]] of Paraguay. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections protesting the conscription of [[Forced labor|forced labour]] for the plantations, in 1898 and 1910, which led to the Bubi being disarmed in 1917 and left them dependent on the missionaries.<ref name="Clarence-Smith" />

Between 1926 and 1959 Bioko and Rio Muni were united as the colony of [[Spanish Guinea]]. The economy was based on large [[cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations and [[logging]] concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant contract labour from [[Liberia]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroun]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Martino, Enrique |title=Clandestine Recruitment Networks in the Bight of Biafra: Fernando Pó’s Answer to the Labour Question, 1926–1945|journal=International Review of Social History |volume=57|pages=39–72|url=http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/03/enrique-martino-clandestine-recruitment.html|doi=10.1017/s0020859012000417}}</ref> Between 1914 and 1930, an estimated 10,000 Liberians went to Fernando Po under a Labour Treaty that was stopped altogether in 1930. 
With the ending of Liberian imports, the cocoa planters of Fernando Po turned to Rio Muni. It was no coincidence that campaigns were mounted to subdue the [[Fang people]] in the 1920s, at the time that Liberia was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/14636204.2013.790703 | title = La última selva de España: Antropófagos, misioneros y guardias civiles.

Rio Muni had a small population, officially put at a little over 100,000 in the 1930s, and escape over the frontiers into Cameroun or Gabon was very easy. Moreover, the timber companies needed growing amounts of labour, and the spread of coffee cultivation offered an alternative means of paying taxes. Fernando Po thus continued to suffer from labour shortages. The French only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroun, and the main source of labour came to be [[Igbo people|Igbo]] smuggled in canoes from [[Calabar]], Nigeria. The British made this current of labour migration legal in 1942. It was this agreement which really permitted Fernando Po to become one of Africa's most productive agricultural areas after the Second World War.<ref name="Clarence-Smith" />

Politically, one can divide the post-war colonial history into three fairly distinct phases: up to 1959, when its status was raised from 'colonial' to 'provincial', taking a leaf out of the approach of the Portuguese Empire; between 1960 and 1968, when Madrid attempted a partial decolonisation which should, as it was hoped, conserve the territory as an integral segment of the Spanish system; and onwards from 1968, when the territory became an independent Republic. The first of these phases consisted of little more than a continuation of previous policies; these closely resembled the policies of Portugal and France, notably in dividing the population into a vast majority governed as 'natives' or non-citizens, and a very small minority (together with whites) admitted to civic status as emancipados, assimilation to the metropolitan culture being the only permissible means of advancement.<ref>Crowder, Michael, ed. (1984) ''The Cambridge History of Africa: Volume 8, from C. 1940 to C. 1975''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521224098.</ref>

This 'provincial' phase saw the beginnings of nationalism, but chiefly among small groups who had taken refuge from the Caudillo's paternal hand in Cameroun and Gabon. They formed two bodies: the Movimiento Nacional de Liberación de la Guinea (MONALIGE), and the Idea Popular de la Guinea Ecuatorial (IPGE). Their pressures were weak, but the general trend in West Africa was not. A decision of 9 August 1963, approved by a referendum of 15 December 1963, introduced the territory to a measure of autonomy and the administrative promotion of a 'moderate' grouping, the Movimiento de Unión Nacional de la Guinea Ecuatorial (MUNGE). This proved a feeble instrument, and, with growing pressure for change from the UN, Madrid gave way to the currents of nationalism.

===Independence (1968)===
Independence was conceded on 12 October 1968 and became the Republic of Equatorial Guinea with [[Francisco Macías Nguema]] elected as president.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Campos, Alicia|title=The decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: the relevance of the international factor|journal= Journal of African history |year=2003|pages=95–116|volume=44|issue=1|url=http://www.egjustice.org/publications/decolonization-equatorial-guinea-relevance-international-factor|doi=10.1017/s0021853702008319}}</ref>

In July 1970, Macias Nguema created a single-party state and made himself [[president for life]] in 1972. He broke off ties with Spain and the West. In spite of his condemnation of Marxism, which he deemed "neo-colonialist", Equatorial Guinea maintained very special relations with socialist countries, notably [[China]], [[Cuba]], and the [[USSR]]. He signed a preferential trade agreement and a shipping treaty with the Soviet Union. The Soviets also granted loans to Equatorial Guinea.<ref name="aworawo103">{{cite journal|last=Aworawo|first=David|title=Decisive Thaw: The Changing Pattern of Relations between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea, 1980–2005|journal=Journal of International and Global Studies|volume=1|issue=2|page=103|url=http://www.lindenwood.edu/jigs/docs/volume1Issue2/essays/89-109.pdf}}</ref>

The shipping agreement granted the Soviets permission to establish a pilot project of fishery development and a naval base at [[Luba, Equatorial Guinea|Luba]]. The USSR was in return to supply fish to Equatorial Guinea. China and Cuba also gave different forms on financial, military, and technical assistance to Equatorial Guinea, which gave them a measure of influence in Equatorial Guinea. For the USSR, despite the unsavoury background of Macias Nguema, there was an advantage to be gained in the [[Angola Civil War|War in Angola]] by having access to Luba base and later on to [[Malabo International Airport]].<ref name="aworawo103"/>

Towards the middle 1970s the Macias regime came under grave accusations of being guilty of [[mass murder|mass killings]]. In 1974 the World Council of Churches affirmed that large numbers of people had been murdered since 1968 in a 'reign of terror' which continued.

[[File:Equatorial Guinea Map.png|thumb|300px|{{center|Equatorial Guinea}}]]
{{main|Politics of Equatorial Guinea}}

The current president of Equatorial Guinea is [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo|Teodoro Obiang Nguema]]. The 1982 constitution of Equatorial Guinea, written with help from the UN, gives Obiang extensive powers, including naming and dismissing members of the cabinet, making laws by decree, dissolving the Chamber of Representatives, negotiating and ratifying treaties and serving as commander in chief of the armed forces. The Prime Minister, [[Vicente Ehate Tomi]] was appointed by Obiang and operates under powers designated by the President.

During the three decades of his rule, Obiang has shown little tolerance for opposition. While the country is nominally a multiparty democracy, elections have generally been considered a sham. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the dictatorship of President Obiang has used an oil boom to entrench and enrich itself further at the expense of the country's people.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13317174 BBC News – Equatorial Guinea country profile – Overview].

According to a March 2004 BBC profile,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3516588.stm |title=Profile: Equatorial Guinea's great survivor |publisher=BBC News |date=17 March 2004 |first=Nicholas |last=Shaxson}}</ref> politics within the country are currently dominated by tensions between Obiang's son, [[Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue]], and other close relatives with powerful positions in the security forces. The tension may be rooted in a power shift arising from the dramatic increase in oil production which has occurred since 1997.

Equatorial Guinea hit the headlines in 2004 when a plane load of suspected mercenaries was intercepted in [[Zimbabwe]] while allegedly on the way to overthrow Obiang. A November 2004 report<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/26/1093518010003.html |title=Thatcher faces 15 years in prison |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=27 August 2004}}</ref> named [[Mark Thatcher]] as a financial backer of the [[2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'état attempt]] organized by [[Simon Mann]].

A 2004 [[United States Senate|US Senate]] investigation into the Washington-based [[Riggs Bank]] found that President Obiang's family had received huge payments from US oil companies such as [[Exxon Mobil]] and [[Amerada Hess]]. Since 2005, [[Military Professional Resources Inc.]], a US-based international private military company, has worked in Equatorial Guinea to train police forces in appropriate human rights practices. In 2006, [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] hailed Obiang as a "good friend" despite repeated criticism of his human rights and civil liberties record. The [[US Agency for International Development]] entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Obiang, in April 2006, to establish a Social Development Fund in the country, implementing projects in the areas of health, education, women's affairs and the environment.<ref>{{cite web |author=Heather Layman, LPA |url=http://www.usaid.gov/press/releases/2006/pr060411_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605153348/http://www.usaid.gov/press/releases/2006/pr060411_2.html |archivedate=5 June 2011 |title=USAID and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea Agree to Unique Partnership for Development |publisher=Usaid.gov |date= 11 April 2006|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

In 2006, Obiang signed an anti-torture decree to ban all forms of abuse and improper treatment in Equatorial Guinea and he commissioned the renovation and modernization of Black Beach prison in 2007 to ensure the humane treatment of prisoners,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090802044807/http://www.mpri.com/esite/index.php/content/services/organizational_reform_amp_institutional_capacity_building/ Organizational Reform & Institutional Capacity-Building].

The anti-corruption lobby [[Transparency International]] has put Equatorial Guinea in the top 12 of its list of most corrupt states. Dismissing the international voices that call for more transparency, Obiang has for long held that oil revenues are a state secret. In 2008 the country became a candidate of the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative]] – an international project meant to promote openness about government oil revenues – but failed to qualify by an April 2010 deadline. The advocacy group [[Global Witness]] has been lobbying the United States to act against Obiang's son, Teodorin, who is vice-president and a government minister. It says there is credible evidence that he spent millions buying a [[Malibu, California]] mansion and private jet using corruptly acquired funds – grounds for denying him a visa. In February 2010, Equatorial Guinea signed a contract with the MPRI subsidiary of the US defense corporation [[L3 Communications]] for coastal surveillance and maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea.<ref>[http://jutiagroup.com/2010/04/05/tension-builds-in-the-gulf-of-guinea-as-competition-for-economic-resources-increases/ Tension Builds in the Gulf of Guinea as Competition for Economic Resources Increases].

Under Obiang, the basic infrastructure of Equatorial Guinea has improved. Asphalt now covers more than 80% of the national roads and ports and airports are being built by Chinese, Moroccan and French contractors across much of the country.<ref name="www1.voanews.com">[http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Equatorial-Guinea-Minister-Seeks-Strong-Ties-With-US-89956902.html Equatorial Guinea Minister Seeks Strong Ties With U.S].

In November 2011, a new constitution was approved. This constitution was voted although the text to be approved was not distributed nor was its content revealed to the public before the vote. Under the new constitution the president was limited to a maximum of two seven-year terms and he would be both the head of state and head of the government, therefore eliminating the figure of prime minister. The new constitution also introduced the figure of a vice president and it also called for the creation of a 70-member senate with 55 elected by the people and the 15 remaining designated by the president. Surprisingly, during the following cabinet reshuffle it was announced that there would be two vice-presidents in clear violation of the constitution that was just taking effect.<ref>[http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/noticia.php?id=2668&lang=en Ignacio Milam Tang, new Vice President of the Nation]. guineaecuatorialpress.com. 22 May 2012.</ref>

In October 2012, during an interview with Christiane Ammanpour on CNN, Obiang was asked whether he would step down at the end of the current term (2009–2016) since the new constitution limited the number of terms to two and he has been reelected at least 4 times before. Obiang answered he refused to step aside because the new constitution was not retroactive and the two term limit would only become applicable from 2016.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1210/05/ampr.01.html Interview with President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea]. CNN. 5 October 2012.</ref>

The 26 May 2013 elections combined the senate, lower house and mayoral contests all in a single package. This, as all the previous elections, was denounced by the opposition and it too was won by Obiang's PDGE. During the electoral contest, the ruling party decided to have their own internal elections which were later scrapped as none of the president's favorite candidates was leading the internal lists. At the end, the ruling party and its satellites of the ruling coalition decided to run not based on the candidates but based on the party. This created a situation where during the election the ruling party's coalition did not provide the names of their candidates so effectively individuals were not running for office, instead the party was the one running for office.

The May 2013 elections were marked by a series of events including the popular protest planned by a group of activists from the MPP (Movement of Popular Protest) which included several social and political groups. The MPP called for a peaceful protest at the Plaza de la Mujer square on 15 May. The MPP coordinator Enrique Nsolo Nzo was arrested and the official state media portrayed him as an individual who was planning to destabilize the country and depose the president. However, and despite speaking under duress and with clear signs of torture, Enrique clearly stated that they were planning a peaceful protest and had indeed obtained all the legal authorizations required to carry out the peaceful protest. In addition to that, and despite the repeated attempts of the state media to link Enrique to an illegal political party, he firmly stated that he was not affiliated with any political parties in the country. The Plaza de la Mujer square in Malabo was occupied by the police from 13 May and it has been heavily guarded ever since. The government embarked on a censorship program that affected social sites including Facebook and other websites that were critical to the government of Equatorial Guinea. In their censorship efforts, they would redirect all the searches performed online to the official government website.  
  
Shortly after the elections, the opposition party CPDS announced that they were going to protest peacefully against the 26 May elections on 25 June.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.cpds-gq.org/attachments/article/269/Comunicado_convocatoria_manifestacion.pdf |title = Convocatorial de Manifestacion, 25 de Junio 2013|work=cpds-gq.org }}</ref> The interior minister Clemente Engonga refused to authorize the protest on the grounds that such an event could "destabilize" the country and CPDS decided to go forward with the peaceful protest claiming it was a constitutional right. On the night of 24 June, the CPDS headquarters in Malabo were surrounded by heavily armed police officers in order to keep those inside from leaving and thus effectively blocking the protest. Several leading members of CPDS were detained in Malabo and others in Bata were kept from boarding several local flights to Malabo.

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Provinces of Equatorial Guinea}}
{{Provinces of Equatorial Guinea Image Map}}
Equatorial Guinea is divided into seven provinces (capitals appear in parentheses):

# [[Annobón Province]] ([[San Antonio de Palé]])
# [[Bioko Norte Province]] ([[Malabo]])
# [[Bioko Sur Province]] ([[Luba, Equatorial Guinea|Luba]])
# [[Centro Sur Province]] ([[Evinayong]])
# [[Kié-Ntem Province]] ([[Ebebiyín]])
# [[Litoral Province (Equatorial Guinea)|Litoral Province]] ([[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]])
# [[Wele-Nzas Province]] ([[Mongomo]])

The provinces are further divided into districts.

{{main|Economy of Equatorial Guinea}}

Pre-independence Equatorial Guinea exported [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], coffee and timber mostly to its colonial ruler, Spain, but also to Germany and the UK. On 1 January 1985, the country became the first non-[[wikt:Francophone|Francophone]] African member of the [[franc zone]], adopting the [[CFA franc|CFA]] as its currency. The national currency, the [[ekwele]], was previously linked to the [[Spanish peseta]].<ref name="web.archive.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.equatorialguinea.org/information1387/information.htm |title=Equatorial Guinea |publisher=equatorialguinea.org |accessdate=3 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991003081314/http://www.equatorialguinea.org/information1387/information.htm |archivedate=3 October 1999}}</ref>

The discovery of large [[oil reserves]] in 1996 and its subsequent exploitation have contributed to a dramatic increase in government revenue. As of 2004,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1101-2004Sep6.html |title=U.S. Oil Firms Entwined in Equatorial Guinea Deals |publisher=washingtonpost.com |author=Justin Blum |date=7 September 2004 |accessdate=9 July 2008}}</ref> Equatorial Guinea is the third-largest oil producer in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Its oil production has risen to {{convert|360000|oilbbl/d}}, up from 220,000 only two years earlier.

Forestry, farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence farming predominates. The deterioration of the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has diminished any potential for agriculture-led growth.

In July 2004, the [[United States Senate]] published an investigation into [[Riggs Bank]], a Washington-based bank into which most of Equatorial Guinea's oil revenues were paid until recently, and which also banked for [[Chile]]'s [[Augusto Pinochet]]. The Senate report, as to Equatorial Guinea, showed that at least $35 million were siphoned off by Obiang, his family and senior officials of his regime. The president has denied any wrongdoing. While Riggs Bank in February 2005 paid $9 million as restitution for its banking for Chile's Augusto Pinochet, no restitution was made with regard to Equatorial Guinea, as reported in detail in an Anti-Money Laundering Report from [[Inner City Press]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.innercitypress.org/finwatch.html |title=Inner City Press / Finance Watch: "Follow the Money, Watchdog the Regulators" |publisher=Innercitypress.org |date= |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

Equatorial Guinea is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] ([[OHADA]]).<ref name="ohada.com">{{cite web |title=OHADA.com: The business law portal in Africa |url=http://www.ohada.com/index.php |accessdate=22 March 2009 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Equatorial Guinea tried to become validated as an [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative|Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)]]–compliant country, working toward transparency in reporting of oil revenues and the prudent use of natural resource wealth. The country was one of thirty candidate countries and obtained candidate status on 22 February 2008. It was then required to meet a number of obligations to do so, including committing to working with civil society and companies on EITI implementation, appointing a senior individual to lead on EITI implementation, and publishing a fully costed Work Plan with measurable targets, a timetable for implementation and an assessment of capacity constraints. However, when Equatorial Guinea applied to extend the deadline for completing EITI validation, the EITI Board did not agree to the extension.<ref>[http://www.eitransparency.org/EquatorialGuinea Equatorial Guinea | EITI].

According to the [[World Bank]], Equatorial Guinea has the highest GNI (Gross National Income) per capita of any other Sub-Saharan country. It is 83 times larger than the GNI per capita of [[Burundi]] which is the poorest country.<ref>{{cite web | title= 50 Things You Didn't Know About Africa| work= [[World Bank]]| url= http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/polsc325-4.1-50-Things-you-didnt-know-about-Africa.pdf| accessdate= 7 May 2012}}</ref>

=== Transportation ===
{{main|Transport in Equatorial Guinea}}

Due to the large oil industry in the country, internationally recognized carriers fly to [[Malabo International Airport]] which, as of May 2014, had several direct connections to Europe and West Africa. There are only three airports in Equatorial Guinea: Malabo International Airport, [[Bata Airport]] and the new [[Annobon Airport]] on the island of [[Annobon]]. Malabo International Airport is the only international airport in the country. It is very hard to travel around Equatorial Guinea by plane. It's more usual to use a bus, taxi, boat (to travel from one of the islands to Rio Muni) and car.

Every airline registered in the country appears on the list of air carriers prohibited in the [[European Union]] (EU) which means that they are banned for safety reasons from operating services of any kind within the EU.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/doc/list_en.pdf List of banned EU air carriers].

The Fang constitute 80% of the population<ref>{{cite news |title=Equatorial Guinea's God|accessdate=26 May 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=26 July 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3098007.stm}}</ref> and comprise around 67 clans. Those in the northern part of [[Río Muni]] speak Fang-Ntumu, while those in the south speak Fang-Okah; the two dialects have differences but are mutually intelligible. Dialects of Fang are also spoken in parts of neighboring Cameroon (Bulu) and Gabon. These dialects, while still intelligible, are more distinct. The [[Bubi people|Bubi]], who constitute 15% of the population, are indigenous to Bioko Island. The traditional demarcation line between Fang and 'Beach' (inland) ethnic groups was the village of [[Niefang]] (limit of the Fang), east of Bata.

In addition, there are coastal ethnic groups, sometimes referred to as [[Ndowe]] or "Playeros" (''Beach People'' in Spanish): [[Combe people|Combes]], [[Bujeba people|Bujebas]], [[Balengue people|Balengues]], and [[Benga people|Bengas]] on the mainland and small islands, and [[Fernandinos]], a [[Sierra Leone Krio people|Krio]] community on Bioko Island. Together, these groups compose 5% of the population. Some Europeans (largely of Spanish or [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] descent) – among them mixed with African ethnicity – also live in the nation. Most Spaniards left after independence. There is a growing number of foreigners from neighboring [[Cameroon]], Nigeria, and [[Gabon]]. According to the ''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations'' (2002) 7% of Bioko islanders were [[Igbo people|Igbo]], an ethnic group from southeastern Nigeria.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: A-C |first=James|last=Minahan|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn= 0313321094 |page=330}}</ref> Equatorial Guinea received [[Asians]] and black Africans from other countries as workers on cocoa and coffee plantations. Other black Africans came from [[Liberia]], Angola, and [[Mozambique]]. Most of the Asian population is [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], with small numbers of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]].

Equatorial Guinea also allowed many fortune-seeking European settlers of other nationalities, including British, French and Germans. There is also a group of Israelis, and [[Moroccan people|Moroccans]]. After independence, thousands of Equatorial Guineans went to Spain. Another 100,000 Equatorial Guineans went to Cameroon, Gabon, and Nigeria because of the dictatorship of [[Francisco Macías Nguema]]. Some Equatorial Guinean communities are also to be found in Latin America, the United States, Portugal, and France.

For several years, the official languages were [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (the local variant is [[Equatoguinean Spanish]]) and [[French language|French]],<ref name=CIA/> Portuguese also being adopted as an official language later.<ref name="CPLP">{{cite web |url=http://www.cplp.org/id-258.aspx |title=Guiné Equatorial  |publisher=CPLP |accessdate=28 November 2014 | language = Portuguese}}</ref><ref name="sol"/> Spanish has been an official language since 1844. It is still the language of education and administration. 67.6% of Equatorial Guineans can speak it, especially those living in the capital, [[Malabo]].<ref name=obi>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080216191116/http://actualidad.terra.es/internacional/articulo/obiang_comunidad_naciones_1710388.htm Obiang convierte al portugués en tercer idioma oficial para entrar en la Comunidad lusófona de Naciones], ''Terra''. 13 July 2007</ref>

Aboriginal languages are recognized as integral parts of the "national culture" (Constitutional Law No. 1/1998 January 21).  Indigenous languages include [[Fang language|Fang]], [[Bube language|Bube]], [[Benga language|Benga]], [[Combe language|Ndowe]], [[Balengue language|Balengue]], [[Bujeba language|Bujeba]], Bissio, Gumu, [[Pichinglis]], [[Annobonese language|Fa d’Ambô]] and the nearly extinct [[Baseke language|Baseke]]. Most ethnic groups speak [[Bantu languages]]."<ref name="GEpress_noticia134en">[http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/noticia.php?id=134&lang=en Oficina de Información y Prensa de Guinea Ecuatorial, Ministerio de Información, Cultura y Turismo].

[[Annobonese language|Fa d’Ambô]], a Portuguese creole, has vigorous use in [[Annobón Province]], in Malabo (the capital), and with some speakers in Equatorial Guinea's mainland. Many speakers on Bioko can also speak Spanish and the local trade language [[Pichinglis]], an English creole. Spanish is not much spoken in Annobón. It is common in all domains except government and education where Spanish is used. Noncreolized Portuguese used as liturgical language by local Catholics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/fab |title=Fa d’Ambu |publisher=Ethnologue |accessdate=15 November 2010}}</ref> The Annobonese ethnic community pressured for membership in the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP). The government financed an [[International Portuguese Language Institute|Instituto Internacional da Língua Portuguesa]] (IILP) sociolinguistic study in Annobon, which noticed strong links with the Portuguese creole populations in São Tomé and Príncipe, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau.<ref name="sol"/>

Due to historical and cultural ties, the sovereign Afro-Iberian dimension of Equatorial Guinea as the territory was first explored by the Portuguese in the 15th century and a Portuguese possession until 1777, and the exceptional friendship ties with Brazil, São Tomé and Principe, Portugal and Cape Verde, a 2010 project of Constitutional Law amended article four of the [[Constitution of Equatorial Guinea]], which was enacted by the [[Chamber of People's Representatives]]. It established Portuguese as an official language of the Republic.

=== Education ===
{{Further|Education in Equatorial Guinea}}

Under the regime of Francisco Macias, education had been significantly neglected with few children receiving any type of education. Under President Obiang, the illiteracy rate dropped from 73% to 13%<ref name=CIA/> and the number of primary school students has risen from 65,000 in 1986 to more than 100,000 in 1994. Education is free and compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14.<ref name="web.archive.org"/>

The Equatorial Guinea government has also partnered with [[Hess Corporation]] and The Academy for Educational Development (AED) to establish a $20 million education program through which primary school teachers participate in a training program to teach modern child development techniques.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20081120025210/http://www.aed.org/News/Stories/equatorial_guinea_partnership.cfm HESS and AED Partner to Improve Education in Equatorial Guinea]. AED.org</ref> There are now 51 Model Schools. It is hoped the active pedagogy in the Model Schools will be a national reform.

In recent years, with change in economic/political climate and government social agendas, several cultural dispersion and literacy organizations are now located in the country, founded chiefly with the financial support of the Spanish government. The country has one university, the [[Universidad Nacional de Guinea Ecuatorial]] (UNGE) with a campus in Malabo and a Faculty of Medicine located in Bata on the mainland. In 2009 the university produced the first 110 national doctors.<ref name="www1.voanews.com"/> The Bata Medical School is supported principally by the government of Cuba and staffed by Cuban medical educators and physicians. However, it is predicted that Equatorial Guinea will have enough national doctors in the country to be self-sufficient within the next five years.<ref name="www1.voanews.com"/>

In June 1984, the First Hispanic-African Cultural Congress was convened to explore the cultural identity of Equatorial Guinea. The congress constituted the center of integration and the marriage of the Hispanic culture with African cultures.<ref name="web.archive.org"/>

=== Media and communications ===
{{main|Media in Equatorial Guinea|Telecommunications in Equatorial Guinea}}

The principal means of communication within Equatorial Guinea are three state-operated [[FM radio]] stations. [[BBC World Service]], [[Radio France Internationale]] and Gabon-based Africa No 1 broadcast on FM in Malabo. There are also five [[shortwave]] radio stations. Television Nacional, the television network, is state operated.<ref name=CIA/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1023151.stm#media |title=Country Profile: Equatorial Guinea: Media |publisher=BBC News |date=26 January 2008}}</ref> The international TV programme RTVGE is available via satellites in Africa, Europa, and the Americas and worldwide via Internet.<ref name="Lyngsat_TVGE">{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/tvchannels/gq/TVGE-Internacional.html |title=TVGE Internacional |publisher=LyngSat |accessdate=28 March 2012}}</ref> There are two newspapers and two magazines.

Equatorial Guinea ranks at position 161 out of 179 countries in the 2012 [[Reporters Without Borders]] press freedom index. The watchdog says the national broadcaster obeys the orders of the information ministry. A "news blackout" was imposed on reporting of uprisings in Arab states in North Africa in 2011, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Most of the media companies practice heavy [[self-censorship]], and are banned by law from criticising public figures. The state-owned media and the main private radio station are under the directorship of the president's son, Teodor Obiang.

Landline telephone penetration is low, with only two lines available for every 100 persons.<ref name=CIA/> There is one [[GSM]] mobile telephone operator, with coverage of [[Malabo]], [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]], and several mainland cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsmworld.com/roaming/gsminfo/cou_gq.shtml |title=GSMWorld Providers: Equatorial Guinea |publisher=GSM World |year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsmworld.com/cgi-bin/ni_map.pl?cc=gq&net=ge |title=GSMWorld GETESA Coverage Map |publisher=GSM World |year=2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref> {{As of|2009}}, approximately 40% of the population subscribed to mobile telephone services.<ref name=CIA/> The only telephone provider in Equatorial Guinea is Orange.

There were more than 42,000 internet users by December 2011.

=== Music ===
{{Further|Music of Equatorial Guinea}}

There is little [[popular music]] coming out of Equatorial Guinea.  Pan-African styles like [[soukous]] and [[makossa]] are popular, as are [[reggae]] and [[rock and roll]].  Acoustic guitar bands based on a Spanish model are the country's best-known indigenous popular tradition.

=== Sports ===

Equatorial Guinea was chosen to co-host the [[2012 African Cup of Nations]] in partnership with [[Gabon]], and hosted the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations|2015 edition]]. The country was also chosen to host the [[2008 Women's African Football Championship]], which they won.
