The term was used to distinguish those ecclesias in fellowship with the Birmingham (Central) ecclesia from those in the &quot;Suffolk Street fellowship&quot;. By 1939 the word &quot;Birmingham&quot; was dropped and the term &quot;Central fellowship&quot; was thereafter used with some regularity (342 times between 1939 and 2000) in<space/><italics><link><target>The Christadelphian</target></link></italics><space/>magazine</extension><space/>named after the Birmingham Central ecclesia. This was formed in 19571958 as a result of a reunion between the Temperance Hall and Suffolk Street fellowships in the UK. The<space/><italics>Suffolk Street fellowship</italics><space/>had formed in 1885 over the<space/><link><target>Biblical inspiration</target><part>inspiration</part></link><space/>of the Bible. Robert Ashcroft, a leading member, wrote an article which challenged Christadelphian belief in<space/><link><target>Wiktionary:plenary</target><part>plenary</part></link><space/>inspiration and which, although he himself left, led to a division in the main body. One group formed a new ecclesia which later met in Suffolk Street, Birmingham. Other ecclesias throughout the world which supported them became known as the &quot;Suffolk Street fellowship&quot; to distinguish them from the group they had separated from, which became known as the &quot;Temperance Hall fellowship&quot;. The main magazine of this group from 18841957 was<space/><italics>The Fraternal Visitor</italics>, whose editors included J.J. Bishop and J.J. Hadley (d. 1912), then<space/><link><target>Thomas Turner (metallurgist)</target><part>Thomas Turner</part></link>, and finally Cyril Cooper (till reunion in 1957). Reunion in the United Kingdom (Temperance Hall-Suffolk Street) was closely followed by reunion in Australia in 1958 between the Shield fellowship (aligned with the Suffolk Street fellowship) and the Central fellowship on the basis of an understanding of the atonement expressed in a document called the Cooper-Carter Addendum (to the BASF).
