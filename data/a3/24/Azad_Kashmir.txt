Azad Kashmir is part of the greater [[Kashmir]] region, which is the subject of [[Kashmir conflict|a long-running conflict]] between India and Pakistan.

The territory also borders Pakistan's [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province to the south and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province to the west. To the east, Azad Kashmir is separated from the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir by the [[Line of Control]], the ''de facto'' border between India and Pakistan. Azad Kashmir has a total area of {{convert|13297|km2|sqmi}}, with an estimated population of around 4.6 million people.

The territory has a parliamentary form of government, with its capital located at [[Muzaffarabad]]. The [[President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir]] is the constitutional head of the state, while [[Prime Minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir|the prime minister]], supported by a Council of Ministers, is the chief executive. The unicameral [[Azad Jammu & Kashmir Legislative Assembly]] elects both the prime minister and president. The state has its own Supreme Court and a High Court, while the [[Government of Pakistan]]'s Ministry of Kashmir Affairs serves as a link between it and Azad Kashmir's government. Neither Azad Kashmir nor Gilgit-Baltistan elect members to Pakistan's [[National Assembly (Pakistan)|National Assembly]].

[[2005 Kashmir earthquake|A 2005 earthquake]] killed 100,000 people and left another three million people displaced, with widespread devastation. Since then, with help from the Government of Pakistan and foreign donors, reconstruction of infrastructure is underway. Azad Kashmir's economy largely depends on agriculture, services, tourism, and remittances sent by members of the [[British Mirpuri]] community. The territory's official language is [[Urdu language|Urdu]], although [[Pahari language|Pahari]], [[Hindko language|Hindko]], [[Gojri language|Gojri]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] are also spoken.

==History==
{{Main|History of Azad Kashmir}}

[[File:Kashmir region 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the entire Kashmir region]]
At the time of the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, the British abandoned their [[suzerainty]] over the [[princely states]], which were left with the options of joining India or Pakistan or remaining independent. Wanting  his state to remain independent, [[Hari Singh]], the [[maharaja]] of Jammu and Kashmir, signed a stand-still agreement with Pakistan and delayed his final decision in an effort to remain independent.<ref>

In Spring 1947, an uprising against the Maharaja broke out in [[Poonch district, Pakistan|Poonch]], an area bordering the [[Rawalpindi division]] of [[West Punjab]]. Maharaja's administration is said to have started levying punitive taxes on the peasantry which provoked a local revolt and the administration resorted to brutal suppression. The area's population, swelled by recently demobilised soldiers following [[World War II]], rebelled against the Maharaja's forces and gained control of almost the entire district. Following this victory, the pro-Pakistan chieftains of the western Jammu districts of [[Muzaffarabad district|Muzaffarabad]], Poonch and [[Mirpur district|Mirpur]] proclaimed a provisional Azad Jammu and Kahmir government in Rawalpindi on 3{{nbsp}}October 1947.{{sfn|Bose|2003|pp=32-33}}

On 21{{nbsp}}October, several thousand [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen from [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] poured into Jammu and Kashmir to liberate it from the Maharaja's rule. They were led by experienced military leaders and were equipped with modern arms. The Maharaja's crumbling forces were unable to withstand the onslaught. The raiders captured the towns of Muzaffarabad and [[Baramulla]], the latter {{convert|20|mi}} northwest of the state capital [[Srinagar]]. On 24{{nbsp}}October, the Maharaja requested military assistance from India, which responded that it was unable to help him unless he acceded to India. Accordingly, on 26{{nbsp}}October 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh signed an [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]], handing over control of defence, external affairs and communications to the Government of India in return for military aid.<ref>http://www.bbc.com/news/10537286</ref> Indian troops were immediately airlifted into Srinagar.{{sfn|Bose|2003|pp=35-36}} Pakistan intervened subsequently.<ref name = britannica /> Fighting ensued between the Indian and Pakistani armies, with the two areas of control more or less stabilised around what is now known as the "[[Line of Control]]".<ref>

India later approached the United Nations, asking it to resolve the dispute, and resolutions were passed in favour of the holding of a plebiscite with regard to Kashmir's future. However, no such plebiscite has ever been held on either side, since there was a precondition which required the withdrawal of the Pakistani Army along with the non-state elements and the subsequent partial withdrawal of the Indian Army.<ref name="UN Resolution 47">

</ref> In 1949, a formal cease-fire line separating the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir came into effect.

Following the 1949 cease-fire agreement, the government of Pakistan divided the northern and western parts of Kashmir that it occupied at the time of cease-fire into the following two separately-controlled political entities:
* Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK)&nbsp;– the narrow, southern part, {{convert|250|mi|km}} long, with a width varying from {{convert|10|to|40|mi|km}}.
* [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] formerly called the [[Federally Administered Northern Areas]] (FANA)&nbsp;– the much larger political entity to the north of AJK with an area of {{convert|72496|km2|sqmi}}. It was directly administered by Pakistan as ''a de facto'' dependent territory, i.e., a non-self-governing territory. However, it was ostensibly granted "full autonomy" on 29{{nbsp}}August 2009.<ref>

</ref>

At one time under Pakistani control, Kashmir's [[Trans-Karakoram Tract|Shaksgam tract]], a small region along the northeastern border of Gilgit–Baltistan, was provisionally ceded by Pakistan to the People's Republic of China in 1963 and now forms part of China's [[Xinjiang]] Uygur Autonomous Region.

In 1972, the then current border between the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of Kashmir was designated as the "[[Line of Control]]". This line has remained unchanged<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unmogip/|title= UNMOGIP: United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan}}
</ref> since the 1972 [[Simla Agreement]], which bound the two countries "to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations". Some political experts claim that, in view of that pact, the only solution to the issue is mutual negotiation between the two countries without involving a third party such as the United Nations.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Government==

[[File:Muzaffarabad Azad Kashmir.svg|thumb|150px|Districts of Azad Kashmir]]
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) is a self-governing state under Pakistani control, but under [[Constitution of Pakistan|Pakistan's constitution]] the state is not formally a part of the country as the dispute on Azad Kashmir has not yet been resolved. Pakistan is administering the region as a self-governing territory rather than incorporating it in the federation since the UN mandated ceasefire.<ref name=brit/><ref name=ajk144/> Azad Kashmir has its own elected [[President]], [[Prime Minister]], [[Legislative Assembly]], [[High Court]], with Khawaja Shahad Ahmad as its present chief justice, and official flag.  The government of Pakistan has not yet allowed Azad Kashmir to issue its own postage stamps, meaning that those of Pakistan are used instead. [[Brad Adams]] the Asia director at the [[U.S.]] based [[NGO]] [[Human Rights Watch]] has said in 2006 <blockquote>Although ‘azad’ means ‘free,’ the residents of Azad Kashmir are anything but, The Pakistani authorities govern Azad Kashmir with strict controls on basic freedoms.<ref name=Adams>

==Geography and climate==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}

[[File:Azad Kashmir Landscape.JPG|thumbnail|Landscape of Azad kashmir]]
The northern part of Azad Jammu and Kashmir encompasses the lower part of the [[Himalayas]], including Jamgarh Peak (15,531 feet [4,734 meters]). However, Sarwali peak in the [[Neelum Valley]] is the highest peak in the state.<ref>http://www.pakistanalpine.com/sarwali-peak</ref> Fertile, green, mountainous valleys are characteristic of Azad Kashmir's geography, making it one of the most beautiful regions on the subcontinent.<ref name=brit/>

The southern parts of Azad Kashmir including Bhimber, Mirpur and Kotli districts has extremely hot weather in summers and moderate cold weather in winters. It receives rains mostly in [[monsoon]] weather.
[[File:Rice Cultivaiton in Leepa AJK.jpg|thumbnail|Paddy field in Leepa valley]]
In the central and northern parts of state weather remains moderate hot in summers and very cold and chilly in winter. Snow fall also occurs there in December and January.

This region receives rainfall in both winters and summers. [[Muzaffarabad]] and Pattan are among the wettest areas of the state. Throughout most of the region, the average rainfall exceeds 1400&nbsp;mm, with the highest average rainfall occurring near Muzaffarabad (around 1800&nbsp;mm). During summer, monsoon floods of the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]] and Leepa rivers are common, due to high rainfall and melting snow.

==Culture==
The culture of Azad Kashmir has many similarities to that of northern Punjabi ([[Pothohar Plateau|Potohar]]) culture in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province. The natives of Azad Kashmir speak [[Urdu]], [[Potwari language|Potwari]], and the [[Pahari languages]]. The traditional dress of the women is the [[shalwar kameez]] in Pahari style. The shalwar kameez is commonly worn by both men and women. Women use shawl to cover their head and upper body.
The popular and traditional cuisines of Azad Kashmir are Raan (Fried leg of Lamb), Rogan Josh, Balti Gosht, Dal Chawal (A mixture of [[split peas]], split red lentils, and boiled rice), and Dam Aloo (Fried Potatoes). The traditional drink of the region is tea.

==Ethnic groups==
{{Main|Demographics of Azad Kashmir}}

Azad Jammu and Kashmir is almost entirely Muslim. This inhabitants of this region comprise of many communities and tribes who share ethnic and linguistic similarities with the people of [[Pothohar Plateau|Northern Punjab]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Azad Kashmir}}
[[File:Sharda Kashmir.jpg|thumb|Neelum valley is a popular tourist destination in Azad Kashmir.]]
Historically the economy of these areas now called ‘Azad’ Kashmir has been agricultural which meant that land was the main source or mean of production. This means that all food for immediate and long term consumption was produced from land. The produce included various crops, Fruits, Vegetables etc. Land was also the source of other livelihood necessities such as wood, fuel, grazing for animals which then turned into dairy products. Because of this land was also the main source of revenue for the governments whose primary purpose for centuries was to accumulate revenue.<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.pndajk.gov.pk/history.asp|title= History of Planning & Development Department in AJK}}
</ref>

Agriculture is a major part of Azad Kashmir's economy. Low-lying areas that have high populations grow crops like [[barley]], [[mango]]es, [[millet]], [[maize|corn]] (maize), and wheat, and also raise cattle. In the elevated areas that are less populated and more spread-out, forestry, corn, and livestock are the main sources of income. There are mineral and marble resources in Azad Kashmir close to [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Muzaffarabad]]. There are also graphite deposits at Mohriwali. There are also reservoirs of low-grade coal, [[chalk]], [[bauxite]], and [[zircon]]. Local household industries produce carved wooden objects, textiles, and dhurrie carpets.<ref name=brit/> There is also an arts and crafts industry that produces such cultural goods as namdas, shawls, pashmina, pherans, [[Papier-mâché]], basketry copper, rugs, wood carving, silk and woolen clothing, patto, carpets, namda gubba, and silverware. Agricultural goods produced in the region include mushrooms, honey, walnuts, apples, cherries, medicinal herbs and plants, resin, deodar, kail, chir, fir, maple, and ash timber.<ref name=brit/><ref name=ajk144/><ref>

The migration to UK was accelerated and by the completion of [[Mangla Dam]] in 1967 the process of ‘[[chain migration]]’ became in full flow. Today, remittances from [[British Mirpuri]] community make a critical role in AJK's economy. In the mid-1950s various economic and social development processes were launched in Azad Kashmir. In the 1960s, with the construction of the [[Mangla Dam]] in [[Mirpur District]], the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government began to receive royalties from the Pakistani government for the electricity that the dam provided to Pakistan. During the mid-2000s, a multi-billion dollar reconstruction began in the aftermath of the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]].<ref name="dawn.com">

</ref>

In addition to agriculture, textiles, and arts and crafts, remittances have played a major role in the economy of Azad Kashmir. One analyst estimated that the figure for Azad Kashmir was 25.1% in 2001. With regard to annual household income, people living in the higher areas are more dependent on remittances than are those living in the lower areas.<ref>

</ref> In the latter part of 2006, billions of dollars for development were mooted by [[international aid agencies]] for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of earthquake-hit zones in Azad Kashmir, though much of that amount was subsequently lost in bureaucratic channels, leading to considerable delays in help getting to the most needy. Hundreds of people continued to live in tents long after the earthquake.<ref name="dawn.com"/> A land-use plan for the city of [[Muzaffarabad]] was prepared by the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]].
