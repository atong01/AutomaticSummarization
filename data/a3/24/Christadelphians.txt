The '''Christadelphians''' are a [[millenarian]] [[Christianity|Christian]] group who hold a view of [[Biblical Unitarianism]]. There are approximately 50,000 Christadelphians in around 120 countries.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/christadelphians_1.shtml</ref> The movement developed in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[North America]] in the 19th century around the teachings of [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]], who coined the name ''Christadelphian''<ref name="BRWname">'The Christadelphians, or brethren in Christ...The very name 'Christadelphian' was coined by the founder of the movement, John Thomas, at the time of the American Civil War principally to provide a distinctive nomenclature for the use of the civil authorities [...] At the time of the American Civil War, Thomas coined a name for his followers: Christadelphian -- brethren in Christ. The exigencies of the situation in which the civil authorities had sought to impress men into the armed forces had accelerated the tendency for those religious bodies objecting to military service to become ore definite in their teaching and conditions of membership.'

Basing their beliefs solely on the [[Bible]], Christadelphians differ from mainstream [[Christianity]] in a number of doctrinal areas. For example, they reject the [[Trinity]] and the [[immortality of the soul]], believing these to be corruptions of original Christian teaching. They were initially found predominantly in the developed English-speaking world, but expanded in developing countries after the Second World War. Congregations traditionally are referred to as 'ecclesias' and would not use the word "church" due to its association with mainstream Christianity, although today it is more acceptable.<ref>http://www.christadelphianresearch.com/achristadelphianchurch.htm</ref>

== History ==

=== 19th century ===

The Christadelphian religious group traces its origins to [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]] (1805–1871), who migrated to North America from England in 1832.<ref name="ch3">{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/Bereans/Cornerstones/Pioneers/Life/toc.html |title=Dr Thomas: His Life and Work. Chapter 3: Emigration to America |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  Following a near shipwreck he vowed to find out the truth about [[human existence|life]] and God through personal [[Bible study (Christian)|Biblical study]].<ref name="ch3"/> Initially he sought to avoid the kind of [[sectarianism]] he had seen in England. In this he found sympathy with the rapidly emerging [[Restoration Movement]] in the United States of America at the time. This movement sought for a reform based upon the [[Sola scriptura|Bible alone]] as a sufficient guide and rejected all [[creed]]s. However this liberality eventually led to dissent as John Thomas developed in his personal beliefs and started to question mainstream orthodox Christian beliefs.  Whilst the Restoration Movement accepted Thomas's right to have his own beliefs, when he started preaching that they were essential to [[salvation]], it led to a fierce series of debates with a notable [[leadership|leader]] of the movement, [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]].  John Thomas believed that scripture, as God's word, did not support a multiplicity of differing beliefs, and challenged the leaders to continue with the process of restoring 1st-century Christian beliefs and correct interpretation through a process of debate.  The history of this process appears in the book ''Dr. Thomas, His Life and Work'' (1873) by a Christadelphian, [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]].<ref>

During this period of formulating his ideas John Thomas was [[baptism|baptised]] twice,<ref>
John Thomas was baptised by Walter Scott of the Disciples of Christ in 1832 and again in 1847 (probably by John Tomline Walsh, according to Peter Hemingray ''John Thomas—His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p.145) after publishing ''A Confession and Abjuration'' in which he renounced previously held beliefs as false.</ref> the second time after renouncing the beliefs he previously held. He based his new position on a new appreciation for the reign of Christ on David's throne.<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.antipas.org/books/faith_in_last_days/fld_014.html |title=Faith In The Last Days |publisher=Antipas.org |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> The abjuration of his former beliefs eventually led to the Restoration Movement disfellowshipping him when he toured England and they became aware of his abjuration in the United States of America.

The Christadelphian community in Britain effectively dates from Thomas's first lecturing tour (May 1848 – October 1850). His message was particularly welcomed in Scotland, and [[Campbellite]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Adventist]] friends separated to form groups of "Baptised Believers". Two thirds of ecclesias, and members, in Britain before 1864 were in Scotland.<ref>Wilson, AB op cit</ref><ref>Evans, Christmas. The Christadelphian 1956–63
</ref><ref>Norrie, William "Early History of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God in Britain" Earlston 1904. Available [http://www.christadelphianresearch.com/theearlyhistorynorrie.htm online]
</ref> In 1849, during his tour of Britain, he completed (a decade and a half before the name ''Christadelphian'' was conceived) ''[[Elpis Israel]]''<ref>
John Thomas, ''Elpis Israel: an exposition of the Kingdom of God with reference to the time of the end and the age to come'' (London: 1849). Available [http://www.thechristadelphian.com/books/readonline/elpisisrael/default.html online]
{{dead link|date=December 2013|bot=WildBot}}</ref> in which he laid out his understanding of the main doctrines of the Bible.{{wikisource|Elpis Israel}} Since his medium for bringing change was print and debate, it was natural for the origins of the Christadelphian body to be associated with books and journals, such as Thomas's ''Herald of the Kingdom''.

In his desire to seek to establish Biblical truth and test out orthodox Christian beliefs through independent scriptural study he was not alone and, amongst other churches, he also had links with [[Adventist]] movement and with [[Benjamin Wilson (Biblical scholar)|Benjamin Wilson]] (who later set up the [[Church of the Blessed Hope|Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith]] in the 1860s). In terms of his rejection of the trinity, Thomas' views had certain similarities with the unitarianism which had developed in a formal way in Europe in the 16th century (although he formally described both Unitarianism and Socinianism as "works of the devil" for their failure to develop his doctrine of God-manifestation).<ref>Thomas, J. (1869). Phanerosis: An Exposition of the Doctrine of the Old and New Testaments, concerning the Manifestation of the Invisible Eternal God in Human Nature. Birmingham: published by Robert Roberts, p. 11.</ref> See [[History of Unitarianism]]

Although the Christadelphian movement originated through the activities of John Thomas, he never saw himself as making his own disciples. He believed rather that he had rediscovered 1st-century beliefs from the Bible alone,<ref>
'The Lecturer [John Thomas] commenced by denying a statement which had appeared in many of the London and country newspapers, and amongst them, one made by a religious Editor in this town, to the effect that he assumed to himself the true, infallible, prophetic character, as one sent from God, ''verbatim''. He would appeal to his writings -- and he had written a great deal in twelve years -- and to his speeches, whether he had ever claimed to be such, in the remotest degree whatever. He believed truth as it was taught in the scriptures of truth...' {{cite news

</ref> and sought to prove that through a process of challenge and debate and writing journals. Through that process a number of people became convinced and set up various fellowships that had sympathy with that position. Groups associated with John Thomas met under various names, including Believers, Baptised Believers, the Royal Association of Believers, Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God, Nazarines (or Nazarenes) and The Antipas<ref name = "anrvrv"/> until the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865). At that time, church affiliation was required in the [[United States]] and in the Confederacy in order to register for [[conscientious objector]] status, and in 1864 Thomas chose for registration purposes the name ''Christadelphian''.<ref name="BRWname"/><ref name="StrongName"/><ref name="ourname"/><ref name="LippyName"/>

Through the teaching of John Thomas and the need in the American Civil War for a name, the Christadelphians emerged as a denomination, but they were formed into a lasting structure through a passionate follower of Thomas's interpretation of the Bible, [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]]. In 1864 he began to publish ''The Ambassador of the Coming Age'' magazine. This was renamed ''[[The Christadelphian]]''<ref>Bryan R. Wilson, ''Sects and Society'' (London: William Heinemann, 1961), p. 241</ref> in 1869 and continues to be published under that name.<ref>
''The Christadelphian'' is published by The Christadelphian Magazine & Publishing Association Ltd (Birmingham, UK)
</ref> Roberts was prominent in the period following the death of John Thomas in 1871, and helped craft the structures of the Christadelphian body.<ref>
Andrew Wilson writes of Roberts that "The organising ability of Robert Roberts was very important: he gave the movement its rules, institutions and much of its literature". Andrew Wilson, ''History of the Christadelphians 1864–1885: the emergence of a denomination'' 1997 p.399.</ref>

Robert Roberts was certain that John Thomas had rediscovered the truth. Robert Robert's life was characterised by debates over issues that arose within the fledgling organisation; some of these debates can be found in the book ''Robert Roberts—A study of his life and character'' by Islip Collyer.

Initially the denomination grew in the English-speaking world, particularly in the [[English Midlands]] and in parts{{which|date=October 2013}} of North America. In the early days after the death of John Thomas the group could have moved in a number of directions. Doctrinal issues arose, debates took place and statements of faith were created and amended as other issues arose. These attempts were felt necessary by many{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} to both settle and define a doctrinal stance for the newly emerging denomination and to keep out error. As a result of these debates, several groups separated from the main body of Christadelphians, most notably the Suffolk Street fellowship and the Unamended fellowship.

=== 20th century ===
The Christadelphian position on conscientious objection came to the fore with the introduction of conscription during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Varying degrees of exemption from military service were granted to Christadelphians in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In the Second World War, this frequently required the person seeking exemption to undertake civilian work under the direction of the authorities.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the Christadelphians in Britain assisted in the [[Kindertransport]], helping to relocate several hundred Jewish children away from Nazi persecution and founding a hostel [[Elpis Lodge]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Kinderball piano score |publisher=Imperial War Museum |url=http://london.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1463 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060127013116/http://london.iwm.org.uk:80/server/show/ConWebDoc.1463 |archivedate=27 January 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Morrell | first=Leslie | title =The Christadelphian Response to the Holocaust | url = http://lesliemorrell.com/papers/Response.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =2008-02-08 }}</ref> In Germany the small Christadelphian community founded by [[Albert Maier]] went underground from 1940–1945, and a leading brother, [[Albert Merz]], was imprisoned as a conscientious objector and later executed.<ref>April 1941 in Berlin.Bogner, Gustav. Geschichte der Christadelphians in Deutschland (2) http://www.projekt-glauben.de/?p=205</ref>

After the Second World War, moves were taken to try to reunite various of the earlier divisions. By the end of the 1950s, most Christadelphians had united into one community, but there are still a number of small groups who remain separate.

=== Today ===
The post-war, and post-reunions, period saw an increase in co-operation and interaction between ecclesias, resulting in the establishment of a number of week-long Bible schools and the formation of national and [[international]] organisations such as the Christadelphian Bible Mission<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbm.org.uk/cbm2histo.htm |title=History of the Christadelphian Bible Mission |publisher=Cbm.org.uk |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> (for preaching and pastoral support overseas), the Christadelphian Support Network<ref>see http://www.chsn.org.uk http://www.caregroup.org.au http://www.caringnetwork.ca</ref> (for counselling), and the [[Meal-a-Day Fund|Christadelphian Meal-A-Day Fund]] (for charity and humanitarian work).

The period following the reunions was accompanied by expansion in the developing world, which now accounts for around 40% of Christadelphians.<ref>Based on figures from ''CBM Worldwide Guide 2006'', Christadelphian Bible Mission (UK), 2006</ref>

== Organisation ==

=== General organization ===
In the absence of centralised organization, some differences exist amongst Christadelphians on matters of belief and practice.  This is because each congregation (commonly styled 'ecclesias') is organized [[wiktionary:autonomous|autonomously]], typically following common practices which have altered little since the 19th century. Most ecclesias have a constitution,<ref>Example: [http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/constitution.htm Constitution of the Birmingham Christadelphian Ecclesia, Midland Institute] c.1932-onwards</ref> which includes a 'Statement of Faith', a list of 'Doctrines to be Rejected' and a formalized list of 'The Commandments of Christ'.<ref>This list as published by [[The Christadelphian Magazine]] contains 53 paraphrases of Bible verses which were originally read weekly as part of the service at Temperance Hall ecclesia. Other versions, of unconfirmed origin, exist with the list expanded to 100 including some verses justifying division.</ref> With no central authority individual congregations are responsible for maintaining orthodoxy in belief and practice, and the statement of faith is seen by many as useful to this end. The statement of faith acts as the official standard of most ecclesias to determine fellowship within and between ecclesias, and as the basis for co-operation between ecclesias. Congregational discipline and conflict resolution are applied using various forms of consultation, mediation, and discussion, with disfellowship (similar to [[excommunication]]) being the final response to those with unorthodox practices or beliefs.<ref>Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 32, 35–36</ref>

The relative uniformity of organization and practice is undoubtedly due to the influence of a booklet, written early in Christadelphian history by Robert Roberts, called ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias''.<ref name="online">Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883). Available [http://www.thechristadelphians.org/htm/books/guide/index.html online]
</ref> It recommends a basically democratic arrangement by which congregational members elect 'brothers' to arranging and serving duties,<ref>Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 17–27</ref> and includes guidelines for the organization of committees, as well as conflict resolution between congregational members and between congregations.<ref>Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 35–38, 41–42</ref> Christadelphians do not have paid [[minister of religion|ministers]]. Male members are assessed by the congregation for their eligibility to teach and perform other duties, which are usually assigned on a rotation basis, as opposed to having a permanently appointed preacher. Congregational governance typically follows a [[democracy|democratic]] model, with an elected arranging committee for each individual ecclesia. This unpaid committee is responsible for the day-to-day running of the ecclesia and is answerable to the rest of the ecclesia's members.

Inter-ecclesial organizations co-ordinate the running of, among other things, Christadelphian schools<ref>For example: Christadelphian [[Heritage College (Cooranbong)|Heritage College, Cooranbong]] and Christadelphian [[Heritage College (Sydney)|Heritage College Sydney]], Kemps Creek.</ref> and elderly care homes, the [[Christadelphian Isolation League]] (which cares for those prevented by distance or infirmity from attending an ecclesia regularly) and the publication of [[:Category:Christadelphian magazines|Christadelphian magazines]].

=== Adherents ===
No official membership figures are published, but the [[Columbia Encyclopedia]] gives an estimated figure of 50,000 Christadelphians.<ref name="exrydu">[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/Christad 'Christadelphians'], ''The Columbia Encyclopedia''</ref> They are spread across approximately 120 countries;<ref name = "xbcrcq">''CBM Worldwide Guide 2006'', Christadelphian Bible Mission (UK), 2006</ref> there are established churches (often referred to as ''ecclesias'') in many of those countries,<ref>''Ecclesias Around the World'' from [http://www.christadelphia.org/ecclesia.htm Christadelphia World Wide]</ref> along with isolated members.

This puts the total figure at around 67,000.

=== Fellowships ===
The Christadelphian body consists of a number of ''fellowships'' - groups of ecclesias which associate with one another, often to the exclusion of ecclesias outside their group. They are to some degree localised. The Unamended Fellowship, for example, exists only in North America. Christadelphian fellowships have often been named after ecclesias or magazines who took a lead in developing a particular stance.

The majority of Christadelphians (around 60,000<ref>Estimate from CALS directory and national statistics in the Adherents section of this article.</ref>) belong to ''Central fellowship'',<ref name="Birmingham 1933, p. 376">The first use of the term "Birmingham (Central) fellowship" in ''The Christadelphian'' magazine was in volume 70, 1933, p. 376. The term was used to distinguish those ecclesias in fellowship with the Birmingham (Central) ecclesia from those in the "Suffolk Street fellowship". By 1939 the word "Birmingham" was dropped and the term "Central fellowship" was thereafter used with some regularity (342 times between 1939 and 2000) in ''[[The Christadelphian]]'' magazine</ref> named after the Birmingham Central ecclesia. This was formed in 1957–1958 as a result of a reunion between the Temperance Hall and Suffolk Street fellowships in the UK. The ''Suffolk Street fellowship'' had formed in 1885 over the [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]] of the Bible. Robert Ashcroft, a leading member, wrote an article which challenged Christadelphian belief in [[Wiktionary:plenary|plenary]] inspiration and which, although he himself left, led to a division in the main body. One group formed a new ecclesia which later met in Suffolk Street, Birmingham. Other ecclesias throughout the world which supported them became known as the "Suffolk Street fellowship" to distinguish them from the group they had separated from, which became known as the "Temperance Hall fellowship". The main magazine of this group from 1884–1957 was ''The Fraternal Visitor'', whose editors included J.J. Bishop and J.J. Hadley (d. 1912), then [[Thomas Turner (metallurgist)|Thomas Turner]], and finally Cyril Cooper (till reunion in 1957). Reunion in the United Kingdom (Temperance Hall-Suffolk Street) was closely followed by reunion in Australia in 1958 between the Shield fellowship (aligned with the Suffolk Street fellowship) and the Central fellowship on the basis of an understanding of the atonement expressed in a document called the Cooper-Carter Addendum (to the BASF). The Central fellowship in North America is often referred to as the ''[[Amended Christadelphians|Amended fellowship]]''.

The ''[[Unamended Christadelphians|Unamended fellowship]]'', consisting of around 1,850 members, is found in East Coast and Midwest USA and Ontario, Canada.<ref>Verified figure, Ecclesial Directory 2006. Parts of grouping currently involved in unity talks with Central.</ref> This group separated in 1898 as a result of differing views on who would be raised to judgment at the return of Christ. The majority of Christadelphians believe that the judgment will include anyone who had sufficient knowledge of the gospel message, and is not limited to baptized believers.<ref>The Sydney Ecclesia, Australia had already "disfellowshipped" 10 members for denying this in 1883. The Christadelphian Magazine 1884, ecclesial news p.90 and editorial comment p.382</ref> The majority in Britain, Australia and North America amended their statement of faith accordingly. Those who opposed the amendment became known as the "Unamended fellowship" and allowed the teaching that God either could not or would not raise those who had no covenant relationship with him. Opinions vary as to what the established position was on this subject prior to the controversy.<ref>For example: [http://www.genusa.com/Truth/UnamendedErrors.html Website] claiming views held by Amended community were original Christadelphian beliefs Versus [http://www.republic-christadelphians.org/Unamended.html Website] claiming views held by Unamended community were original Christadelphian beliefs.</ref> Prominent in the formation of the Unamended fellowship was [[Thomas Williams (Christadelphian)|Thomas Williams]], editor of the Christadelphian Advocate magazine. The majority of the Unamended Fellowship outside North America joined the Suffolk Street fellowship before its eventual incorporation into Central fellowship. There is also some co-operation between the Central (Amended) and Unamended Fellowships in North America – most recently in the Great Lakes region, where numerous Amended and Unamended ecclesias have opened fellowship to one another despite the failure of wider attempts at re-union under the North American Statement of Understanding (NASU).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasu.ca |title=North American Statement of Understanding |publisher=Nasu.ca |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref>

The ''[[Berean Christadelphians|Berean Fellowship]]'' was formed in 1923 as a result of varying views on military service in Britain, and on the atonement in North America. The majority of the North American Bereans re-joined the main body of Christadelphians in 1952. A number continue as a separate community, numbering around 200 in Texas, 100 in Kenya and 30 in Wales.<ref>[http://www.bereanecclesialnews.com/ Berean Ecclesial News] entries, also [http://www.bereans.org Bereans] and [http://www.bereanchristadelphian.com/ Berean Christadelphians]</ref> Most of the divisions still in existence within the Christadelphian community today stem from further divisions of the Berean fellowship.<ref>Phillips, Jim, ''The Berean Christadelphians: Why the Bereans?''

In 1942 the Berean fellowship divided over marriage and divorce with the stricter party forming the ''Dawn fellowship''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Longman |url=http://www.dawnchristadelphian.co.uk/ |title=The Dawn Christadelphian Homepage |publisher=Dawnchristadelphian.co.uk |date=2007-01-05 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}<p>{{*}}{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnchristadelphians.org |title=A Dawn Christadelphian's Website |publisher=Dawnchristadelphians.org |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> Following union with the Lightstand fellowship in Australia in November 2007,<ref>The Dawn Christadelphian Magazine, January 2008</ref> there are now 800 members in the UK, Australia, Canada, India,  Jamaica, Poland, the Philippines and Russia.<ref>Estimate undergoing review.

The [[Church of the Blessed Hope|Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith (CGAF)]] has common origins with Christadelphians and shares Christadelphian beliefs.<ref>[http://cotbh.org/what-do-we-believe-teach/ Cleveland CBH statement of faith] [http://www.abrahamicfaithinniles.org/belief.php CGAF Niles statement of faith]</ref> Numbering around 400 (primarily Ohio and Florida, USA),<ref>From CGAF directory.</ref> they are welcomed into fellowship by some Christadelphians and are currently involved in unity talks.

According to [[Bryan Wilson]], functionally the definition of a "fellowship" within Christadelphian history has been mutual or unilateral exclusion of groupings of ecclesias from the breaking of bread.<ref>See Wilson op.cit.</ref> This functional definition still holds true in North America, where the Unamended fellowship and the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith are not received by most North American [[Amended Christadelphians|Amended]] ecclesias. But outside North America this functional definition no longer holds. Many articles and books on the doctrine and practice of fellowship now reject the notion itself of separate "fellowships" among those who recognise the same baptism, viewing such separations as schismatic.<ref>[http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/oates-pearce-1957-booklet-fellowship-and-withdrawal.doc Oates & Pearce ''Fellowship and Withdrawal'' (doc)] 1957<p>{{*}}[http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/whittaker_fellowship_1973.doc H.A.

{{wikisource|Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith}}They tend to operate organisationally fairly similarly, although there are different emphases. Despite their differences, the Central, Old Paths, Dawn<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnchristadelphians.org |title=Dawn Christadelphians |publisher=Dawn Christadelphians |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> and Berean<ref>[http://www.bereans.org/basf.html Bereans.org BASF] With some exceptions including the Lampasas Texas Berean Ecclesia. Some have an amendment in the Doctrines to be Rejected which prohibits a person being a police constable.</ref> fellowships generally subscribe to the ''Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith'' (BASF), though the latter two have additional clauses or supporting documents to explain their position. Most Unamended ecclesias use the ''Birmingham Unamended Statement of Faith'' (BUSF)<ref>''Birmingham Unamended Statement of Faith''. Available [http://www.monroechristadelphians.com/browser/unamendedsof.html online]</ref> with one clause being different. Within the Central fellowship individual ecclesias also may have their own statement of faith, whilst still accepting the statement of faith of the larger community. Some ecclesias have statements around their positions, especially on divorce and re-marriage, making clear that offence would be caused by anyone in that position seeking to join them at the 'Breaking of Bread' service. Others tolerate a degree of divergence from commonly held Christadelphian views.

For each fellowship, anyone who publicly assents to the doctrines described in the statement and is in good standing in their "home ecclesia" is generally welcome to participate in the activities of any other ecclesia.

== Beliefs ==
Due to the way the Christadelphian body is organised there is no central authority to establish and maintain a standardised set of beliefs and it depends what statement of faith is adhered to and how liberal the ecclesia is, but there are core doctrines most Christadelphians would accept.  In the formal statements of faith a more complete list is found. For instance in the Central fellowship, the BASF, the standard statement of faith, has 30 doctrines to be accepted and 35 to be rejected.

=== The Bible ===
Christadelphians state that their beliefs<ref>See, e.g., the ''[http://www.christadelphia.org/basf.htm Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith]''</ref> are based wholly on the [[Bible]],<ref name="hyndman"/> and they do not see other works as inspired by [[God]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Bull  | first =Mike| title =The Bible—The Word of God | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_bible.htm | isbn =81-87409-52-5 }}</ref> They regard the Bible as inspired by God and, therefore, believe that, in its original form, it is error free and errors in later copies are due to errors of transcription or translation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christadelphia.org/basf.htm |title=The Christadelphian Statement of Faith |publisher=Christadelphia.org |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> Based on this, Christadelphians teach what they believe as is true Bible teaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truebibleteaching.co.nz |title=True Bible Teaching Home |publisher=Truebibleteaching.com |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truebibleteaching.com/teaching/12-the-bible-our-guide.html |title=True Bible Teaching Teaching |publisher=Truebibleteaching.com |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref>

Now Paul says that the ''sacred Scriptures are able to make us wise to salvation, by the faith'' (or gospel) ''which is through Jesus Christ''. What more do we want than wisdom in relation to this matter? If the sacred Scriptures are able to make us wise, we need no other instrumentality. The Holy Spirit by the word, without infusing a single idea into it more than it actually and ordinarily contains, and without any collateral influence, teaches us all wisdom and knowledge that is necessary ...'

According to Christadelphians, these terms are used in reference to specific political systems or individuals in opposition or conflict. ''[[Hell]]'' (Hebrew: Sheol; Greek: Hades, Gehenna) is understood to refer exclusively to death and the grave, rather than being a place of everlasting torment (see also [[annihilationism]]).<ref name="devil"/><ref>[http://www.christadelphia.org/reject.htm ''Doctrines to be Rejected'']—an appendix to the Christadelphian Statement of Faith</ref> Christadelphians do not believe that anyone will "go to Heaven" upon death.

===Other historical groups and individuals with some shared doctrines===
One criticism of the Christadelphian movement has been over the claim of John Thomas and Robert Roberts to have "rediscovered" scriptural truth.<ref>Christendom Astray, Robert Roberts, written 1862, Lecture 1: 'Do you mean to say, asks the incredulous enquirer, that the Bible has been studied by men of learning for eighteen centuries without being understood?  and that the thousands of ministers set apart for the very purpose of ministering in its holy pages are all mistaken?'  (He then goes on to suggest that social conditioning, self interest by the clergy and an incomplete reformation prevented its rediscovery.)</ref><ref> In an article 'A Glance at The History and Mystery of Christadelphianism', a contemporary of John Thomas, David King, from the Restoration Movement 1881, argues that a complete losing of truth would have been unlikely.  Available [http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~pdover/histmyst.htm online]</ref> However one might argue that ''all'' [[Protestant]] groups make the same claims to some extent. Although both men believed that they had "recovered" the true doctrines for themselves and contemporaries, they also believed there had always existed a group of true believers throughout the ages, albeit marred by the apostasy.<ref>'An arrangement of this sort was absolutely necessary for '''the preservation and protection of the One Body, witnessing for the truth''' against "the worshipping of the daemonials and idols", in the midst of the nations, and "before the God of the earth;" the weapons of whose warfare were civil disabilities, and the infernal tortures of anti-heretical crusaders and inquisitions.', John Thomas, 'Eureka' (1915 edition), volume 2, chapter 11, section 2.1</ref><ref>''''Thus, the history of the ages and the generations of the unmeasured Court is in strict harmony with this prophecy of the witnesses'''. For a period considerably over a thousand years after Rome renounced its old gods for the ghosts, dry bones, and fables of the catholic superstition, '''the Spirit had provided himself with Two Witnessing Classes, to whose custody he providentially committed the truth''', and its judicial vindication by fire and sword.', John Thomas, 'Eureka', volume 2, chapter 11, section 2.2</ref><ref>'Though the apostles died, their work continued, '''and the generation of believers that went to the grave with them were succeeded by other believers who maintained the integral structure of the temple of God, founded in Europe'''. True, the work was marred and corrupted by the apostasy of the mass: '''still, a real work—a real temple, existed, consisting of the remnant of true believers preserved by God as His witnesses in the midst of the prevailing corruption'''.', Robert Roberts, 'Thirteen Lectures On The Apocalypse' (4th edition 1921), page 98</ref>

The most notable Christadelphian attempts to find a continuity of those with doctrinal similarities since that point have been geographer [[Alan Eyre]]'s two books ''The Protesters''<ref>http://www.antipas.org/books/protesters/prot_toc.html</ref> (1975) and ''Brethren in Christ''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antipas.org/books/brethren_in_christ/binc_toc.html |title=Brethren In Christ Contents Contents |publisher=Antipas.org |date=2012-10-07 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> (1982) in which he shows that many individual Christadelphian doctrines had been previously believed.  Eyre focused in particular on the [[Radical Reformation]], and also among the [[Socinians]] and other early [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and the [[English Dissenters]]. In this way, Eyre was able to demonstrate substantial historical precedents for individual Christadelphian teachings and practices, and believed that the Christadelphian community was the 'inheritor of a noble tradition, by which elements of the Truth were from century to century hammered out on the anvil of controversy, affliction and even anguish'.<ref name="Alan Eyre page 8">Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', page 8 (1975)</ref>  Although noting in the introduction to 'The Protestors' that 'Some recorded herein perhaps did not have "all the truth" — so the writer has been reminded',<ref name="Alan Eyre page 8"/> Eyre nevertheless claimed that the purpose of the work was to 'tell how a number of little-known individuals, groups and religious communities strove to preserve or revive the original Christianity of apostolic times',<ref>Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', page 11 (1975)</ref> and that 'In faith and outlook they were far closer to the early springing shoots of 1st-century Christianity and the penetrating spiritual challenge of Jesus himself than much that has passed for the religion of the Nazarene in the last nineteen centuries'.<ref>Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', pages 11–12 (1975)</ref>

Eyre's research has been criticized by some of his Christadelphian peers,<ref>E.g., both of Eyre's works were criticized by Ruth McHaffie 'Finding Founders and Facing Facts' (2001), in which evidence was presented suggesting that Eyre had misread a number of his sources, and that some his claims could not be supported from (and were often contradicted by) the available historical evidence. Also see James Andrews, ''Ferenc Dávid and the search for Bible truth in Transylvania''</ref> and as a result Christadelphian commentary on the subject has subsequently been more cautious and circumspect, with caveats being issued concerning Eyre's claims,<ref>'But some, though having neither time nor opportunity to search archives, knew enough to realise that the claims were exaggerated, however praiseworthy the intention. Moreover, misgivings increased as the years passed and when members examined the subject more closely for themselves. As explained in the November 1993 issue of The Endeavour Magazine, Brother Ron Coleman in 1986, when preparing an address for the Oxford ecclesia to commemorate the 450th anniversary of William Tyndale's death, not only sought information from ''The Protesters'' but also from Tyndale's own writings. He was surprised to find serious misrepresentations in our community's publication.', Ruth McHaffie, 'Finding Founders And Facing Facts' (2001), page 8</ref><ref>'In 1989 when an article by Brother Alan appeared in The Christadelphian containing a number of inaccuracies on the hymn writer Isaac Watts,, editor of The Christadelphian, and subsequently corresponded with Alan in the manner which becomes Brethren.  Scholarly evidence to disprove Ron's criticisms was not forthcoming with regard to either Tyndale or Watts, and the editor was requested to publish a short note of amendment on both writers, but there appears to have been no response.', Ruth McHaffie, 'Finding Founders And Facing Facts', (2001), page 8</ref> and the two books less used and publicized than in previous years.

Nevertheless, even with most source writings of those later considered "heretics" destroyed, evidence can be provided that since the 1st century CE there have been various groups and individuals who have held certain individual Christadelphian beliefs or similar ones.

Ecclesias are typically involved in preaching the gospel ([[evangelism]]) in the form of public lectures on Bible teaching,<ref>Examples of lecture titles on [http://www.handsworth-cdelph.co.uk/ Handsworth Christadelphians] website</ref> college-style seminars on reading the Bible,<ref>For example: [http://www.biblecourse.f9.co.uk/ Learn to Read the Bible Effectively]</ref> and Bible Reading Groups.

Some ecclesias, organisations or individuals also preach through other media like video,<ref>For example: Christadelphian Auxiliary Lecturing Society (CALS) [http://www.christadelphian.org/videos.htm videos], Williamsburgh Christadelphian Foundation (WCF) [http://www.wcfoundation.org/res/videolauncher.htm videos], the Christadelphians of Southern California's [http://thisisyourbible.org/video.asp videos], and Christadelphian [http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=youpreach YouPreach] on [[YouTube]].</ref> podcasts<ref>For example: [http://washwoodheath.thepositiveword.com/index.php?cat=Proclamation Washwood Heath] Christadelphians' podcasts, [http://biblestudypodcast.wordpress.com Bible Study Podcasts] and [http://www.searchforhope.org/podcasts Search for Hope] podcasts.</ref> and internet forums.<ref>For example: [http://www.openbibleforum.org/forums/index.php?act=home Open Bible Forum], [http://www.thechristadelphians.org/forums/ Bible Discussion Forum] and [http://www.btdf.org/forums/ Bible Truth Discussion Forum]</ref> There are also a number of Bible Education/Learning Centres around the world.<ref>For example, the [http://www.biblelearningcentre.org/nottingham/ Bible Learning Centre] in the [[Westfield Broadmarsh|Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]], [[Nottingham]] (UK); [[Solihull]] [http://www.biblelearningcentre.org/sol_blc/ Bible Learning Centre] (UK); [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]] [http://biblecourses.com.au/ Bible Education Centre], [[Melbourne]] (Aus.); [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] [http://www.castlehillbec.org.au/ Bible Education Centre], [[Sydney]] (Aus.); [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] [http://liverpoolbec.org.au/ Bible Education Centre], [[South-western Sydney]] (Aus.); the [http://www.mustardseedbec.org.au/ Mustard Seed Bible Education Centre], [[Adelaide]] (Aus.); [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] [http://bibleeducationcenter.org/ Bible Education Center], [[Champaign County, Illinois]] (USA); [[Durban]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1NXKf0yrM Bible Education Centre] (SA).

Only baptised (by complete immersion in water) believers are considered members of the ecclesia. Ordinarily, baptism follows someone making a "good confession" (cf. 1 Tim. 6:12) of their faith before two or three nominated elders of the ecclesia they are seeking to join. The good confession has to demonstrate a basic understanding of the main elements - "first principles" - of the faith of the community. The children of members are encouraged to attend Christadelphian [[Sunday Schools]] and youth groups. Interaction between youth from different ecclesias is encouraged through regional and national youth gatherings. Many ecclesias organise holidays for young people, the most popular form in the UK being [[camping]] holidays and Youth Weekends such as Swanwick and others locally organised by different ecclesias.

Christadelphians understand the Bible to teach that male and female believers are equal in God's sight, and also that there is a distinction between the roles of male and female members.<ref>{{Citation

They do, however: participate in other ecclesial and inter-ecclesial committees; participate in discussions; teach children in Sunday Schools as well as at home, teach other women and non-members; perform music; discuss and vote on business matters; and engage in the majority of other activities. Generally, at formal ecclesial and inter-ecclesial meetings the women wear head coverings when there are acts of worship and prayer.

There are ecclesially-accountable committees for co-ordinated [[evangelism|preaching]], youth and Sunday School work, [[conscientious objection]] issues, care of the elderly, and humanitarian work. These do not have any legislative authority, and are wholly dependent upon ecclesial support. Ecclesias in an area may regularly hold joint activities combining youth groups, fellowship, preaching, and Bible study.

Christadelphians refuse to participate in any military (and police forces) because they are conscientious objectors.<ref name="gospelandstrife">{{cite book | last =Norris | first =Alfred | title =The Gospel and Strife | publisher =Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/norris_gospelandstrife.doc}}</ref><ref name="warandpolitics">{{cite book | last =Watkins | first =Peter | title =War and Politics: The Christian's Duty | publisher =Christadelphian Auxiliary Lecturing Society | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/watkins_warandpoliticsthechristiansduty.doc }}</ref>

Most Christadelphians do not vote in political elections, as they take direction from Romans 13:1-4, which they interpret as meaning that God puts into power those leaders He deems worthy.  To vote for a candidate that does not win an election would be considered to vote against God's will.  To avoid the risk of such conflict, Christadelphians abstain from voting.

There is a strong emphasis on personal Bible reading and study<ref>'They are characterized by holding a firm belief in the inspired status of the Bible and place enormous emphasis upon biblical study', Evans, John S, 'The Prophecies of Daniel 2', page 251, USA:Xulon Press (2008)<p>{{*}}'Christadelphian devotion centers on daily Bible study and weekly meetings', page 421, Fahlbusch, Erwin and Bromiley, Geoffrey W, 'The Encyclopedia of Christianity', USA:Wm.

=== Hymnody and music ===
{{Main|Christadelphian hymnals}}
Christadelphians are a [[liturgy|non-liturgical]] denomination. Christadelphian ecclesias are autonomous and free to adopt whatever pattern of worship they choose. However, in the English-speaking world, there tends to be a great deal of uniformity in order of service and [[hymn]]ody.

Christadelphian hymnody makes considerable use of the hymns of the Anglican and British Protestant traditions (even in US ecclesias the hymnody is typically more British than American). In many Christadelphian hymn books a sizeable proportion of hymns are drawn from the [[Psalter|Scottish Psalter]] and non-Christadelphian hymn-writers including [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]] and [[John Newton]].  Despite incorporating non-Christadelphian hymns however, Christadelphian hymnody preserves the essential teachings of the community.<ref>'Hymnody was an important part of Christadelphianism from its beginning, and, along with the journal, The Christadelphian, gave independent ecclesias a broader fellowship. Hymns reflected the essential doctrines and principles of their faith. These principles were anti-Trinitarianism. They also believed that God would establish his kingdom on earth through the return of Jesus to reign a thousand years in Jerusalem', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997</ref>

The earliest hymn book published was the "Sacred Melodist" which was published by [[Benjamin Wilson (Biblical scholar)|Benjamin Wilson]] in Geneva, Illinois in 1860.<ref>{{cite book |first=Rachel |last=Hocking |title=A Study of Christadelphian Hymnody: singing with the spirit and with the understanding |date=2000, 7 |url= http://sites.google.com/site/rachelhockingsite/articles/christadelphian-hymnody |accessdate= }}</ref> The next was the hymn book published for the use of ''Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God'' (an early name for Christadelphians)<ref name = "anrvrv">Peter Hemingray, ''John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p. 235</ref> by George Dowie in Edinburgh in 1864.<ref>Andrew Wilson, ''History of the Christadelphians 1864–1885: the emergence of a denomination'' 1997 p. 326</ref> In 1865 [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]] published a collection of Scottish psalms and hymns called ''The Golden Harp'' (which was subtitled "Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, compiled for the use of Immersed Believers in 'The Things concerning the Kingdom of God and the Name of Jesus Christ'").<ref>Peter Hemingray, ''John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p. 195</ref> This was replaced only five years later by the first "Christadelphian Hymn Book" (1869), compiled by J. J. and A. Andrew,<ref>Ambassador of the Coming Age Vol. 6, P. 148</ref> and this was revised and expanded in 1874, 1932 and 1964. A thorough revision by the Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association resulted in the latest (2002) edition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thechristadelphian.com/acatalog/2002HymnBooks.html |title=The CMPA online bookshop |publisher=Thechristadelphian.com |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090624190953/http://www.thechristadelphian.com:80/acatalog/2002HymnBooks.html |archivedate=24 June 2009 }}</ref> which is almost universally used by English-speaking Christadelphian ecclesias. In addition some Christadelphian fellowships have published their own hymn books.

Some ecclesias use the ''Praise the Lord'' songbook.<ref>''Praise the Lord'' (Hoddesdon Christadelphian Service, 1993, 2000)</ref> It was produced with the aim of making contemporary songs which are consistent with Christadelphian theology more widely available.  Another publication, the "Worship" book<ref>{{cite web |title=Worship |work=Worship Book Committee, NCC, 2008, 2010 |url=http://www.theworshipbook.com |publisher=Theworshipbook.com |accessdate= }}</ref> is a compilation of songs and hymns that have been composed only by members of the Christadelphian community. This book was produced with the aim of providing extra music for non-congregational music items within services (e.g. voluntaries, meditations, etc) but has been adopted by congregations worldwide and is now used to supplement congregational repertoire.

In the English-speaking world, worship is typically accompanied by organ or piano, though in recent years a few ecclesias have promoted the use of other instruments (e.g. strings, wind and brass as mentioned in the Psalms). This trend has also seen the emergence of some Christadelphian bands<ref>An example is the Christadelphian folk rock band [[Fisher's Tale]] (albeit this is a witness project as opposed to being for the purpose of church worship)</ref> and the establishment of the Christadelphian Art Trust to support performing, visual and dramatic arts within the Christadelphian community.

In other countries, hymn books have been produced in local languages,<ref>e.g. ''Liedboek van de Broeders in Christus'' (Netherlands, circa 1980)</ref> sometimes resulting in styles of worship which reflect the local culture.  It has been noted that Christadelphian hymnody has historically been a consistent witness to Christadelphian beliefs, and that hymnody occupies a significant role in the community.<ref>'Considering the scope of hymnic literature by Christadelphians, we might conclude that few branches of Christianity can claim such a close relationship between hymn writing and their own religious development, and such a high percentage of hymnists in their membership.  As their hymns become better known, this close relationship will reveal that the heritage and faith of Christadelphians has been enhanced through a strong emphasis on hymnody, from their beginnings to the present day', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997</ref>
