The construction involves replacing a common word with a rhyming phrase of two or three words and then, in almost all cases, omitting the secondary rhyming word (which is thereafter implied), in a process called hemiteleia,<extension extension_name='ref' name="roberts"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="mother"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Bryson</arg><arg name="first">Bill</arg><arg name="title">Mother Tongue</arg><arg name="publisher">Penguin</arg><arg name="year">1990</arg><arg name="isbn">0-14-014305-X</arg></template></extension><space/>making the origin and meaning of the phrase elusive to listeners not in the know.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ayto"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>One example is replacing the word &quot;stairs&quot; with the rhyming phrase &quot;apples and pears&quot;. Following the pattern of omission, &quot;and pears&quot; is dropped, thus the spoken phrase &quot;I'm going up the apples&quot; means &quot;I'm going up the stairs&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>In similar fashion, &quot;telephone&quot; is replaced by &quot;dog&quot; (= 'dog-and-bone'); &quot;wife&quot; by &quot;trouble&quot; (= 'trouble-and-strife'); &quot;eyes&quot; by &quot;mincers&quot; (= 'mince pies'); &quot;wig&quot; by &quot;syrup&quot; (= 'syrup of figs') and &quot;feet&quot; by &quot;plates&quot; (= 'plates of meat'). Thus a construction of the following type could conceivably arise: &quot;It nearly knocked me off me plateshe was wearing a syrup! So I ran up the apples, got straight on the dog to me trouble and said I couldn't believe me mincers.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>In some examples the meaning is further obscured by adding a second iteration of rhyme and truncation to the original rhymed phrase. For example, the word &quot;Aris&quot; is often used to indicate the buttocks. This is the result of a double rhyme, starting with the original rough synonym &quot;arse&quot;, which is rhymed with &quot;bottle and glass&quot;, leading to &quot;bottle&quot;. &quot;Bottle&quot; was then rhymed with &quot;Aristotle&quot; and truncated to &quot;Aris&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="mother"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The use of rhyming slang has spread beyond the purely dialectal and some examples are to be found in the mainstream British English lexicon and internationally, although many users may be unaware of the origin of those words. One example is &quot;berk&quot;, a mild pejorative widely used across the UK and not usually considered particularly offensive, although the origin lies in a contraction of &quot;<link><target>Berkeley Hunt</target></link>&quot;, as the rhyme for the significantly more offensive &quot;<link><target>cunt</target></link>&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Oxford English Reference Dictionary</arg><arg name="publisher">Oxford University Press</arg></template><link type='external' href='http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/berk'></link></extension><space/>Another example is to &quot;have a butcher's&quot; for to have a look, from &quot;butcher's hook&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Most of the words changed by this process are nouns.

(The reference is to travelling salesmen of certain kinds. Chaunters sold sheet music and patterers offered cheap, tawdry goods at fairs and markets up and down the country). Hotten's<space/><italics>Dictionary</italics><space/>included a &quot;Glossary of the Rhyming Slang&quot;, the first known such work. It included later mainstays such as &quot;Frog and toadthe main road&quot; and &quot;Apples and pearsstairs&quot; as well as many that later grew more obscure, e.g. &quot;Battle of the Nilea tile&quot; (vulgar term for a hat), &quot;Duke of Yorktake a walk&quot;, and &quot;Top of Romehome&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>It remains a matter of speculation whether rhyming slang was a linguistic accident, a game, or a<space/><link><target>cryptolect</target></link><space/>developed intentionally to confuse non-locals. If deliberate, it may also have been used to maintain a sense of community.

Another suggestion is that it may have been used by criminals (see<space/><link><target>thieves' cant</target></link>) to confuse the police.</paragraph><paragraph>The English academic and lexicographer, Terence Dolan, has suggested that rhyming slang may have been invented by Irish immigrants to London &quot;so the actual English wouldn't understand what they were talking about.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.eolasmagazine.ie/irish-english-explained/'>Irish-English explained</link><space/>Eolas Magazine, 2012-02-06.</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Development</heading><paragraph>At any point in history, in any location, rhyming slang can be seen to incorporate words and phrases that are relevant at that particular time and place. Many examples are based on locations in London and, in all likelihood, will be meaningless to people unfamiliar with the capital e.g. &quot;<link><target>Peckham Rye</target></link>&quot;, meaning &quot;tie&quot; (as in necktie), which dates from the late 19th century; &quot;<link><target>Hampstead Heath</target></link>&quot;, meaning &quot;teeth&quot; (usually as &quot;Hampsteads&quot;), which was first recorded in 1887 and &quot;<link><target>Barnet Fair</target></link>&quot;, meaning &quot;hair&quot;, which dates from the 1850s. (In these examples and many subsequent ones the final step of hemiteleia has been omitted to make it easier to trace the origin of the substituted words).</paragraph><paragraph>By the mid-20th century many rhyming slang expressions used the names of contemporary personalities, especially actors and performers: for example &quot;<link><target>Gregory Peck</target></link>&quot; meaning &quot;neck&quot; and also &quot;cheque&quot;; &quot;<link><target>Ruby Murray</target></link>&quot; meaning &quot;curry&quot;; &quot;Alans&quot;, meaning &quot;knickers&quot; from<space/><link><target>Alan Whicker</target></link>; &quot;<link><target>Max Miller (comedian)</target><part>Max Miller</part></link>&quot; meaning &quot;pillow&quot; when pronounced /pil/ and &quot;<link><target>Henry Hall (bandleader)</target><part>Henry Halls</part></link>&quot; for &quot;balls (testicles)&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>The use of personal names as rhymes continued into the late 20th century, for example &quot;<link><target>Tony Blair</target><trail>s</trail></link>&quot; meaning &quot;flares&quot;, as in trousers with a wide bottom (previously this was &quot;<link><target>Lionel Blair</target><trail>s</trail></link>&quot; and this change illustrates the ongoing mutation of the forms of expression) and &quot;<link><target>Britney Spears</target></link>&quot;, meaning &quot;beers&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Many examples have passed into common usage. Some substitutions have become relatively widespread in England in their contracted form. &quot;To have a butcher's&quot;, meaning to have a look, originates from &quot;<link><target>butcher</target></link>'s hook&quot;, an S-shaped hook used by butchers to hang up meat, and dates from the late 19th century but has existed independently in general use from around the 1930s simply as &quot;butchers&quot;. Similarly, &quot;use your loaf&quot;, meaning &quot;use your head&quot;, derives from &quot;loaf of<space/><link><target>bread</target></link>&quot; and also dates from the late 19th century but came into independent use in the 1930s.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ayto"></extension><space/>To &quot;have a giraffe&quot; is commonly employed for a &quot;laugh&quot;, although technically this does not involve hemiteleia.</paragraph><paragraph>Rhyming slang, in keeping with the rest of the language, is at the mercy of what one might loosely refer to as &quot;false etymology&quot;. An example occurs that involves the term &quot;barney&quot;, which has been used to mean an altercation or fight since the late 19th century, although without a clear derivation.<extension extension_name='ref'>Partridge,Eric, A concise dictionary of slang and unconventional English.

Some constructions, however, rely on particular regional accents for the rhymes to work.

Unique formations also exist in other parts of the United Kingdom, such as in the East Midlands, where the local accent has formed &quot;Derby Road&quot;, which rhymes with &quot;cold&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Outside England, rhyming slang is used in many English-speaking countries in the<space/><link><target>Commonwealth of Nations</target></link>, but is not in general use in the United States.
