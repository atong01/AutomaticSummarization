Often, &quot;rear admiral&quot; is the first of the &quot;flag ranks&quot;. For example, it was not until 2001 that the UK made &quot;commodore&quot; a &quot;flag rank&quot;, and changed the shoulder rank insignia (although not the cuff rings) of the higher ranking admirals accordingly. Australia made this change in the mid-1990s, and also changed the commodore rank insignia to include a star.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>It is sometimes abbreviated: as &quot;Cdre&quot; in British Royal Navy, &quot;CDRE&quot; in the US Navy, &quot;Cmdre&quot; in the Royal Canadian Navy, &quot;COMO&quot; in the Spanish Navy and in the some navies speaking the Spanish language, or &quot;CMDE&quot; as used in the Indian Navy or in some other Navies.<extension extension_name='ref'>The &quot;Cdre&quot; abbreviation for the OF-6 rank of commodore is sometimes confused with the &quot;Cmdr&quot; abbreviation for the OF-4 rank of &quot;<link><target>commander</target></link>&quot;.</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Etymology</heading><paragraph>The rank of commodore derives from the<space/><link><target>French language</target><part>French</part></link><space/><italics>commandeur</italics>, which was one of the highest ranks in orders of<space/><link><target>knight</target><trail>hood</trail></link>, and in military orders the title of the knight in charge of a<space/><italics>commenda</italics><space/>(a local part of the order's territorial possessions).</paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Dutch Navy</target></link><space/>also used the rank of<space/><italics><link><target>commandeur</target></link></italics><space/>from the end of the 16th century for a variety of temporary positions, until it became a conventional permanent rank in 1955. The<space/><link><target>Royal Netherlands Air Force</target></link><space/>has adopted the English spelling of<space/><italics>commodore</italics><space/>for an equivalent rank.</paragraph><paragraph>The rank of commodore was at first a position created as a temporary title to be bestowed upon captains who commanded<space/><link><target>Squadron (naval)</target><part>squadrons</part></link><space/>of more than one vessel. In many navies, the rank of commodore was merely viewed as a<space/><link><target>senior captain</target></link><space/>position, whereas other naval services bestowed upon the rank of commodore the prestige of<space/><link><target>flag officer</target></link><space/>status.</paragraph><paragraph>Commodore is the highest rank in the<space/><link><target>Irish Naval Service</target></link><space/>held by the Chief of Naval Operations. This is because Ireland, despite having the largest part of EU waters to patrol, has among the smallest navies (always less than 10 ships) and thus the rank of admiral for flag officers seemed inappropriate.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>Royal Navy</target></link>, the position was introduced to combat the cost of appointing more admiralsa costly business with a fleet as large as the Royal Navy's at that time.</paragraph><heading level='3'>United States</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Commodore (United States)</arg></template>In 1899 the substantive rank of commodore was discontinued in the<space/><link><target>United States Navy</target></link>, but revived during World War II. It was discontinued as a rank in these services during the postwar period, but as an appointment, the title &quot;commodore&quot; was then used to identify senior U.S. Navy<space/><link><target>captain (U.S. Navy)</target><part>captain</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>who commanded squadrons of more than one vessel or functional air wings or air groups that were not part of a carrier air wing or air group. Concurrently, until the early 1980s,<space/><link><target>U.S. Navy</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>U.S. Coast Guard</target></link><space/>captains selected for promotion to the rank of<space/><link><target>rear admiral</target></link><space/>(lower half), would wear the same insignia as rear admiral (upper half), i.e., two silver stars for collar insignia or sleeve braid of one wide and one narrow gold stripe, even though they were actually only equivalent to one-star officers and paid at the one-star rate.</paragraph><paragraph>To correct this inequity, the rank of commodore as a single star flag officer was reinstated by both services in the early 1980s. This immediately caused confusion with those senior U.S. Navy captains commanding destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons, functional air wings and air groups, and so on, who held the temporary &quot;title&quot; of commodore while in their major command billet. As a result of this confusion, the services soon renamed the new one-star rank as<space/><link><target>commodore admiral</target></link><space/>(CADM) within the first six months following the rank's reintroduction. However, this was considered an awkward title and the one-star flag rank was renamed a few months later to its current title of rear admiral (lower half), later abbreviated by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard as RDML.</paragraph><paragraph>The &quot;title&quot; of commodore continues to be used in the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard for those senior captains in command of organizations consisting of groups of ships or submarines organized into<space/><link><target>Squadron (naval)</target><part>squadrons</part></link>; air wings or air groups of multiple<space/><link><target>Squadron (aviation)</target><part>aviation squadrons</part></link><space/>other than carrier air wings (the latter whose commanders still use the title &quot;CAG&quot;); explosive ordnance disposal (<link><target>Explosive Ordnance Disposal</target><part>EOD</part></link>), mine warfare and special warfare (<link><target>United States Navy SEALs</target><part>SEAL</part></link>) groups; and construction battalion (<link><target>SeaBee</target></link>) regiments. Although not flag officers, modern day commodores in the U.S. Navy rate a blue and white command pennant, also known as a<space/><link><target>broad pennant</target></link>, that is normally flown at their headquarters facilities ashore or from ships that they are embarked aboard when they are the senior officer present afloat (SOPA).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Argentina</heading><paragraph>In the Argentine Navy, the rank of commodore was created in the late 1990s, and is usually, but not always, issued to senior captains holding rear-admirals' positions. Its equivalent in the army is colonel-major, and has no equivalent in the air force. It is usuallybut incorrectlyreferred to as &quot;navy commodore&quot;, to avoid confusion with the &quot;air force commodore&quot;, which is equivalent to the navy's captain and army's colonel. The sleeve lace is identical to that of the Royal Navy, and wears one star on the shoulder strap.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Naval rank</heading><paragraph>The following articles deal with the rank of commodore (or its equivalent) as it is employed<space/><link><target>OF-6</target></link><space/><link><target>one-star rank</target><part>one-star</part></link><space/>flag officer rank in various countries.</paragraph><table class="wikitable"><tablerow><tablehead>Country</tablehead><tablehead>Rank</tablehead><tablehead>Remark</tablehead></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Argentina</tablecell><tablecell><italics>Comodoro</italics></tablecell><tablecell>abbreviated &quot;COMO&quot;</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Bulgaria</tablecell><tablecell><italics>Komodor</italics></tablecell><tablecell></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Canada</tablecell><tablecell><link><target>Commodore (Canada)</target><part>Commodore</part></link></tablecell><tablecell>abbreviated &quot;Cmdre&quot;</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Croatia</tablecell><tablecell><italics>Komodor</italics></tablecell><tablecell></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Finland</tablecell><tablecell><italics><link><target>Flotilla admiral</target><part>Lippueamiraali</part></link></italics></tablecell><tablecell><link><target>Commodore (Finland)</target><part>''Kommodor''</part></link><space/>OF-5 rank</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>France</tablecell><tablecell><italics>Chef de division</italics></tablecell><tablecell>France (deprecated)</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell align="center" rowspan="2">Germany</tablecell><tablecell><italics><link><target>Flottillenadmiral</target></link></italics></tablecell><tablecell><link><target>Rank insignia of the German Bundeswehr#Generals and Flag officers</target><part>Deutsche Marine</part></link><space/>rank<space/><link><target>OF-6</target></link></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><italics><link><target>Kommodore</target></link></italics></tablecell><tablecell>Geraman<space/><link><target>Uniforms and insignia of the Kriegsmarine#Officer ranks</target><part>Kriegsmarine</part></link><space/>rank<space/><link><target>OF-5</target></link><space/>until 1945</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>India</tablecell><tablecell>Commodore</tablecell><tablecell>abbreviated &quot;CMDE&quot;</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Indonesia</tablecell><tablecell><italics>Komodor</italics></tablecell><tablecell>used until 1973, then replaced with<space/><link><target>Indonesian military ranks</target><part>Laksamana Pertama</part></link></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Iran</tablecell><tablecell><italics>Darydr</italics></tablecell><tablecell></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Italy</tablecell><tablecell><italics><link><target>w:it:Sottoammiraglio</target><part>Sottoammiraglio</part></link></italics></tablecell><tablecell>Kingdom of Italy 1918-1923</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Netherlands</tablecell><tablecell><italics><link><target>w:nl:Commandeur (marine)</target><part>Commandeur</part></link></italics></tablecell><tablecell></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Poland</tablecell><tablecell><italics>Kontradmira</italics></tablecell><tablecell><italics><link><target>w:pl:Komandor</target><part>Komandor</part></link></italics><space/>OF-5 rank</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Portugal</tablecell><tablecell><italics><link><target>w:pt:Comodoro (patente)</target><part>Comodoro</part></link></italics></tablecell><tablecell></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Romania</tablecell><tablecell><italics>Contraamiral de flotil</italics></tablecell><tablecell><italics>Comandor</italics><space/>OF-5 rank</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Spain</tablecell><tablecell><italics>Contraalmirante</italics></tablecell><tablecell></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>Turkey</tablecell><tablecell><italics>Tugamiral</italics></tablecell><tablecell></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>United Kingdom</tablecell><tablecell><link><target>Commodore (Royal Navy)</target><part>Commodore</part></link></tablecell><tablecell></tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell>United States</tablecell><tablecell><link><target>Commodore (United States)</target><part>Commodore</part></link></tablecell><tablecell>United States - abbreviated when used &quot;CDRE&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>The modern US rank for this level is<space/><link><target>Rear admiral (United States)#Rear admiral (lower half)</target><part>rear admiral (lower half)</part></link></extension></tablecell></tablerow></table><paragraph><table style='border-collapse: collapse;
