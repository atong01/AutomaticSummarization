'''[[Caribbean]] cuisine''' is a fusion of [[African cuisine|African]],<ref name="bahama">[http://www.bahamabreeze.com/menus/cuisine/ "Cuisine."] (Caribbean.) [http://www.bahamabreeze.com Bahamabreeze.com]. Accessed July 2011.</ref> [[Amerindian cuisine|Amerindian]], [[European cuisine|European]],<ref name="bahama"/> [[Indian cuisine|East Indian]], [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] and [[Chinese cuisine]]. These traditions were brought from many different countries when they came to the Caribbean.<ref name="bahama"/> In addition, the population has created styles that are unique to the region.

Ingredients which are common in most islands' dishes are [[rice]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[bean]]s, [[cassava]], [[cilantro]] (coriander), [[bell pepper]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[sweet potato]]es, [[coconut]], and any of various meats that are locally available like beef, poultry, pork or fish. A characteristic seasoning for the region is a green herb and oil based marinade which imparts a flavor profile which is quintessentially Caribbean in character. Ingredients may include garlic, onions, scotch bonnet peppers, celery, green onions, and herbs like cilantro, marjoram, rosemary, tarragon and thyme. This green seasoning is used for a variety of dishes like curries, stews and roasted meats.<ref>[http://latinfood.about.com/od/seasoningmarinade/r/Green-Seasoning.htm Caribbean Green Seasoning Recipe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Traditional dishes are so important to regional culture that, for example, the local version of Caribbean goat stew has been chosen as the official national dish of [[Montserrat]] and is also one of the signature dishes of [[St. Kitts and Nevis]]. Another popular dish in the Anglophone Caribbean is called "Cook-up", or Pelau. [[Ackee and saltfish]] is another popular dish that is unique to Jamaica. [[Callaloo]] is a dish containing leafy vegetables and sometimes [[okra]] amongst others, widely distributed in the Caribbean, with a distinctively mixed African and indigenous character.

The variety of dessert dishes in the area also reflects the mixed origins of the recipes. In some areas, [[Black Cake]], a derivative of English Christmas pudding may be served, especially on special occasions.
