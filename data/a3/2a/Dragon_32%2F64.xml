The Dragons are very similar to the<space/><link><target>TRS-80 Color Computer</target></link>, and were produced for the<space/><link><target>Europe</target><trail>an</trail></link><space/>market by<space/><link><target>Dragon Data</target></link>, Ltd., in<space/><link><target>Port Talbot</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Wales</target></link>, and for the US market by Tano of<space/><link><target>New Orleans</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Louisiana</target></link>.

New machines were released almost monthly. In August 1982, Dragon Data joined the fray with the Dragon 32; the Dragon 64 followed a year later. The computers sold quite well initially and attracted the interest of several independent software developers, most notably<space/><link><target>Microdeal</target></link>. A magazine,<space/><italics><link><target>Dragon User</target></link></italics>, also began publication shortly after the machine's launch.</paragraph><paragraph>In the private home computer market, where games were a significant driver, the Dragon suffered because its graphical capabilities were inferior to contemporary machines such as the<space/><link><target>Sinclair Research Ltd</target><part>Sinclair</part></link><space/><link><target>ZX Spectrum</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>BBC Micro</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="EandT"><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last">Sangani<space/></arg><arg name="first">Kris<space/></arg><arg name="year">2009<space/></arg><arg name="title">Gadgets That Design Forgot<space/></arg><arg name="journal">Engineering & Technology<space/></arg><arg name="volume">4<space/></arg><arg name="issue">16<space/></arg><arg name="page">31<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://kn.theiet.org/magazine/issues/0916/gadgets-design-forgot-0916.cfm<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">IET<space/></arg><arg name="issn">1750-9637<space/></arg><arg name="doi">10.1049/et.2009.1604</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The Dragon was also unable to display<space/><link><target>Lower case</target><part>lower-case</part></link><space/>letters easily. Some more sophisticated applications would synthesise them using high-resolution graphics modes (in the same way that user-defined characters would be designed for purely graphical applications such as games). Simpler programs just managed without lower case. This effectively locked it out of the then-blooming educational market.<extension extension_name='ref' name="EandT"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>As a result of these limitations, the Dragon was not a commercial success, and Dragon Data collapsed in June 1984.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Worlock</arg><arg name="first">Peter</arg><arg name="title">Dragon Fire Flickers</arg><arg name="url">http://www.personalcomputernews.co.uk/pcnb/html/065/personal_computer_news_065_monitor_07.html</arg><arg name="work">Personal Computer News</arg><arg name="accessdate">14 September 2012</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Dragon sign in Valetta.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Dragon Logo</part></link></paragraph><heading level='2'>Technical notes</heading><heading level='3'>Hardware and peripherals</heading><paragraph>The Dragon is built around the<space/><link><target>Motorola 6809</target><part>Motorola MC6809E</part></link><space/>processor running at 0.89<space/><link><target>megahertz</target><part>MHz</part></link>. This was an advanced 8-bit CPU design, having, among other things, limited 16-bit capabilities. In terms of raw computational power, the Dragon beat most of its contemporary rivals based on the older<space/><link><target>MOS Technology 6502</target></link>, but this made little difference in a market where graphical capabilities and games were much more important to consumers.</paragraph><paragraph>It was possible to increase the speed of the computer by using<space/><link><target>PEEK and POKE</target><part>POKE</part></link><space/>65495,0 which accelerates the ROM-resident BASIC interpreter, but temporarily disables correct functioning of the cassette/printer ports. Manufacturing variances means that not all Dragons are able to function at this higher speed, and use of this POKE can cause some units to crash or be unstable, though with no permanent damage. POKE 65494,0 returns the speed to normal. POKE 65497,0 pushes the speed yet higher but the display is lost until a slower speed is restored.</paragraph><paragraph>The Dragon also used the SN74LS783/MC6883 Synchronous Address Multiplexer (SAM) and the<space/><link><target>MC6847</target></link><space/>Video Display Generator (VDG). I/O was provided by two MC6821<space/><link><target>Peripheral Interface Adapter</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(PIAs). Many Dragon 32s were upgraded by their owners to 64&amp;nbsp;kB of memory. A few were further expanded to 128&amp;nbsp;kB, 256&amp;nbsp;kB, or 512&amp;nbsp;kB, with home-built memory controllers/<link><target>memory management unit</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(MMUs).</paragraph><paragraph>A broad range of peripherals exist for the Dragon 32/64, and on top of this there are add-ons such as the Dragon's Claw which give the Dragons access to the<space/><link><target>BBC Micro</target></link>'s large range of accessories (a particularly important factor in the UK home market). Although neither machine has a built-in disk operating system (<link><target>compact audio cassette</target><part>cassette tapes</part></link><space/>being the default data-storage mechanism in the home computer market at the time), DragonDOS was supplied as part of the disk controller interface from Dragon Data Ltd. The numerous external ports (by the standards of the time), including the standard<space/><link><target>RS-232</target></link><space/>on the 64, also allows hobbyists to attach a diverse range of equipment.</paragraph><paragraph>An unusual feature was a monitor port for connection of a computer monitor, as an alternative to the TV output. This was rarely used due to the cost of dedicated monitors at that time. The port is actually a Composite Video port and can be used to connect the Dragon 32 to most modern TVs to deliver a much better picture.</paragraph><paragraph>The Dragon uses analogue joysticks, unlike most systems of the time which used less versatile but cheaper digital systems. Other uses for the joystick ports include<space/><link><target>light pen</target><trail>s</trail></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Tony Clarke and Richard Wadman laid out the specifications for the Dragon.<extension extension_name='ref' name="edmondson">&quot;The Computer that Roared&quot; by Fernleigh Edmonson. &quot;Microcomputing&quot; magazine 1983 May.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The units had a robust<space/><link><target>motherboard</target></link><space/>in a spacious case, reminiscent of the<space/><link><target>BBC Micro</target></link>, and so were more tolerant of home-modification than some of their contemporaries, which often had their components crammed into the smallest possible space.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Video modes</heading><paragraph>The Dragon's main display mode is 'black on green' text (actually the black was a deeper, muddier green). The only graphics possible in this mode are quarter-tile block based.</paragraph><paragraph>It also has a selection of five high resolution modes, named PMODEs 0-4, which alternate monochrome and four-colour in successively higher resolutions, culminating in the black and white 256192 PMODE 4. Each mode has two possible colour palettes. Unfortunately, these are rather garish and cause the system to fare poorly in visual comparisons with other home computers of the time. It is also impossible to use standard printing commands to print text on the graphical modes, causing software development difficulties.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">November 2012</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Full colour scanline based 64192 &quot;semi-graphics&quot; modes are also possible, though their imbalanced resolution and programming difficulty (they are not accessible via BASIC) meant they were not often utilised.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Disk systems</heading><paragraph>A complete Disk Operating System was produced for the Dragon by a third-party supplier, Premier Microsystems located near Croydon, South London. The system was sold as the &quot;Delta&quot; disk operating system. Although Premier offered the Delta system to be marketed by Dragon themselves, Dragon were not happy that a third party were hijacking the standards for their computer, and produced their own rival DragonDOS system making it clear that the third party Delta was not compatible with the 'standard' Dragon Disk system.</paragraph><paragraph>Inevitably, with Delta's head start, software was marketed in either system, but rarely both. The result was the inevitable confusion with customers upset that a particular piece of software was not available for the Disk system that they had. Although this was far from the principal driver for the Dragon's demise, it was nevertheless a factor,<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">April 2013</arg></template><space/>and had Dragon adopted the established Delta system, the machine may well have had a greater following and a longer life.<template><target>or</target><arg name="date">October 2013</arg></template><template><target>Speculation-inline</target></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>System software</heading><paragraph>The Dragon comes with a<space/><link><target>Microsoft</target></link><space/><link><target>BASIC</target></link><space/>interpreter in 16&amp;nbsp;KB of<space/><link><target>Read-only memory</target><part>ROM</part></link>.The BASIC appears to be identical to<space/><link><target>Color BASIC</target><part>Tandy Color Computer's Extended Basic</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="edmondson"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Unlike a modern PC with the operating system on disk, a Dragon starts instantly when powered up. Some software providers also produced compilers for BASIC, and other languages, to produce binary (or &quot;machine&quot;) code which would run many times faster and make better use of the small system RAM. Towards the end of its life, Dragon Data produced an assembler/disassembler/editor suite called<space/><italics>Dream</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>In addition to the<space/><link><target>DragonDOS</target></link><space/>disk operating system, the Dragon 32/64 is capable of running several others, including<space/><link><target>FLEX (operating system)</target><part>FLEX</part></link>, and even<space/><link><target>OS-9</target></link><space/>which brought<space/><link><target>Unix</target><part>UNIX</part></link>-like multitasking to the platform.
