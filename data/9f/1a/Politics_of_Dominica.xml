Nominated by the prime minister in consultation with the leader of the opposition party, the president is elected for a 5-year term by the parliament. The president appoints as prime minister the person who command the majority of elected representatives in the parliament and also appoints, on the prime minister's recommendation, members of the parliament as cabinet ministers. The prime minister and cabinet are responsible to the parliament and can be removed on a no-confidence vote.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Legislative branch</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>House of Assembly of Dominica</arg></template>The<space/><link><target>House of Assembly of Dominica</target><part>House of Assembly</part></link><space/>has 32 members. 21 members are elected for a five-year term in single-seat<space/><link><target>constituency</target><part>constituencies</part></link>. 9 members are senators appointed by the President; 5 on the advice of the Prime Minister and 4 on the advice of the leader of the opposition.

The<space/><link><target>head of state</target></link><space/>- the<space/><link><target>president</target></link><space/>-is elected by the House of Assembly. The regional representatives decide whether senators are to be elected or appointed. If appointed, five are chosen by the president with the advice of the prime minister and four with the advice of the opposition leader. If elected, it is by vote of the regional representatives. Elections for representatives and senators must be held at least every 5 years, although the prime minister can call elections any time. Dominica has a<space/><link><target>two-party system</target></link>, which means that there are two dominant<space/><link><target>political parties</target></link>, with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party.
