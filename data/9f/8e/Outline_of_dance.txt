[[Dance]] &ndash; human movement either used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]] or presented in a [[social environment|social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. [[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer.

A great many dances and dance styles are performed to [[dance music]].

=== Dance styles by number of interacting dancers ===
* [[Solo dance]] &ndash; a dance danced by an individual dancing alone.
* [[Partner dance]] &ndash; dance with just 2 dancers, dancing together. In most partner dances, one, typically a man, is the leader; the other, typically a woman, is the follower.
