[[Christian theology]] is expressed in [[ecumenical creeds]]. These [[Profession (religious)|professions]] of faith state that Jesus suffered, died, was buried, and was [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] from the dead, in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust in him for the [[forgiveness#Christianity|remission]] of their [[Christian views on sin|sin]]s. The creeds further maintain that Jesus bodily [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended]] into heaven, where he reigns with [[God the Father]], and that he will [[Second Coming|return]] to [[Last Judgment|judge]] the living and dead and grant [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] to his followers. His [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and resurrection are often referred to as "[[the gospel]]", meaning "good news".<ref group="note">"Good news" is a translation of the [[Ancient Greek]] term {{lang|grc-gre|εὐαγγέλιον}} ''euangélion'', from which the terms [[evangelical]] and [[evangelism]] derive.</ref> The term ''[[gospel]]'' also refers to written accounts of Jesus's life and teaching, four of which—[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]]—are considered [[Canonical gospels|canonical]] and included in [[Christian Bible]]s.

==Beliefs==

There are many important differences of interpretation and opinion of the Bible on which Christianity is based.<ref name="Olsen">Olson, ''The Mosaic of Christian Belief''.</ref> Because of these irreconcilable differences in theology and a lack of consensus on the core tenets of what defines Christianity, Protestants, Catholics and Orthodox church members and theologians often deny that members of other branches are Christians.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ehrman|first1=Bart|title=Lost Christianities: the battles for scripture and the faiths we never knew|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=URdACxKubDIC&dq=lost+christianities&hl=nl&ei=LyzHTae8IsXoOfDSzfUB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA|accessdate=9 May 2011|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=978-0-19-518249-1|page=1|chapter=Introduction: Recouping Our Losses|quote=Many of these Christian groups, of course, refuse to consider other such groups Christian.}}</ref>

===Creeds===
{{Main|Creeds}}
{{Wikisource|Apostles' Creed}}
{{Wikisource|Nicene Creed}}

Concise doctrinal statements or confessions of religious beliefs are known as creeds (from Latin ''credo'', meaning "I believe"). They began as baptismal formulae and were later expanded during the [[Christology|Christological]] controversies of the 4th and 5th&nbsp;centuries to become statements of faith.

Many [[evangelical]] Protestants reject creeds as definitive statements of faith, even while agreeing with some or all of the substance of the creeds. [[Baptists|The Baptists]] have been non-creedal "in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another."<ref name=Avis>Avis, Paul (2002) ''The Christian Church: An Introduction to the Major Traditions'', SPCK, London, ISBN 0-281-05246-8 paperback</ref>{{rp|p.111}} Also rejecting creeds are groups with roots in the [[Restoration Movement]], such as the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], the [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]] and the [[Churches of Christ]].<ref>White, Howard A.

[[File:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|An [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] icon depicting [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine]] and the Fathers of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) as holding the Niceno–Constantinopolitan Creed of 381]]
The [[Apostles' Creed]] remains the most popular statement of the articles of Christian faith which are generally acceptable to most Christian denominations that are creedal. It is widely used by a number of [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] for both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechesis|catechetical]] purposes, most visibly by liturgical Churches of [[Western Christian]] tradition, including the [[Latin Church]] of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Anglicanism]], and [[Western Rite Orthodoxy]]. It is also used by [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. This particular creed was developed between the 2nd and 9th&nbsp;centuries. Its central doctrines are those of the Trinity and God the Creator. Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic period]]. The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome.<ref>Pelikan/Hotchkiss, ''Creeds and Confessions of Faith in the Christian Tradition''.</ref>

Its main points include:

* belief in [[God the Father]], [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[Son of God]] and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]
* the [[crucifixion of Jesus|death]], [[Harrowing of Hell|descent into hell]], [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], and [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] of Christ
* the holiness of the [[Ecclesia (church)|Church]] and the [[communion of saints]]
* Christ's [[second coming]], the [[Day of Judgement]] and [[salvation]] of the faithful.

The [[Nicene Creed]], largely a response to [[Arianism]], was formulated at the Councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] and [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 325 and 381 respectively<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cuf.org/2005/02/we-believe-in-one-god-the-nicene-creed-at-mass/ |title="We Believe in One God….": The Nicene Creed and Mass |date=February 2005 |website= |publisher=Catholics United for the Fath |registration=yes |accessdate=16 June 2014}}</ref><ref>''Encyclopedia of Religion'', "Arianism".</ref> and ratified as the universal creed of [[Christendom]] by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref name="ephesus">''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05491a.htm Council of Ephesus]".</ref>

===Jesus===
[[File:CompositeJesus.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Various [[Depiction of Jesus|depictions of Jesus]]]]
{{Main|Christ|Christian views of Jesus|Christology}}
{{See also|Jesus Christ in comparative mythology}}

The central tenet of Christianity is the belief in [[Jesus]] as the [[Son of God]] and the [[Messiah]] (Christ). Christians believe that Jesus, as the Messiah, was [[anointing|anointed]] by God as savior of humanity, and hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of [[Messianic prophecies of Jesus|messianic prophecies]] of the [[Old Testament]]. The Christian concept of the Messiah differs significantly from [[Jewish Messiah|the contemporary Jewish concept]]. The core Christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|the death and resurrection of Jesus]], [[original sin|sinful]] humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Immortality|eternal life]].<ref>Metzger/Coogan, ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', pp. 513, 649.</ref>

While there have been many [[Christian theology|theological]] disputes over the [[Christology|nature of Jesus]] over the earliest centuries of Christian history, generally Christians believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] and "[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become [[Incarnation (Christianity)|fully human]], suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, but did not [[Christian views on sin|sin]]. As fully God, he rose to life again. According to the [[Bible]],God raised him from the dead,<ref>{{Bibleref2|Acts|2:24}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|2:31–32}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:15}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:26}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|4:10}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|10:40–41}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:34}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:37}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|17:30–31}}, {{Bibleref2|Romans|10:9}}, {{bibleref2|1Cor|15:15 || 1 Cor. 15:15}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Cor|6:14}}, {{bibleref2|2Cor|4:14 || 2 Cor. 4:14}}, {{Bibleref2|Gal|1:1}}, {{Bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{Bibleref2|Col|2:12}}, {{bibleref2|1Thess|1:10 || 1 Thess. 11:10}}, {{Bibleref2|Heb.|13:20}}, {{bibleref2|1Pet|1:3 || 1 Pet. 1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Pet|1:21}}</ref> he [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascended]] to heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father<ref>[[Wikisource:Nicene Creed]]</ref> and will ultimately return{{bibleref2c|Acts|1:9–11}} to fulfill the rest of [[Messianic prophecy]] such as the [[Resurrection of the dead]], the [[Last Judgment]] and final establishment of the [[Kingdom of God]].

According to the canonical gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Jesus was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|conceived]] by the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Nativity of Jesus|born]] from [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin Mary]]. Little of Jesus' childhood is recorded in the canonical Gospels, however [[infancy Gospels]] were popular in antiquity. In comparison, his adulthood, especially the week before his death, is well documented in the Gospels contained within the [[New Testament]], because that part of his life was believed to be most important. The Biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include: [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]], [[Miracles attributed to Jesus|miracles]], preaching, [[Ministry of Jesus|teaching, and deeds]].

====Death and resurrection====
{{Main|Crucifixion of Jesus|Resurrection of Jesus}}
[[File:Cristo crucificado.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Christ Crucified (Velázquez)|Crucifixion]]'', representing the death of [[Jesus]] on the [[Christian Cross|Cross]], painting by [[Diego Velázquez]], 17th&nbsp;century]]

Christians consider the resurrection of Jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith (see [[1 Corinthians 15]]) and the most important event in history.<ref>Hanegraaff. ''Resurrection: The Capstone in the Arch of Christianity''.</ref> Among Christian beliefs, the death and resurrection of Jesus are two core events on which much of Christian doctrine and theology is based.<ref name="ACU-Death & Resurrection">{{cite web|url = http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/research/theology/Walsh.htm| title = The Significance of the Death and Resurrection of Jesus for the Christian|publisher = Australian Catholic University National|accessdate = 16 May 2007}}</ref><ref name="Got Questions-Death & Resurrection">{{cite web|url = http://www.gotquestions.org/resurrection-Christ-important.html| title = Why is the resurrection of Jesus Christ important?|publisher = Got Questions Ministries|accessdate = 16 May 2007}}</ref> According to the New Testament Jesus was [[Crucifixion|crucified]], died a physical death, was buried within a tomb, and rose from the dead three days later.{{bibleref2c|Jn.|19:30–31}} {{bibleref2c|Mk.|16:1}} {{bibleref2c-nb|Mark|16:6}}

The New Testament mentions several [[resurrection appearances of Jesus]] on different occasions to his [[twelve apostles]] and [[disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], including "more than five hundred brethren at once",{{bibleref2c|1Cor|15:6}} before Jesus' [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] to heaven. Jesus' death and resurrection are commemorated by Christians in all worship services, with special emphasis during [[Holy Week]] which includes [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter]] Sunday.

The death and resurrection of Jesus are usually considered the most important events in [[Christian theology]], partly because they demonstrate that Jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].<ref>{{bibleref2 || John|3:16}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|5:24}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|6:39–40}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|6:47}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|10:10}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|11:25–26}}, and {{bibleref2-nb|John|17:3}}</ref>

Christian churches accept and teach the New Testament account of the resurrection of Jesus with very few exceptions.<ref>This is drawn from a number of sources, especially the early Creeds, the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the Reformation including the ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', works contained in the ''Book of Concord''.</ref> Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the [[historical Jesus]] and the proclamation of the [[early church]].<ref>Fuller, ''The Foundations of New Testament Christology'', p. 11.</ref> Some [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]] do not accept a literal bodily resurrection,<ref>A [[Jesus Seminar]] conclusion: "in the view of the Seminar, he did not rise bodily from the dead; the resurrection is based instead on [[vision hypothesis|visionary experiences]] of [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], and [[Mary Magdalene|Mary]]."</ref><ref>Funk. ''The Acts of Jesus: What Did Jesus Really Do?''.</ref> seeing the story as richly symbolic and spiritually nourishing [[mythology|myth]]. Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious [[debate]]s and [[interfaith|interfaith dialogues]].<ref>Lorenzen. ''Resurrection, Discipleship, Justice: Affirming the Resurrection Jesus Christ Today'', p. 13.</ref> [[Paul the Apostle]], an early Christian convert and missionary, wrote, "If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless."{{bibleref2c|1Cor|15:14}} <ref>Ball/Johnsson (ed.). ''The Essential Jesus''.</ref>

===Salvation===
{{Main|Salvation (Christianity)}}

[[Paul the Apostle]], like Jews and Roman [[pagan]]s of his time, believed that sacrifice can bring about new kinship ties, purity, and eternal life.<ref name="remedy">{{cite journal |last=Eisenbaum |first=Pamela |date=Winter 2004 |title=A Remedy for Having Been Born of Woman: Jesus, Gentiles, and Genealogy in Romans |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=671–702 |url=http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/JBL1234.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=3 April 2009 |doi=10.2307/3268465 |jstor=3268465 |subscription=yes}}</ref> For Paul the necessary sacrifice was the death of Jesus: Gentiles who are "Christ's" are, like Israel, descendants of Abraham and "heirs according to the promise".{{bibleref2c|Gal.|3:29}} <ref>Wright, N.T. ''What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?'' (Oxford, 1997), p. 121.</ref> The God who raised Jesus from the dead would also give new life to the "mortal bodies" of Gentile Christians, who had become with Israel the "children of God" and were therefore no longer "in the flesh".{{bibleref2c|Rom.|8:9,11,16}} <ref name="remedy" />

Modern Christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be [[eternal salvation|saved]] from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both Jews and Gentiles can be in God's family. According to both Catholic and Protestant doctrine, salvation comes by Jesus' [[substitutionary atonement|substitutionary death and resurrection]]. The Catholic Church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of Christians; converts must live in accordance with principles of love and ordinarily must be baptized.<ref>CCC 846; Vatican II, Lumen Gentium 14</ref><ref>See quotations from Council of Trent on Justification at [http://www.justforcatholics.org/a14.htm Justforcatholics.org]</ref> [[Martin Luther]] taught that baptism was necessary for salvation, but modern Lutherans and other Protestants tend to teach that salvation is a gift that comes to an individual by [[Divine grace|God's grace]], sometimes defined as "unmerited favor", even apart from baptism.

Christians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals' salvation is pre-ordained by God. Reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are [[total depravity|completely incapable of self-redemption]], but that [[irresistible grace|sanctifying grace is irresistible]].<ref>Westminster Confession, [http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/wcf.htm#chap10 Chapter X];<br />Spurgeon, ''[http://www.spurgeon.org/calvinis.htm A Defense of Calvinism]''.</ref> In contrast Catholics, Orthodox Christians and [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Protestants believe that the exercise of [[free will]] is necessary to have faith in Jesus.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]|title=Grace and Justification|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815001751/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm|archivedate=15 August 2010}}</ref>

According to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (see [[Perichoresis]]). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and (in [[Western Christian]] theology) [[Filioque|from the Son]]. Regardless of this apparent difference, the three "persons" are each [[eternity|eternal]] and [[omnipotent]]. Other Christian religions including [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Mormonism]] and others do not share those views on the Trinity.

The word ''trias'', from which ''trinity'' is derived, is first seen in the works of [[Theophilus of Antioch]]. He wrote of "the Trinity of God (the Father), His Word (the Son) and His Wisdom (Holy Spirit)".<ref>Theophilus of Antioch ''Apologia ad Autolycum'' II 15</ref> The term may have been in use before this time.

====Trinitarians====
{{Main|Trinitarianism}}

''Trinitarianism'' denotes those Christians who believe in the concept of the ''[[Trinity]]''. Almost all Christian denominations and Churches hold Trinitarian beliefs. Although the words "Trinity" and "Triune" do not appear in the Bible, theologians beginning in the 3rd&nbsp;century developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the New Testament teachings of God as Father, God as Jesus the Son, and God as the Holy Spirit. Since that time, Christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that Trinity does not imply three gods, nor that each member of the Trinity is one-third of an infinite God; Trinity is defined as one God in three Persons.<ref>Moltman, Jurgen. ''The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God.'' Tr. from German. Fortress Press, 1993. ISBN 0-8006-2825-X</ref> 
 
====Nontrinitarians====
{{Main|Nontrinitarianism}}

''Nontrinitarianism'' refers to theology that rejects the doctrine of the Trinity. Various nontrinitarian views, such as [[adoptionism]] or [[modalism]], existed in early Christianity, leading to the disputes about [[Christology]].<ref>Harnack, ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html History of Dogma]''.</ref> Nontrinitarianism later appeared again in the [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Cathars]] in the 11th through 13th&nbsp;centuries, and by groups with [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theology in the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th&nbsp;century,<ref>Pocket Dictionary of Church History Nathan P. Feldmeth p.135 "Unitarianism. Unitarians emerged from Protestant Christian beginnings in the sixteenth century with a central focus on the unity of God and subsequent denial of the doctrine of the Trinity"</ref> and in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th&nbsp;century, and in some groups arising during the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th&nbsp;century.

===Scriptures===
{{Main|Bible|Development of the Christian Biblical canon}}
[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Bible]] is sacred in Christianity]]
Christianity, like other religions, has adherents whose beliefs and biblical interpretations vary. Christianity regards the [[biblical canon]], the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]], as the [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] word of God. The traditional view of inspiration is that God worked through human authors so that what they produced was what God wished to communicate. The Greek word referring to inspiration in {{bibleref2|2Timothy|3:16||2 Timothy 3:16}} is ''theopneustos'', which literally means "God-breathed".<ref>{{cite book |title=Hermeneutics: Principles and Processes of Biblical Interpretation |edition=2nd |last=Virkler |first=Henry A. |editor-last=Ayayo |editor-first=Karelynne Gerber |year=2007 |publisher=Baker Academic |location=Grand Rapids, USA |isbn=978-0-8010-3138-0 |page=21 }}</ref>

Some believe that divine inspiration makes our present Bibles [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]]. Others claim inerrancy for the Bible in its original manuscripts, although none of those are extant. Still others maintain that only a particular translation is inerrant, such as the [[King James Version]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]|title=Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909213651/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm|archivedate=9 September 2010}}(§105–108)</ref><ref>Second Helvetic Confession, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071203120450/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c01.htm ''Of the Holy Scripture Being the True Word of God'']</ref><ref>[[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html ''online text'']</ref> Another closely related view is [[Biblical infallibility]] or limited inerrancy, which affirms that the Bible is free of error as a guide to salvation, but may include errors on matters such as history, geography or science.

The [[books of the Bible]] accepted by the Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant churches vary somewhat, with Jews accepting only the Hebrew Bible as canonical; there is however substantial overlap. These variations are a reflection of the range of [[tradition]]s, and of the [[Ecumenical council|councils]] that have convened on the subject. Every version of the Old Testament always includes the books of the [[Tanakh]], the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The Catholic and Orthodox canons, in addition to the Tanakh, also include the [[Deuterocanonical Books]] as part of the Old Testament. These books appear in the [[Septuagint]], but are regarded by Protestants to be [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]]. However, they are considered to be important historical documents which help to inform the understanding of words, grammar and syntax used in the historical period of their conception. Some versions of the Bible include a separate Apocrypha section between the Old Testament and the New Testament.<ref>Metzger/Coogan, ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. p. 39.</ref> The New Testament, originally written in [[Koine Greek]], contains 27 books which are agreed upon by all churches.

Modern scholarship has raised many issues with the Bible. While the [[Authorized King James Version]] is held to by many because of its striking English prose, in fact it was translated from the Erasmus Greek Bible which in turn "was based on a single 12th&nbsp;Century manuscript that is one of the worst manuscripts we have available to us".<ref name="Ehrman209-183">Ehrman, Bart D. (2005). Misquoting Jesus: the story behind who changed the Bible and why. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco ISBN 978-0060738174 pages 209, 183</ref> Much scholarship in the past several hundred years has gone into comparing different manuscripts in order to reconstruct the original text. Another issue is that several books are considered to be forgeries. The injunction that women "be silent and submissive" in 1 Timothy 12<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202:11-12&version=NIV |title=1 Timothy 2:11–12 NIV – A woman should learn in quietness and |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> is thought by many to be a forgery by a follower of Paul, a similar phrase in 1 Corinthians 14,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2014:34-35&version=NIV |title=1 corinthians 14:34–35 NIV – Women should remain silent in the |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> which is thought to be by Paul, appears in different places in different manuscripts and is thought to originally be a margin note by a copyist.<ref name="Ehrman209-183" /> Other verses in 1 Corinthians, such as 1 Corinthians 11:2–16 where women are instructed to wear a covering over their hair "when they pray or prophesies",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2011:2-16&version=NIV |title=1 corinthians 11:2–16 NIV – On Covering the Head in Worship – I |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> contradict this verse.

A final issue with the Bible is the way in which books were selected for inclusion in the New Testament. [[Gnostic Gospels|Other Gospels]] have now been recovered, such as those found near [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945, and while some of these texts are quite different from what Christians have been used to, it should be understood that some of this newly recovered Gospel material is quite possibly contemporaneous with, or even earlier than, the New Testament Gospels. The core of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], in particular, may date from as early as 50&nbsp;AD, and if so would provide an insight into the earliest gospel texts that underlie the canonical Gospels, texts that are mentioned in Luke 1:1–2. The Gospel of Thomas contains much that is familiar from the canonical Gospels—verse 113, for example ("The Father's Kingdom is spread out upon the earth, but people do not see it"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gosthom.html |title=The Gospel of Thomas Collection – Translations and Resources |publisher=Gnosis.org |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> is reminiscent of Luke 17:20–21<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+17%3A20-21&version=NIV |title=Luke 17:20–21 NIV – The Coming of the Kingdom of God |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmnet.com.au/australian_landscape_photos/writer/Reflections.html |title=Reflections on religions |publisher=Mmnet.com.au |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>—and the [[Gospel of John]], with a terminology and approach that is suggestive of what was later termed ''Gnosticism'', has recently been seen as a possible response to the Gospel of Thomas, a text that is commonly labelled ''proto-Gnostic''. Scholarship, then, is currently exploring the relationship in the [[Early Christianity|Early Church]] between mystical speculation and experience on the one hand and the search for church order on the other, by analyzing new-found texts, by subjecting canonical texts to further scrutiny, and by an examination of the passage of New Testament texts to canonical status.

====Catholic and Orthodox interpretations====
[[File:StPetersBasilicaEarlyMorning.jpg|thumb|250px|[[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]], the largest church in the world and a symbol of the [[Catholic Church]].]]

In antiquity, two schools of exegesis developed in [[Alexandria]] and [[School of Antioch|Antioch]]. Alexandrine interpretation, exemplified by [[Origen]], tended to read Scripture [[allegory|allegorically]], while Antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense, holding that other meanings (called ''[[theoria]]'') could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning.<ref>Kelly. ''Early Christian Doctrines''. pp. 69–78.</ref>

[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] theology distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual.<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III, ''The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture'' § 115–118]. {{wayback|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III, |date=20150325191945 }}</ref>

The ''literal'' sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture. The ''spiritual'' sense is further subdivided into:
* the ''allegorical'' sense, which includes [[Typology (theology)|typology]]. An example would be the [[Passage of the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]] being understood as a "type" (sign) of baptism.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|10:2}}
* the ''[[moral]]'' sense, which understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching.
* the ''[[anagoge|anagogical]]'' sense, which applies to [[eschatology]], eternity and the [[Apocalypse|consummation of the world]]

Regarding [[exegesis]], following the rules of sound interpretation, Catholic theology holds:
* the injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the ''literal''<ref>Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm "Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses"]</ref><ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III §116] {{wayback|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III |date=20150325191945 }}</ref>
* that the historicity of the Gospels must be absolutely and constantly held<ref>[[Second Vatican Council]], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html ''Dei Verbum'' (V.19)].</ref>
* that scripture must be read within the "living Tradition of the whole Church"<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III "The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture" § 113]. {{wayback|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III |date=20150325191945 }}</ref> and
* that "the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]]".<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#III "The Interpretation of the Heritage of Faith" § 85]. {{wayback|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#III |date=20150403212113 }}</ref>

===Eschatology===
{{Main|Christian eschatology}}
[[File:Kohrvirab.jpg|thumb|250px|The 7th-century [[Khor Virap]] monastery in the shadow of [[Mount Ararat]]. [[Armenia]] was the first state to adopt Christianity as the state religion, in AD 301.<ref name="Armenia"/>]]

The end of things, whether the end of an individual life, the end of the age, or the end of the world, broadly speaking is Christian eschatology; the study of the destiny of humans as it is revealed in the Bible. The major issues in Christian eschatology are the [[Great Tribulation|Tribulation]], death and the afterlife, the [[Rapture]], the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, [[Resurrection of the Dead]], Heaven and Hell, [[Millennialism]], the [[Last Judgment]], the end of the world, and the [[New Heavens and New Earth]].

Christians believe that the second coming of Christ will occur at the [[eschatology|end of time]] after a period of severe persecution (the Great Tribulation). All who have died will be [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrected bodily from the dead]] for the Last Judgment. Jesus will fully establish the [[Kingdom of God]] in fulfillment of [[Bible prophecy|scriptural prophecies]].<ref name="res">[[Thomas Aquinas]], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm ''Summa Theologicum, Supplementum Tertiae Partis''] questions 69 through 99</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =Calvin | first =John | authorlink = | title =Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Three, Ch. 25 | work = | publisher =www.reformed.org | date = | url =http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book3/bk3ch25.html | doi = | accessdate =1 January 2008 }}</ref>

====Death and afterlife====

Most Christians believe that human beings experience divine judgment and are rewarded either with eternal life or [[hell|eternal damnation]]. This includes the [[Last Judgment|general judgement]] at the [[resurrection of the dead]] as well as the belief (held by Roman Catholics,<ref name="CEParticularJudgement">''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm Particular Judgment]".</ref><ref name="Ott">Ott, ''Grundriß der Dogmatik'', p. 566.</ref> Orthodox<ref>David Moser, ''[http://www.orthodox.net/articles/about-prayer-for-the-dead.html What the Orthodox believe concerning prayer for the dead]''.</ref><ref>Ken Collins, ''[http://www.kencollins.com/question-45.htm What Happens to Me When I Die?]''.</ref> and most Protestants) in a [[particular judgment|judgment particular to the individual soul]] upon physical death.

In Roman Catholicism, those who die in a state of grace, i.e., without any mortal sin separating them from God, but are still imperfectly purified from the effects of sin, undergo purification through the intermediate state of [[purgatory]] to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into God's presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_04081999_en.html |title=Audience of 4 August 1999 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=4 August 1999 |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> Those who have attained this goal are called ''saints'' (Latin ''sanctus'', "holy").<ref>''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm The Communion of Saints]".</ref>

Some Christian groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, hold to [[Christian mortalism|mortalism]], the belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal, and is unconscious during the intermediate state between bodily death and resurrection. These Christians also hold to [[Annihilationism]], the belief that subsequent to the final judgement, the wicked will cease to exist rather than suffer everlasting torment. Jehovah's Witnesses hold to a similar view.<ref>"The death that Adam brought into the world is spiritual as well as physical, and only those who gain entrance into the Kingdom of God will exist eternally. However, this division will not occur until Armageddon, when all people will be resurrected and given a chance to gain eternal life. In the meantime, "the dead are conscious of nothing."

==Worship==
{{Main|Christian worship}}
{{See also|Mass (liturgy)|Reformed worship|Contemporary worship}}
[[File:Thebible33.jpg|230px|thumb|Samples of [[Catholic]] religious objects—The [[Bible]], a [[Crucifix]], and a [[Rosary]]]]

[[Justin Martyr]] described 2nd-century Christian [[liturgy]] in his ''[[First Apology]]'' (c. 150) to Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], and his description remains relevant to the basic structure of Christian liturgical worship:

{{quote|And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the [[presbyter|president]] verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying [[Amen]]; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need.|Justin Martyr<ref name=justin>Justin Martyr, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html ''First Apology''] §LXVII</ref>}}

Thus, as Justin described, Christians assemble for communal worship on Sunday, the day of the resurrection, though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting. Scripture readings are drawn from the Old and New Testaments, but especially the gospel accounts. Often these are arranged on an [[annual cycle]], using a book called a [[lectionary]]. Instruction is given based on these readings, called a [[sermon]], or homily. There are a variety of congregational [[prayer]]s, including thanksgiving, confession, and intercession, which occur throughout the service and take a variety of forms including recited, responsive, silent, or sung. The [[Lord's Prayer]], or Our Father, is regularly prayed.

[[File:Worship-team.jpg|thumb|250px|A modern Protestant worship band leading a contemporary worship session]]
Some groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure. A division is often made between "[[High church|High]]" [[church service]]s, characterized by greater solemnity and ritual, and "[[Low church|Low]]" services, but even within these two categories there is great diversity in forms of worship. [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] meet on Saturday, while others do not meet on a weekly basis. [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] or [[Pentecostal]] congregations may spontaneously feel led by the Holy Spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service, including spontaneous prayer. [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] sit quietly until moved by the Holy Spirit to speak.

Some [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] services resemble concerts with [[Christian rock|rock and pop music]], dancing, and use of multimedia. For groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers the services are generally led by a [[minister of religion|minister]], [[preacher]], or [[pastor]]. Still others may lack any formal leaders, either in principle or by local necessity. Some churches use only [[a cappella]] music, either on principle (for example, many [[Churches of Christ]] object to the use of instruments in worship) or by tradition (as in Orthodoxy).

Nearly all forms of [[churchmanship]] celebrate the [[Eucharist]] (Holy Communion), which consists of a consecrated meal. It is reenacted in accordance with Jesus' instruction at the Last Supper that his followers do in remembrance of him as when he gave his disciples [[Sacramental bread|bread]], saying, "This is my body", and gave them [[sacramental wine|wine]] saying, "This is my blood".<ref>Ignazio Silone, ''Bread and Wine'' (1937).</ref> Some [[Christian denominations]] practice [[closed communion]]. They offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church. Catholics restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of [[mortal sin]]. Most other churches practice [[open communion]] since they view communion as a means to unity, rather than an end, and invite all believing Christians to participate.

Worship can be varied for special events like [[baptism]]s or weddings in the service or significant [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. In the [[Early Christianity|early church]], Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called [[Sunday school]] or [[Sabbath school]] (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).

{{quote box|title=2nd-century description of the [[Eucharist]]
|quote=And this food is called among us ''Eukaristia'' [the Eucharist], of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Savior, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.

In Christian belief and practice, a ''sacrament'' is a [[rite]], instituted by Christ, that mediates [[divine grace|grace]], constituting a [[Sacred Mysteries|sacred mystery]]. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sacramentum'', which was used to translate the Greek word for ''mystery''. Views concerning both what rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament vary among Christian denominations and traditions.<ref name="ODCC1435">Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. p. 1435f.</ref>

The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] (or Holy Communion), however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments: [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]] in the Orthodox tradition), [[Holy orders]] ([[ordination]]), [[Penance]] (or [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), [[Anointing of the Sick]], and [[Matrimony]] (see [[Christian views on marriage]]).<ref name="ODCC1435" />

Taken together, these are the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]] as recognized by churches in the [[High Church]] tradition—notably [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]], many [[Anglican sacraments|Anglicans]], and some [[Lutherans]]. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.<ref name="ODCC1435" /> [[Christian denominations]], such as [[Baptists]], which believe these rites do not communicate grace, prefer to call Baptism and Holy Communion ''[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinances]]'' rather than sacraments.

===Liturgical calendar===
{{Main|Liturgical year}}
{{See also|Calendar of saints}}
[[File:Nativity tree2011.jpg|thumb|left|A [[nativity scene|depiction of the Nativity]] with a [[Christmas tree]] backdrop.]]
Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians, and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around the [[liturgical year]]. The liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of [[season]]s, each with their theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colours of [[parament]]s and [[vestment]]s for clergy,<ref name="calendar">{{cite web|last1=Fortescue|first1=Adrian|title=Christian Calendar|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03158a.htm|website=The Catholic Encyclopedia.|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=18 July 2014|year=1912}}</ref> scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home.

Western Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church,<ref name="calendar" /> and Eastern Christians use analogous calendars based on the cycle of their respective [[Rite#Christian|rites]]. Calendars set aside holy days, such as [[Solemnity|solemnities]] which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus or Mary, the [[saint]]s, periods of [[fasting]] such as [[Lent]], and other pious events such as [[memoria]] or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Pentecost]]: these are the celebrations of Christ's birth, resurrection and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Church, respectively. A few denominations make no use of a liturgical calendar.<ref>Hickman. ''Handbook of the Christian Year''.</ref>

===Symbols===
{{Main|Christian symbolism}}
[[File:Nideggen-St.Johannes Baptist249.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Christian cross|cross]] and the fish are two common symbols of [[Jesus Christ]]. The letters of the Greek word ΙΧΘΥΣ [[Ichthys]] (fish) form an acronym for "Ίησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ", which translates into English as "Jesus Christ, God's Son, Savior".]]
Christianity has not generally practiced [[Aniconism in Christianity|aniconism]], or the avoidance or prohibition of types of images, even if the early [[Jewish Christian]]s sects, as well as some modern [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, preferred to some extent not to use figures in their symbols, by invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of [[idolatry]].

The [[Christian cross|cross]], which is today one of the most widely recognized symbols in the world, was used as a Christian symbol from the earliest times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm |title=ANF04. Fathers of the Third Century: Tertullian, Part Fourth; Minucius Felix; Commodian; Origen, Parts First and Second &#124; Christian Classics Ethereal Library |publisher=Ccel.org |date=1 June 2005 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref><ref>Minucius Felix speaks of the cross of Jesus in its familiar form, likening it to objects with a crossbeam or to a man with arms outstretched in prayer ([http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm#P5713_906729 Octavius of Minucius Felix], chapter XXIX).</ref> Tertullian, in his book ''De Corona'', tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.<ref>"At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign." (Tertullian, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.vi.iii.html ''De Corona'', chapter 3])</ref> Although the cross was known to the early Christians, the [[crucifix]] did not appear in use until the 5th&nbsp;century.<ref name="soc">Dilasser. ''The Symbols of the Church''.</ref>

Among the symbols employed by the primitive Christians, that of the fish or [[Ichthys]] seems to have ranked first in importance. From monumental sources such as tombs it is known that the symbolic fish was familiar to Christians from the earliest times. The fish was depicted as a Christian symbol in the first decades of the 2nd&nbsp;century.<ref name="cefish">''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06083a.htm Symbolism of the Fish]".</ref> Its popularity among Christians was due principally, it would seem, to the famous acrostic consisting of the initial letters of five Greek words forming the word for fish (Ichthys), which words briefly but clearly described the character of Christ and the claim to worship of believers: ''Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter'' (Ίησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ), meaning, ''Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior''.<ref name="cefish" />

Other major Christian symbols include the [[Chi-Rho|chi-rho monogram]], the [[dove]] (symbolic of the Holy Spirit), the sacrificial lamb (symbolic of Christ's sacrifice), the [[vine]] (symbolizing the necessary connectedness of the Christian with Christ) and many others. These all derive from writings found in the New Testament.<ref name="soc"/>

===Baptism===
[[File:Baptism-of-Christ-xx-Francesco-Alban.JPG|thumb|[[Francesco Albani]]'s ''The Baptism of Christ'']]
[[Baptism]] is the ritual act, with the use of water, by which a person is admitted to membership of the [[Christian Church|Church]]. Beliefs on baptism vary among denominations. Differences occur firstly, on whether the act has any spiritual significance, some churches hold to the doctrine of [[Baptismal Regeneration]], which affirms that baptism creates or strengthens a person's faith, and is intimately linked to salvation, this view is held by Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches as well as Lutherans and Anglicans, while others simply acknowledge it as a purely symbolic act, an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person. Secondly, there are differences of opinion on the methodology of the act. These methods being: [[Immersion baptism|Baptism by Immersion]]; if immersion is total, Baptism by Submersion; and [[Affusion|Baptism by Affusion]] (pouring) and [[Aspersion|Baptism by Aspersion]] (sprinkling). Those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of [[Infant Baptism]];<ref>"Through Baptism we are freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1213]); "Holy Baptism is the sacrament by which God adopts us as his children and makes us members of Christ's Body, the Church, and inheritors of the kingdom of God" ([http://anglicansonline.org/basics/catechism.html#Holy Book of Common Prayer, 1979, Episcopal );] "Baptism is the sacrament of initiation and incorporation into the body of Christ" ([http://www.backriverumc.com/userFiles/1257/by_water_and_the_spirit.pdf By Water and The Spirit – The Official United Methodist Understanding of Baptism (PDF)];<br />"As an initiatory rite into membership of the Family of God, baptismal candidates are symbolically purified or washed as their sins have been forgiven and washed away" ([[William H. Brackney]], [http://www.baptisthistory.org/pamphlets/baptism.htm Doing Baptism Baptist Style{{snd}} Believer's Baptism])</ref> the [[Orthodox Church]]es all practice infant baptism and always baptize by total immersion repeated three times in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<ref>"After the proclamation of faith, the baptismal water is prayed over and blessed as the sign of the goodness of God's creation. The person to be baptized is also prayed over and blessed with sanctified oil as the sign that his creation by God is holy and good. And then, after the solemn proclamation of "Alleluia" (God be praised), the person is immersed three times in the water in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit" ([http://www.oca.org/OCchapter.asp?SID=2&ID=51 Orthodox Church in America: Baptism).]</ref><ref>"In the Orthodox Church we totally immerse, because such total immersion symbolizes death. What death? The death of the "old, sinful man".

===Prayer===
{{Main|Prayer in Christianity}}

Jesus' teaching on prayer in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer. A concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as 'pagan', and instead a simple trust in God's fatherly goodness is encouraged.{{bibleref2c|Mat.|6:5–15}} Elsewhere in the New Testament this same freedom of access to God is also emphasized.{{bibleref2c|Phil.|4:6}}{{bibleref2c|Jam.|5:13–19}} This confident position should be understood in light of Christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and Christ through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.<ref name="NBDprayer">{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Alexander, T. D., & Rosner, B. S |year=2001 |title =Prayer |encyclopedia= New Dictionary of Biblical Theology|publisher= Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, IL |id= }}</ref>

In subsequent Christian traditions, certain physical gestures are emphasized, including medieval gestures such as [[genuflection]] or making the [[sign of the cross]]. [[Kneeling]], bowing and [[prostration]]s (see also [[poklon]]) are often practiced in more traditional branches of Christianity. Frequently in Western Christianity the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal [[commendation ceremony]]. At other times the older [[orans]] posture may be used, with palms up and elbows in.

''Intercessory prayer'' is prayer offered for the benefit of other people. There are many intercessory prayers recorded in the Bible, including prayers of the [[Apostle Peter]] on behalf of sick persons{{bibleref2c|Acts|9:40}} and by [[prophet]]s of the Old Testament in favor of other people.{{bibleref2c|1Ki|17:19–22}} In the New Testament [[book of James]] no distinction is made between the intercessory prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent Old Testament prophet Elijah.{{bibleref2c|Jam|5:16–18}} The effectiveness of prayer in Christianity derives from the power of God rather than the status of the one praying.<ref name="NBDprayer"/>

The ancient church, in both [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Western Christianity]], developed a tradition of asking for the [[intercession of saints|intercession of (deceased) saints]], and this remains the practice of most [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and some [[Anglican]] churches. Churches of the [[Protestant Reformation]] however rejected prayer to the saints, largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author=Ferguson, S. B., & Packer, J. |year=1988 |title =Saints |encyclopedia= New Dictionary of Theology|publisher= Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, IL |id= }}</ref> The reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was [[idolatry in Christianity|idolatrous]].<ref>Madeleine Gray, ''The Protestant Reformation'', (Sussex Academic Press, 2003), page 140.</ref>

According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]: "Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.va/archive/catechism/p4s1.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church: Part Four – Christian Prayer |publisher=Va |date= |accessdate=19 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110728034653/http://www.va/archive/catechism/p4s1.htm |archivedate=28 July 2011 }}</ref> The [[Book of Common Prayer]] in the Anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for church services, containing set prayers, scripture readings, and hymns or sung Psalms.

Christianity began as a [[Jewish]] sect in the [[Levant]] of the middle east in the mid-1st&nbsp;century. Other than [[Second Temple Judaism]], the primary religious influences of early Christianity are [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Gnosticism]].<ref group="note" name="name">The term "Christian" ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Χριστιανός}}) was first used in reference to Jesus's [[disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] in the city of [[Antioch]]{{bibleref2c|Acts|11:26}} about 44&nbsp;AD, meaning "followers of Christ". The name was given by the non-Jewish inhabitants of Antioch to the disciples of Jesus. In the New Testament the names by which the disciples were known among themselves were "brethren", "the faithful", "elect", "saints", and "believers". The earliest recorded use of the term "Christianity" (Greek {{lang|grc|Χριστιανισμός}}) was by [[Ignatius of Antioch]], around 100&nbsp;AD.{{ref|name="Christian"|Elwell/Comfort. ''Tyndale Bible Dictionary'', pp. 266, 828.}}</ref><ref name="Robinson"/><ref name="Esler"/> John Bowker states that Christian ideas such as "angels, the end of the world, a final judgment, the resurrection, and heaven and hell received form and substance from ... Zoroastrian beliefs".<ref>{{cite book |title= World Religions: The Great Faiths Explored & Explained |edition= |last= Bowker|first= John|authorlink= John Bowker (theologian)|year= 1997|publisher= Dorling Kindersley Limited|location= London|isbn= 0-7894-1439-2|page= 13}}</ref> Its earliest development took place under the leadership of the [[Twelve Apostles]], particularly [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle]], followed by the early [[bishop]]s, whom Christians consider the [[apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]].

According to the Christian scriptures, Christians were from the beginning subject to [[Persecution of Christians|persecution]] by some Jewish and Roman religious authorities, who disagreed with the apostles' teachings (See [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism]]). This involved punishments, including death, for Christians such as [[Stephen]]{{bibleref2c|Acts|7:59}} and [[James, son of Zebedee]].{{bibleref2c|Acts|12:2}} Larger-scale persecutions followed at the hands of the authorities of the Roman Empire, first in the year 64, when [[Emperor Nero]] blamed them for the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. According to Church tradition, it was under Nero's persecution that early Church leaders Peter and [[Paul of Tarsus]] were each martyred in Rome.

Further widespread [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|persecutions]] of the Church occurred under nine subsequent Roman emperors, most intensely under [[Decius]] and [[Diocletian]]. From the year 150, Christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith. These authors are known as the [[Church Fathers]], and study of them is called [[Patristics]]. Notable early Fathers include [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and [[Origen]].

State persecution ceased in the 4th&nbsp;century, when [[Constantine I]] issued an [[Edict of Milan|edict of toleration]] in 313.

Around 500, [[St. Benedict]] set out his [[Monastic Rule]], establishing a system of regulations for the foundation and running of [[monasteries]].<ref name = "Gonzalez-p238"/> [[Monasticism]] became a powerful force throughout Europe,<ref name = "Gonzalez-p238"/> and gave rise to many early centers of learning, most famously in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Gaul]], contributing to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 9th&nbsp;century.

In the 7th&nbsp;century [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Muslims conquered Syria]] (including [[Jerusalem]]), [[North Africa]] and [[Spain]]. Part of the Muslims' success was due to the exhaustion of the [[Byzantine empire]] in its decades long conflict with [[Persia]].<ref>Mullin, 2008, p. 88.</ref> Beginning in the 8th&nbsp;century, with the rise of [[Carolingian]] leaders, the papacy began to find greater political support in the [[Frankish Kingdom]].<ref>Mullin, 2008, p.&nbsp;93–4.</ref>

The Middle Ages brought about major changes within the church. [[Pope Gregory the Great]] dramatically reformed [[Ecclesiastical polity|ecclesiastical structure]] and administration.<ref>Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 244–47.</ref> In the early 8th&nbsp;century, [[iconoclasm]] became a divisive issue, when it was sponsored by the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] emperors.

In the west, from the 11th&nbsp;century onward, older cathedral schools developed into universities (see [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Paris]], and [[University of Bologna]].) The traditional [[medieval universities]]—evolved from Catholic and Protestant church schools—then established specialized academic structures for properly educating greater numbers of students as [[profession]]als. Prof. Walter Rüegg, editor of ''[[A History of the University in Europe]]'', reports that universities then only trained students to become clerics, lawyers, civil servants, and physicians.<ref>Rudy, ''The Universities of Europe, 1100–1914'', p. 40</ref>

Originally teaching only [[theology]], [[universities]] steadily added subjects including [[medicine]], [[philosophy]] and [[law]], becoming the direct ancestors of modern institutions of learning.<ref>Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 305, 312, 314f..</ref>
The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity|Medieval Christian]] setting.<ref name="Rüegg, Walter 1992, pp. XIX">Rüegg, Walter: "Foreword.

Accompanying the rise of the "new towns" throughout Europe, [[mendicant order]]s were founded, bringing the [[Consecrated life (Catholic Church)|consecrated religious life]] out of the monastery and into the new urban setting. The two principal mendicant movements were the [[Franciscans]]<ref>Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 303–07, 310f., 384–86.</ref> and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]<ref>Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 305, 310f., 316f.</ref> founded by [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] and [[St. Dominic]] respectively. Both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of Europe. Another new order were the [[Cistercians]], whose large isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas. In this period church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights, culminating in the orders of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]] and the building of the great European cathedrals.<ref>Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 321–23, 365f.</ref>

From 1095 under the pontificate of [[Urban II]], the [[Crusades]] were launched.<ref>Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 292–300.</ref> These were a series of military campaigns in the [[Holy Land]] and elsewhere, initiated in response to pleas from the Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I]] for aid against [[Turkish people|Turkish]] expansion. The Crusades ultimately failed to stifle Islamic aggression and even contributed to Christian enmity with the sacking of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]].<ref>Riley-Smith. ''The Oxford History of the Crusades''.</ref>

Over a period stretching from the 7th to the 13th&nbsp;century, the Christian Church underwent gradual alienation, resulting in a [[East-West Schism|schism]] dividing it into a so-called Latin or [[Western Christian]] branch, the Roman Catholic Church,<ref>The Western Church was called Latin at the time by the Eastern Christians and non Christians due to its conducting of its rituals and affairs in the Latin language</ref> and an [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]], largely Greek, branch, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]. These two churches disagree on a number of administrative, liturgical, and doctrinal issues, most notably [[papal primacy|papal primacy of jurisdiction]].<ref name="Orthodox Information Centre-Great Schism">{{cite web|url = http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/greatschism.aspx| title = The Great Schism: The Estrangement of Eastern and Western Christendom|publisher = Orthodox Information Centre|accessdate = 26 May 2007}}</ref><ref name="SandSp91">Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 91</ref> The [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274) and the [[Council of Florence]] (1439) attempted to reunite the churches, but in both cases the Eastern Orthodox refused to implement the decisions and the two principal churches remain in schism to the present day. However, the Roman Catholic Church has achieved union with various [[Eastern Catholic Churches|smaller eastern churches]].

Beginning around 1184, following the crusade against the [[Cathars|Cathar]] heresy,<ref>Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 300, 304–05.</ref> various institutions, broadly referred to as the [[Inquisition]], were established with the aim of suppressing [[heresy]] and securing religious and doctrinal unity within Christianity through [[religious conversion|conversion]] and prosecution.<ref>Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 310, 383, 385, 391.</ref>

===Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation===
[[File:95Thesen.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Martin Luther]] started the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1517 with the [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]], going against the Catholic Church interpretation of the Bible]]
{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Counter-Reformation}}
{{See also|European wars of religion}}

The 15th-century [[Renaissance]] brought about a renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. Another major schism, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], resulted in the splintering of the [[Western Christianity|Western Christendom]] into several branches.<ref name="Simon-120-121">Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. p. 7.</ref> [[Martin Luther]] in 1517 [[95 Theses|protested]] against the sale of [[indulgences]] and soon moved on to deny several key points of Roman Catholic [[doctrine]].<ref name="Simon">Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. pp. 39, 55–61.</ref>

Other reformers like [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], [[John Knox|Knox]] and [[Jacobus Arminius|Arminius]] further criticized Roman Catholic teaching and worship. These challenges developed into the movement called [[Protestantism]], which repudiated the [[papal primacy|primacy of the pope]], the role of tradition, the [[Catholic sacraments|seven sacraments]], and other doctrines and practices.<ref name="Simon" /> The [[English Reformation|Reformation in England]] began in 1534, when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] had himself [[Act of Supremacy|declared head]] of the [[Church of England]]. Beginning in 1536, the monasteries throughout England, Wales and Ireland were [[Dissolution of the monasteries|dissolved]].<ref name="Schama">Schama. ''A History of Britain''. pp. 306–10.</ref>

[[Thomas Müntzer]], [[Andreas Karlstadt]] and other theologians perceived both the Roman Catholic Church and the confessions of the [[Magisterial Reformation]] as corrupted. Their activity brought about the [[Radical Reformation]], which gave birth to various [[Anabaptist]] denominations.

[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned edit.jpg|thumb|230px|Michelangelo's ''Pietà'' in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], The Catholic Church were among the patronage of the [[Renaissance]]<ref name="natgeo 254">National Geographic, 254.</ref><ref>Jensen, De Lamar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe'', ISBN 0-395-88947-2</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Levey|first=Michael|title=Early Renaissance|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1967}}</ref>]]
Partly in response to the Protestant Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal, known as the [[Counter-Reformation]] or Catholic Reform.<ref name="Bokenkotter242">Bokenkotter, ''A Concise History of the Catholic Church'', pp. 242–44.</ref> The [[Council of Trent]] clarified and reasserted Roman Catholic doctrine. During the following centuries, competition between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism became deeply entangled with political struggles among European states.<ref name="Simon3">Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. pp. 109–120.</ref>

Meanwhile, the discovery of America by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 brought about a new wave of missionary activity. Partly from missionary zeal, but under the impetus of [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] by the European powers, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, [[East Asia]], and [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

Throughout Europe, the divides caused by the Reformation led to outbreaks of [[religious violence]] and the establishment of separate state churches in Europe. [[Lutheranism]] spread into northern, central and eastern parts of present-day Germany, [[Livonia]] and Scandinavia. [[Anglicanism]] was established in England in 1534. [[Calvinism]] and its varieties (such as [[Presbyterianism]]) were introduced in [[Scotland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Hungary]], [[Switzerland]] and [[France]]. [[Arminianism]] gained followers in the Netherlands and [[Frisia]]. Ultimately, these differences led to the outbreak of [[religious war|conflicts]] in which religion played a key factor. The [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[English Civil War]], and the [[French Wars of Religion]] are prominent examples. These events intensified the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]].<ref>A general overview about the English discussion is given in Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England 1558–1689''.</ref>

===Post-Enlightenment===
[[File:Madonna and Child, Kakure Kirishitan.jpg|thumb|230px|right|A depiction of [[Madonna and Child]] in a 19th-century [[Kakure Kirishitan]] [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese woodcut]].]]

In the era known as the [[Great Divergence]], when in the West the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Scientific revolution]] brought about great societal changes, Christianity was confronted with various forms of [[skepticism]] and with certain modern [[Ideology|political ideologies]] such as versions of [[socialism]] and [[liberalism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Novak|first=Michael|title=Catholic social thought and liberal institutions: Freedom with justice|year=1988|publisher=Transaction|isbn=978-0-88738-763-0|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pb1GDmxA1UC&pg=PA63}}</ref> Events ranged from mere [[anti-clericalism]] to violent outbursts against Christianity such as the [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|Dechristianisation]] during the [[French Revolution]],<ref>Mortimer Chambers, ''The Western Experience'' (vol. 2) chapter 21.</ref> the [[Spanish Civil War]], and general hostility of [[Marxism|Marxist]] movements, especially [[Russian Revolution (1917)|the Russian Revolution]].

Especially pressing in Europe was the formation of [[nation states]] after the [[Napoleonic era]]. In all European countries, different Christian denominations found themselves in competition, to greater or lesser extents, with each other and with the state. Variables are the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious, political, and ideological orientation of the state. Urs Altermatt of the [[University of Fribourg]], looking specifically at Catholicisms in Europe, identifies four models for the European nations. In traditionally Catholic countries such as [[Belgium]], [[Spain]], and to some extent [[Austria]], religious and national communities are more or less identical. Cultural symbiosis and separation are found in [[Poland]], [[Ireland]], and [[Switzerland]], all countries with competing denominations. Competition is found in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and again Switzerland, all countries with minority Catholic populations who to a greater or lesser extent did identify with the nation. Finally, separation between religion (again, specifically Catholicism) and the state is found to a great degree in France and [[Italy]], countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite book|last=Altermatt|first=Urs|title=Religion und Nation: Katholizismen im Europa des 19. und 20. Jahrhundert|year=2007|publisher=Kohlhammer|isbn=978-3-17-019977-4|pages=15–34|editor=Urs Altermatt, Franziska Metzger|language=German|chapter=Katholizismus und Nation: Vier Modelle in europäisch-vergleichender Perspektive}}</ref>

The combined factors of the formation of nation states and [[ultramontanism]], especially in Germany and the Netherlands but also in [[England]] (to a much lesser extent<ref>{{cite book|last=Heimann|first=Mary|title=Catholic Devotion in Victorian England|year=1995|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0-19-820597-X|pages=165–73}}</ref>), often forced Catholic churches, organizations, and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the Church, specifically the papacy. This conflict came to a head in the [[First Vatican Council]], and in Germany would lead directly to the [[Kulturkampf]], where liberals and Protestants under the leadership of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] managed to severely restrict Catholic expression and organization.

Christian commitment in Europe dropped as modernity and secularism came into their own in Europe,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197 | work=BBC News | title=Religion may become extinct in nine nations, study says | date=22 March 2011}}</ref> particularly in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Estonia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/~honkawa/9460.html |title=図録▽世界各国の宗教 |publisher=.ttcn.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> while religious commitments in America have been generally high in comparison to Europe. The late 20th&nbsp;century has shown the shift of Christian adherence to the Third World and southern hemisphere in general, with the [[western civilization]] no longer the chief standard bearer of Christianity.

Some Europeans (including diaspora), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], and natives of other continents have revived their respective peoples' historical folk religions. Approximately 7.1 to 10% of [[Arabs]] are [[Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians|Christians]]<ref name=Pacini>{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink=Philippe Fargues |title=Christian Communities in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |doi= |isbn=0-19-829388-7 |author= ed. by Andrea Pacini}}</ref> most prevalent in Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.

In addition to the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] (or Calvinist) branches of the Reformation, there is [[Anglicanism]] after the [[English Reformation]]. The [[Anabaptist]] tradition was largely ostracized by the other Protestant parties at the time, but has achieved a measure of affirmation in more recent history. [[Adventist]], [[Baptist]], [[Methodist]], [[Pentecostal]] and [[List of Christian denominations#Protestantism|other Protestant]] confessions arose in the following centuries.

As well as these modern divisions, there were many diverse Christian communities with wildly different Christologies, eschatologies, soteriologies, and cosmologies that existed alongside the "Early Church" which is itself a projected concept to indicate which communities were "proto-orthodox", in that their views would become dominate. In many ways, the first three centuries of Christianity was significantly more diverse than the modern Church.<ref>{{cite book | first=Bart D.|last=Ehrman|authorlink=Bart D.

A number of conflicts with Western Christianity over questions of doctrine and authority culminated in the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]].

===Protestant===
{{Main|Protestantism}}
{{See also|History of Protestantism}}
{{Protestantism}}

In the 16th&nbsp;century, [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and [[John Calvin]] inaugurated what has come to be called [[Protestantism]]. Luther's primary theological heirs are known as [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]. Zwingli and Calvin's heirs are far broader denominationally, and are broadly referred to as the [[Reformed|Reformed tradition]].<ref name="McManners251">McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. pp. 251–59.</ref> The oldest Protestant groups separated from the Catholic Church in the [[Protestant Reformation]], often followed by further divisions.<ref name="McManners251"/>

Estimates of the total number of Protestants are very uncertain, but it seems clear that Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians after Roman Catholicism in number of followers (although the Eastern Orthodox Church is larger than any single Protestant denomination).<ref name="Adherents" /> Often that number is put at more than 800 million, corresponding to nearly 40% of world's Christians.<ref name="pewforum1">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2011/12/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf |title=Pewforum: Christianity (2010) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> The majority of Protestants are members of just a handful of denominational families, i.e. [[Adventism|Adventists]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Baptists]], [[Calvinism|Reformed (Calvinists)]],<ref>This branch was first called Calvinism by Lutherans who opposed it, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word ''Reformed''. It includes [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].</ref> [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]].<ref name="pewforum1"/> [[Nondenominational Christianity|Nondenominational]], [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]], [[Neo-charismatic churches|neo-charismatic]], independent and other churches are on the rise, and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity.<ref>[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/church-families/evangelical-churches World Council of Churches: Evangelical churches]: "Evangelical churches have grown exponentially in the second half of the 20th century and continue to show great vitality, especially in the global South. This resurgence may in part be explained by the phenomenal growth of Pentecostalism and the emergence of the charismatic movement, which are closely associated with evangelicalism. However, there can be no doubt that the evangelical tradition "per se" has become one of the major components of world Christianity. Evangelicals also constitute sizable minorities in the traditional Protestant and Anglican churches. In regions like Africa and Latin America, the boundaries between "evangelical" and "mainline" are rapidly changing and giving way to new ecclesial realities."</ref>

A special grouping are the Anglican churches descended from the [[Church of England]] and organised in the [[Anglican Communion]]. Some Anglican churches consider themselves both Protestant and Catholic.<ref>Sykes/Booty/Knight. ''The Study of Anglicanism'', p. 219.</ref> Some Anglicans consider their church a [[Branch theory|branch of the "One Holy Catholic Church"]] alongside of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, a concept rejected by the Roman Catholic Church and some Eastern Orthodox.<ref>Gregory Hallam, ''[http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/ecumenical/hallam_orthodoxy_ecumenism.htm Orthodoxy and Ecumenism]''.</ref><ref>Gregory Mathewes-Green, "[http://www.westernorthodox.com/branch.html Whither the Branch Theory?]", ''Anglican Orthodox Pilgrim'' Vol. 2, No. 4. {{wayback|url=http://www.westernorthodox.com/branch.html |date=20120519104645 }}</ref>

While Anglicans, Lutherans and the Reformed branches of Protestantism originated in the [[Magisterial Reformation]], other Protestant groups such as the [[Anabaptists]] (including [[Mennonites]] and [[Hutterites]]), originated in the [[Radical Reformation]] and are distinguished by their belief in [[credobaptism]].<ref name="BenedettoDuke2008">{{cite book|last1=Benedetto|first1=Robert|last2=Duke|first2=James O.|title=The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History|accessdate=27 August 2015|year=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664224165|page=22}}</ref>

Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as "Christians" or "[[born-again]] Christians". They typically distance themselves from the [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]] and/or [[creed]]alism of other Christian communities<ref>Confessionalism is a term employed by historians to refer to "the creation of fixed identities and systems of beliefs for separate churches which had previously been more fluid in their self-understanding, and which had not begun by seeking separate identities for themselves—they had wanted to be truly Catholic and reformed." (MacCulloch, ''The Reformation: A History'', p. xxiv.)</ref> by calling themselves "[[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]]" or "[[evangelical]]". Often founded by individual pastors, they have little affiliation with historic denominations.<ref name="Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life / U.S. Religious Landscape Survey">{{cite web|url =http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-appendix3.pdf |title = Classification of Protestant Denominations|publisher = Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life / U.S. Religious Landscape Survey|accessdate = 27 September 2009}}</ref>

The [[Second Great Awakening]], a period of religious revival that occurred in the United States during the early 1800s, saw the development of a number of unrelated churches. They generally saw themselves as [[Restorationism|restoring]] the original church of Jesus Christ rather than reforming one of the existing churches.<ref>McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 91f.</ref> A common belief held by Restorationists was that the other divisions of Christianity had introduced doctrinal defects into Christianity, which was known as the [[Great Apostasy]].<ref name="Religious Tolerance—Restorationism">{{cite web|url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/chrrest.htm| title = The Restorationist Movements|publisher = Religious Tolerance|accessdate = 31 December 2007}}</ref><ref name="Got Questions Ministries—Restorationism">{{cite web|url = http://www.gotquestions.org/restorationism.html| title = What is Restorationism?|publisher = Got Questions Ministries|accessdate = 31 December 2007}}</ref> In Asia, [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] is a known restorationist religion that was established during the early 1900s.

Some of the churches originating during this period are historically connected to early 19th-century camp meetings in the Midwest and Upstate New York. American [[Millennialism]] and [[Adventist|Adventism]], which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, influenced the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] movement and, as a reaction specifically to [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]. Others, including the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]],<ref>Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (2004)</ref><ref>Melton's Encyclopedia of American Religions (2009)</ref> [[Churches of Christ]], and the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]], have their roots in the contemporaneous Stone-Campbell [[Restoration Movement]], which was centered in Kentucky and Tennessee. Other groups originating in this time period include the [[Christadelphians]] and [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. While the churches originating in the Second Great Awakening have some superficial similarities, their doctrine and practices vary significantly.

[[Messianic Judaism]] (or Messianic Movement) is the name of a Christian movement comprising a number of streams, whose members may consider themselves Jewish. It blends elements of religious [[Judaism|Jewish]] practice with evangelical Christianity. Messianic Judaism affirms Christian creeds such as the messiahship and divinity of "[[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]]" (the Hebrew name of Jesus) and the Triune Nature of God, while also adhering to some Jewish dietary laws and customs.

[[Western culture]], throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to [[Christian culture]], and many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as cultural Christians.

==Ecumenism==
{{Main|Ecumenism}}
[[File:Taizé prayer.JPG|thumb|left|Ecumenical worship service at the [[monastery]] of [[Taizé]] in France]]

Christian groups and denominations have long expressed ideals of being reconciled, and in the 20th&nbsp;century, Christian [[ecumenism]] advanced in two ways.<ref name="McManners581">McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', pp. 581–84.</ref> One way was greater cooperation between groups, such as the [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]] of Protestants in 1910, the Justice, Peace and Creation Commission of the [[World Council of Churches]] founded in 1948 by Protestant and Orthodox churches, and similar national councils like the [[National Council of Churches in Australia]] which includes Roman Catholics.<ref name="McManners581"/>

The other way was institutional union with new [[United and uniting churches]]. Congregationalist, Methodist and Presbyterian churches united in 1925 to form the [[United Church of Canada]],<ref>McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. p. 413f.</ref> and in 1977 to form the [[Uniting Church in Australia]]. The [[Church of South India]] was formed in 1947 by the union of Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, and Presbyterian churches.<ref>McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 498.</ref>

The ecumenical, [[monasticism|monastic]] [[Taizé Community]] is notable for being composed of more than one hundred [[monk|brothers]] from Protestant and Catholic traditions.<ref name="taize">{{cite book|title=The Oxford companion to Christian thought|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198600244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ognCKztR8a4C&pg=PA694|accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> The community emphasizes the reconciliation of all denominations and its main church, located in [[Taizé, Saône-et-Loire]], France, is named the "Church of Reconciliation".<ref name="taize" /> The community is internationally known, attracting over 100,000 young pilgrims annually.<ref>Oxford, "Encyclopedia Of Christianity, pg. 307.</ref>

==Criticism and apologetics==
{{Main|Criticism of Christianity|Christian apologetics}}
[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A copy of the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', a famous Christian apologetic work.]]
Criticism of Christianity and Christians goes back to the [[Apostolic age]], with the New Testament recording friction between the followers of Jesus and the [[Pharisees]] and [[scribes]] (e.g. {{Bibleref||Matthew|15:1-20|NIV}} and {{Bibleref||Mark|7:1–23|NIV}}).<ref>''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982 ISBN 0-8028-3782-4 page 175</ref> In the 2nd&nbsp;century, Christianity was criticized by the Jews on various grounds, e.g. that the prophecies of the Hebrew Bible could not have been fulfilled by Jesus, given that he did not have a successful life.<ref>''Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D. 70 to 135'' by James D. G. Dunn 1999 ISBN 0-8028-4498-7 pages&nbsp;112–113</ref> By the 3rd&nbsp;century, criticism of Christianity had mounted, partly as a defense against it, and the 15-volume ''Adversus Christianos'' by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] was written as a comprehensive attack on Christianity, in part building on the pre-Christian concepts of [[Plotinus]].<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Christian Literature, Volume 1'' by George Thomas Kurian and James Smith 2010 ISBN 0-8108-6987-X page 527</ref><ref>''Apologetic Discourse and the Scribal Tradition'' by Wayne Campbell Kannaday 2005 ISBN 90-04-13085-3 pages&nbsp;32–33</ref>

By the 12th century, the [[Mishneh Torah]] (i.e., [[Rabbi]] [[Moses Maimonides]]) was criticizing Christianity on the grounds of idol worship, in that Christians attributed divinity to Jesus who had a physical body.<ref>''A Dictionary Of Jewish-Christian Relations'' by Edward Kessler, Neil Wenborn 2005 ISBN 0-521-82692-6 page 168</ref> In the 19th&nbsp;century, [[Nietzsche]] began to write a series of polemics on the "unnatural" teachings of Christianity (e.g. sexual abstinence), and continued his criticism of Christianity to the end of his life.<ref>''The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche'' by Bernd Magnus, Kathleen Marie Higgins 1996 ISBN 0-521-36767-0 pages&nbsp;90–93</ref> In the 20th&nbsp;century, the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] expressed his criticism of Christianity in ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'', formulating his rejection of Christianity in the setting of logical arguments.<ref>''Russell on Religion: Selections from the Writings of Bertrand Russell'' by Bertrand Russell, Stefan Andersson and Louis Greenspan 1999 ISBN 0-415-18091-0 pages&nbsp;77–87</ref>

Criticism of Christianity continues to date, e.g. [[Jewish]] and [[Muslim]] theologians criticize the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] held by most Christians, stating that this doctrine in effect assumes that there are three Gods, running against the basic tenet of [[monotheism]].<ref>''Christianity: An Introduction'' by Alister E. McGrath 2006 ISBN 1-4051-0899-1 pp.&nbsp;125–126.</ref> New Testament scholar [[Robert M. Price]] has outlined the possibility that some Bible stories are based partly on myth in "The Christ Myth Theory and its problems".<ref>" The Christ Myth Theory and its Problems ", published 2011 by American Atheist press, Cranford, New Jersey, ISBN 1-57884-017-1</ref>

Christian apologetics aims to present a [[reason|rational]] basis for Christianity. The word "apologetic" comes from the Greek word "apologeomai", meaning "in defense of". Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries, starting with Paul the Apostle. The philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] presented five arguments for God's existence in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', while his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' was a major apologetic work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dulles|first=Avery Robert Cardinal|title=A History of Apologetics|year=2005|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-89870-933-4|page=120}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Classical Readings in Christian Apologetics|year=1983|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0-310-45641-X|editor=L Russ Bush|page=275}}</ref> Another famous apologist, [[G. K. Chesterton]], wrote in the early twentieth century about the benefits of religion and, specifically, Christianity. Famous for his use of paradox, Chesterton explained that while Christianity had the most mysteries, it was the most practical religion.<ref>(http://www.chesterton.org/why-i-believe-in-christianity/)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Hauser, Chris (History major, Dartmouth College class of 2014)|date=Fall 2011|title=Faith and Paradox: G.K.

John Lennox, a mathematician at the University of Oxford, tells us that 'even if the non-believers don't like it, the Big Bang fits in exactly with the Christan narrative of creation'. ... William Lane Craig is another who claims that the Biblical account is corroborated by Big Bang cosmology. Lane Craig also claims that there is a prior ''proof'' that there is a God who created this universe.}}</ref>
