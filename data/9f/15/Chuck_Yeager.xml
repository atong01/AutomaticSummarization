During his stay with the<space/><italics>Maquis</italics>, Yeager assisted the guerrillas in duties that did not involve direct combat, although he did help to construct bombs for the group, a skill that he had learned from his father.<extension extension_name='ref' name="yeagerbio_45">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 45.</extension><space/>He was awarded the<space/><link><target>Bronze Star Medal</target><part>Bronze Star</part></link><space/>for helping another airman, who had lost part of his leg during the escape attempt, to cross the<space/><link><target>Pyrenees</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite a regulation prohibiting &quot;evaders&quot; (escaped pilots) from flying over enemy territory again, the purpose of which was to prevent a second capture from compromising resistance groups, Yeager was reinstated to flying combat. He had joined another evader, bomber pilot Captain Fred Glover, in speaking directly to the<space/><link><target>Supreme Allied Commander</target></link>, General<space/><link><target>Dwight D. Eisenhower</target></link>, on<space/><template><target>nowrap</target><arg>June 12</arg></template>, 1944. With Glover pleading their case, they argued that because the Allies had invaded France and the<space/><italics>Maquis</italics><space/>resistance movement was by then openly fighting the Nazis alongside Allied troops, if Yeager or Glover were shot down again, there was little about those who had previously helped them evade capture that could be revealed to the enemy.</paragraph><paragraph>Eisenhower, after gaining permission from the War Department to decide the requests, concurred with Yeager and Glover. Yeager later credited his postwar success in the Air Force to this decision, saying that his test pilot career followed naturally from his having been a decorated combat pilot, along with having been an aircraft mechanic before attending pilot school. In part, because of his maintenance background, he also frequently served as a maintenance officer in his flying units.</paragraph><paragraph>Yeager demonstrated outstanding flying skills and combat leadership. On<space/><template><target>nowrap</target><arg>October 12</arg></template>, 1944, he became the first pilot in his group to make &quot;<link><target>ace in a day</target></link>,&quot; downing five enemy aircraft in a single mission. Two of these kills were scored without firing a single shot: when he flew into firing position against a<space/><link><target>Messerschmitt Bf 109</target></link>, the pilot of the aircraft panicked, breaking to starboard and colliding with his wingman. Yeager later reported both pilots bailed out. He finished the war with 11.5 official victories, including one of the first air-to-air victories over a jet fighter (a German<space/><link><target>Messerschmitt Me 262</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>Another victory, which was not officially counted for Yeager, came during the period before his combat status was reinstated. In his biography Yeager reveals an incident that occurred during a training flight in his P-51 over the<space/><link><target>North Sea</target></link><space/>when he was ordered to fly top cover for the crew of a downed<space/><link><target>Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</target></link>. He spotted a German<space/><link><target>Junkers Ju 88</target></link><space/>at great distance flying in his general direction. Apparently, when the crew of the Ju-88 saw Yeager and his wingman they turned and ran for the coast line. Yeager abandoned his station to chase after the Ju-88 which he downed as it crossed the beach. Yeager could provide no factual evidence to support his assertion, but explained his conduct by claiming the Ju-88 must have been there to attack the men in the water, and many authors have since chosen to repeat this unsupported claim as fact. Ju-88s were often used in the daylight battles against the allied bomber streams to keep contact with the formations and search for downed pilots at sea. Yeager says that he was chewed out for his conduct. Because he was not yet cleared for flying combat again, his gun camera film and credit for the kill were given to his wingman, Eddie Simpson. (Yeager later mistakenly recalled that the credit had given Simpson his fifth kill.)</paragraph><paragraph>In his 1986 memoirs, Yeager recalled with disgust that &quot;atrocities were committed by both sides&quot; and went on to recount going on a mission with orders from the<space/><link><target>Eighth Air Force</target></link><space/>to &quot;strafe anything that moved.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Wolfgang W.

The pair started dating shortly thereafter, and married in August 2003.<extension extension_name='ref' name='LAT'></extension><space/>Subsequent to the commencement of their relationship, a bitter dispute arose between Yeager, his children and D'Angelo. The children contended that D'Angelo, 41 years Yeager's junior, had married him for his fortune. Yeager and D'Angelo both denied the charge. Litigation ensued, in which his children accused D'Angelo of &quot;undue influence&quot; on Yeager, and Yeager accused his children of diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars from his pension fund.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Tresniowski"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name='LAT'>Hubler, Shawn.<space/><link type='external' href='http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/02/entertainment/et-hubler2'>&quot;Far from heavens.&quot;</link><space/><italics><link><target>Los Angeles Times</target></link>,</italics><space/>July 2, 2004.
