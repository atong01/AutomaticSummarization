'''Alphonse Gabriel "Al" Capone''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|_|k|ə|ˈ|p|oʊ|n}}; January 17, 1899&nbsp;– January 25, 1947) was an American [[gangster]] who attained fame during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]] as the co-founder and boss of the [[Chicago Outfit]]. His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33 years old.

Capone was born in the [[Brooklyn|borough of Brooklyn]] in [[New York City]] to [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]]. He was considered a [[Five Points Gang]] member who became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels. In his early twenties, he moved to [[Chicago]] and became bodyguard and trusted factotum for [[Johnny Torrio]], head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol &ndash; the forerunner of the Outfit &ndash; and that was politically protected through the [[Unione Siciliana]]. A conflict with the [[North Side Gang]] was instrumental in Capone's rise and fall. Torrio went into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him, handing control to Capone. Capone expanded the bootlegging business through increasingly violent means, but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor [[William Hale Thompson]] and the city's police meant that Capone seemed safe from law enforcement. 

Capone apparently reveled in attention, such as the cheers from spectators when he appeared at ball games. He made donations to various charities and was viewed by many to be a "modern-day [[Robin Hood]]". However, the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]] of gang rivals from the North Side Gang damaged Chicago's image, leading influential citizens to demand governmental action.

The federal authorities became intent on jailing Capone, and they prosecuted him for tax evasion in 1931. The case was  highly politicized and both prosecutors and judge later received preferment. Capone had made admissions of his income during prior negotiations (which ultimately were abortive) to pay the government any back taxes that he owed. The judge deemed these statements usable as evidence at the trial, and refused to let Capone plead guilty for a lighter sentence. The effect of such decisions by the judge was added to by the incompetence of Capone's defense attorneys. Capone was convicted and sentenced to a record-breaking 11 years in [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]]. He replaced his old defense team with experts in tax law, and his grounds for appeal were strengthened by a Supreme Court ruling, but the judges decided in his disfavor, perhaps in part because of Capone's status as a symbol of criminality. 

He was already showing signs of syphilitic [[dementia]] early in his sentence, and he became increasingly debilitated before being released after eight years. On January 25, 1947, Capone died of [[cardiac arrest]] after suffering a stroke. Capone's conviction had negligible effect on the prevalence of organized crime in Chicago.

==Early life==
[[File:Al Capone mother.jpg|thumb|upright|Albert Francis "Sonny" Capone with his mother, Teresa]]
Alphonse Gabriel Capone was born in the borough of [[Brooklyn]] in New York on January 17, 1899.<ref name="CAPONE"/> His parents were Italian immigrants Gabriele Capone (December 12, 1865 – November 14, 1920) and Teresina (née Raiola; December 28, 1867 – November 29, 1952). His father was a [[barber]] and his mother was a [[sewing|seamstress]], both born in [[Angri]], a town in the [[Province of Salerno]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.letrescimmiette.info/curiosita-domande-e-stranezze-ad-angri/item/853-angri-le-origini-angresi-di-al-capone.html|title=Al Capone, il gangster  americano piu' famoso del mondo era di origini angresi|author=Super User|date=|work=letrescimmiette.info|accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Capone|last=Kobler|first=John|year=1971|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn= 0-306-80499-9|page= 23}}</ref>

Gabriele and Teresa had nine children: Alphonse "Al" Capone; [[James Capone|James Vincenzo Capone]], who later changed his name to Richard Hart and ironically became a Prohibition agent in [[Homer, Nebraska]]; [[Ralph Capone|Raffaele James Capone]], AKA Ralph "Bottles" Capone, who took charge of his brother's beverage industry; [[Frank Capone|Salvatore "Frank" Capone]], John Capone, Albert Capone, Matthew Capone, Rose Capone, and Mafalda Capone (who married John J. Maritote). His two brothers [[Ralph Capone|Ralph]] and [[Frank Capone|Frank]] worked with him in his criminal empire. Frank did so until his death on April 1, 1924. Ralph ran the bottling companies (both legal and illegal) early on, and was also the front man for the [[Chicago Outfit]] for some time until he was imprisoned for tax evasion in 1932. 

The Capone family immigrated to the United States, first immigrating from Italy to Fiume, [[Austria-Hungary]] (present day [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]) in 1893, traveling on a ship to the U.S., and finally settling at 95 Navy Street,<ref name="CAPONE">{{cite book |last=Schoenberg |first=Robert L. |title= Mr. Capone|year= 1992 |publisher=William Morrow and Company|location=[[New York City|New York]], New York|isbn=0-688-12838-6| pages=18–19|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U7VAcMdddNkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=al+capone}}</ref> in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|Navy Yard]] section of [[downtown Brooklyn]]. Gabriele Capone worked at a nearby barber shop at 29 Park Avenue.<ref name="CAPONE"/> When Al was 11, the Capone family moved to 38 Garfield Place<ref name="CAPONE"/> in [[Park Slope]], Brooklyn.

Capone showed promise as a student, but had trouble with the rules at his strict parochial [[Catholic school]]. He dropped out of school at the age of 14, after being expelled for hitting a female teacher in the face.<ref name="Biography Channel"/> He worked at odd jobs around Brooklyn, including a candy store and a [[bowling alley]].<ref>Kobler, 27.</ref> During this time, Capone was influenced by gangster [[Johnny Torrio]], whom he came to regard as a mentor.<ref>Kobler, 26.</ref>

==Career==
Capone initially became involved with small-time gangs that included the Junior Forty Thieves and the Bowery Boys. He then joined the Brooklyn Rippers, and then the powerful [[Five Points Gang]] based in Lower Manhattan. During this time, he was employed and mentored by fellow racketeer [[Frankie Yale]], a [[bartender]] in a [[Coney Island]] dance hall and saloon called the Harvard Inn. Capone inadvertently insulted a woman while working the door at a Brooklyn night club and was slashed by her brother Frank Gallucio. The wounds led to the nickname that Capone loathed: "Scarface".<ref name="five families book">{{cite book

===Marriage and family===
Capone married Mae Josephine Coughlin on December 30, 1918 at age 19. She was Irish Catholic and, earlier that month, had given birth to their son Albert Francis "Sonny" Capone. Capone was under the age of 21, so his parents had to consent to the marriage in writing.<ref>{{cite book|title=Al Capone: A Biography|author=Luciano J.

===Chicago===
At about 20 years of age, Capone left New York for [[Chicago]] at the invitation of [[Johnny Torrio]], who was imported by [[Rum-running|bootlegger]] [[Jim Colosimo|James "Big Jim" Colosimo]] as an enforcer. Capone began in Chicago as a bouncer in a brothel, where he contracted [[syphilis]]. Timely use of [[Arsphenamine|Salvarsan]] probably could have cured the infection, but he apparently never sought treatment.<ref>Get Capone: The Secret Plot That Captured America's Most Wanted

Chicago's location on Lake Michigan gave access to a vast inland territory, and it was well-served by railroads. Torrio took over Colosimo's crime empire after Colosimo's murder on May 11, 1920, in which Capone was suspected of being involved.<ref name="Biography Channel">{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/notorious/crimefiles.do?catId=259452&action=view&profileId=262834 |title=Notorious Crime Files: Al Capone |accessdate=2010-11-12 |publisher=Biography.com |work=[[The Biography Channel]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110727215147/http://www.biography.com/notorious/crimefiles.do?action=view&profileId=262834&catId=259452 |archivedate=27 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first= Marilyn |last= Bardsley|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/capone/chicago_5.html|title=Chicago|accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher= Crime Library|work= Al Capone}}</ref><ref>Kobler, 37.</ref>

Torrio headed an essentially Italian organized crime group that was the biggest in the city, with Capone as his right-hand man. He was wary of being drawn into gang wars and tried to negotiate agreements over territory between rival crime groups. The smaller, mixed ethnicity, [[North Side Gang]] led by [[Dean O'Banion]] (also known as Dion O'Banion) came under pressure from the Genna brothers, who were allied with Torrio. O'Banion found that, for all Torrio's pretensions to be a settler of disputes, he was unhelpful with the encroachment of the Gennas into the North Side.<ref>{{cite book |title= Capone: The Man and the Era|last= Bergreen|first= Laurence|year= 1994|publisher= Simon and Schuster Paperbacks|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-684-82447-5|pages= 131–132}}</ref> In a fateful step, Torrio either arranged for or acquiesced to the murder of O'Banion at the latter's flower shop in October 1924.

Weiss had been a close friend of O'Banion, and the North Siders treated revenge on his killers as a priority.<ref>Bergreen, pp&nbsp;134–135</ref><ref>Bergreen, p. 138</ref><ref name="myalcaponemuseum.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id89.htm|title=Hymie Weiss|publisher=}}</ref>

===Boss===

In January 1925, Capone was ambushed, leaving him shaken but unhurt. Twelve days later, Torrio was returning from a shopping trip when he was shot several times. After recovering, Torrio effectively resigned and handed control to Capone, age 26, who became the new boss of an organization that took in illegal breweries and a transportation network that reached to Canada, with political and law-enforcement protection. In turn, he was able to use more violence to increase revenue. Refusal by an establishment to purchase liquor from him often resulted in the premises being blown up. As many as 100 people were killed in such bombings during the 1920s. Rivals saw Capone as responsible for the  proliferation of brothels in the city.<ref name="myalcaponemuseum.com"/><ref>Sifakis, Carl, ''The Mafia Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p.362</ref><ref>Russo, Gus, ''The Outfit'', Bloomsbury (2001), pp.39,40</ref><ref>Disasters and Tragic Events, edited by Mitchell Newton-Matza p258</ref>

Capone indulged in custom suits, cigars, gourmet food and drink (his preferred liquor was [[Templeton Rye]] from [[Iowa]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavytable.com/templeton-rye-of-templeton-iowa/|title=Templeton Rye of Templeton, Iowa|last=Walker|first=Jason|date=2009-07-07|accessdate=2010-12-04|publisher=Heavy Table| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101125042146/http://heavytable.com/templeton-rye-of-templeton-iowa/| archivedate= 25 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref>), and female companionship. He was particularly known for his flamboyant and costly jewelry. His favorite responses to questions about his activities were: "I am just a businessman, giving the people what they want"; and, "All I do is satisfy a public demand." Capone had become a national celebrity and talking point.<ref name="five families book"/>

Capone based himself in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] after using bribery and widespread intimidation to take over during elections for the town council. This made it difficult for the North Siders to target him.<ref name="five families book"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Added by bob armour |url=http://timelines.com/1923/al-capone-moves-his-gangs-headquarters-to-cicero-illinois |title=Al Capone moves his gang's headquarters to Cicero, Illinois |publisher=Timelines.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> Capone's driver was found tortured and murdered, and there was an attempt on Weiss's life in the [[Chicago Loop]]. On September 20, 1926, the North Side Gang used a ploy outside the Capone headquarters at the Hawthorne Inn, aimed at drawing him to the windows. Gunmen in several cars then opened fire with [[Thompson submachine gun]]s and shotguns at the windows of the first-floor restaurant. Capone was unhurt and called for a truce, but the negotiations fell through. Three weeks later, Weiss was killed outside the former O'Banion flower shop North Side headquarters. In January 1927, the Hawthorne's restaurant owner, a friend of Capone's, was kidnapped and killed by Moran and Drucci.<ref>Russo, Gus, ''The Outfit'', Bloomsbury (2001), p.37</ref><ref name="CBS">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-5369641-504083.html |title=Al Capone's Couderay, Wisconsin Hideout Home for Sale; Asking Price $2.6M |publisher=CBS News |date=7 October 2009 |accessdate=20 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120212125601/http://www.cbsnews.com:80/8301-504083_162-5369641-504083.html |archivedate=12 February 2012 }}</ref>

In 1928, Capone paid $40,000 to beer magnate August Busch for a 14-room retreat at 93 Palm Avenue on [[Palm Island (Miami Beach)|Palm Island, Florida]], in [[Biscayne Bay]] between [[Miami]] and [[Miami Beach]].<ref name="five families book"/> Capone never registered any property under his name.

===Political alliances===
The protagonists of Chicago's politics had long been associated with questionable methods, and even newspaper circulation "wars", but the need for bootleggers to have protection in city hall introduced a far more serious level of violence and graft. Capone is generally seen as having an appreciable effect in bringing about the victories of Republican [[William Hale Thompson]], especially in the 1927 mayoral race when Thompson campaigned for a wide open town, at one time hinting that he'd reopen illegal saloons.<ref name="big_bill_232_244">{{cite book|last=Wendt|first=Lloyd|title=Big Bill of Chicago|year=1953|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|pages=232–244|author2=Herman Kogan }}</ref> Such a proclamation helped his campaign gain the support of Capone, and he allegedly accepted a contribution of $250,000 from the gangster.

Capone continued to back Thompson. Voting booths were targeted by Capone's bomber [[James Belcastro]] in the wards where Thompson's opponents were thought to have support, on the polling day of April 10, 1928, in the so-called [[Pineapple Primary]], causing the deaths of at least 15 people. Belcastro was also accused of the murder of lawyer Octavius Granady, an African American who challenged Thompson's candidate for the African American vote, and was chased through the streets on polling day by cars of gunmen before being shot dead. Four policemen were among those charged along with Belcastro, but all charges were dropped after key witnesses recanted their statements. An indication of the attitude of local law enforcement to Capone's organization came in 1931 when Belcastro was wounded in a shooting; police suggested to skeptical journalists that Belcastro was an independent operator.<ref>Sifakis, Carl, ''The Mafia Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp.291,292</ref><ref>Russo, Gus, ''The Outfit'', Bloomsbury (2001), pp.38,39</ref><ref>The Evening Independent - Jan 12, 1931, AP, Career of Chicago bomb king halted by bullets</ref><ref>The Afro American - Oct 12, 1929, Chicargo (ANP)Police Named In Granady Killing,</ref><ref>The Outfit: The Role Of Chicago's Underworld In The Shaping Of Modern America

The 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre led to public disquiet about Thompson's alliance with Capone and was a factor in [[Anton J. Cermak]] winning the mayoral election on April 6, 1931.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com">{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-03-07/news/ct-met-kass-0307-20130307_1_chicago-way-anton-cermak-chicago-politics|title=Cermak's death offers lesson in Chicago Way|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=March 7, 2013|author=Kass, John}}</ref>

===Saint Valentine's Day Massacre===

[[File:Valentine Day massacre.jpg|thumb|The St. Valentine's Day Massacre damaged Capone's image in the public mind]]

Capone was widely assumed to have been responsible for ordering the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre in an attempt to kill [[Bugs Moran]], the head of the North Side Gang. Moran was the last survivor of the main North Side gunmen; his succession had come about because his similarly aggressive predecessors [[Vincent Drucci]] and [[Hymie Weiss]] had been killed in the violence that followed the murder of original leader [[Dean O'Banion]].<ref name="five families book"/><ref>[http://www.bugsmoran.net/northsiders/drucci.html Bugs Moran Online]</ref><ref>[http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id111.htm ''My Al Capone Museum''] [http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id111.htm "Vincent 'The Schemer' Drucci"], Mario Gomes, accessed 2/7/14</ref>

To monitor their targets' habits and movements, Capone's men rented an apartment across from the trucking warehouse and garage at 2122 North Clark Street that served as Moran headquarters. On the morning of Thursday, February 14, 1929, Capone's lookouts signaled gunmen disguised as police to start a "raid." The ''faux'' police lined the seven victims along a wall without a struggle, then signaled for accomplices with machine guns. The seven victims were machine-gunned and shot-gunned. Photos of the victims shocked the public and damaged Capone's reputation. Within days, Capone received a summons to testify before a Chicago grand jury on violations of the federal Prohibition Law, but he claimed to be too unwell to attend at that time.<ref>Capone: The Man and the Era, by Laurence Bergreen, p. 418</ref>

In April 1930, Capone was arrested on vagrancy charges when visiting Miami Beach, the governor having ordered sheriffs to run him out of the state.

In 1927, the Supreme Court ruled that illegally earned income was subject to income tax; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] rejected the argument that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protected criminals from reporting illegal income.<ref>Capone: The Man and the Era - Page 224</ref> The IRS special investigation unit chose [[Frank J. Wilson]] to investigate Capone, with the focus on his spending. The key to Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was  tried for tax evasion in 1930. Ralph spent the next three years in prison after being convicted in a two-week trial over which Wilkerson presided.<ref>Al Capone: Chicago's King of Crime, by Nate Hendley, p. 108</ref> Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. Crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income that Capone was willing to pay tax on for various years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance. Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years. In 1931, Capone was charged with [[income tax evasion]], as well as with various violations of the [[Volstead Act]] (Prohibition) at the [[Chicago Federal Building]] in the courtroom of Judge [[James Herbert Wilkerson]].<ref name="court">{{cite web| title= Visitors to the Court-Historic Trials| publisher=US District Court-Northern District of Illinois| date=| accessdate=2011-02-10|url=http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/CourtHouseVisitors.aspx}}</ref> U. S. Attorney George E. Q. Johnson agreed to a deal that he hoped might result in the judge giving Capone a couple of years, but Judge Wilkerson had been aware of the deal all along and refused to allow Capone to plead guilty for a reduced sentence. On the second day of the trial, Judge Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his client, saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so at his own risk. Wilkerson deemed that the 1930 letter to federal authorities could be admitted into evidence from a lawyer acting for Capone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id146.htm |title=Al Capone's tax trial and downfall |publisher=Myalcaponemuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/capone/caponeaccount.html |title=Al Capone Trial (1931): An Account by Douglas O.

Much was later made of other evidence, such as witnesses and ledgers, but these strongly implied Capone's control rather than stating it. The ledgers were inadmissible on grounds of statute of limitations, but Capone's lawyers incompetently failed to make the necessary timely objection; they also ran a basically irrelevant defense of gambling losses.<ref>Al Capone: A Biography By Luciano J. Iorizzo p81</ref> Judge Wilkerson allowed Capone's spending to be presented at very great length. There was no doubt that Capone ''spent'' vast sums but, legally speaking, the case against him centered on the size of his ''income.'' Capone was convicted and was sentenced to eleven years in federal prison in November 1931, fined $50,000 plus $7,692 for court costs, and was held liable for $215,000 plus interest due on his back taxes. The contempt of court sentence was served concurrently.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/capone/caponeverdict.html | title= Selected Documents: Jury Verdict Form (October 17, 1931) | work=Al Capone Trial | first=Douglas O. | last=Linder | publisher=University of Missouri–Kansas City | accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref><ref>Bergreen, p. 484</ref><ref>''Capone v.

===Imprisonment===
[[File:San Francisco-Alcatraz-Al Capones Cell 181.jpg|thumb|Cell 181 in [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]] where Capone was imprisoned]]
Capone was sent to [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary]] in May 1932, aged 33. Upon his arrival at Atlanta, the {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} Capone was officially diagnosed with [[syphilis]] and gonorrhea. He was also suffering from withdrawal symptoms from cocaine addiction, use of which had perforated his septum. Capone was competent at his prison job of stitching soles on shoes for eight hours a day, but his letters were barely coherent.<ref name="bergreen 511">Bergreen, pp. 511-514</ref> He was seen as a weak personality, and so out of his depth dealing with bullying fellow inmates that his cellmate, seasoned convict Red Rudinsky, feared that Capone would have a breakdown. Rudinsky was formerly a small time criminal associated with the Capone gang, and found himself becoming a protector for Capone.<ref name="bergreen 511"/> The conspicuous protection of Rudinsky and other prisoners drew accusations from less friendly inmates, and fueled suspicion that Capone was receiving special treatment. No solid evidence ever emerged, but it formed part of the rationale for moving Capone to the recently opened [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] off the coast of San Francisco.<ref name="bergreen 511"/><ref>Bergreen, pp. 519-521</ref>

At Alcatraz, Capone's decline became increasingly evident as [[neurosyphilis]] progressively eroded his mental faculties.<ref name="five families book"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timelines.com/1934/8/11/first-prisoners-arrive-at-alcatraz-prison-likely-including-al-capone |title=First Prisoners Arrive at Alcatraz Prison (Likely Including Al Capone) |publisher=Timelines.com |date=1934-08-11 |accessdate=2011-01-27}}</ref><ref>Sifakis, Carl.

==Later years and death==
[[File:Death certificate of Al Capone.jpg|thumb|Capone's [[death certificate]]]]
After Capone was released from prison, he was referred to [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore]] for the treatment of [[General paresis of the insane|paresis]] (caused by late-stage syphilis). Hopkins refused to admit him based solely on his reputation, but [[Union Memorial Hospital]] took him in. Capone was grateful for the compassionate care that he received, and donated two Japanese weeping cherry trees to Union Memorial Hospital in 1939. A very sickly Capone left Baltimore on March 20, 1940, after a few weeks inpatient and a few weeks outpatient, for [[Palm Island, Florida]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-08-30/news/1994242174_1_capone-katz-pimlico|last=Sandler|first=Gilbert|title=Al Capone's hide-out|publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=30 August 1994|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/explore/baltimorecounty/news/ph-ms-union-memorial-0329-20120326,0,1307075.story|last=Perl|first=Larry|title=For Union Memorial, Al Capone's tree keeps on giving|publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=26 March 2012|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc2news.com/news/region/baltimore-city/medstar-union-memorial-celebrates-capone-cherry-tree-blooming|last=Slade|first=Fred|title=Medstar Union Memorial celebrates Capone Cherry Tree blooming|publisher=[[WMAR-TV|Abc2News]] |date=10 April 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref>

==Chicago aftermath==
The main effect of Capone's conviction was that he ceased to be boss immediately on his imprisonment, but those involved in the jailing of Capone portrayed it as having dealt a fatal blow to the city's [[organized crime]] syndicate. Far from being smashed, the [[Chicago Outfit]] continued without being troubled by the Chicago police. Organized crime in the city had a lower profile once [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was repealed, already wary of attention after seeing Capone's notoriety bring him down, to the extent that there is a lack of consensus among writers about who was actually in control and who was a figurehead 'front boss'.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/> Prostitution, labor union racketeering, and gambling became moneymakers for organized crime in the city without incurring serious investigation. In the late 1950s, FBI agents discovered an organization led by Capone's former lieutenants reigning supreme over the Chicago underworld.<ref>''The Chicago Outfit'', John J. Binder, chapter four</ref>

==In popular culture==
Capone is one of the most notorious American gangsters of the 20th century and has been the subject of numerous articles, books, and films. His personality and character have been used in fiction as a model for crime lords and criminal [[Mastermind (Role Variant)|masterminds]] ever since his death. The stereotypical image of a mobster wearing a blue pinstriped suit and tilted [[fedora]] is based on photos of Capone. His accent, mannerisms, facial construction, physical stature, and  [[parody|parodies]] of his name have been used for numerous gangsters in comics, movies, music, and literature.

===Literature===
*Capone is featured in a segment of [[Mario Puzo]]'s ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'' as an ally of a New York mob boss in which he sends two "button men" at the mob boss' request to kill [[Don Vito Corleone]]; arriving in New York, the two men are intercepted and brutally killed by [[Luca Brasi]], after which Don Corleone sends a message to Capone warning him not to interfere again, and Capone apparently capitulates.<ref>{{cite book |last=Puzo |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Puzo |year=1969 |title=[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]] |isbn=0-7493-2468-6 |pages=214–217}}</ref>
*Capone is an antagonist in [[Hergé]]'s ''[[Tintin in America]]'' and is referred to in ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]''. He is the only real-life character depicted in his real-life role in the ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series.
