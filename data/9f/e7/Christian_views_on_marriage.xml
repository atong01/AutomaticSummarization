The KJV translates it as God saying, &quot;I will make a help meet for him&quot;. The first distortion was extrabiblical: the noun &quot;help&quot; and the adjective &quot;meet&quot; traditionally have been combined into a new noun, &quot;helpmate&quot;. Thus, wives were often referred to as her husband's &quot;helpmate&quot;.

Patriarchy gives preeminence to the male in essentially all matters of religion and culture. It explicitly deprives all women of social, political, and economic rights.

In the Hebrew nation, patriarchy seems to have evolved as an expression of male dominance and supremacy, and of a double standard that prevailed throughout much of the Old Testament.

Their view is that the male has God-given authority and mandate to direct &quot;his&quot; household in paths of obedience to God.
