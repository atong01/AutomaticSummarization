It reported the events from May to June of the same year at Tonghua Zhenguo Pharmaceutical Company in<space/><link><target>Tonghua</target><part>Tonghua City</part></link>, Jilin Province, which debunked the flying rods. Surveillance cameras in the facility's compound captured video footage of flying rods identical to those shown in Jose Escamilla's video. Getting no satisfactory answer to the phenomenon, curious scientists at the facility decided that they would try to solve the mystery by attempting to catch these airborne creatures. Huge nets were set up and the same surveillance cameras then captured images of rods flying into the trap. When the nets were inspected, the &quot;rods&quot; were no more than regular moths and other ordinary flying insects. Subsequent investigations proved that the appearance of flying rods on video was an optical illusion created by the slower recording speed of the camera.<extension extension_name='ref' name="CCTV"><link type='external' href='http://tech.sina.com.cn/d/2006-01-23/2211827624.shtml'>UFO()</link><space/><link type='external' href='http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;langpair=zh-CN'>|en&amp;u=http://tech.sina.com.cn/d/2006-01-23/2211827624.shtml SINA Technology News, &quot;China's outstanding UFO Investigation: fly rod Haunted World (Part Two)&quot;</link></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Cryptozoology</heading><paragraph>In 2012, the<space/><link><target>East Malaysia</target><part>Malaysian</part></link><space/>independent newspaper<space/><link><target>Daily Express (Sabah)</target><part>Daily Express</part></link><space/>reported that a British traveller named Matthew Lazenby had &quot;discovered&quot; rods in a cave in<space/><link><target>Sabah</target></link>.
