'''''Carmilla''''' is a [[Gothic novel]]la by [[Sheridan Le Fanu|Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]] and one of the early works of [[vampire fiction]], predating [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) by 26 years. First published as a [[Serial (literature)|serial]] in ''[[The Dark Blue]]'' (1871–72), its narrator is a young woman preyed upon by a female [[vampire]] named Carmilla. The story is often [[Anthology|anthologized]] and has been adapted many times in film and other media.

==Publication==
''Carmilla,'' serialized in the literary magazine ''The Dark Blue'' in late 1871 and early 1872,<ref>The story ran in one issue of 1871 (December, pp. 434–448) and in three issues of 1872 (January, pp. 592–606; February, pp. 701–714; and March, pp. 59–78).</ref> was reprinted in Le Fanu's short story collection ''[[In a Glass Darkly]]'' (1872). Comparing the work of the two [[illustrators]], [[David Henry Friston]] and Michael Fitzgerald, whose work appears in the magazine but not in modern printings of the book, reveals inconsistencies in the characters' depictions. Consequently, confusion has arisen relating the pictures to the plot.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Isabella Mazzanti illustrated the book's 2014 anniversary edition, published by Editions Soleil and translated by Gaid Girard.<ref>{{cite book|author=Le Fanu, Sheridan & Girard, Gaid (Translator) & Mazzanti, Isabella (Illustrator)|title=Carmilla|date=2014|language=French|publisher=Editions Soleil}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://bookillustrations.quora.com/Isabella-Mazzantis-Illustrations-for-Carmilla|website=Quora|title=Book Artists and Their Illustrations:  Isabella Mazzanti's Illustrations for "Carmilla"|author=Stein, Rivka|date=January 21, 2014 }}</ref>

==Plot summary==
Le Fanu presents the story as part of the casebook of Dr. Hesselius, whose departures from medical orthodoxy rank him as the first [[occult doctor]] in literature.<ref>{{cite web|website=gwthomas.org|url=http://www.gwthomas.org/hesselius.htm |title=Dr Martin Hesselius}}</ref>

Laura, one of the two protagonists, narrates, beginning with her childhood in a "picturesque and solitary" castle amid an extensive forest in [[Styria]], where she lives with her father, a wealthy [[English people|English]] widower retired from service to the [[Austrian Empire]]. When she was six, Laura had a vision of a beautiful visitor in her bedchamber. She later claims to have been punctured in her breast, although no wound was found.

Twelve years later, Laura and her father are admiring the sunset in front of the castle when her father tells her of a letter from his friend, General Spielsdorf. The General was supposed to bring his niece, Bertha Rheinfeldt, to visit the two, but the niece suddenly died under mysterious circumstances. The General ambiguously concludes that he will discuss the circumstances in detail when they meet later.

Laura, saddened by the loss of a potential friend, longs for a companion. A carriage accident outside Laura's home unexpectedly brings a girl of Laura's age into the family's care. Her name is Carmilla. Both girls instantly recognize the other from the "dream" they both had when they were young.

Carmilla appears injured after her carriage accident, but her mysterious mother informs Laura's father that her journey is urgent and cannot be delayed. She arranges to leave her daughter with Laura and her father until she can return in three months. Before she leaves, she sternly notes that her daughter will not disclose any information whatsoever about her family, past, or herself, and that Carmilla is of sound mind. Laura comments that this information seems needless to say, and her father laughs it off.

Carmilla and Laura grow to be very close friends, but occasionally Carmilla's mood abruptly changes. She sometimes makes unsettling romantic advances towards Laura. Carmilla refuses to tell anything about herself, despite questioning by Laura. Her secrecy is not the only mysterious thing about Carmilla; she never joins the household in its prayers, she sleeps much of the day, and she seems to sleepwalk outside at night.

Young women and girls in the vicinity have begun dying from an unknown malady. When the funeral procession of one such victim passes by the two girls, Laura joins in the funeral hymn. Carmilla bursts out in rage and scolds Laura, complaining that the hymn hurts her ears.

When a shipment of family [[heirloom]] restored portraits arrives at the castle, Laura finds one of her ancestor, Mircalla Karnstein, dated 1698. The portrait resembles Carmilla exactly, down to the mole on her neck.

During Carmilla's stay, Laura has nightmares of a large cat-like beast entering her room and biting her on the chest. The beast then takes the form of a female figure and disappears through the door without opening it. In another nightmare, Laura hears a voice say, "Your mother warns you to beware of the assassin," and a sudden light reveals Carmilla standing at the foot of her bed, her nightdress drenched in blood. Laura's health declines, and her father has a doctor examine her. He finds a small blue spot on her chest and speaks privately with her father, only asking that Laura never be unattended.

Her father then sets out with Laura, in a carriage, for the ruined village of Karnstein. They leave a message behind asking Carmilla and one of the governesses to follow once the perpetually late-sleeping Carmilla wakes. En route to Karnstein, Laura and her father encounter General Spielsdorf. He tells them his own ghastly story.

At a costume ball, Spielsdorf and his niece Bertha had met a young woman named Millarca and her enigmatic mother. Bertha was immediately taken with Millarca. The mother convinced the General that she was an old friend of his and asked that Millarca be allowed to stay with them for three weeks while she attended to a secret matter of great importance.

Bertha fell mysteriously ill, suffering the same symptoms as Laura. After consulting with a specially-ordered priestly doctor, the General realized that Bertha was being visited by a vampire. He hid with a sword and waited until a large black creature crawled onto his niece's bed and to her neck. He leapt from his hiding place and attacked the beast, which took the form of Millarca. She fled through the locked door, unharmed. Bertha died immediately afterward.

Upon arriving at Karnstein, the General asks a woodman where he can find the tomb of Mircalla Karnstein. The woodman says the tomb was relocated long ago by the hero who vanquished the vampires that haunted the region.

While the General and Laura are alone in the ruined chapel, Carmilla appears. The General and Carmilla both fly into a rage upon seeing each other, and the General attacks her with an axe. Carmilla disarms the General and disappears. The General explains that Carmilla is also Millarca, both anagrams for the original name of the vampire Mircalla, Countess Karnstein.

The party is joined by Baron Vordenburg, the descendant of the hero who rid the area of vampires long ago. Vordenburg, an authority on vampires, has discovered that his ancestor was romantically involved with the Countess Karnstein before she died and became one of the undead. Using his forefather's notes, he locates Mircalla's hidden tomb. An Imperial Commission exhumes the vampire's body. Immersed in blood, it seems to be breathing faintly, its heart beating, its eyes open. A stake is driven through its heart, and it gives a corresponding shriek; then the head is struck off. The body and head are burned to ashes, which are thrown into a river.

Afterwards, Laura's father takes his daughter on a year-long tour through Italy to recover from the trauma and regain her health.

==Sources==
As with ''[[Dracula]]'', critics have looked for the sources used in the writing of ''Carmilla''. Matthew Gibson proposes that Le Fanu used [[Antoine Augustin Calmet|Dom Augustin Calmet's]] ''Dissertations sur les apparitions des anges, des demons et des esprits, et sur les revenants et vampires de Hongrie, de Boheme, de Moravie, et de Silesie'' (1746),<ref>{{cite book|author=Calmet, Antoine Augustin|date=1746|url=http://archive.org/details/dissertationssu00conggoog |title=Dissertations sur les apparitions des anges, des demons et des esprits, et sur les revenants et vampires de Hongrie, de Boheme, de Moravie, et de Silesie|location=Paris|publisher= De Bure l'aîné|language=French}}</ref> which was first anonymously translated into English in a single volume as ''Dissertations Upon the Apparitions of Angels, Daemons, and Ghosts, and Concerning the Vampires of Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia'' (1759).<ref>{{cite book|authors=Calmet, Antoine Augustin & Anonymous Translator|date=1759|title=Dissertations Upon the Apparitions of Angels, Daemons, and Ghosts, and Concerning the Vampires of Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia|location=London|publisher= M. Cooper|edition=First English Translation}}</ref> and later translated into English in two volumes as ''The phantom world, or, The philosophy of spirits, apparitions, &c.'' (1850)<ref>{{cite book|authors=Calmet, Antoine Augustin & Christmas, Henry (Translator)|date=1850|title=The phantom world, or, The philosophy of spirits, apparitions, &c.|location= London|publisher= Richard Bentley |url=http://archive.org/details/phantomworldorp00calmgoog |volume= 1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|authors=Calmet, Antoine Augustin & Christmas, Henry (Translator)|date=1850|title=The phantom world, or, The philosophy of spirits, apparitions, &c.|location= London|publisher= Richard Bentley |url=
 http://archive.org/details/phantomworldorp02calmgoog |volume= 2}}</ref> Gibson also believes that [[Sabine Baring-Gould|the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould]]'s ''The Book of Were-wolves'' (1863) and his account of [[Elizabeth Báthory]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]'' (Part 1, 1797 and Part 2, 1800), and Captain [[Basil Hall]]'s ''[[Schloss]] [[Hainfeld]]; or a Winter in [[Lower Styria]]'' (London and Edinburgh, 1836) are other sources for Le Fanu's ''Carmilla''. Hall's account provides much of the Styrian background and, in particular, a model for both Carmilla and Laura in the figure of [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall|Jane Anne Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gibson, Matthew|url=http://www.jslefanu.com/gibson.html |title=Jane Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall: A Possible Inspiration for Le Fanu's ''Carmilla''|journal=Le Fanu Studies|date= November 2007|issn= 1932-9598}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Gibson, Matthew |date=2006|title=Dracula and the Eastern Question: British and French Vampire Narratives of the Nineteenth-century Near East|isbn=1-4039-9477-3 }}</ref>

==Influence==
Carmilla, the title character, is the original prototype for a legion of female and [[lesbian vampire]]s. Though Le Fanu portrays his vampire's [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] with the circumspection that one would expect for his time, it is evident that [[lesbian]] attraction is the main dynamic between Carmilla and the narrator of the story:<ref>{{cite book|author=Keesey, Pam |date=1993|title=Daughters of Darkness: Lesbian Vampire Stories|publisher= Cleis|isbn= 0-939416-78-6}}</ref>

{{quotation|Sometimes after an hour of apathy, my strange and beautiful companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous respiration. It was like the ardour of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was hateful and yet overpowering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips travelled along my cheek in kisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, "You are mine, you ''shall'' be mine, and you and I are one for ever". (''Carmilla'', Chapter 4).}}

When compared to other literary vampires of the 19th century, Carmilla is a similar product of a culture with strict sexual mores and tangible religious fear. While Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, she only becomes emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla had [[nocturnal]] habits, but was not confined to the darkness. She had unearthly beauty, and was able to change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as in ''Dracula''. She did, however, sleep in a coffin. ''Carmilla'' works as a [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] horror story because her victims are portrayed as succumbing to a perverse and unholy temptation that has severe metaphysical consequences for them.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Auerbach |first=Nina |title=Our Vampires, Ourselves |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press |year=1995 |location= |page=42 |isbn= 0-2260-3202-7}}</ref>

Some critics, among them [[William Veeder]], suggest that ''Carmilla'', notably in its outlandish use of narrative frames, was an important influence on [[Henry James]]' ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' (1898).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Bram Stoker's ''Dracula''===
Although ''Carmilla'' is a lesser known and far shorter [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] vampire story than the generally-considered master work of that genre, ''Dracula'', the latter is heavily influenced by Le Fanu's novella. In the earliest manuscript of ''Dracula'' (dated 8 March 1890), the castle is set in [[Styria]], although the setting was changed to [[Transylvania]] six days later.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Stoker's posthumously published [[short story]] "[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]" (1914), known as the deleted first chapter to ''Dracula'', shows a more obvious and intact debt to ''Carmilla'':
* Both stories are told in the [[first-person narrative|first person]]. ''Dracula'' expands on the idea of a first person account by creating a series of journal entries and logs of different persons and creating a plausible background story for their having been compiled. 
* Both authors indulge the air of mystery, though Stoker takes it further than Le Fanu by allowing the characters to solve the enigma of the vampire along with the reader.
* The descriptions of the title character in ''Carmilla'' and of Lucy in ''Dracula'' are similar, and have become archetypes for the appearance of the waif-like victims and seducers in vampire stories as being rosy-cheeked, slender, languid, and with large eyes, full lips, and soft voices.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Additionally, both women [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalk]].
*Stoker's Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]] is a direct parallel to Le Fanu's vampire expert Baron Vordenburg: both characters used to investigate and catalyse actions in opposition to the vampire, and symbolically represent knowledge of the unknown and stability of mind in the onslaught of chaos and death.<ref>{{cite news|title=Le Fanu, J.S.|author=Sullivan, Jack (Editor)|work=The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural|page= 260}}</ref>

==In popular culture==

===Anime and Manga===
(Alphabetical by series title)
* In idol-themed anime ''[[Aikatsu!]]'', one of the main characters, vampire-themed Yurika Tōdō, claimed Carmilla is her mother.
* In ''[[Black Butler]]'' vol. 9, Ciel makes a reference to Le Fanu's Carmilla because they are facing a murder mystery, and one of the victims has a bite mark on the side of his neck, but that theory was ruled out by Lau.
* In ''[[Glass Mask]]'' (episode 29 of the anime and volume 17 of the manga), Ayumi Himekawa played Carmilla in a stage adaptation of the novella.
* The mecha anime ''[[Valvrave the Liberator]]'' includes themes of vampirism, including the fourth Valvrave unit's being nicknamed Carmilla by its pilot, "Saki". An exemplary episode is "Saki's Comeback" (May 17, 2013), episode 6.
* In ''[[Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust]]'' Carmilla is a villain and patron of the vampire Meier Link. Long ago Count Dracula killed her out of disgust by her unnaturally strong bloodlust, but she survives as a ghost. To revive herself, she tricks Charlotte (the woman Meier Link loves) into allowing Carmilla to suck her blood. Later, Carmilla is killed again in a fight with the Vampire Hunter known as D.
* In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh GX]]'' a character named Camula is the second shadow rider faced by the protagonists. The name could possibly be an homage to both Carmilla (a female vampire) and Dracula (a male).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Books===

*[[Ro McNulty]]'s novella, ''Ruin: The Rise of the House of Karnstein,'' is a sequel to Le  Fanu's novella and takes place over 100 years later. Carmilla continues to play games with mortals, inserting herself into their lives and breaking them to her will. She settles herself around a teacher and his family, feeding on his baby daughter.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 
* A vampire named Baron Karnstein appears in [[Kim Newman]]'s novel ''[[Anno Dracula series#Anno Dracula|Anno Dracula]]'' (1992). Carmilla herself is mentioned several times as a former (until her death at the hands of vampire hunters) friend of the book's vampire heroine Geneviève.

===Film===
[[File:Ingrid-pitt.jpg|thumb|[[Ingrid Pitt]] portrayed Carmilla/Mircalla in [[The Vampire Lovers]]]]
(Chronological)
* [[Danes|Danish]] director [[Carl Dreyer]] loosely adapted ''Carmilla'' for his film ''[[Vampyr]]'' (1932) but deleted any references to lesbian sexuality.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Grant |first=Barry Keith |authorlink= |last2=Sharrett |first2=Christopher |author2-link= |title=Planks of Reason: Essays on the Horror Film |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2004 |location= |page=73 |url =http://books.google.com/?id=QHg7m_ESR54C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=0-8108-5013-3}}</ref> The credits of the original film say that the film is based on ''In a Glass Darkly''. This collection contains five tales, one of which is ''Carmilla''. Actually the film draws its central character, Allan Gray, from Le Fanu's Dr. Hesselius; and the scene in which Gray is buried alive is drawn from "The Room in the Dragon Volant".
* [[French people|French]] director [[Roger Vadim]]'s ''[[Blood and Roses|Et mourir de plaisir]]'' (literally ''And to die of pleasure'', but actually shown in the UK and US as ''Blood and Roses'', 1960) is based on ''Carmilla'' and is considered one of the greatest of the vampire genre. The Vadim film thoroughly explores the lesbian implications behind Carmilla's selection of victims, and boasts cinematography by [[Claude Renoir]]. The film's lesbian eroticism was however significantly cut for its US release. [[Mel Ferrer]] stars in the film.
* A more-or-less faithful adaptation starring [[Christopher Lee]] was produced in Italy in 1963 under the title ''[[La cripta e l'incubo]]'' (''Crypt of the Vampire'' in English). The character of Laura is played by Adriana Ambesi, who fears herself possessed by the spirit of a dead ancestor.
* The British [[Hammer Film Productions]] also produced a fairly faithful adaptation of ''Carmilla'' titled ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'' (1970) with [[Ingrid Pitt]] in the lead role, [[Madeline Smith]] as her victim/lover, and Hammer's regular [[Peter Cushing]]. It is the first installment of the [[Karnstein Trilogy]].
* ''[[The Blood Spattered Bride]]'' (''La Novia Ensangrentada'') is a 1972 Spanish [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Vicente Aranda]], is based on the text. The film has reached cult status for its mix of horror, vampirism and seduction with lesbian overtones.

* The [[Cradle of Filth]]'s lead singer [[Dani Filth]] has often cited [[Sheridan Le Fanu]] as an inspiration to his lyrics.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  For example, his British [[extreme metal]] band's EP, ''[[V Empire or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein]]'' (1994), includes a track titled "Queen of Winter, Throned", which contains the lyrics: "Iniquitous/I share Carmilla's mask/A gaunt mephitic voyeur/On the black side of the glass". Additionally, the album ''[[Dusk... and Her Embrace]]'' (1996) was largely inspired by ''Carmilla'' and Le Fanu's writings in general. The band has also recorded an instrumental track titled "Carmilla's Masque", and in the track "A Gothic Romance", the lyric "Portrait of the Dead Countess" may reference the portrait found in the novel of the Countess Mircalla.
* The lyrics for "Blood and Roses", [[LaHost]]'s track on the [[EMI]] compilation album ''Fire in Harmony'' (1985), are loosely based on the [[Roger Vadim]] film version of ''Carmilla''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
