The High Seas Fleet's intention was to lure out, trap and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, as the German naval force was insufficient to openly engage the entire British fleet. This formed part of a larger strategy to break the British<space/><link><target>blockade of Germany</target></link><space/>and to allow German mercantile shipping to operate. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy pursued a strategy to engage and destroy the High Seas Fleet, or keep the German force contained and away from Britain's own<space/><link><target>Sea lines of communication</target><part>shipping lanes</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The German plan was to use Vice-Admiral<space/><link><target>Franz von Hipper</target><part>Franz Hipper's</part></link><space/>fast scouting group of five modern<space/><link><target>battlecruiser</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>to lure Vice-Admiral<space/><link><target>David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty</target><part>Sir David Beatty's</part></link><space/>battlecruiser squadrons into the path of the main German fleet. Submarines were stationed in advance across the likely routes of the British ships. However, the British learned from signal intercepts that a major fleet operation was likely, so on 30 May Jellicoe sailed with the Grand Fleet to rendezvous with Beatty, passing over the locations of the German submarine picket lines while they were unprepared. The German plan had been delayed, causing further problems for their submarines which had reached the limit of their endurance at sea.</paragraph><paragraph>On the afternoon of 31 May, Beatty encountered Hipper's battlecruiser force long before the Germans had expected. In a running battle, Hipper successfully drew the British<space/><link><target>Vanguard (military formation)</target><part>vanguard</part></link><space/>into the path of the High Seas Fleet. By the time Beatty sighted the larger force and turned back towards the British main fleet, he had lost two battlecruisers from a force of six battlecruisers and four battleships, against the five ships commanded by Hipper. The battleships, commanded by Rear-Admiral<space/><link><target>Hugh Evan-Thomas</target><part>Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas</part></link>, were the last to turn and formed a<space/><link><target>rearguard</target></link><space/>as Beatty withdrew, now drawing the German fleet in pursuit towards the main British positions. Between 18:30, when the sun was lowering on the western horizon, backlighting the German forces, and nightfall at about 20:30, the two fleets totalling 250 ships between them directly engaged twice.</paragraph><paragraph>Fourteen British and eleven German ships were sunk, with great loss of life. After sunset, and throughout the night, Jellicoe manoeuvred to cut the Germans off from their base, hoping to continue the battle the next morning, but under the cover of darkness Scheer broke through the British light forces forming the rearguard of the Grand Fleet and returned to port.<extension extension_name='ref'>Campbell,<space/><italics>Analysis</italics><space/>pp. 274</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Both sides claimed victory. The British lost more ships and twice as many sailors, and the British press criticised the Grand Fleet's failure to force a decisive outcome, but Scheer's plan of destroying a substantial portion of the British fleet also failed. The Germans' &quot;<link><target>fleet in being</target></link>&quot; continued to pose a threat, requiring the British to keep their battleships concentrated in the North Sea, but the battle confirmed the German policy of avoiding all fleet-to-fleet contact.

This followed protests from neutral countries, notably the United States, that their nationals had been the victims of attacks. Germany agreed that future attacks would only take place in accord with internationally agreed prize rules, which required an attacker to give a warning and allow the crews of vessels time to escape, and not to attack neutral vessels at all. Scheer believed that it would not be possible to continue attacks on these terms, which took away the advantage of secret approach by submarines and left them vulnerable to even relatively small guns on the target ships. Instead, he set about deploying the submarine fleet against military vessels.<extension extension_name='ref'>Tarrant p.55</extension></paragraph><paragraph>It was hoped that, following a successful German submarine attack, fast British escorts, such as<space/><link><target>destroyers</target></link>, would be tied down by anti-submarine operations. If the Germans could catch the British in the expected locations, there were thought to be good prospects of at least partially redressing the balance of forces between the fleets. &quot;After the British sortied in response to the raiding attack force&quot;, the Royal Navy's centuries-old instincts for aggressive action could be exploited to draw its weakened units towards the main German fleet under Scheer. The hope was that Scheer would thus be able to ambush a section of the British fleet and destroy it.<extension extension_name='ref'>Campbell, p. 2</extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Submarine deployments</heading><paragraph>A plan was devised to station submarines offshore from British naval bases, and then stage some action that would draw out the British ships to the waiting submarines.

Each boat had an allocated area, within which it could move around as necessary to avoid detection, but was instructed to keep within it. During the initial North Sea patrol the boats were instructed to sail only north-south so that any enemy who chanced to encounter one would believe it was departing or returning from operations on the west coast (which required them to pass around the north of Britain). Once at their final positions, the boats were under strict orders to avoid premature detection that might give away the operation. It was arranged that a coded signal would be transmitted to alert the submarines exactly when the operation commenced: &quot;Take into account the enemy's forces may be putting to sea&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>Tarrant p. 56-57</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Additionally,<space/><italics>UB-27</italics><space/>was sent out on 20 May with instructions to work its way into the Firth of Forth past<space/><link><target>Isle of May</target><part>May Island</part></link>.<space/><italics>U-46</italics><space/>was ordered to patrol the coast of<space/><link><target>Sunderland, Tyne and Wear</target><part>Sunderland</part></link>, which had been chosen for the diversionary attack, but because of engine problems it was unable to leave port and<space/><italics>U-47</italics><space/>was diverted to this task.

The ambush submarines were now on station and experiencing difficulties of their own: visibility near the coast was frequently poor due to fog, and sea conditions were either so calm the slightest ripple, as from the periscope, could give away their position, or so rough as to make it very hard to keep the vessel at a steady depth.

Tactical doctrine called for a fleet approaching battle to be in a compact formation of parallel columns, allowing relatively easy manoeuvring, and giving shortened sight lines within the formation, which simplified the passing of the signals necessary for command and control.</paragraph><paragraph>A fleet formed in several short columns could change its heading faster than one formed in a single long column. Since most command signals were made with<space/><link><target>flag</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Aldis lamp</target><part>signal lamps</part></link><space/>between ships, the flagship was usually placed at the head of the centre column so that its signals might be more easily seen by the many ships of the formation. Wireless telegraphy was in use, though security (radio direction finding), encryption, and the limitation of the radio sets made their extensive use more problematic. Command and control of such huge fleets remained difficult.<extension extension_name='ref'>Sutherland, Cramwell, p.13</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Thus, it might take a very long time for a signal from the flagship to be relayed to the entire formation. It was usually necessary for a signal to be confirmed by each ship before it could be relayed to other ships, and an order for a fleet movement would have to be received and acknowledged by every ship before it could be executed. In a large single-column formation, a signal could take 10 minutes or more to be passed from one end of the line to the other, whereas in a formation of parallel columns, visibility across the diagonals was often better (and always shorter) than in a single long column, and the diagonals gave signal &quot;redundancy&quot;, increasing the probability that a message would be quickly seen and correctly interpreted.</paragraph><paragraph>However, before battle was joined the heavy units of the fleet would, if possible, deploy into a single column. To form the battle line in the correct orientation relative to the enemy, the commanding admiral had to know the enemy fleet's distance, bearing, heading, and speed. It was the task of the scouting forces, consisting primarily of<space/><link><target>battlecruiser</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>cruiser</target><trail>s</trail></link>, to find the enemy and report this information in sufficient time, and, if possible, to deny the enemy's scouting forces the opportunity of obtaining the equivalent information.</paragraph><paragraph>Ideally, the battle line would cross the intended path of the enemy column so that the maximum number of guns could be brought to bear, while the enemy could fire only with the forward guns of the leading ships, a manoeuvre known as &quot;<link><target>crossing the T</target></link>&quot;. Admiral<space/><link><target>Tg Heihachir</target><part>Tg</part></link>, commander of the Japanese battleship fleet, had achieved this against Admiral<space/><link><target>Zinovy Rozhestvensky</target></link>'s Russian battleships in 1905 at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Tsushima</target></link>, with devastating results.<extension extension_name='ref'>Forczyk p. 58-62</extension><space/>Jellicoe was to achieve this twice in one hour against the High Seas Fleet at Jutland, but on both occasions Scheer managed to turn away and disengage, thereby avoiding a decisive action.<space/><template><target>clear left</target></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Ship design</heading><paragraph>Within the existing technological limits, a trade-off had to be made between the weight and size of guns, the weight of armour protecting the ship, and the maximum speed. Battleships sacrificed speed for armour and heavy naval guns (<template><target>convert</target><arg>11</arg><arg>in</arg><arg>mm</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>or larger). British battlecruisers sacrificed weight of armour for greater speed, while their German counterparts were armed with lighter guns and heavier armour. These weight savings allowed them to escape danger or catch other ships. Generally, the larger guns mounted on British ships allowed an engagement at greater range. In theory, a lightly armoured ship could stay out of range of a slower opponent while still scoring hits. The fast pace of development in the pre-war years meant that every few years, a new generation of ships rendered its predecessors obsolete.

Beatty's withdrawal toward Jellicoe is called the &quot;Run to the North&quot;, in which the tables turned and the Germans chased the British. Because Beatty once again failed to signal his intentions adequately, the battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron which were too far behind to read his flags found themselves passing the battlecruisers on an opposing course and heading directly toward the approaching main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 16:48, at extreme range, Scheer's leading battleships opened fire.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Camp-54"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Analysis<space/></arg><arg name="last">Campbell<space/></arg><arg name="pages">54</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Meanwhile, at 16:47, having received Goodenough's signal and knowing that Beatty was now leading the German battle fleet north to him, Jellicoe signalled to his own forces that the fleet action they had waited so long for was finally imminent; at 16:51, by radio, he informed the Admiralty so in London.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Analysis<space/></arg><arg name="last">Campbell<space/></arg><arg name="pages">58â€“59</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The difficulties of the 5th Battle Squadron were compounded when Beatty gave the order to Evan-Thomas to &quot;turn in succession&quot; (rather than &quot;turn together&quot;) at 16:48 as the battleships passed him.

At 16:55, when the 5BS had moved within range of the enemy battleships, Evan-Thomas issued his own flag command warning his squadron to expect sudden manoeuvres and to follow his lead, before starting to turn on his own initiative. The order to turn in succession would have resulted in all four ships turning in the same patch of sea as they reached it one by one, giving the High Seas Fleet repeated opportunity with ample time to find the proper range.

Cordite MD was developed to reduce barrel wear, its formula being 65% nitrocellulose, 30% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. While cordite MD solved the gun-barrel erosion issue, it did nothing to improve its storage properties, which were poor. Cordite was very sensitive to variations of temperature, and acid propagation/cordite deterioration would take place at a very rapid rate.

The British used a 'bracket system', whereby a salvo was fired at the best-guess range and, depending where it landed, the range was progressively corrected up or down until successive shots were landing in front of and behind the enemy. The Germans used a 'ladder system', whereby an initial volley of three shots at different ranges was used, with the centre shot at the best-guess range. The ladder system allowed the gunners to get ranging information from the three shots more quickly than the bracket system, which required waiting between shots to see how the last had landed.

The British preferred signalling using ship-to-ship flag and lamp signals, avoiding wireless, whereas the Germans used wireless successfully. One conclusion drawn was that flag signals were not a satisfactory way to control the fleet. Experience using lamps, particularly at night when issuing challenges to other ships, demonstrated this was an excellent way to advertise your precise location to an enemy, inviting a reply by gunfire. Recognition signals by lamp, once seen, could also easily be copied in future engagements.<extension extension_name='ref'>Marder III p.175-176</extension></paragraph><paragraph>British ships both failed to report engagements with the enemy but also, in the case of cruisers and destroyers, failed to actively seek out the enemy. A culture had arisen within the fleet of not acting without orders, which could prove fatal when any circumstances prevented orders being sent or received. Commanders failed to engage the enemy because they believed other, more senior officers must also be aware of the enemy nearby, and would have given orders to act if this was expected. Wireless, the most direct way to pass messages across the fleet (although it was being jammed by German ships), was avoided either for perceived reasons of not giving away the presence of ships or for fear of cluttering up the airwaves with unnecessary reports.<extension extension_name='ref'>Marder III p.176-178</extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Fleet Standing Orders</heading><paragraph>Naval operations were governed by standing orders issued to all the ships. These attempted to set out what ships should do in all circumstances, particularly in situations where ships would have to react without referring to higher authority, or when communications failed. A number of changes were introduced as a result of experience gained in the battle.</paragraph><paragraph>A new signal was introduced instructing squadron commanders to act independently as they thought best while still supporting the main fleet, particularly for use when circumstances would make it difficult to send detailed orders. The description stressed that this was not intended to be the only time commanders might take independent action, but was intended to make plain times when they definitely should. Similarly, instructions on what to do if the fleet was instructed to take evasive action against torpedoes were amended. Commanders were given discretion that if their part of the fleet was not under immediate attack, they should continue engaging the enemy rather than turning away with the rest of the fleet. In this battle, when the fleet turned away from Scheer's destroyer attack covering his retreat, not all the British ships had been affected, and could have continued to engage the enemy.<extension extension_name='ref'>MarderIII p.222</extension></paragraph><paragraph>A number of opportunities to attack enemy ships by torpedo had presented themselves but had been missed. All ships, not just the destroyers armed principally with torpedoes but also battleships, were reminded that they carried torpedoes intended to be used whenever an opportunity arose. Destroyers were instructed to close the enemy fleet to fire torpedoes as soon as engagements between the main ships on either side would keep enemy guns busy directed at larger targets. Destroyers should also be ready to immediately engage enemy destroyers if they should launch an attack, endeavouring to disrupt their chances of launching torpedoes and keep them away from the main fleet.<extension extension_name='ref'>Marder III p.224-225</extension></paragraph><paragraph>To add some flexibility when deploying for attack, a new signal was provided for deploying the fleet to the centre, rather than as previously only either to left or right of the standard closed-up formation for travelling. The fast and powerful 5th Battle Squadron was moved to the front of the cruising formation so it would have the option of deploying left or right depending upon the enemy position. In the event of engagements at night, although the fleet still preferred to avoid night fighting, a destroyer and cruiser squadron would be specifically detailed to seek out the enemy and launch destroyer attacks.<extension extension_name='ref'>Marder III p.226</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Controversy</heading><paragraph>At the time, Jellicoe was criticised for his caution and for allowing Scheer to escape.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Massie-631">Massie, p. 631</extension><space/>Beatty, in particular, was convinced that Jellicoe had missed a tremendous opportunity to annihilate the High Seas Fleet<extension extension_name='ref'>Massie, p. 670</extension><space/>and win what would amount to another<space/><link><target>battle of Trafalgar</target><part>Trafalgar</part></link>.

Criticism focused on Jellicoe's decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn to the south-east, and so keep out of range of the torpedoes.
