They chose to abandon the old strategy of stopping the enemy at the beach. The new tactics would only disrupt the landings at the water's edge and depend on an in-depth defense farther inland. Colonel Nakagawa used the rough terrain to his advantage, by constructing a system of heavily fortified bunkers, caves and underground positions all interlocked into a &quot;honeycomb&quot; system. The old &quot;<link><target>banzai charge</target></link>&quot; attack was also discontinued as being both wasteful of men and ineffective. These changes would force the Americans into a war of attrition requiring increasingly more resources.<link><target>File:Peleliu-defense-194409.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>right</part><part>Japanese fortifications</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Nakagawa's defenses were based at Peleliu's highest point, Umurbrogol Mountain, a collection of hills and steep ridges located at the center of Peleliu overlooking a large portion of the island, including the crucial airfield. The Umurbrogol contained some 500 limestone caves, interconnected by tunnels. Many of these were former mine shafts that were turned into defense positions. Engineers added sliding armored steel doors with multiple openings to serve both artillery and machine guns. Cave entrances were built slanted as a defense against grenade and flamethrower attacks. The caves and bunkers were connected to a vast system throughout central Peleliu, which allowed the Japanese to evacuate or reoccupy positions as needed, and to take advantage of shrinking<space/><link><target>interior lines</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The Japanese were well armed with<space/><link><target>Type 97 81 mm infantry mortar</target><part><template><target>convert</target><arg>81</arg><arg>mm</arg><arg>in</arg><arg>2</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template></part></link>,<space/><link><target>Type 96 150 mm Infantry Mortar</target><part><template><target>convert</target><arg>150</arg><arg>mm</arg><arg>in</arg><arg>1</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>mortar</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Type 98 20 mm AA Machine Cannon</target><part><template><target>convert</target><arg>20</arg><arg>mm</arg><arg>in</arg><arg>2</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template></part></link><space/><link><target>Anti-aircraft warfare</target><part>anti-aircraft</part></link><space/><link><target>Autocannon</target><part>cannon</part><trail>s</trail></link>, and backed by a light tank unit and an anti-aircraft detachment.</paragraph><paragraph>The Japanese also used the beach terrain to their advantage.

The plan was for the 1st and 7th Regiments to push inland, guarding the 5th Regiment's left and right flank, and allowing them to capture the airfield located directly to the center of the landing beaches. The 5th Marines were to push to the eastern shore, cutting the island in half. The 1st Marines would push north into the Umurbrogol, while the 7th Marines would clear the southern end of the island.

Even the battalion left to defend the beaches was virtually unscathed. During the assault, the island's defenders exercised unusual firing discipline to avoid giving away their positions. The bombardment managed only to destroy Japan's aircraft on the island, as well as the buildings surrounding the airfield.

The Marines soon ran out of ammunition, and had to fight the attackers with knives and fists, even resorting to throwing coral rock and empty ammunition boxes at the Japanese. Pope and his men managed to hold out until dawn came, which brought on more deadly fire. When they evacuated the position, only nine men remained.
