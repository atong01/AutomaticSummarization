The '''chupacabra''' or '''chupacabras''' ({{IPA-es|tʃupaˈkaβɾas}}, literally "goat-sucker") is a [[legend]]ary [[cryptid]] rumored to inhabit parts of the Americas, with the first sightings reported in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name="Latino Bigfoot"/> The name comes from the animal's reported [[Vampirism|habit]] of attacking and [[Hematophagy|drinking the blood]] of [[livestock]], especially [[goat]]s.

Physical descriptions of the creature vary. It is purportedly a heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail.

Eyewitness sightings have been claimed as early as 1995 in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported as far north as [[Maine]], and as far south as [[Chile]], and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like [[Russia]] and [[The Philippines]], but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence. Sightings in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as [[Canidae|canids]] afflicted by [[mange]].<ref name="Radford2011">{{cite book |last= Radford |first= Benjamin |authorlink= Benjamin Radford |year= 2011 |title= [[Tracking the Chupacabra|Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction and Folklore]] |isbn= 9780826350152}}</ref> According to biologists and wildlife management officials, the chupacabra is an [[urban legend]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Miried Gonzalez Rodriguez|title=Dizfrazado el chupacabras| publisher= Primera Hora|location=Puerto Rico |language=Spanish }}</ref>

==Name==
''Chupacabras'' can be literally translated as "goat-sucker", from ''chupar'' ("to suck") and ''cabra'' ("goat"). It is known as both ''chupacabras'' and ''chupacabra'' throughout the Americas, with the former being the original word,<ref name="Clave">Diccionario Clave, [http://clave.librosvivos.net/verficha.asp?idelementoaver=42243&cadena=chupacabras chupacabras]. It states that both singular and plural is ''chupacabras''.</ref> and the latter a [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of it.  The name in Spanish can be preceded by a singular masculine article (''el chupacabras''), or the plural masculine article (''los chupacabras'').{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==History==
The first reported attacks occurred in March 1995 in Puerto Rico.<ref name="trail">{{cite web| author=Stephen Wagner| url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm| title=On the trail of the Chupacabras| accessdate=October 5, 2007}}</ref> In this attack, eight [[domestic sheep|sheep]] were discovered dead, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and completely drained of blood.<ref name="trail"/> A few months later, in August, an eyewitness, Madelyne Tolentino, reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of [[Canóvanas, Puerto Rico|Canóvanas]], when as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed.<ref name="trail"/> In 1975, similar killings in the small town of [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]] were attributed to ''El Vampiro de Moca'' (The Vampire of Moca).<ref>{{cite web| author=Stephen Wagner| url=http://paranormal.about.com/cs/chupacabra/a/aa071403.htm| title=Encounters with Chupacabras| accessdate=October 5, 2007}}</ref> Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[cult]]; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals was reported to have had its body bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.

[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] comedian and [[entrepreneur]] [[Silverio Pérez]] is credited with coining the term ''chupacabras'' soon after the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other animal deaths were reported in other countries, such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], [[United States]], and [[Mexico]].<ref name="trail"/>

==Reputed origin==
A five-year investigation by [[Benjamin Radford]], documented in his 2011 book ''[[Tracking the Chupacabra]]'', concluded that the description given by the original eyewitness in Puerto Rico, Madelyne Tolentino, was based on the creature Sil in the science-fiction horror film ''[[Species (film)|Species]]''.<ref name="Radford2011" /> The alien creature Sil is nearly identical to Tolentino’s chupacabra eyewitness account and she had seen the movie before her report: "It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all... The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive," Tolentino reported.<ref>Corrales, Scott. Chupacabras: And Other Mysteries. ISBN 1-883729-06-8</ref> Radford revealed that Tolentino "believed that the creatures and events she saw in ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' were happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time," and therefore concludes that "the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted."<ref name="Radford2011" /> This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.<ref>Radford, Benjamin. "Slaying the Vampire: Solving the ''Chupacabra'' Mystery" ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', Vol. 35 No. 3, May/June 2011, Pages 45–48</ref>

In addition, the reports of blood-sucking by the chupacabra were never confirmed by a [[necropsy]],<ref name="Radford2011" /> the only way to conclude that the animal was drained of blood. An analysis by a veterinarian of 300 reported victims of the chupacabra found that they had not been bled dry.

Radford divided the chupacabra reports into two categories:
* the reports from [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Latin America]] where animals were attacked and it is supposed their blood was extracted
* the reports in the [[United States]] of [[mammal]]s, mostly dogs and [[coyote]]s with [[mange]], that people call "chupacabra" due to their unusual appearance

In late October 2010, [[University of Michigan]] biologist Barry O'Connor concluded that all the chupacabra reports in the United States were simply coyotes infected with the parasite ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'', whose symptoms would explain most of the features of the chupacabra: they would be left with little fur, thickened skin, and rank odour. O'Connor theorized that the attacks on goats occurred "because these animals are greatly weakened, they're going to have a hard time hunting. So they may be forced into attacking livestock because it's easier than running down a rabbit or a deer." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://ur.umich.edu/1011/Oct25_10/1698-scary-chupacabras-monster |title=Scary chupacabras monster is as much victim as villain |publisher=umich.edu |date=2010-10-25 |accessdate=2011-12-24}}</ref>

Although several witnesses came to the conclusion that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect.<ref name="Radford2011" /> Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey.<ref name="Radford2011" /><ref name="Wade and Bowns">{{cite web|url=http://texnat.tamu.edu/about/procedures-for-evaluating/evaluation-of-suspected-predator-kills/ |title=Evaluation of Suspected Predator Kills  |accessdate=2011-12-24}}</ref> The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal [[bleeding]] or [[circulatory shock]].<ref name="Radford2011" /><ref name="Wade and Bowns" /> The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]], are to be expected since this is the only way that most land [[carnivores]] have to catch their prey.<ref name="Radford2011" />

There are reports of stray [[Mexican Hairless Dog]]s being mistaken for chupacabras.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/offbeat/2009/09/01/roldan.chupacabra.KSAT?iref=videosearch|title=Breaking News Videos, Story Video and Show Clips - CNN.com|date=12 March 2014|work=CNN}}</ref>

==Reputed sightings==
Numerous sightings of the creature were reported during the mid-1990s in Mexico, the U.S. Southwest and China. The first reported sightings were in [[Puerto Rico]], US, where more than 200 original reports were made in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chupacabra Science: How Evolution Made a Mythical Monster|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101028-chupacabra-evolution-halloween-science-monsters-chupacabras-picture/|work=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=6 April 2014|author=Ker Than|date=28 October 2010}}</ref>

[[Biology|Biologists]] in [[Texas]] examined samples from the two carcasses and determined they were also [[coyote]]s suffering from very severe cases of [[mange]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.banderasnews.com/0603/art-chupacabra.htm| title=Texas' Blood-Sucking Monster| accessdate=June 12, 2007}}</ref> In [[Coleman, Texas|Coleman]], Texas, a farmer named Reggie Lagow caught an animal in a trap he set up after the deaths of a number of his [[chicken]]s and [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]s.

Lagow provided the animal to Texas Parks and Wildlife officials for identification, but Lagow reported in a September 17, 2006, phone interview with John Adolfi, founder of the Lost World Museum, that the "critter was caught on a Tuesday and thrown out in Thursday's trash."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbc4.tv/news/4895053/detail.html|title=Texas Farmer Claims He Caught Legendary 'Chupacabra'|publisher=KNBC Los Angeles|date=August 25, 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051026021126/http://www.nbc4.tv/news/4895053/detail.html |archivedate= 2005-10-26}}</ref>

In April 2006, ''MosNews'' reported that the chupacabra was spotted in Russia for the first time. Reports from [[Central Federal District|Central Russia]] beginning in March 2005 tell of a beast that kills animals and sucks out their blood. 32 turkeys were killed and drained overnight. Reports later came from neighboring villages when 30 sheep were killed and had their blood drained. Finally, eyewitnesses were able to describe the chupacabra. In May 2006, experts were determined to track the animal down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2006/04/27/chupacabra.shtml|title=Chupacabra the Goatsucker Vampire Sightings Reported in Central Russia|publisher=MosNews|date=April 17, 2006}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> According to Russian paranormal researcher [[Vadim Chernobrov]], the territory allegedly frequented by chupacabras lies in the [[Kharkov]] region of [[Ukraine]] and neighboring regions of Russia, but also in parts of Belarus and Poland. Recently the reports appeared of chupacabra-like attacks in the Moscow region of Russia with dozens of birds and animals found bloodless, with strange incisions. At least twice the mysterious kangaroo-like creature ("with a crocodile head") attacked humans, causing no serious damage, though. According to Chernobrov, the two extraordinary things about the chupacabras' ways are that the thing leaves a 'vanishing' line of footprints, looking as if it takes off as a bird, and also it tends occasionally to assort its victim's bodies 'aesthetically', often by colour and size, or build pyramids with killed bodies.<ref name="gov">{{cite web | author = | date = | url  = http://planeta.moy.su/blog/govorim_i_pokazyvaem_chto_za_monstr_02_11_2012/2012-11-04-34142|title = What’s This Beast?| publisher  = NTV Russia.

In mid-August 2006, Michelle O'Donnell of [[Turner, Maine|Turner]], Maine, described an "evil looking" rodent-like animal with fangs that had been found dead alongside a road. The animal was apparently struck by a car, and was unidentifiable. Photographs were taken and witness reports seem to be in relative agreement that the creature was canine in appearance, but in widely published photos seemed unlike any dog or [[Gray Wolf|wolf]] in the area. Photos from other angles seem to show a [[Chow Chow|chow]] or [[akita (dog)|akita]] mixed-breed dog. It was reported that "the carcass was picked clean by [[vulture]]s before experts could examine it". For years, residents of [[Maine]] have reported a mysterious creature and a string of dog maulings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/MYSTERY_BEAST?SITE=WWL&TEMPLATE=STRANGEHEADS.html&SECTION=HOME| title='Hybrid Mutant' Found Dead in Maine|agency=Associated Press|date=August 16, 2006}}{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref>

On January 11, 2008, a sighting was reported at the province of [[Capiz]] in the [[Philippines]].

In September 2009, [[CNN]] aired a report showing closeup video footage of an unidentified dead animal. The same CNN report stated that locals have begun speculating the possibility that this might be a chupacabra. A [[Blanco, Texas|Blanco]], [[Texas]], taxidermist reported that he received the body from a former student whose cousin had discovered the animal in his barn, where it had succumbed to poison left out for rodents. The taxidermist expressed his belief that this is a genetically mutated coyote.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/offbeat/2009/09/01/roldan.chupacabra.KSAT?iref=videosearch CNN video report], September 3, 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/09/03/animal.mystery.chupacabra/index.html Texas mystery: 'Defective coyote' or chupacabra?], CNN, September 4, 2009.</ref>
