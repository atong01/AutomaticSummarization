Still, Dlfer, Fiechtl and Herzog commonly employed carabiners on the eve of<space/><link><target>World War I</target></link><space/>and from 1921 a model with a unit weight of 130 grams for climbers was made in Munich. The carabiner has been improved several times over the decades, making it more lightweight, reliable and durable.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Use</heading><paragraph>Carabiners are widely used in rope-intensive activities such as<space/><link><target>climbing</target></link>,<space/><link><target>arboriculture</target></link>,<space/><link><target>caving</target></link>,<space/><link><target>sailing</target></link>,<space/><link><target>hot air ballooning</target></link>,<space/><link><target>rope rescue</target></link>,<space/><link><target>construction</target></link>,<space/><link><target>industrial rope access</target><part>industrial rope work</part></link>,<space/><link><target>window cleaning</target></link>,<space/><link><target>whitewater rescue</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>acrobatics</target></link>.

Often referred to as carabiner-style, carabiner keyrings and other light-use clips of similar style and design have also become popular. Most are stamped with a &quot;Not For Climbing&quot; or similar warning due to a common lack of load-testing and safety standards in manufacturing.

Rock climbers frequently connect two non-locking carabiners with a short length of nylon web to create a<space/><link><target>quickdraw</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Three gate types are common:</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>Straight gate: The most utilitarian, and hence most popular.</listitem><listitem>Bent gate: Curved gates allow for easier clipping in and out in special situations, such as connecting a rope to a quickdraw. Gate strength remains on a par with straight-gate carabiners.</listitem><listitem>Wire gate: The lightest type, with a strength roughly equal to the others, allowing more to be carried for a given weight. Wire gates are less prone to icing up than solid gates, an advantage in Alpine mountaineering and ice climbing. The reduced gate mass makes their wire bales less prone to 'gate flutter,' a dangerous condition created by irregular impact forces generated by the climbing rope or contact with hard surfaces in a fall which momentarily opens the gate (and both lowers the breaking strength of the carabiner when open and potentially allows the rope to escape).</listitem></list><heading level='4'>Locking</heading><paragraph>Locking carabiners have the same general shape as non-locking carabiners but have an additional mechanism securing the gate. These mechanisms may be either threaded sleeves (&quot;screw-lock&quot;), spring-loaded sleeves (&quot;twist-lock&quot;), magnetic levers (&quot;Magnetron&quot;) or double-gates (&quot;Twin-Gate&quot;).</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Screw-lock: Have a threaded sleeve over the gate which must be engaged and disengaged manually. They have fewer moving parts than spring-loaded mechanisms, are less prone to malfunctioning due to contamination or component fatigue, easier to employ one-handed. They, however, require more total effort and are more time-consuming than twist-lock.</listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem>Twist-lock: Have a security sleeve which must be manually rotated to disengage, but which springs closed automatically upon release. They offer the advantage of re-engaging without additional user input, but being spring-loaded are prone to both spring fatigue and their more complex mechanisms becoming balky from dirt, ice, or other contamination. They are also difficult to engage one-handed and with gloves on.</listitem><listitem>Magnetic: Have two small levers with embedded magnets on either side of the locking gate which must be pushed or pinched simultaneously to disengage. Upon release the levers pull shut and into the locked position against a small steel insert in the carabiner nose. With the gate open the magnets in the two levers repel each other so they do not lock or stick together, which might prevent the gate from closing properly. Advantages are very easy one-handed operation, re-engaging without additional user input and few mechanical parts that can fail.</listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem>Double-Gate: Have two opposed overlapping gates at the opening which prevent a rope or anchor from inadvertently passing through the gate in either direction, but which can be opened by splitting the gates with a fingertip, allowing the carabiner to be quickly opened with and closed with one hand. The lack of a rotating lock prevents a rolling knot, such as the Munter hitch, from unlocking the gate and passing through, giving a measure of inherent safety in use and reducing mechanical complexity.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/grivel-mega-k6g-twingate-review</arg><arg name="title">Grivel Mega K6g Twingate</arg><arg name="work">rockandice.com</arg></template></extension></listitem></list><heading level='2'>Certification</heading><heading level='3'>Europe</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>Recreation: Carabiners sold for use in climbing in Europe must conform to standard EN 12275:1998 &quot;Mountaineering equipment Connectors Safety requirements and test methods&quot;, which governs testing protocols, rated strengths, and markings.
