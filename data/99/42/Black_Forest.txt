The '''Black Forest''' ({{lang-de|Schwarzwald}}, {{IPA-de|ˈʃvaʁt͡svalt|pron}}) is a large [[forest]]ed [[mountain range]] in the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] in southwestern [[Germany]]. It is bounded by the [[Rhine]] valley to the west and south. Its highest peak is the [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]] with an elevation of 1,493 metres (4,898&nbsp;ft). The region is almost rectangular in shape with a length of {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} and breadth of up to {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

== Geography ==
[[File:High Black Forest nr Breitnau.JPG|thumb|Woods and pastures of the High Black Forest near Breitnau]]
The Black Forest stretches from the [[High Rhine]] in the south to the [[Kraichgau]] in the north. In the west it is bounded by the [[Upper Rhine Plain]] (which, from a natural region perspective, also includes the low chain of foothills); in the east it transitions to the [[Gäu (Baden-Württemberg)|Gäu]], [[Baar (landscape)|Baar]] and hill country west of the [[Klettgau]]. The Black Forest is the highest part of the [[South German Scarplands]] and much of it is densely [[forest|wooded]]. It is composed of rocks of the [[crystalline basement]] and [[Bunter Sandstone]] and its natural boundary with the surrounding landscapes is formed by the emergence of [[muschelkalk]], which is absent from the Black Forest bedrock. Thanks to the fertility of the soil which is dependent on the underlying rock, this line is both a vegetation boundary as well as the border between the [[Altsiedelland]] ("old settlement land") and the Black Forest, which was not permanently settled until the [[High Middle Ages]]. From north to south the Black Forest extends for over 150&nbsp;kilometres, attaining a width of up to 50&nbsp;kilometres in the south, and up to 30&nbsp;kilometres in the north.<ref>[http://www.landwirtschaft-mlr.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1257064_l1/index1221750829191.html Information Service for Agriculture, Nutrition and Regional Planning] at the Ministry for Regional Planning, Nutrition and Consumer Protection in Baden-Württemberg</ref> [[Tectonically]] the range forms a lifted [[fault block]], which rises prominently in the west from the Upper Rhine Plain, whilst seen from the east it has the appearance of a heavily forested plateau.

=== Natural regions ===
The [[natural region]]s of the Black Forest are separated by various features:

[[Geomorphologically]], the main division is between the gentle eastern slopes with their mostly rounded hills and broad plateaux (so-called [[Danube|Danubian]] [[relief (geology)|relief]], especially prominent in the north and east on the Bunter Sandstone) and the deeply incised, steeply falling terrain in the west that drops into the [[Upper Rhine Graben]]; the so-called Valley Black Forest (''Talschwarzwald'') with its [[Rhine|Rhenanian]] relief. It is here, in the west, where the highest mountains and the greatest local differences in height (of up to 1000&nbsp;metres) are found. The valleys are often narrow and ravine-like; but rarely basin-shaped. The summits are rounded and there are also the remnants of plateaux and [[arête]]-like landforms.

Geologically the clearest division is also between east and west. Large areas of the eastern Black Forest, the lowest layer of the [[Swabian-Franconian Scarpland|South German Scarplands]] composed of [[Bunter Sandstone]], are covered by seemingly endless coniferous forest with their island clearings. The exposed [[basement (geology)|basement]] in the west, predominantly made up of [[metamorphic rock]]s and [[granite]]s, was, despite its rugged topography, easier to settle and appears much more open and inviting today with its varied meadow valleys.

[[File:Luftaufnahme-Feldberg-Seebuck-30122004.jpg|thumb|The [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]], the highest mountain in the Black Forests, southeast of [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]]]]
The most common way of dividing the regions of the Black Forest is, however, from north to south. Until the 1930s, the Black Forest was divided into the Northern and Southern Black Forest, the boundary being the [[Kinzig (Rhine)|line of the Kinzig valley]]. Later the Black Forest was divided into the heavily forested [[Northern Black Forest]], the lower, central section, predominantly used for agriculture in the valleys, was the [[Middle Black Forest]] and the much higher [[Southern Black Forest]] with its distinctive highland economy and [[ice age]] glacial relief. The term [[High Black Forest]] referred to the highest areas of the South and southern Middle Black Forest.

The boundaries drawn were, however, quite varied. In 1931, Robert Gradmann called the Middle Black Forest the catchment area of the Kinzig and in the west the section up to the lower [[Elz (Rhine)|Elz]] and Kinzig tributary of the [[Gutach (Kinzig)|Gutach]].<ref>Robert Gradmann: ''Süddeutschland.'' Engelhorn, Stuttgart 1931. Reprint: [[Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft]] Darmstadt, ISBN 3-534-00124-9. Vol. 2: ''The einzelnen Landschaften'', p. 85.</ref> A pragmatic division, which is oriented not just on natural and cultural regions, uses the most important transverse valleys. Based on that, the Middle Black Forest is bounded by the Kinzig in the north and der line from [[Dreisam]] to [[Gutach (Wutach)]] in the south, corresponding to the [[Bonndorf Graben]] zone and the course of the present day [[Bundesstraße 31|B&nbsp;31]].

In 1959, Rudolf Metz combined the earlier divisions and proposed a modified tripartite division himself, which combined natural and cultural regional approaches and was widely used.<ref>c.f.

==== Work of the Institute of Applied Geography ====
The [[Handbook of the Natural Region Divisions of Germany]] published by the Federal Office of Regional Geography (''Bundesanstalt für Landeskunde'') since the early 1950s names the Black Forest as one of six tertiary level major landscape regions within the secondary level region of the [[South German Scarplands]] and, at the same time, one of nine new major landscape unit groups. It is divided into six so-called major units (level 4 landscapes).<ref name="Meynen">Emil Meynen, Josef Schmithüsen: ''[[Handbuch der naturräumlichen Gliederung Deutschlands]].'' Bundesanstalt für Landeskunde, Remagen/Bad Godesberg 1953–1962 (9 instalments in 8 books, updated 1:1,000,000 map with major units, 1960).</ref> This division was refined and modified in several, successor publications (1:200,000 individual map sheets) up to 1967, each covering individual sections of the map. The mountain range was also divided into three regions. The northern boundary of the Middle Black Forest in this classification runs south of the Rench Valley and the [[Kniebis]] to near Freudenstadt. Its southern boundary varied with each edition.<ref>Emil Meynen, Josef Schmithüsen (editors: ''Handbuch der naturräumlichen Gliederung Deutschlands.''

[[File:Yburg von Fremersberg (cropped).jpg|thumb|Slopes of the Northern Black Forest to the Upper Rhine Plain (Northern Black Forest Valleys)]]
The Black Forest Foothills (''Schwarzwald-Randplatten'', 150) geomorphologically form plateaux on the north and northeast periphery of the mountain range that descend to the [[Kraichgau]] in the north and the [[Heckengäu]] landscapes in the east. They are incised by valleys, especially those of the [[Nagold (river)|Nagold]] river system, into individual [[interfluve]]s; a narrow northwestern finger extends to beyond the [[Enz]] near [[Neuenbürg]] and also borders the middle reaches of the [[Alb (Upper Rhine)|Alb]] to the west as far as a point immediately above [[Ettlingen]]. To the southwest it is adjoined by the Black Forest ''[[Grinden]]'' and Enz Hills (''Grindenschwarzwald und Enzhöhen'', 151), along the upper reaches of the Enz and [[Murg (North Black Forest)|Murg]], forming the heart of the Northern Black Forest. The west of the Northern Black Forest is formed by the Northern Black Forest Valleys (''Nördliche Talschwarzwald'', 152) with the middle reaches of the Murg around [[Gernsbach]], the middle course of the [[Oos (river)|Oos]] to [[Baden-Baden]], the middle reaches of the [[Bühlot]] above [[Bühl (Baden)|Bühls]] and the upper reaches of the [[Rench]] around [[Oppenau]]. Their exit valleys from the mountain range are all oriented towards the northwest.

[[File:Langbrunnen Welschensteinach 01 Kandelhöhenweg.jpg|thumb|Grassland economy in side valleys of the Kinzig, Middle Black Forest]]
The Middle Black Forest (153) is mainly restricted to the [[drainage basin|catchment area]] of the River [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig]] above [[Offenburg]] as well as the [[Schutter (Kinzig)|Schutter]] and the low hills north of the [[Elz (Rhine)|Elz]].

The Southeastern Black Forest (''Südöstliche Schwarzwald'', 154) consists mainly of the catchment areas of the upper reaches of the [[Danube]] headstreams, the [[Brigach]] and [[Breg (river)|Breg]] as well as the left side valleys of the [[Wutach (river)|Wutach]] north of [[Neustadt im Schwarzwald|Neustadt]] – and thus draining from the northeast of the Southern Black Forest. To the south and west it is adjoined by the High Black Forest (''Hochschwarzwald'', 155) with the highest summits in the whole range around the [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]] and the [[Belchen (Black Forest)|Belchen]]. Its eastern part, the Southern Black Forest Plateau, is oriented towards the Danube, but drained over the Wutach and the [[Alb (High Rhine)|Alb]] into the Rhine. The southern crest of the Black Forest in the west is deeply incised by the Rhine into numerous ridges. Immediately right of the [[Wiese (river)|Wiese]] above [[Lörrach]] rises the relatively small Bunter Sandstone-[[Rotliegendes]] table of the Weintenau Uplands (''Weitenauer Bergland'') in the extreme southwest of the Black Forest; morphologically, geologically and climatically it is separate from the other parts of the Southern Black Forest and, in this classification, is also counted as part of the High Black Forest.

=== Mountains ===
{{See also|List of mountains and hills in the Black Forest}}

At {{Höhe|1493|DE-NHN|link=true}} the [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]] in the Southern Black Forest is the range's highest summit. Also in the same area are the [[Herzogenhorn]] ({{Höhe|1415}}) and the [[Belchen (Black Forest)|Belchen]] ({{Höhe|1414}}).

In generally the mountains of the Southern or High Black Forest are higher than those in the Northern Black Forest. The highest Black Forest peak north of the Freiburg–Höllental–Neustadt line is the [[Kandel (mountain)|Kandel]] ({{Höhe|1241.4}}). Like the highest point of the Northern Black Forest, the [[Hornisgrinde]] ({{Höhe|1163}}), or the Southern Black Forest lookout mountains, the [[Schauinsland]] ({{Höhe|1284.4}}) and [[Blauen (Badenweiler)|Blauen]] ({{Höhe|1164.7}}{{GeoQuelle|DE|BFN-Karten}}) it lies near the western rim of the range.

=== Rivers and lakes ===

[[File:Schluchsee.jpg|thumb|The Schluchsee, north of [[St. Blasien]].]]
Rivers in the Black Forest include the [[Danube]] (which originates in the Black Forest as the confluence of the [[Brigach]] and [[Breg (river)|Breg]] rivers), the [[Enz]], the [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig]], the [[Murg (Northern Black Forest)|Murg]], the [[Nagold River|Nagold]], the [[Neckar]], the [[Rench]], and the [[Wiese]]. The Black Forest occupies part of the [[continental divide]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] [[drainage basin]] (drained by the [[Rhine]]) and the [[Black Sea]] drainage basin (drained by the Danube).

* [[Fischbach (Eschach)|Glasbach]] (18&nbsp;km), hydrological main artery of the [[Neckar]] system

Important lakes of natural, [[glacial]] origin in the Black Forest include the [[Titisee]], the [[Mummelsee]] and the [[Feldsee]]. Especially in the Northern Black Forest are a number of other, smaller [[tarn (lake)|tarns]]. Numerous [[reservoir]]s like the - formerly natural but much smaller – [[Schluchsee]] with the other lakes of the ''Schluchseewerk'', the [[Schwarzenbach Reservoir]], the [[Kleine Kinzig Reservoir]] or the [[Nagold Reservoir]] are used for [[electricity generation]], [[flood protection]] or [[drinking water]] supply.

== Geology ==
[[File:Schwarzwald topo.jpg|thumb|Topography of the Black Forest]]
The Black Forest consists of a cover of [[sandstone]] on top of a core of [[gneiss]] and [[granite]]s. Formerly it shared tectonic evolution with the nearby [[Vosges Mountains]]. Later during the Middle [[Eocene]] a [[rifting]] period affected the area and caused formation of the [[Rhine graben]]. During the last [[glacial period]] of the [[Würm glaciation]], the Black Forest was covered by glaciers; several [[Tarn (lake)|tarns (or lakes)]] such as the [[Mummelsee]] are remains of this period.

=== Formation ===
Since the irruption of the [[Upper Rhine Graben]] during the [[Eocene]] epoch, the two shoulders on either side have been uplifted: the Black Forest to the east and the [[Vosges]] to the west. In the centre lies the [[Kaiserstuhl (Baden)|Kaiserstuhl volcano]] which dates to the [[Miocene]]. In the times that followed, the [[Mesozoic]] [[platform (geology)|platform]] on the uplands was largely eroded, apart from remains of [[bunter sandstone]] and [[rotliegendes]], but it has survived within the graben itself. During the [[Pliocene]] a pronounced, but uneven bulge occurred which especially affected the southern Black Forest, including the Feldberg. As a result, the upper surface of the [[basement (geology)|basement]] in the northern part of the forest around the Hornisgrinde is considerably lower. In the central Black Forest, the tectonic [[syncline]] of the Kinzig and Murg emerged.

The geological foundation of the Black Forest is formed by the crystalline bedrock of the [[Variscan Orogeny|Variscan]] basement. This is covered in the east and northeast by bunter sandstone slabs, the so-called platforms. On the western edge a descending, [[step-fault]]-like, foothill zone borders the Upper Rhine Graben consisting of rocks of the [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] periods.

=== Basement ===
The dominant rocks of the basement are [[gneiss]] (ortho- and paragneisses, in the south also [[migmatite]]s and [[diatexite]]s, e.&nbsp;g. on the Schauinsland and Kandel). These gneisses were penetrated by a number of granitic bodies during the [[Carboniferous]] period. Among the bigger ones are the Triberg Granite and the [[Forbach Granite]], the youngest is the Bärhalde Granite. In the south lies the zone of Badenweiler-Lenzkirch, in which Palaeozoic rocks have been preserved (volcanite and sedimentary rocks), which are interpreted as the intercalated remains of a [[microcontinent]]al collision. Still further in the southeast (around Todtmoos) is a range of exotic inclusions: [[gabbro]] from [[Ehrsberg]], [[serpentinite]]s and [[pyroxenite]]s near Todtmoos, [[norite]] near [[Dachsberg (Southern Black Forest)|Horbach]]), which are possibly the remnants of an [[accretionary wedge]] from a continental collision. Also noteworthy are the basins in the [[rotliegendes]], for example the Schramberg or the Baden-Baden Basin, with, in places thick, quartz-porphyry and [[tuff]] plates (exposed, for example, on the rock massif of [[Battert]] near Baden-Baden). Thick rotliegendes rock, covered by bunter, also occurs in the north of the [[Dinkelberg]] block (several hundred metres thick in the Basel [[geothermal gradient|geothermal]] borehole). Even further to the southeast, under the Jura, lies the North Swiss Permocarboniferous Basin.

=== Platform ===
Above the crystalline basement of the Northern Black Forest and the adjacent parts of the Central Black Forest the bunter sandstone platforms rise in prominent steps. The most resistant surface strata on the stepped terrain of the ''[[grinden]]'' uplands and the heights around the upper reaches of the [[Enz]], which have been heavily eroded by the tributaries of the Murg, is the silicified main conglomerate (Middle Bunter). To the east and north are the [[nappe]]s of the Upper Bunter (platten sandstones and red clays). South of the Kinzig the bunter sandstone zone narrows to a fringe in the east of the mountain range.

=== Ice age and topography ===
It is considered proven that the Black Forest was heavily glaciated during the peak periods of at least the [[Riß glaciation|Riß]] and [[Würm glaciation]]s. (up to about 10,000 years ago). This glacial geomorphology characterizes almost all of the High Black Forest as well as the main ridge of the Northern Black Forest. Apart from that, it is only discernable from a large number of [[cirque]]s mainly facing northeast. Especially in this direction snow accumulated on the shaded and leeward slopes of the summit plateau to form short cirque glaciers that made the sides of these funnel-shaped depressions. There are still [[tarn (lake)|tarns]] in some of these old cirques, partly a result of the [[anthropogenic]] elevation of the low-side lip of the cirque, such as the [[Mummelsee]], [[Wildsee (Ruhestein)|Wildsee]], [[Schurmsee]], [[Glaswaldsee]], [[Buhlbachsee]], [[Nonnenmattweiher]] and [[Feldsee]]. The Titisee formed as [[glacial lake]] behind a glacial [[moraine]].

== Climate ==
Climatically the mountain range differs from its surrounding countryside in having lower temperatures and higher rainfall. The highlands of the Black Forest are characterized by regular rainfall throughout the year. However, temperatures do not fall evenly with increasing elevation, nor does the rainfall increase uniformly. Rather, the precipitation rises quickly even in the lower regions and is disproportionately heavy on the rainier western side of the mountains.

=== Precipitation ===
[[File:Schwarzwaldschnee.jpg|thumb|Winter on the [[Schauinsland]]. In the background are the Vosges]]
The wettest areas are the highlands around the Hornisgrinde in the north and around the Belchen and Feldberg in the south, where annual rainfall reaches 1,800-2,100&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{Literatur | Herausgeber=Ekkehard Liehl, Wolf Dieter Sick | Titel=Der Schwarzwald.

On the exposed east side of the Central Black Forest, it is much drier again. Thus, the annual rainfall here is only about 750&nbsp;l/m² in places.

=== Temperature and sunshine ===
Thermally, the higher elevations of the Black Forest are characterized by relatively small annual fluctuations and steamed extreme values. This is due to the frequent light winds and greater cloud cover in summer. During the winter months, frequent high pressure means that the summits are often bathed in sunshine, while the valleys disappear under a thick blanket of fog as a result of pockets of cold air ([[temperature inversion]]).

== History ==
[[File:Part of Tabula Peutingeriana centered around present day Black Forest.jpg|thumb|The Black Forest on the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]: a mountain chain with fantastically formed trees as a symbol of an unsettled and virtually inaccessible terrain]]
[[File:Schwarzwaelder Bauernhaus um 1900.jpg|thumb|[[Black Forest farmhouse]] around 1900]]
[[File:Schwarzwaelderin in Tracht um 1900.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|An unmarried Black Forest woman wearing a red ''[[Bollenhut]]'' (1900)]]

In ancient times, the Black Forest was known as ''[[Abnoba mons]]'', after the Celtic deity, [[Abnoba]]. In Roman times ([[Late Antiquity]]), it was given the name ''Marciana Silva'' ("Marcynian Forest", from the Germanic word ''marka'' = "border").<ref>[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] 21, 8, 2; see {{Reflist|I,1|104||Abnoba|[[Maximilian Ihm]]|RE:Abnoba}}</ref> The Black Forest probably represented the border area of the [[Marcomanni]] ("border people") who were settled east of the Roman ''[[limes]]''. They, in turn, were part of the Germanic tribe of [[Suebi]], who subsequently gave their name to the historic state of [[Swabia]]. With the exception of Roman settlements on the perimeter (e.g. the baths in Badenweiler, and mines near Badenweiler and Sulzburg) and the construction of the Roman road of [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzigtalstraße]], the colonization of the Black Forest was not carried out by the Romans, but by the [[Alemanni]]. They settled and first colonized the valleys, crossing the old [[settlement boundary]], the so-called "red sandstone border", for example, from the region of [[Baar (region)|Baar]]. Soon afterwards, increasingly higher areas and adjacent forests were colonized, so that by the end of the 10th century, the first settlements could be found in the red (bunter) sandstone region. These include, for example, [[Rötenbach (Friedenweiler)|Rötenbach]], which was first mentioned in 819.

Some of the uprisings (including the [[Bundschuh movement]]) that preceded the [[German Peasants' War]], originated in the 16th century from the Black Forest. Further peasant unrest, in the shape of the [[saltpetre]] uprisings, took place over the next two centuries in [[Hotzenwald]].

Remnants of military fortifications dating from the 17th and 18th centuries can be found in the Black Forest, especially on the mountain passes. Examples include the multiple baroque fieldworks of Margrave [[Louis William of Baden-Baden]] or individual defensive positions such as Alexander's Redoubt, the ''Röschenschanze'' and the Swedish Redoubt (''Schwedenschanze'').

Originally, the Black Forest was a mixed forest of deciduous trees and firs - see the [[history of the forest in Central Europe]]. At the higher elevations [[spruce]] also grew. In the middle of the 19th century, the Black Forest was almost completely deforested by intensive forestry and was subsequently replanted, mostly with spruce [[monoculture]]s.

In 1990, extensive damage to the forest was caused by Hurricanes [[Vivian (hurricane)|Vivian]] and [[Wiebke (hurricane)|Wiebke]].<ref>These severe storms or cyclones are commonly known as hurricanes even though they are not true tropical hurricanes.</ref> On 26 December 1999, [[Cyclone Lothar and Martin|Hurricane Lothar]] raged across the Black Forest and caused even greater damage, especially to the spruce monocultures. As had happened following the 1990 storms, large quantities of fallen logs were kept in provisional wet storage areas for years. The effects of the storm are demonstrated by the [[Lothar Path]], a forest educational and adventure trail at the nature centre in [[Ruhestein]] on a highland timber forest of about 10 hectares that was destroyed by a hurricane.

Several areas of storm damage, both large and small, were left to nature and have developed today into a natural mixed forest again.

Mining developed in the Black Forest due to its ore deposits, which were often lode-shaped. The formation of these lode-shaped deposits ([[Schauinsland Pit]]: [[zinc]], [[lead]], about 700–1000 g [[silver]]/ton of lead; [[baryte]], [[fluorite]], less lead and zinc in the Kinzig valley; [[BiCoNi Formation|BiCoNi]] ores near [[Wittichen]], [[uranium]] discovered in the [[Krunkelbach Pit|Krunkelbach valley]] near [[Menzenschwand]] but never officially mined) often used to be linked to the intrusion of Carboniferous granite in the para- and orthogneisses. More recent research has revealed that most of these lode fillings are much younger ([[Triassic]] to [[Tertiary]]). Economic deposits of other minerals included: fluorite in the Northern Black Forest near [[Pforzheim]], baryte in the central region near [[Freudenstadt]], fluorite along with lead and silver near Wildschapbach, baryte and fluorite in the Rankach valley and near Ohlsbach, in the Southern Black Forest near [[Todtnau]], [[Wieden (Black Forest)|Wieden]] and Urberg.

Small liquid magmatic deposits of nickel-magnetite gravel in [[norite]] were mined or prospected in the Hotzenwald forest near Horbach and [[Todtmoos]]. Strata-bound deposits include iron ores in the Dogger layer of the foothill zone and uranium near Müllenbach/Baden-Baden. [[Stone coal]] is only found near [[Berghaupten]] and [[Hohberg|Diersburg]], but was always only of local importance.

Chronology: [[Stone Age]] mining of [[haematite]] (as red pigment) near [[Sulzburg]]. By the 5th and 6th centuries B.C. [[iron ore]] was being mined by the [[Celts]] in the Northern Black Forest (for example in [[Neuenbürg]]). Especially in the Middle Black Forest, but also in the south (for example in the [[Münstertal/Schwarzwald|Münster valley]]) ore mining was already probably taking place in Roman times ([[mining]] of silver and lead ore; evidence of this at Sulzburg and possibly [[Badenweiler]]). Until the [[High Middle Ages]] the High Black Forest was practically unsettled. In the course of inland colonisation in the Late High Middle Ages even the highlands were cultivated by settlers from the abbeys ([[St. Peter's Abbey, Black Forest|St. Peter's]], [[St. Märgen's Abbey|St. Märgen's]]). In the Late High Middle Ages (from about 1100) mining experienced another boom, especially around Todtnau, in the Münster and Suggen valleys and, later, on the [[Schauinsland]] too. It is believed that around 800–1,000 miners lived and worked in the Münster valley until the end of the Middle Ages. After the Plague, which afflicted the valley in 1516, the [[German Peasants' War]] (1524–26) and the [[Thirty Years' War]], mining in the region declined until just a few pits remained.

An important mining area was the [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig valley]] and its side valleys. The small mining settlement of [[Wittichen Abbey|Wittichen]] near [[Schenkenzell]] in the upper Kinzig valley had many pits in which in [[baryte]], [[cobalt]] and [[silver]] of many kinds were mined. A circular, geological footpath runs today past the old pits and [[tip (mining)|tips]].

Another boom began in the early 18th century after the loss of the [[Alsace]] to France. It lasted until the 19th century. May pits from this period may be visited today as [[show mine]]s; for example the Teufelsgrund Pit ([[Münstertal/Schwarzwald|Münstertal]]), the [[Finstergrund]] Pit near Wieden, the Hoffnungsstollen ("Hope Gallery") at Todtmoos, the mine in the [[Schauinsland]], the formerly especially silver-rich Wenzel Pit in [[Oberwolfach]] and Gr. Segen Gottes ("God's Great Blessing") in [[Haslach im Kinzigtal|Haslach]]-Schnellingen.

Non-ferrous metal mining in the Black Forest continued until the middle of the 20th century near [[Bad Rippoldsau-Schapbach|Wildschapbach]] and on the Schauinsland (to 1954); fluorite and baryte are still mined today at the [[Clara Pit]] in the Rankach valley in [[Oberwolfach]]. Iron ores of the Dogger formation was worked until the 1970s near [[Ringsheim]] and was smelted in [[Kehl]].

Compared with the [[Harz]] and [[Ore Mountains]] the quantities of silver extracted in the Black Forest were rather modest and reached only about 10 per cent of that produced in the other silver-mining regions.

There are many [[show mine]]s in the Black Forest. These include:
the Frischglück Pit near [[Neuenbürg]], the Hella Glück Pit near [[Neubulach]], the Silbergründle Pit near [[Seebach (Baden)|Seebach]], the Himmlich Heer Pit near [[Hallwangen]], the Heilige Drei Könige Pit near [[Freudenstadt]], the Segen Gottes Pit near [[Haslach im Kinzigtal|Haslach]], the Wenzel Pit near [[Oberwolfach]], the Caroline Pit near [[Sexau]], the Suggental Silver Mine near [[Waldkirch]], the Schauinsland Pit near [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], the Teufelsgrund Pit near [[Münstertal/Schwarzwald|Münstertal]], the [[Finstergrund]] Pit near [[Wieden (Black Forest)|Wieden]] and the Hoffnungsstollen Pit near [[Todtmoos]].

=== Forestry ===
[[File:Expo 2000 Dach Holzkonstruktion.jpg|thumb|Trunks of [[White Fir]] from [[Gersbach (Schopfheim)#Forestry|Gersbach]] hold up the largest unsupported wooden roof in the world at [[Expo 2000]]]]
For several centuries logs from the Black Forest were rafted down the [[Enz]], [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig]], [[Murg (Northern Black Forest)|Murg]], [[Nagold (river)|Nagold]] and [[Rhine]] rivers for use in the [[ship]]ping industry, as construction [[timber]] and for other purposes. This branch of industry boomed in the 18th century and led to large-scale clearances. As most of the long, straight pine logs were transported downriver for shipbuilding in the [[Netherlands]], they were referred to as "Dutchmen". The logs were used in the Netherlands, above all, as [[Pile (type of foundation)|piles]] for house construction in the sandy and wet ground. Even today in Amsterdam large numbers of historic building are built on these posts and the reforestation of the Black Forest with spruce [[monoculture]]s testifies to the destruction of the original [[mixed forest]]. With the expansion of the railway and road network as alternative transportation, rafting largely came to an end in the late 19th century.

Today, fir trees, especially those which are very tall and branchless to a great height, are shipped mainly to Japan. The global advertising impact of [[Expo 2000]] fuelled a resurgence of timber exports. The importance of the timber resources of the Black Forest has also increased sharply recently due to the increasing demand for [[wood pellet]]s for heating.

=== Glass making, charcoal burning and potash mining ===
The timber resources of the Black Forest provided the basis for other sectors of the economy that have now largely disappeared. [[Charcoal burner]]s (''Köhler'') built their wood piles (''Meiler'') in the woods and produced charcoal which, like the products of the [[potash]] boilers - further processed ''inter alia'' for the [[glassmaking]] industry. The Black Forest supplied raw materials and energy for the manufacture of [[forest glass]]. This is evinced today by a number of [[glassblowing]] houses e.g. in the Hoellental in Todtnau and [[Wolfach]] and the Forest Glass Centre in [[Gersbach (Schopfheim)]], which is open to visitors.

=== Precision engineering, clock and jewellery manufacture ===
[[File:Clockmakers black forest.jpg|thumb|[[Clockmaker]]'s workshop in a sitting room (postcard around 1900)]]
{{main|Clock production in the Black Forest}}
In the relatively inaccessible Black Forest valleys [[industrialization]] did not arrive until late in the day. In winter, many [[farmer]]s made wooden [[cuckoo clock]]s to supplement their income. This developed in the 19th century into the precision engineering and watch industry, which boomed with the arrival of the railway in many of the Black Forest valleys. The initial disadvantage of their remote location, which led to the development of precision-engineered wooden handicrafts, became a competitive advantage because of their access to raw materials: timber from the forest and metal from the mines. As part of a structural support programme the Baden State Government founded the first clockmaking school in 1850 in [[Furtwangen]] to ensure that small artisans were given good training and thus better sales opportunities. Due to the increasing demand for mechanical devices, large companies such as [[Junghans]] and [[Kienzle Uhren|Kienzle]] became established. In the 20th century, the production of consumer electronics was developed by companies such as [[SABA (electronics manufacturer)|SABA]], [[Dual (brand)|Dual]] and [[Harman Becker Automotive Systems|Becker]]. In the 1970s, the industry declined due to Far Eastern competition. Nevertheless, the Black Forest remains a centre for the metalworking industry and is home to many high-tech companies.

Since the start of industrialisation there have been numerous firms in [[Pforzheim]] that manufacture jewellery and work with precious metals and stones. There is also a [[goldsmith]]'s school in Pforzheim.

=== Hydropower ===
[[File:Hornberg Straßerhofmühle.jpg|thumb|The Straßerhof Mill in [[Hornberg]], a typical Black Forest farming mill]]
[[File:Hornbergbecken leer.jpg|thumb|The [[Hornberg Basin]] near [[Herrischried]], upper reservoir of the Wehr [[pumped storage station]] (emptied, May 2008).]]
Due to the large amounts of precipitation and elevation changes the Black Forest has significant [[hydropower]] potential. This was used until the 19th century especially for operating numerous [[water mill|mills]], including [[sawmill]]s and [[hammer mill]]s and was one of the local factors in the industrialization of some Black Forest valleys.

Since the 20th century, the Black Forest has seen the large scale generation of electrical power using [[run-of-the-river power plant]]s and [[pumped storage power station]]s. From 1914 to 1926, the Rudolf Fettweis Company was established in the Murg valley in the Northern Black Forest with the construction of the [[Schwarzenbach Dam]]. In 1932, the [[Schluchsee]] reservoir, with its new dam, became the upper basin of a pumped storage power plant. In 2013 the association of the Southern Black Forest's ''Schluchseewerk'' owned five power plants with 14 storage tanks. At the [[Hornberg Basin]] topographical conditions allow an average head of water of 625&nbsp;m to drive the turbines before it flows into the [[Wehra Reservoir]].

In the 21st century, in the wake of the [[Renewable Energy Act]], numerous smaller run-of-the-river power stations were re-opened or newly constructed.

==Political jurisdiction==
Administratively, the Black Forest belongs completely to the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and comprises the cities of [[Pforzheim]], [[Baden-Baden]] and [[Freiburg]] as well as the following districts (''[[Districts of Germany|Kreise]]''). In the north: [[Enz (district)|Enz]], [[Rastatt (district)|Rastatt]] and [[Calw (district)|Calw]]; in the middle: [[Freudenstadt (district)|Freudenstadt]], [[Ortenaukreis]] and [[Rottweil (district)|Rottweil]]; in the south: [[Emmendingen (district)|Emmendingen]], [[Schwarzwald-Baar]], [[Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald]], [[Lörrach (district)|Lörrach]] and [[Waldshut (district)|Waldshut]].

== Tourism ==

The main industry of the Black Forest is [[tourism]]. Black Forest Tourism assesses there are around 140,000 direct full-time jobs in the tourist sector and around 34.8 million tourist overnight stays in 2009.<ref>Inklusive Privatunterkünften und der Übernachtung von Verwandten und Bekannten. [http://www.schwarzwald-tourismus.info/content/view/full/37287 Schwarzwald Tourismus GmbH: ''Tourismusentwicklung im Schwarzwald 2009''], retrieved 12 October 2011.</ref>

In spring, summer and autumn extensive hiking and cycleway networks enable various target groups to use the natural region. Winter sports include both downhill and Nordic skiing for which there are numerous facilities.

=== Tourist destinations ===
[[File:Hinterzarten Kirche und Schanze.jpg|thumb|Hinterzarten in the Southern Black Forest: church and Adler ski jump]]
[[File:Altensteiger Altstadt.JPG|thumb|The ''Altstadt'' of [[Altensteig]] in the Northern Black Forest]]
The most heavily frequented tourist destinations and resorts in the Black Forest are the [[Titisee (lake)|Titisee]] and the [[Schluchsee]]. Both lakes offer opportunities for [[water sport]]s like [[diving]] and [[windsurfing]]. From [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] these lakes may be reached on the [[Bundesstraße 31|B 31]] through the [[Höllental (Black Forest)|Höllental]], via the [[Hirschsprung (Black Forest)|Hirschsprung monument]] located at the narrowest point in the valley, and the [[Sankt Oswald im Höllental|Oswald Chapel]] below the Ravenna Gorge.

One oft-visited town is [[Baden-Baden]] with its thermal baths and festival hall. Other thermal baths are found in the spa resorts of [[Badenweiler]], [[Bad Herrenalb]], [[Bad Wildbad]], [[Bad Krozingen]], [[Bad Liebenzell]] and [[Bad Bellingen]].

Other popular tourist destinations are the old imperial town of [[Gengenbach]], the former county towns of [[Wolfach]], [[Schiltach]] and [[Haslach im Kinzigtal]] (both on the [[German Timber-Frame Road]]) and the flower and wine village of [[Sasbachwalden]] at the foot of the Hornisgrinde. Picturesque old towns may be visited in [[Altensteig]], [[Dornstetten]], [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], [[Gernsbach]], [[Villingen-Schwenningen|Villingen]] and [[Zell am Harmersbach]]. [[Baiersbronn]] is a centre of gastronomic excellence, [[Freudenstadt]] is built around the largest market place in Germany. [[Gersbach (Schopfheim)|Gersbach]]'s floral displays have won awards as the German Golden Village of 2004 and the [[Entente Florale|European Golden Village]] of 2007.

Noted for their fine interiors are the former monastery of [[St. Blaise Abbey, Black Forest|St. Blaise]] as well as the abbeys of [[Münstertal, Black Forest|Sankt Trudpert]], [[Sankt Peter, Baden-Württemberg|St. Peter]] and [[St. Märgen]].
[[Alpirsbach Abbey]] and the ruined [[Hirsau Abbey]] were built of red sandstone in the Hirsau style. Another idyllic rural edifice is [[Wittichen Abbey]] near [[Schenkenzell]].

The [[Murg (Northern Black Forest)|Murg valley]], the [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig valley]], the [[Triberg Waterfalls]] and the [[Black Forest Open Air Museum, Vogtsbauernhof|Open Air Museum at Vogtsbauernhof]] are also very popular.

Lookout mountains include the [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]], the [[Belchen (Black Forest)|Belchen]], the [[Kandel (mountain)|Kandel]] and the [[Schauinsland]] in the Southern Black Forest; and the [[Hornisgrinde]], the [[Schliffkopf]], the [[Hohloh]], the [[Merkur (Baden-Baden)|Merkur]] and the [[Teufelsmühle (Black Forest)|Teufelsmühle]] in the Northern Black Forest.

There are well known winter sports areas around the Feldberg, near [[Todtnau]] with its [[Fédération Internationale de Ski|FIS]] downhill ski run of ''Fahler Loch'' and in [[Hinterzarten]], a centre and talent forge for German ski jumpers. In the Northern Black Forest the winter sports areas are concentrated along the [[Black Forest High Road]] and on the ridge between the Murg and Enz rivers around [[Kaltenbronn (Gernsbach)|Kaltenbronn]].

The height differences in the mountains are used in many places for [[hang gliding]] and [[paragliding]].

=== Hiking trails ===
The Black Forest has a great number of very varied trails; some of pan-regional significance. The [[European long-distance path]] [[European walking route E1|E1]] crosses the Black Forest following the routes of some of the local long-distance paths.  Their framework is a network of long distance paths with main routes and side branches, many of which were laid out in the early 20th century by the [[Black Forest Club]] (''[[Schwarzwaldverein]]''). The best known of these is the challenging West Way (''Westweg'') with its many steep inclines. After 1950, circular walks were constructed to meet the changing demand, initially from the relatively dense railway network and, later, mainly from locally established hiking car parks. Currently, special, more experience-oriented themed paths are being laid out, such as the Dornstetten Barefoot Park (''Barfußpark Dornstetten''), the Park of All Senses (''Park mit allen Sinnen'') in Gutach (Black Forest Railway)), as well as those designed to bring the walker more directly in contact with nature (e.g. the ''Schluchtensteig''). Roads and wide forest tracks are thus less often used than hitherto.

There are numerous shorter paths suitable for day walks, as well as [[mountain biking]] and [[cross-country skiing]] trails. The total network of tracks amounts to around {{convert|23000|km}}, and is maintained and overseen by volunteers of the Black Forest Club, which has around 90,000 members (figures from Bremke, 1999, p.&nbsp;9).

* West Way (''[[Westweg]]'') Pforzheim–Basel
* Middle Way (''Mittelweg'') Pforzheim-Waldshut
* East Way (''Ostweg'') Pforzheim-Schaffhausen
* Querweg Rottweil-Lahr (4 days)
* Querweg Gengenbach-Alpirsbach (2–3 days)
* Hansjakob Way (''Hansjakobweg'') I (circular walk, 3 days)
* Hansjakob Way II (circular walk, 4 days)
* Murgleiter (5 days, premium trail)
* Gernsbach Circular Walk (''Gernsbacher Runde'', 2–3 days, premium trail)

=== Museums ===
[[File:Vogtsbauernhof 1999.jpg|thumb|The open-air museum of Vogtsbauernhof in the Gutach valley]]
The [[Black Forest Open Air Museum]] at ''Vogtsbauernhof'' farm in [[Gutach (Schwarzwaldbahn)|Gutach]] has original [[Black Forest house]]s that offer insights into farming life of the 16th and 17th centuries. The buildings were dismantled at their original sites, the individual pieces numbered and then re-erected to exactly the same plan in the museum. The [[German Clock Museum]] in [[Furtwangen im Schwarzwald|Furtwangen]] gives a comprehensive cross-section of the history of the [[watchmaking]] and [[clockmaking]] industries. From this early precision engineering a formerly important phonographic industry developed in the 20th century; the history of leisure electronics is presented in the [[German Phono Museum]] in [[St. Georgen im Schwarzwald|St. Georgen]]. The [[Schüttesäge Museum]] in [[Schiltach]] has information and living history demonstrations covering the themes of [[lumbering]] and [[timber rafting]] in the Kinzig valley as well as [[tanning]]. The [[Black Forest Costume Museum]] in [[Haslach im Kinzigtal]] offers an overview of the traditional costume of the whole of the Black Forest and its peripheral regions. Also in Haslach is the Hansjakob Museum and the Hansjakob Archive with numerous works of the writer, priest, politician, historian and chronicler, [[Heinrich Hansjakob]]. The [[MiMa Mineral and Mathematics Museum]] in [[Oberwolfach]] houses minerals and mining exhibits from the whole of the Black Forest and links them to mathematical explanations.

=== Road transport ===
Several tourist routes run through the Black Forest. Well known [[holiday route]]s are the [[Black Forest High Road]] ([[Bundesstraße 500|B 500]]) and the [[German Clock Road]].

Thanks to its winding country roads, the Black Forest is a popular destination for [[motorcyclist]]s. This arm of tourism 
is viewed as controversial due to the high number of accidents and the wide-ranging noise pollution<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/baden-wuerttemberg-startet-bundesratsinitiative-gegen-motorradlaerm-a-846166.html ''Baden-Württemberg: Landesregierung will Motorradlärm eindämmen.''] In: ''Spiegel Online'' date 24 July 2012</ref> and has been restricted through the introduction of speed limits and by placing certain roads out of bounds. For example, since 1984, motorcyclists have been banned from using the [[ADAC Schauinsland Races|mountain racing route]] on the [[Schauinsland]] during summer weekends.<ref>[http://www.badische-zeitung.de/freiburg/schauinsland-motorradfahrer-ignorieren-fahrverbot-radler-in-angst--32673594.html Schauinsland: Motorradfahrer ignorieren Fahrverbot – Radler in Angst.] In: ''Badische Zeitung'' dated 28 June 2010</ref>

=== Railway transport ===
[[File:Gutachbrücke mit VT 611.JPG|thumb|The Gutach bridge on the [[Höllentalbahn (Schwarzwald)|Höllental Railway]]]]
The whole of the Black Forest was once linked by the [[railway]]. In the eastern part of the Northern Black Forest by the [[Enz Valley Railway]] from [[Pforzheim]] to [[Bad Wildbad]], by the [[Nagold Valley Railway]] from Pforzheim via [[Calw]] and [[Nagold (town)|Nagold]] to [[Horb am Neckar]], by the [[Black Forest Railway (Württemberg)|Württemberg Black Forest Railway]] from [[Stuttgart]] to Calw and the Gäu Railway from Stuttgart to Freudenstadt or its present-day [[Gäu Railway (Eutingen–Freudenstadt)|section from Eutingen to Freudenstadt]].

Many railway lines run from the Rhine Plain up the valleys into the Black Forest: the [[Alb Valley Railway]] runs from [[Karlsruhe]] to [[Bad Herrenalb]], the [[Murg Valley Railway]] from [[Rastatt]] to [[Freudenstadt]], the [[Acher Valley Railway]] from [[Achern]] to [[Ottenhöfen im Schwarzwald]] and the [[Rench Valley Railway]] from [[Appenweier]] to [[Bad Griesbach im Schwarzwald|Bad Griesbach]]. The [[Black Forest Railway (Baden)|Baden Black Forest Railway]] has linked [[Offenburg]] with [[Konstanz]] on [[Lake Constance]] since 1873, running via [[Hausach]], [[Triberg]], [[St. Georgen im Schwarzwald|St. Georgen]], [[Villingen-Schwenningen|Villingen]] and [[Donaueschingen]]. In Hausach the [[Kinzig Valley Railway (Black Forest)|Kinzig Valley Railway]] branches off to Freudenstadt, in [[Denzlingen]] the [[Elz Valley Railway]] peels off towards [[Elzach]], the [[Höllental Railway (Black Forest)|Höllental Railway]] runs from [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] through the Höllental valley to Donaueschingen, the [[Münstertal Railway]] from [[Bad Krozingen]] to [[Münstertal/Schwarzwald|Münstertal]], the [[Kander Valley Railway]] from [[Haltingen]] near [[Basel]] through the Kander valley to [[Kandern]] and the [[Wiesen Valley Railway]] from [[Basel]] to [[Zell im Wiesental]].

The [[Three Lakes Railway]] branches off at the [[Titisee-Neustadt|Titisee]] from the Höllental Railway and runs to the [[Windgfällweiher]] and the [[Schluchsee]]. The [[Wutach Valley Railway]] runs along the border between Baden-Württemberg and Switzerland, linking [[Waldshut-Tiengen]] with [[Immendingen]] on the Black Forest Railway.

Most of these routes are still busy today, whilst some are extremely popular [[heritage line]]s.

=== Administration ===
Since January 2006 the Black Forest Tourist organisation, '' Schwarzwald Tourismus'', whose head office is in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], has been responsible for the administration of tourism in the 320 municipalities of the region. Hitherto there had been four separate tourist associations.

=== Points of interest ===
[[File:Windbuchencom.jpg|thumb|Winter on [[Schauinsland]]: famous "Windbuchen" [[Beech]]es bent by the wind]]
There are many historic towns in the Black Forest. Popular tourist destinations include [[Baden-Baden]], [[Freiburg]], [[Calw]] (the birth town of [[Hermann Hesse]]), [[Gengenbach]], [[Staufen, Germany|Staufen]], [[Schiltach]], [[Haslach im Kinzigtal|Haslach]] and [[Altensteig]]. Other popular destinations include such mountains as the Feldberg, the [[Belchen (Black Forest)|Belchen]], the [[Kandel (Black Forest)|Kandel]], and the Schauinsland; the [[Titisee]] and [[Schluchsee]] lakes; the [[All Saints Waterfalls]]; the [[Triberg Waterfalls]], not the highest, but the most famous waterfalls in Germany; and the [[canyon|gorge]] of the River [[Wutach (river)|Wutach]].

The [[Black Forest Open Air Museum]] shows the life of 16th or 17th century farmers in the region, featuring a number of reconstructed Black Forest farms. The [[German Clock Museum]] in [[Furtwangen im Schwarzwald|Furtwangen]] portrays the history of the [[clock]] industry and of [[watch]]makers.

For drivers, the main route through the region is the fast [[Bundesautobahn 5|A 5]] (E35) motorway, but a variety of signposted scenic routes such as the [[Schwarzwaldhochstraße]] ({{convert|60|km|abbr=on}}, [[Baden-Baden]] to [[Freudenstadt]]), Schwarzwald Tälerstraße ({{convert|100|km|abbr=on}}, the [[Murg (Northern Black Forest)|Murg]] and [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig]] valleys) or Badische Weinstraße (Baden Wine Street, {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}}, a wine route from [[Baden-Baden]] to [[Weil am Rhein]]) offers calmer driving along high roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/the-complete-guide-to-the-black-forest-587560.html |title=The complete guide to The Black Forest |publisher=The Independent |date=2014-03-19 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref> The last is a picturesque trip starting in the south of the Black Forest going north and includes numerous old wineries and tiny villages.

[[File:Photo01 1A.jpg|thumb|Black Forest track]]
Due to the rich mining history dating from medieval times (the Black Forest was one of the most important mining regions of Europe circa 1100) there are many mines re-opened to the public. Such mines may be visited in the Kinzig valley, the Suggental, the Muenster valley, and around Todtmoos.

The Black Forest was visited on several occasions by Count [[Otto von Bismarck]] during his years as Prussian and later German chancellor (1862–1890). Allegedly, he especially was interested in the [[Triberg Waterfalls]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GOwOyUl7-TMC&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=bismarck+triberg&source=bl&ots=o0tRfEUt2Z&sig=EddXNLXfR1TCIzsN2HxkV2MnM_4&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result |title=A Rough Passage, Volume II: Memories of Empire |author=Ken Barnes |publisher=The Radcliffe Press |date=2007 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref> There is now a monument in Triberg dedicated to Bismarck, who apparently enjoyed the tranquility of the region as an escape from his day-to-day political duties in Berlin.

The Black Forest featured in the philosophical development of [[Martin Heidegger]]. Heidegger wrote and edited some of his philosophical works in a small hut in the Black Forest,<ref>http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/heideggers-hut</ref> and would receive visitors there for walks, including his former pupil [[Hannah Arendt]]. This hut features explicitly in his essay ''Building, Dwelling, Thinking''.<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger-aesthetics/</ref> His walks in the Black Forest are supposed to have inspired the title of his collection of essays '' Holzewege '', translated as ''Off The Beaten Track ''.<ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QImd2ARqQPMC&q=path#v=snippet&q=path&f=false</ref>

== Conservation areas ==
The [[Black Forest National Park]], established in 2014, was the first [[national park]] in Baden-Württemberg. It covers an area of 10,062 [[hectare]]s and lies on the main crest of the Northern Black Forest between Baiersbronn and Baden-Baden.

There are two [[nature park]]s named after the Black Forest that cover the region: the [[Central/North Black Forest Nature Park]] (''Naturpark Schwarzwald Mitte/Nord'') and the [[Southern Black Forest Nature Park]] (''Naturpark Südschwarzwald''). Their aim is to preserve the countryside as a cultural landscape, to market local produce more effectively and to make the area more suitable for tourism. The 370,000&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]] Southern Black Forest Nature Park, which is the second largest in Germany, encloses the southern part of the Central Black Forest, the Southern Black Forest and adjacent areas. The Central/North Black Forest Nature Park covers 375,000&nbsp;ha and is thus the largest in Germany. It begins in the southern part of the Central Black Forest, bordering on the Southern Black Forest Nature Park and covers the rest of the Black Forest to the north.

In addition there are numerous [[Naturschutzgebiet|nature reserves]], [[protected areas]], [[forest reserve]]s and [[bird reserve]]s.

==Fauna==
In addition to the expected kinds of wildlife to be found in a European forest area, the following types of animals may be observed in the Black Forest.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070813055539/http://www.blackforest-tourism.com/index.php/layout/set/print/sprachversionen/natur/natur_mit_allen_sinnen_wahrnehmen__1 Enjoy nature with all the senses / Nature / Home / Inhalte – Schwarzwald Tourismus GmbH<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

*''[[Black Forest Horse]]s'' are a breed of [[horse]], previously indispensable for heavy field work.
*In some regions of the Black Forest, the [[Western Capercaillie]] can be found.

== Tourism and transport ==
Large parts of the Black Forest today depend mainly on tourism. The organisation, Black Forest Tourism (''Schwarzwald Tourismus''), assesses around 140,000 people work full-time in the tourism sector and that tourists spent around 34.8 million overnight stays in 2009.<ref>Including private accommodation and visitors by relatives and friends. [http://www.schwarzwald-tourismus.info/content/view/full/37287 Schwarzwald Tourismus GmbH: ''Tourismusentwicklung im Schwarzwald 2009''], retrieved 12 October 2011.</ref>

In spring, summer and autumn an extensive network of hiking trails and mountain bike routes enable different groups of people to use the natural region. In winter, of course, it is the various types of winter sport that come to the fore. There are facilities for both [[downhill skiing|downhill]] and [[Nordic skiing]] in many places.

=== Sights and attractions ===

The Black Forest is mainly rural and comprises many scattered villages and a few large towns. [[Tradition]] and custom are celebrated in many places.

The forest is best known for its [[Black Forest house|typical farmhouses]] with their sweeping [[hip roof|half-hipped roofs]], its [[Black Forest gâteau]]s, [[Black Forest ham]], [[Wight|Black Forest wight]], [[Kirschwasser]] and the [[cuckoo clock]].

=== Dialects ===
The main dialects spoken in the Black Forest area are [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] and [[Swabian German|Swabian]].

=== Traditional costume ===
[[File:Vogtsbauernhof-Costume de Forêt-Noire.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Traditional costume from Gutach with the unmarried woman's red ''Bollenhut'']]
Traditional costume or ''Trachten'' is still sometimes worn today, usually at festive occasions. The appearance of such costume varies from region to region, sometimes very markedly. One of the best known Black Forest costumes is that of the villages of [[Kirnbach (Wolfach)|Kirnbach]], [[Reichenbach (Hornberg)|Reichenbach]] and [[Gutach (Schwarzwaldbahn)|Gutach im Kinzigtal]] with the characteristic ''[[Bollenhut]]'' headdress. Unmarried women wear the hats with red bobbles or ''Bollen'', married women wear black. Engaged women sometimes wear a [[bridal crown]] before and on the day of their wedding, the so-called ''Schäppel'', whose largest examples from the town of [[St. Georgen im Schwarzwald|St. Georgen]] weigh up to 5 kilogrammes.

=== Art ===
Its rural beauty as well as the sense of tradition of its inhabitants had already attracted many artists in the 19th and early 20th centuries, whose works made the Black Forest famous the world over. Especially notable were [[Hans Thoma (artist)|Hans Thoma]] from [[Bernau im Schwarzwald|Bernau]] and his fellow student, Rudolf Epp, who was sponsored by the Grand Duke of Baden, [[Frederick I of Baden|Frederick I]]. Both artists painted motifs from the Black Forest throughout their lives. The artist, [[J. Metzler]], from Düsseldorf travelled through the Black Forest to paint his landscapes. The works of the Gutach artist colony around [[Wilhelm Hasemann]] were widely admire, their landscape and genre motifs capturing the character of the Black Forest. Like local author, Heinrich Hansjakob, they were part of a Baden folk costume movement.<ref>Brigitte Heck: ''Ein Hut macht Karriere.''.

=== Crafts ===
[[File:Du200613.png|thumb|upright|A cuckoo clock]]
In the field of handicrafts, [[wood carving]] plays an important role, than not only produces folk art like the [[Longinus cross]]es, but also famous sculptors like Matthias Faller.

[[Wood-carving]] is a traditional cottage industry in the region and carved ornaments now are produced in substantial numbers as souvenirs for tourists. [[Cuckoo clock]]s are a popular example; they have been made in the region since the mid-18th century and much of their development occurred there.

In the past [[singing bird box]]es were produced as well.  It is believed in the late Middle Ages, mechanical roosters were first created in some clocks to crow the hours.<ref>[[Cuckoo clock]]</ref>  These clocks may have preceded the Cuckoo Clock.  Interestingly, new scientific evidence suggests a mechanized planetarium, created by Archimedes in Syracuse before the birth of Christ, may have sparked production of mechanical clocks in Europe.  It is believed the ancient Greek knowledge of gearing came into Europe in the 13th century.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.siouxlandobserver.blogspot.com/2014/11/in-forest_46.html

=== Cuisine ===
[[Black Forest ham]] originated from this region, and so, by name and reputation at least, did the [[Black Forest gâteau]]. It is also known as "Black Forest Cherry Cake" or "Black Forest Cake" and is made with chocolate cake, cream, sour cherries and [[Kirsch]].<ref>http://www.europeancuisines.com/German-Schwarzwalder-Kirschtorte-Recipe-Black-Forest-Cake-Cherry-Kirsch</ref> The Black Forest variety of ''[[Tarte flambée|Flammkuchen]]'' is a Baden specialty made with ham, cheese and cream. ''[[Pancake|Pfannkuchen]]'', a [[crêpe]] or [[Drop-scone|crêpe-like]] (''[[:de:Eierkuchen|Eierkuchen]]'' or ''[[Palatschinken]]'') pastry, is also common. 
The Black Forest is also known for its long tradition in gourmet cuisine. No fewer than 17 [[Michelin star]]red restaurants are located in the region, among them two restaurants with 3 stars (Restaurants Bareiss and Schwarzwaldstube in [[Baiersbronn]])<ref>[http://www.viamichelin.de/web/Restaurants Michelin Restaurants]. Via Michelin. Retrieved 18 June 2011</ref> as well as the only restaurant in Germany that has been awarded a Michelin star every year since 1966. At Schwarzwald Hotel Adler in Häusern, three generations of chefs from the same family have defended the award from the first year the ''[[Michelin Guide]]'' selected restaurants in Germany until today.<ref>[http://www.adler-schwarzwald.de/en/adler-magazine/michelin-guide/ "The ''[[Michelin Guide]]'' and the Zumkeller Chefs"]. Schwarzwald Hotel Adler. Retrieved 18 June 2011</ref>

=== Fasnet ===
The German holiday of [[Fastnacht]], or Fasnet, as it is known in the Black Forest region, occurs in the time leading up to [[Lent]]. On [[Fasnetmendig]], or the Monday before [[Ash Wednesday]], crowds of people line the streets, wearing wooden, mostly hand-carved masks. One prominent style of mask is called the Black Forest Style, originating from the Black Forest Region.
