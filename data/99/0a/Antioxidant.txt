[[Image:Glutathione-3D-vdW.png|thumb|right|250px|Model of the antioxidant [[metabolomics|metabolite]] [[glutathione]]. The yellow sphere is the [[redox|redox-active]] sulfur atom that provides antioxidant activity, while the red, blue, white, and dark grey spheres represent oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon atoms, respectively.]]

An '''antioxidant''' is a [[molecule]] that inhibits the [[Redox|oxidation]] of other molecules. Oxidation is a [[chemical reaction]] involving the loss of electrons which can produce [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]].  In turn, these radicals can start [[chain reaction]]s.  When the chain reaction occurs in a [[cell (biology)|cell]], it can cause damage or death to the cell.  Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and inhibit other oxidation reactions. They do this by being oxidized themselves, so antioxidants are often [[reducing agent]]s such as [[thiol]]s, [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C), or [[polyphenol antioxidant|polyphenols]].<ref name="Sies" />

[[Image:Antioxidant.png|thumb|right|250px|Substituted [[phenols]] and derivatives of [[p-Phenylenediamine|phenylenediamine]] are common antioxidants used to inhibit gum formation in gasoline (petrol).]]

Although oxidation reactions are crucial for life, they can also be damaging; plants and animals maintain complex systems of multiple types of antioxidants, such as [[glutathione]], [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin A]], and [[vitamin E]] as well as [[enzyme]]s such as [[catalase]], [[superoxide dismutase]] and various [[peroxidase]]s. Insufficient levels of antioxidants, or [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of the antioxidant enzymes, cause [[oxidative stress]] and may damage or kill cells. Oxidative stress is damage to cell structure and cell function by overly reactive oxygen-containing molecules and chronic excessive inflammation. Oxidative stress seems to play a significant role in many human diseases, including cancers. The use of antioxidants in [[pharmacology]] is intensively studied, particularly as treatments for stroke and [[neurodegenerative disease]]s.  For these reasons, oxidative stress can be considered to be both the cause and the consequence of some diseases.

Antioxidants are widely used in [[dietary supplement]]s and have been investigated for the prevention of diseases such as cancer, [[coronary heart disease]] and [[altitude sickness]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Baillie JK, Thompson AA, Irving JB, Bates MG, Sutherland AI, Macnee W, Maxwell SR, Webb DJ | title = Oral antioxidant supplementation does not prevent acute mountain sickness: double blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial | journal = Qjm | volume = 102 | issue = 5 | pages = 341–8 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19273551 | doi = 10.1093/qjmed/hcp026 }}</ref> Although initial studies suggested that antioxidant supplements might promote health, later large [[clinical trial|trials]] including of beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E singly or in different combinations suggest that supplementation has no effect on mortality or possibly increases it.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Gluud C | title = Meta-regression analyses, meta-analyses, and trial sequential analyses of the effects of supplementation with beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E singly or in different combinations on all-cause mortality: do we have evidence for lack of harm? | journal = PloS One | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = e74558 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24040282 | pmc = 3765487 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0074558 |bibcode = 2013PLoSO...874558B }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Abner EL, Schmitt FA, Mendiondo MS, Marcum JL, Kryscio RJ | title = Vitamin E and all-cause mortality: a meta-analysis | journal = Current Aging Science | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 158–70 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21235492 | pmc = 4030744 | doi = 10.2174/1874609811104020158 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Gluud LL, Simonetti RG, Gluud C | title = Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 8 | pages = 842–57 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17327526 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.8.842 | first2 = D | first3 = LL }}</ref>  Randomized trials of taking antioxidants including beta carotene, vitamin E, vitamin C and selenium have shown no effect on cancer risk or have increased cancer risk.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vinceti M, Dennert G, Crespi CM, Zwahlen M, Brinkman M, Zeegers MP, Horneber M, D'Amico R, Del Giovane C | title = Selenium for preventing cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 3 | issue =  | pages = CD005195 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24683040 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005195.pub3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pais R, Dumitraşcu DL | title = Do antioxidants prevent colorectal cancer?

The immune system response to the damage done by exercise peaks 2 to 7 days after exercise, which is the period during which most of the adaptation that leads to greater fitness occurs. During this process, free radicals are produced by [[neutrophil]]s to remove damaged tissue. As a result, excessive antioxidant levels may inhibit recovery and adaptation mechanisms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tiidus PM | title = Radical species in inflammation and overtraining | journal = Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology | volume = 76 | issue = 5 | pages = 533–8 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9839079 | doi = 10.1139/cjpp-76-5-533 | url = http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?issn=0008-4212&volume=76&issue=5&startPage=533 }}</ref>

== Uses in technology ==

=== Food preservatives ===
Antioxidants are used as [[food additive]]s to help [[preservative|guard against food deterioration]]. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping in the dark and sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], storing plant materials in [[Anaerobic organism#Metabolism|anaerobic]] conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kader AA, Zagory D, Kerbel EL | title = Modified atmosphere packaging of fruits and vegetables | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–30 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2647417 | doi = 10.1080/10408398909527490 }}</ref> Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or [[fungus|fungal]] spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zallen EM, Hitchcock MJ, Goertz GE | title = Chilled food systems. Effects of chilled holding on quality of beef loaves | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 552–7 | date = Dec 1975 | pmid = 1184900 }}</ref> These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as [[propyl gallate]] (PG, E310), [[tert-Butylhydroquinone|tertiary butylhydroquinone]] (TBHQ), [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA, E320) and [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT, E321).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Iverson F | title = Phenolic antioxidants: Health Protection Branch studies on butylated hydroxyanisole | journal = Cancer Letters | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–54 | date = Jun 1995 | pmid = 7600543 | doi = 10.1016/0304-3835(95)03787-W }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=E number index |publisher=UK food guide|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm#antioxidants |accessdate=5 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070304151341/http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm| archivedate= 4 March 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

The most common molecules attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation causes them to turn [[rancidification|rancid]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robards K, Kerr AF, Patsalides E | title = Rancidity and its measurement in edible oils and snack foods. A review | journal = The Analyst | volume = 113 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–24 | date = Feb 1988 | pmid = 3288002 | doi = 10.1039/an9881300213 | bibcode = 1988Ana...113..213R }}</ref> Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or [[sulfur]]ous flavors, it is important to avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by [[Smoking (cooking technique)|smoking]], [[salting (food)|salting]] or [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]]. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in [[aluminium foil]] or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Carlo M, Sacchetti G, Di Mattia C, Compagnone D, Mastrocola D, Liberatore L, Cichelli A | title = Contribution of the phenolic fraction to the antioxidant activity and oxidative stability of olive oil | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 13 | pages = 4072–9 | date = Jun 2004 | pmid = 15212450 | doi = 10.1021/jf049806z }}</ref> Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and [[moisturizer]]s to prevent rancidity.

=== Industrial uses ===
Antioxidants are frequently added to industrial products. A common use is as [[Gasoline additive|stabilizers]] in [[fuel]]s and [[lubricant]]s to prevent oxidation, and in gasolines to prevent the polymerization that leads to the formation of engine-fouling residues.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=3233–7 |doi=10.1021/ja01617a026 |year=1955 |last1=Boozer |first1=Charles E. |last2=Hammond |first2=George S. |last3=Hamilton |first3=Chester E. |last4=Sen |first4=Jyotirindra N. |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=77 |issue=12 |title=Air Oxidation of Hydrocarbons.1II. The Stoichiometry and Fate of Inhibitors in Benzene and Chlorobenzene|bibcode=1955JAChS..77.1678G | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> In 2007, the worldwide market for industrial antioxidants had a total volume of around 0.88 million tons. This created a revenue of circa 3.7 billion US-dollars (2.4 billion Euros).<ref>{{cite web|title = Market Study: Antioxidants|publisher = Ceresana Research|url = http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/additives/antioxidants/ }}</ref>

They are widely used to prevent the oxidative degradation of [[polymer]]s such as rubbers, plastics and [[adhesive]]s that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why use Antioxidants? |publisher=SpecialChem Adhesives|url=http://www.specialchem4adhesives.com/tc/antioxidants/index.aspx?id= |accessdate=27 February 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070211063739/http://www.specialchem4adhesives.com/tc/antioxidants/index.aspx?id=| archivedate= 11 February 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Polymers containing [[double bond]]s in their main chains, such as [[natural rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]], are especially susceptible to [[oxidation]] and [[ozonolysis]]. They can be protected by [[antiozonant]]s. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and [[ozone]] attack, the former causing a "crazy paving" effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned at right angles to the tensile strain in the product.  Oxidation and [[UV degradation]] are also frequently linked, mainly because [[UV radiation]] creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce [[peroxy]] radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a [[chain reaction]]. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include [[polypropylene]] and [[polyethylene]]. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of [[secondary carbon atom]]s present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a [[primary carbon atom]]. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in [[low density polyethylene]].

== Metabolites ==
Antioxidants are classified into two broad divisions, depending on whether they are soluble in water ([[hydrophile|hydrophilic]]) or in lipids ([[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]]). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell [[cytosol]] and the [[blood plasma]], while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect [[cell membrane]]s from lipid peroxidation.<ref name="Sies" /> These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet.<ref name="Vertuani" /> The different antioxidants are present at a wide range of concentrations in [[Bodily fluid|body fluids]] and tissues, with some such as glutathione or [[ubiquinone]] mostly present within cells, while others such as [[uric acid]] are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in [[pathogen]]s and can be [[virulence factor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller RA, Britigan BE | title = Role of oxidants in microbial pathophysiology | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | date = Jan 1997 | pmid = 8993856 | pmc = 172912 }}</ref>

The relative importance and interactions between these different antioxidants is a very complex question, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having [[synergy|synergistic]] and interdependent effects on one another.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaudière J, Ferrari-Iliou R | title = Intracellular antioxidants: from chemical to biochemical mechanisms | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 37 | issue = 9-10 | pages = 949–62 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10541450 | doi = 10.1016/S0278-6915(99)00090-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sies H | title = Strategies of antioxidant defense | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry / FEBS | volume = 215 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–9 | date = Jul 1993 | pmid = 7688300 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18025.x }}</ref> The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system.<ref name="Vertuani" /> The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.<ref name="Vertuani" />

Some compounds contribute to antioxidant defense by [[chelation|chelating]] [[transition metal]]s and preventing them from catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important is the ability to sequester iron, which is the function of [[iron-binding proteins]] such as [[transferrin]] and [[ferritin]].<ref name="Pathways Ofoxidativedamage"/> [[Selenium]] and [[zinc]] are commonly referred to as ''antioxidant nutrients'', but these [[chemical element]]s have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.

Other antioxidants are not vitamins and are instead made in the body. For example, [[ubiquinol]] (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made in humans through the [[mevalonate pathway]].<ref name="Turunen" /> Another example is [[glutathione]], which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, [[glycine]] and [[glutamic acid]] before being absorbed, even large oral doses have little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Witschi A, Reddy S, Stofer B, Lauterburg BH | title = The systemic availability of oral glutathione | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 667–9 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1362956 | doi = 10.1007/BF02284971 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Flagg EW, Coates RJ, Eley JW, Jones DP, Gunter EW, Byers TE, Block GS, Greenberg RS | title = Dietary glutathione intake in humans and the relationship between intake and plasma total glutathione level | journal = Nutrition and Cancer | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–46 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8183721 | doi = 10.1080/01635589409514302 }}</ref> Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as [[acetylcysteine]] can increase glutathione,<ref name=Dodd>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dodd S, Dean O, Copolov DL, Malhi GS, Berk M | title = N-acetylcysteine for antioxidant therapy: pharmacology and clinical utility | journal = Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = 1955–62 | date = Dec 2008 | pmid = 18990082 | doi = 10.1517/14728220802517901 }}</ref> no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van de Poll MC, Dejong CH, Soeters PB | title = Adequate range for sulfur-containing amino acids and biomarkers for their excess: lessons from enteral and parenteral nutrition | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 136 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = 1694S–1700S | date = Jun 2006 | pmid = 16702341 }}</ref> Supplying more of these precursors may be useful as part of the treatment of some diseases, such as [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], [[protein-energy malnutrition]], or preventing the liver damage produced by [[paracetamol]] overdose.<ref name=Dodd/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu G, Fang YZ, Yang S, Lupton JR, Turner ND | title = Glutathione metabolism and its implications for health | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 3 | pages = 489–92 | date = Mar 2004 | pmid = 14988435 }}</ref>

Other compounds in the diet can alter the levels of antioxidants by acting as [[pro-oxidant]]s whereby consuming the compound may cause [[oxidative stress]], possibly resulting in higher levels of antioxidant enzymes.<ref name=Hail/>

===Invalidation of ORAC===
Measurement of antioxidant content in food is not a straightforward process, as this is a diverse group of compounds with different reactivities to various reactive oxygen species. In [[food science]], the [[oxygen radical absorbance capacity]] (ORAC) used to be the industry standard for antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao G, Alessio HM, Cutler RG | title = Oxygen-radical absorbance capacity assay for antioxidants | journal = Free Radical Biology & Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–11 | date = Mar 1993 | pmid = 8458588 | doi = 10.1016/0891-5849(93)90027-R }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ou B, Hampsch-Woodill M, Prior RL | title = Development and validation of an improved oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay using fluorescein as the fluorescent probe | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 49 | issue = 10 | pages = 4619–26 | date = Oct 2001 | pmid = 11599998 | doi = 10.1021/jf010586o }}</ref> However, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) withdrew these ratings in 2012 as biologically invalid, stating that no physiological proof ''[[in vivo]]'' existed to support the [[free-radical theory]], especially for [[polyphenols]].<ref name=USDAx>{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/services/docs.htm?docid=15866 |title=Withdrawn: Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) of Selected Foods, Release 2 (2010)  |date=16 May 2012 |work= |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service |accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref> Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from ''in vitro'' experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or [[biology]].

Alternative ''in vitro'' measurements include the [[Folin-Ciocalteu reagent]], and the [[Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity]] assay.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prior RL, Wu X, Schaich K | title = Standardized methods for the determination of antioxidant capacity and phenolics in foods and dietary supplements | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 53 | issue = 10 | pages = 4290–302 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15884874 | doi = 10.1021/jf0502698 }}</ref>

== History ==
As part of their adaptation from marine life, terrestrial plants began producing non-marine antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]] ([[vitamin C]]), [[polyphenols]] and [[tocopherol]]s.  The evolution of [[angiosperm]] plants between 50 and 200 million years ago resulted in the development of many antioxidant pigments&nbsp;– particularly during the [[Jurassic]] period&nbsp;– as chemical defences against [[reactive oxygen species]] that are byproducts of [[photosynthesis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benzie IF | title = Evolution of dietary antioxidants | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology. Part A, Molecular & Integrative Physiology | volume = 136 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–26 | date = Sep 2003 | pmid = 14527634 | doi = 10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00368-9 }}</ref> Originally, the term antioxidant specifically referred to a chemical that prevented the consumption of oxygen. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, extensive study concentrated on the use of antioxidants in important industrial processes, such as the prevention of metal [[corrosion]], the [[vulcanization]] of rubber, and the [[polymerization]] of fuels in the [[fouling]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mattill HA | title = Antioxidants | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 16 | pages = 177–92 | year = 1947 | pmid = 20259061 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.16.070147.001141 }}</ref>

Early research on the role of antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of [[unsaturated fat]]s, which is the cause of [[rancidity]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = German JB | title = Food processing and lipid oxidation | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 459 | pages = 23–50 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10335367 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4615-4853-9_3 | isbn = 978-0-306-46051-7 | series = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology }}</ref> Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of [[Vitamin A|vitamins A]], [[Vitamin C|C]], and [[Vitamin E|E]] as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of [[Organism|living organisms]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacob RA | title = Three eras of vitamin C discovery | journal = Sub-Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 25 | pages = 1–16 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8821966 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4613-0325-1_1 | isbn = 978-1-4613-7998-0 | series = Subcellular Biochemistry }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Knight JA | title = Free radicals: their history and current status in aging and disease | journal = Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 331–46 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9846200 }}</ref> The possible [[mechanisms of action]] of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moureu|first1=Charles |last2=Dufraisse|first2=Charles |year=1922 |title=Sur l'autoxydation: Les antioxygènes|journal=Comptes Rendus des Séances et Mémoires de la Société de Biologie |volume=86 |pages=321–322|language=French | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> Research into how [[vitamin E]] prevents the process of [[lipid peroxidation]] led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by [[scavenger (chemistry)|scavenging]] [[reactive oxygen species]] before they can damage cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf G | title = The discovery of the antioxidant function of vitamin E: the contribution of Henry A.
