These older systems are placing great demands on the logistics system for service, maintenance, replacement parts and necessary upgrades, costing the army both financially and in overall readiness. The ground force is engaged in an effort of reassessment, reorganisation and restructuring, as the future of Armenia's defence needs a revised force structure and unit mix. The army sees the need to maintain much of its traditional mechanised formations, but is looking to lighten and make more mobile and self-sustainable a small number of other formations. It must develop these newer formations to support its international requirements and effectively operate in mountainous and other rugged terrain, but it must do this without affecting the mechanised capability that is needed to confront Azerbaijan's conventional forces.<extension extension_name='ref' name="eskiyaordusu1"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-World-Armies/Armenia-Armenia.html</arg><arg name="title">Defense & Security Intelligence & Analysis: IHS Jane's - IHS</arg><arg name="publisher"></arg><arg name="accessdate">24 December 2014</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Since the fall of the<space/><link><target>Soviet Union</target></link>, Armenia has followed a policy of developing its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military.
