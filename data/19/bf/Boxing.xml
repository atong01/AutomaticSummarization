It should be noted, that this earliest form of modern boxing was very different. Contests in Mr. Figg's time, in addition to fist fighting, also contained fencing and cudgeling. On 6 January 1681, the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when<space/><link><target>Christopher Monck</target></link>, 2nd<space/><link><target>Duke of Albemarle</target></link><space/>(and later<space/><link><target>Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica</target></link>) engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize.</paragraph><paragraph>Early fighting had no written rules. There were no weight divisions or round limits, and no referee. In general, it was extremely chaotic. The first boxing rules, called the Broughton's rules, were introduced by champion<space/><link><target>Jack Broughton</target></link><space/>in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm'>John Rennie (2006) ''East London Prize Ring Rules 1743''</link><space/><template><target>wayback</target><arg name="url">http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm<space/></arg><arg name="date">20141111112325<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>Under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a form of padded bandage or mitten, to be used in 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.</paragraph><paragraph>An early article on boxing was published in Nottingham, 1713, by<space/><link><target>Parkyns baronets</target><part>Sir Thomas Parkyns</part></link>, a successful Wrestler from<space/><link><target>Bunny, Nottinghamshire</target></link>, who had practised the techniques he described.

As a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. Because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Modern</heading><paragraph>Through the late nineteenth century, the martial art of boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy.

A minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls.</paragraph><paragraph>Up to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches that connect, defense, knockdowns, and other, more subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one or both fighters believe they have been &quot;robbed&quot; or unfairly denied a victory. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where his or her coach, as well as one or more &quot;seconds&quot; may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signaled end of each round.</paragraph><paragraph>A bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges, and is said to &quot;go the distance&quot;. The fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. With three judges, unanimous and split decisions are possible, as are draws. A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knock-out ; such bouts are said to have ended &quot;inside the distance&quot;. If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent's punch and not a slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to his or her feet and can continue.</paragraph><paragraph>Should the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled &quot;knocked out&quot; (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by<space/><link><target>knockout</target></link><space/>(KO). A &quot;technical knock-out&quot; (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a &quot;three-knockdown rule&quot;, in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. A &quot;standing eight&quot; count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that he feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. After counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if he is fit to continue. For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Ingemar Johansson and Floyd Pattersson 1959.JPG</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Ingemar Johansson</target></link><space/>of Sweden KO's heavyweight champion<space/><link><target>Floyd Patterson</target></link>, 26 June 1959.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>In general, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting. The boxer's shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury. Failure to abide by the former may result in a foul. They also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from hitting the back, back of the neck or head (called a &quot;rabbit-punch&quot;) or the kidneys. They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between).</paragraph><paragraph>If a &quot;clinch&quot; a defensive move in which a boxer wraps his or her opponents arms and holds on to create a pause is broken by the referee, each fighter must take a full step back before punching again (alternatively, the referee may direct the fighters to &quot;punch out&quot; of the clinch). When a boxer is knocked down, the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue.</paragraph><paragraph>Violations of these rules may be ruled &quot;fouls&quot; by the referee, who may issue warnings, deduct points, or disqualify an offending boxer, causing an automatic loss, depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul. An intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified. A fighter who suffers an accidental low-blow may be given up to five minutes to recover, after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue. Accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a &quot;no contest&quot; result, or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds (typically four or more, or at least three in a four-round fight) have passed.</paragraph><paragraph>Unheard of these days, but common during the early 20th Century in North America, a &quot;newspaper decision (NWS)&quot; might be made after a no decision bout had ended. A &quot;no decision&quot; bout occurred when, by law or by pre-arrangement of the fighters, if both boxers were still standing at the fight's conclusion and there was no knockout, no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner. But this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications. Officially, however, a &quot;no decision&quot; bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing. Boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records for illustrative purposes only. Often, media outlets covering a match will personally score the match, and post their scores as an independent sentence in their report.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Professional vs. amateur boxing</heading><paragraph>Throughout the 17th through 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by money, as the fighters competed for<space/><link><target>prize money</target></link>, promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result. The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://news.discovery.com/tech/headgear-protects-boxers-brains-120208.htm</arg><arg name="title">Headgear Protects Boxers' Brains, Mostly</arg><arg name="work">DNews</arg><arg name="accessdate">22 September 2014</arg></template></extension><space/>Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an<space/><link><target>Automated Boxing Scoring System</target></link>, which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators.

Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA (Amateur Boxing Association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds.</paragraph><paragraph>Competitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. The white end just is a way to make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. Gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless, the fighters weigh under 165 pounds, thus allowing them to wear 10 ounce gloves. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches any boxer repeatedly landing low blows<space/><link><target>below the belt</target></link><space/>is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://boxing.about.com/od/amateurs/a/oly_rules.htm<space/></arg><arg name="title">Andrew Eisele (2005).

They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing ones attacks. To be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork.</paragraph><paragraph>Notable counter punchers include<space/><link><target>Muhammad Ali</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Vitali Klitschko</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Evander Holyfield</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Max Schmeling</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Chris Byrd</target></link>,<space/><link><target>James J Corbett</target><part>Jim Corbett</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Jack Johnson (boxer)</target><part>Jack Johnson</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Bernard Hopkins</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Laszlo Papp</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Jerry Quarry</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Anselmo Moreno</target></link>,<space/><link><target>James Toney</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Marvin Hagler</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Juan Manuel Mrquez</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Humberto Soto</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Floyd Mayweather, Jr.</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Roger Mayweather</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Pernell Whitaker</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Sergio Gabriel Martinez</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Guillermo Rigondeaux</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Counter punchers usually wear their opponents down by causing them to miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try to stay away from the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Brawler/slugger</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:George Foreman 2009.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Famous brawler<space/><link><target>George Foreman</target></link></part></link>A brawler is a fighter who generally lacks finesse and footwork in the ring, but makes up for it through sheer punching power.

Many brawlers tend to lack mobility, preferring a less mobile, more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. They may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favor of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches (such as hooks and uppercuts). Their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment. However, not all brawler/slugger fighters are not mobile; some can move around and switch styles if needed but still have the brawler/slugger style such as<space/><link><target>Wilfredo Gmez</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Prince Naseem Hamed</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Danny Garca</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>A brawler's most important assets are power and chin (the ability to absorb punishment while remaining able to continue boxing).

They often have a higher chance than other fighting styles to score a knockout against their opponents because they focus on landing big, powerful hits, instead of smaller, faster attacks. Oftentimes they place focus on training on their upper body instead of their entire body, to increase power and endurance. They also aim to intimidate their opponents because of their power, stature and ability to take a punch.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Swarmer/in-fighter</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Rocky Marciano.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Undefeated heavyweight champion<space/><link><target>Rocky Marciano</target></link><space/>was an excellent swarmer and in-fighter but also had the power of a brawler.</part></link>In-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called &quot;pressure fighters&quot;) attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of<space/><link><target>Hook (boxing)</target><part>hooks</part></link><space/>and uppercuts. A successful in-fighter often needs a good &quot;<link><target>chin (boxing)</target><part>chin</part></link>&quot; because swarming usually involves being hit with many<space/><link><target>jab</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. In-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward. However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting.</paragraph><paragraph>The essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression. Many short in-fighters utilize their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches. Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter. A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts where they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch;<space/><link><target>Mike Tyson</target></link><space/>was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts.<space/><link><target>Marvin Hagler</target></link><space/>was known for his hard &quot;<link><target>chin (boxing)</target><part>chin</part></link>&quot;, punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents.

In general, an in-fighter has an advantage over an out-fighter, an out-fighter has an advantage over a brawler, and a brawler has an advantage over an in-fighter; these form a cycle with each style being stronger relative to one, and weaker relative to another, with none dominating, as in<space/><link><target>rock-paper-scissors</target></link>. Naturally, many other factors, such as the skill level and training of the combatants, determine the outcome of a fight, but the widely held belief in this relationship among the styles is embodied in the clich amongst boxing fans and writers that &quot;styles make fights.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Brawlers tend to overcome swarmers or in-fighters because, in trying to get close to the slugger, the in-fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder-hitting brawler, so, unless the former has a very good chin and the latter's stamina is poor, the brawler's superior power will carry the day. A famous example of this type of match-up advantage would be<space/><link><target>George Foreman</target></link>'s knockout victory over<space/><link><target>Joe Frazier</target></link><space/>in their original bout &quot;The Sunshine Showdown&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Although in-fighters struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. Out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance between themselves and the opponent. The in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. On the inside, the out-fighter loses a lot of his combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. The in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. For example, the swarming Joe Frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer<space/><link><target>Muhammad Ali</target></link><space/>in their three fights.<space/><link><target>Joe Louis</target></link>, after retirement, admitted that he hated being crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ<space/><link><target>Rocky Marciano</target></link><space/>would have caused him style problems even in his prime.</paragraph><paragraph>The boxer or out-fighter tends to be most successful against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers.</paragraph><paragraph>An example of a style matchup was the historical fight of<space/><link><target>Julio Csar Chvez</target></link>, a swarmer or in-fighter, against<space/><link><target>Meldrick Taylor</target></link>, the boxer or out-fighter (see<space/><link><target>Julio Csar Chvez vs. Meldrick Taylor</target></link>). The match was nicknamed &quot;Thunder Meets Lightning&quot; as an allusion to punching power of Chvez and blinding speed of Taylor. Chvez was the epitome of the &quot;Mexican&quot; style of boxing. Taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. Chvez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Chvez slowly punished Taylor. Coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the bones around his eye socket had been broken, he had swallowed a considerable amount of his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Chvez, which only gave Chvez a greater chance to cause damage. While there was little doubt that Taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter. Going into the final round, Taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges. Chvez would have to knock Taylor out to claim a victory, whereas Taylor merely needed to stay away from the Mexican legend. However, Taylor did not stay away, but continued to trade blows with Chvez. As he did so, Taylor showed signs of extreme exhaustion, and every tick of the clock brought Taylor closer to victory unless Chvez could knock him out.With about a minute left in the round, Chvez hit Taylor squarely with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Chvez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Chvez back ahead of him. Suddenly Chvez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Chvez' desperate final flurry. Chvez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Chvez with only two seconds to go in the bout.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Equipment</heading><paragraph>Since boxing involves forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must be taken to prevent damage to bones in the hand. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without<space/><link><target>wrist wraps</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>boxing gloves</target></link>. Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not utilize them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves to be used in the bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. Both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and no tampering has taken place.</paragraph><paragraph>A mouth guard is important to protect the teeth and gums from injury, and to cushion the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout. Both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental (or intentional) stepping on feet. While older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler, modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts.</paragraph><paragraph>Boxers practice their skills on two basic types of punching bags. A small, tear-drop-shaped &quot;speed bag&quot; is used to hone reflexes and repetitive punching skills, while a large cylindrical &quot;heavy bag&quot; filled with sand, a synthetic substitute, or water is used to practice power punching and body blows. In addition to these distinctive pieces of equipment, boxers also utilize sport-nonspecific training equipment to build strength, speed, agility, and stamina. Common training equipment includes free weights, rowing machines,<space/><link><target>jump rope</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>medicine balls</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Boxing matches typically take place in a<space/><link><target>boxing ring</target></link>, a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner.

Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly offcenter. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the &quot;textbook&quot; stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents.</paragraph><paragraph>Left-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. The<space/><link><target>southpaw stance</target></link>, conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand.</paragraph><paragraph>North American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots.</paragraph><paragraph>Modern boxers can sometimes be seen tapping their cheeks or foreheads with their fists in order to remind themselves to keep their hands up (which becomes difficult during long bouts). Boxers are taught to push off with their feet in order to move effectively. Forward motion involves lifting the lead leg and pushing with the rear leg. Rearward motion involves lifting the rear leg and pushing with the lead leg. During lateral motion the leg in the direction of the movement moves first while the opposite leg provides the force needed to move the body.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Punches</heading><paragraph>There are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Any punch other than a jab is considered a power punch. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, the following discussion will assume a right-handed boxer.<table style='border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid grey;'><tablerow><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:jab7.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br><italics><link><target>Jab</target></link></italics></tablecell><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:Drop3.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br><italics><link><target>Cross (boxing)</target><part>Cross</part></link><space/></italics><space/>- in counter-punch with a looping</tablecell><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:crochet1.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br><italics><link><target>hook (boxing)</target><part>hook</part></link></italics></tablecell><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:uppercut2.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br><italics><link><target>Uppercut</target></link></italics></tablecell></tablerow></table></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><bold><link><target>Jab</target></link></bold><space/>A quick, straight punch thrown with the lead hand from the guard position. The jab is accompanied by a small, clockwise rotation of the torso and hips, while the fist rotates 90 degrees, becoming horizontal upon impact. As the punch reaches full extension, the lead shoulder can be brought up to guard the chin. The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw. After making contact with the target, the lead hand is retracted quickly to resume a guard position in front of the face.<list type='bullet'><listitem>The jab is recognized as the most important punch in a boxer's arsenal because it provides a fair amount of its own cover and it leaves the least amount of space for a counter punch from the opponent. It has the longest reach of any punch and does not require commitment or large weight transfers. Due to its relatively weak power, the jab is often used as a tool to gauge distances, probe an opponent's defenses, harass an opponent, and set up heavier, more powerful punches. A half-step may be added, moving the entire body into the punch, for additional power. Some notable boxers who have been able to develop relative power in their jabs and use it to punish or 'wear down' their opponents to some effect include<space/><link><target>Larry Holmes</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Wladimir Klitschko</target></link>.</listitem></list></listitem><listitem><bold><link><target>Cross (boxing)</target><part>Cross</part></link></bold><space/>A powerful, straight punch thrown with the rear hand.

The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching the outside of the chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is thrown. A measure of an ideally extended cross is that the shoulder of the striking arm, the knee of the front leg and the ball of the front foot are on the same vertical plane.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Patterson</arg><arg name="first">Jeff</arg><arg name="title">Boxing for Fitness: Straight Right</arg><arg name="url">http://nwfighting.com/fitnessboxing.html</arg><arg name="work">nwfighting.com</arg><arg name="publisher">Northwest Fighting Arts</arg><arg name="accessdate">12 March 2014</arg></template></extension><list type='bullet'><listitem>Weight is also transferred from the rear foot to the lead foot, resulting in the rear heel turning outwards as it acts as a fulcrum for the transfer of weight. Body rotation and the sudden weight transfer is what gives the cross its power. Like the jab, a half-step forward may be added. After the cross is thrown, the hand is retracted quickly and the guard position resumed. It can be used to counter punch a jab, aiming for the opponent's head (or a counter to a cross aimed at the body) or to set up a hook.

From this position, the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent's chin or torso.<list type='bullet'><listitem>At the same time, the knees push upwards quickly and the torso and hips rotate anti-clockwise and the rear heel turns outward, mimicking the body movement of the cross. The strategic utility of the uppercut depends on its ability to &quot;lift&quot; the opponent's body, setting it off-balance for successive attacks. The right uppercut followed by a left hook is a deadly combination employing the uppercut to lift the opponent's chin into a vulnerable position, then the hook to knock the opponent out.</listitem></list></listitem></list><paragraph>These different punch types can be thrown in rapid succession to form combinations or &quot;combos.&quot; The most common is the jab and cross combination, nicknamed the &quot;one-two combo.&quot; This is usually an effective combination, because the jab blocks the opponent's view of the cross, making it easier to land cleanly and forcefully.</paragraph><paragraph>A large, swinging circular punch starting from a cocked-back position with the arm at a longer extension than the hook and all of the fighter's weight behind it is sometimes referred to as a &quot;roundhouse,&quot; &quot;haymaker,&quot; or sucker-punch. Relying on body weight and centripetal force within a wide arc, the roundhouse can be a powerful blow, but it is often a wild and uncontrolled punch that leaves the fighter delivering it off balance and with an open guard.</paragraph><paragraph>Wide, looping punches have the further disadvantage of taking more time to deliver, giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter. For this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation.

This style is so effective for counterpunching because it allows fighters to slip punches by rotating and dipping their upper body and causing blows to glance off the fighter. After the punch glances off, the fighter's back hand is in perfect position to hit their out-of-position opponent. The shoulder lean is used in this stance. To execute the shoulder lean a fighter rotates and ducks (to the right for orthodox fighters and to the left for southpaws) when their opponents punch is coming towards them and then rotates back towards their opponent while their opponent is bringing their hand back.</paragraph><paragraph>The fighter will throw a punch with their back hand as they are rotating towards their undefended opponent. The weakness to this style is that when a fighter is stationary and not rotating they are open to be hit so a fighter must be athletic and well conditioned to effectively execute this style.

The back-leaning posture, which does not cause the defending boxer to become as unbalanced as they would during normal backward movement, also maximizes the distance of the defender's head from his opponent, increasing the probability that punches will miss their intended target. Weathering the blows that do land, the defender lures the opponent into expending energy while conserving his/her own. If successful, the attacking opponent will eventually tire, creating defensive flaws which the boxer can exploit. In modern boxing, the rope-a-dope is generally discouraged since most opponents are not fooled by it and few boxers possess the physical toughness to withstand a prolonged, unanswered assault.

As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking it has been said that there is no such thing as a check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past.
