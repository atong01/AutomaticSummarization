'''Ansbach''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|z|b|æ|k}}; {{IPA-de|ˈansbax|3=Ansbach.ogg}}) is a city in the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Bavaria]]. It is the capital of the [[Regierungsbezirk|administrative region]] of [[Mittelfranken|Middle Franconia]]. Ansbach is situated {{convert|25|mi|sp=us}} southwest of [[Nuremberg]] and {{convert|90|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Munich]], on the [[Fränkische Rezat]] (Rezat River), a tributary of the [[Main (river)|Main]] river. As of 2004, its population was 40,723.

Developed in the 8th century as a [[Benedictine monastery]], it became the seat of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] family in 1331. In 1460, the Margraves of Branderberg–Anspach lived here. The city has a castle known as [[Markgrafenschloß|Margrafen–Schloss]], built between 1704-1738. It was not badly damaged during the [[World Wars]] and hence retains its original historical baroque sheen.  Ansbach is now home to a US military base and to the [[Ansbach University of Applied Sciences]].

The city has connections via autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 6|A6]] and highways [[Bundesstraße 13|B13]] and [[Bundesstraße 14|B14]]. [[Ansbach station]] is on the [[Nuremberg–Crailsheim railway|Nürnberg–Crailsheim]] and [[Treuchtlingen–Würzburg railway|Treuchtlingen–Würzburg]] railways and is the terminus of line S4 of the [[Nuremberg S-Bahn]].

==Name==
The name of the town was originally '''Onolzbach''',{{sfnp|EB|1878}} meaning "On'z [[Stream|Brook]]".<ref name=" Carlyle 2010">{{cite book|last= Carlyle |first= Thomas |title= The Works of Thomas Carlyle |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CourdfDUcOAC&pg=PA103 |accessdate=16 September 2012 |year=2010 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781108022354 |page=104}}</ref> It was also formerly known as '''Anspach'''.{{sfnp|EB|1878}}

==History==
Ansbach lies on the [[Rezat River|Rezat]] around {{convert|25|mi|sp=us}} SW of [[Nuremberg]] and {{convert|90|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Munich]]. A [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine monastery]] was established there around 748 by the [[Franks|Frankish]] noble [[Gumbertus|St&nbsp;Gumbertus]]. The adjoining village of Onolzbach is first noticed as a proper town in 1221.{{fact|date=June 2015}}

The counts of [[Oettingen]] ruled over Ansbach until the [[Hohenzollern]] burgraves of Nuremberg took over in 1331. The Hohenzollerns made Ansbach the seat of their dynasty until their acquisition of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1415. After the 1440 death of [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick&nbsp;I]], a cadet branch of the family established itself as the [[Brandenburg-Ansbach|margraves of Ansbach]]. [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George the Pious]] introduced the [[Protestant Reformation]] to Ansbach in 1528, leading to the secularization of [[St. Gumbertus, Ansbach|Gumbertus Abbey]] in 1563. 

The [[Markgrafenschloß|Margrafen–Schloss]] was built between 1704-1738;<ref name="Spaltro2005">{{cite book|last1= Spaltro |first1= Kathleen |last2= Bridge |first2= Noeline |display-authors=1 |title= Royals of England: A Guide for Readers, Travelers, and Genealogists |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UUOzgLiyd54C&pg=PA262 |accessdate=16 September 2012 |year=2005 |publisher= iUniverse |isbn=9780595373123 |page=262}}</ref> its gardens continued to be a notable attraction into the 19th century.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} In 1791, the last margrave sold his realm to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}} In 1796, the Duke of Zweibrücken, [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian Joseph]]—the future Bavarian king Max I Joseph—was exiled to Ansbach after Zweibrücken had been taken by the French. In Ansbach, [[Maximilian von Montgelas]] wrote an elaborate concept for the future political organization of Bavaria, which is known as the Ansbacher Mémoire.<ref>[http://www.hdbg.de/montgelas/pages/hmv33.htm ?]</ref> In 1806, Napoleon forced Prussia to cede Ansbach and its principality to [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}} The act was confirmed by the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]];{{sfnp|EB|1878}} Prussia was compensated with the Bavarian [[Berg (German region)|duchy of Berg]].{{fact|date=June 2015}} Ansbach became the capital of the circle of Middle Franconia following the [[unification of Germany]]; at the time, it had a population of 12,635.{{Sfnp|EB|1878}}

Jewish families were resident in Ansbach from at least the end of the 18th century. They set up a Jewish Cemetery in the Ruglaender Strasse, which was vandalised and razed under the Nazi tyranny. It was repaired in 1946, but it was damaged several times more. A plaque on the wall of the cemetery commemorates these events. The Jewish Congregation built its synagogue at No 3 Rosenbadstrasse, but it too was damaged by the SA, though it was not burnt down for fear of damaging the neighbouring buildings. It serves today as a "Symbolic House of God". A plaque in the entrance serves as a memorial to the synagogue and to Jewish residents who were murdered during the Holocaust.<ref name="de.wikipedia.org">[[:de:Ansbach]]</ref> In 1940, at least 500 patients were deported from the Heil- und Pflegeanstalt Ansbach [''Ansbach Medical and Nursing Clinic''] to the extermination facilities Sonnenstein and Hartheim which were disguised as psychiatric institutions, as part of the [[Action T4]] euthanasia action. They were gassed there. At the clinic in Ansbach itself, around 50 intellectually disabled children were injected with the drug Luminal and killed that way. A plaque was erected in their memory in 1988 in the local hospital at No. 38 Feuchtwangerstrasse.<ref name="de.wikipedia.org"/>

During [[World War II]], a subcamp of [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]] was located here.<ref>[http://www.tartanplace.com/tartanhistory/concentrationcamps.html Christine O'Keefe. ''Concentration Camps.'']</ref> Also during the Second World War the Luftwaffe and Wehrmacht had bases here. The nearby airbase was the home station for the Stab & I/KG53 (Staff & 1st Group of Kampfgeschwader 53) operating 38 [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers. On 1 September 1939 this unit was one of the many that participated in the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|attack on Poland]] that started the war. All of its bridges were destroyed during the course of the war. During the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]] in April 1945, the airfield was seized by the [[United States Third Army]], and used by the [[USAAF]] [[354th Fighter Wing|354th Fighter Group]] which flew [[P-47 Thunderbolts]] from the aerodrome (designated [[Advanced Landing Ground|ALG R-82]]) from late April until the German capitulation on 7 May 1945.<ref>[http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9966 354 Operations Group Fact Sheet, USAFHRA]</ref><ref>[http://www.skylighters.org/history/airfields USAAF Airfields in the ETO]</ref><ref>[http://www.eucmh.com/2008/08/10/aaf-airfields-fr-be-nl-lu-deprocessing AAF Airfields in France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg]</ref> At the end of the war, 19-year-old student Robert Limpert tried to get the town to surrender to the US Forces without a fight. He was betrayed by [[Hitler Youth]] and was hung from the portal of the City Hall by the city's military commander, Col. (''Oberst'') Ernst Meyer. Several memorials to his heroic deed have been erected over the years, despite opposition from some residents — in the Ludwigskirche, in the Gymnasium Carolinum and at No 6 Kronenstrasse.<ref name="de.wikipedia.org"/> After the Second World War, Ansbach belonged to the American Zone. The American Military authorities established a displaced persons (DP) camp in what used to be a sanatorium in what is today the Strüth quarter.<ref name="de.wikipedia.org"/> 

[[Bachwoche Ansbach]] has been held in Ansbach since 1947. Since 1970, Ansbach has enlarged its municipal area by incorporating adjacent communities. Ansbach hosts several units of the U.S. armed forces, associated with German units under [[NATO]]. There are five separate U.S. installations: Shipton Kaserne, home to 412th Aviation Support Battalion, Katterbach Kaserne, formally the home of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division's]] [[4th Combat Aviation Brigade]], which has been replaced by the [[12th Combat Aviation Brigade (United States)|12th Combat Aviation Brigade]] as of 2006, as part of the 1st Infantry Division's return to [[Fort Riley]], Kansas; Bismarck Kaserne, which functions as a satellite post to Katterbach, hosting their Post Theater, barracks, Von Steuben Community Center, Military Police, and other support agencies, Barton Barracks, home to the USAG Ansbach and Bleidorn Barracks, which has a library and housing, and Urlas, which hosts the [[Post Exchange]] as well as a housing area opened in 2010. Ansbach was also home to the headquarters of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)]] from 1972 to the early 1990s.<ref>[http://www.ridinthewave.com/thinkytees/1stArmorDivision.html ?]</ref>
