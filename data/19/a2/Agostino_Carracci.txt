{{commons category|Agostino Carracci}}
'''Agostino Carracci''' (or '''Caracci''') (16 August 1557 – 22 March 1602) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[printmaker]]. He was the brother of the more famous [[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]] and cousin of [[Lodovico Carracci]].

He posited the ideal in nature, and was the founder of the competing school to the more gritty view of nature as expressed by [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]]. He was one of the founders of the [[Accademia degli Incamminati]] along with his brother, Annibale Carracci, and cousin, Ludovico Carracci. The academy helped propel painters of the [[Bolognese School (painting)|School of Bologna]] to prominence.

==Life==
Agostino Carracci was born in [[Bologna]], and trained at the workshop of the architect Domenico Tibaldi. Starting from 1574 he worked as a reproductive [[engraver]], copying works of 16th century masters such as [[Federico Barocci]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Antonio Campi]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Correggio]]. He also produced some original prints, including two [[etching]]s.

He travelled to [[Venice]] (1582, 1587–1589) and [[Parma]] (1586–1587). Together with Annibale and Ludovico he worked in Bologna on the fresco cycles in [[Palazzo Fava]] (''Histories of Jason and Medea'', 1584) and [[Palazzo Magnani, Bologna|Palazzo Magnani]] (''Histories of [[Romulus]]'', 1590–1592). In 1592 he also painted the ''Communion of St. Jerome'', now in the [[Pinacoteca di Bologna]] and considered his masterwork. From 1586 is his altarpiece of the ''Madonna with Child and Saints'', in the National Gallery of [[Parma]].  In 1598 Carracci joined his brother Annibale in Rome, to collaborate on the decoration of the Gallery in [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Palazzo Farnese]]. From 1598–1600 is a ''triple Portrait'', now in [[Naples]], an example of genre painting.  In 1600 he was called to Parma by Duke [[Ranuccio I Farnese]] to began the decoration of the Palazzo del Giardino, but he died before it was finished.

Agostino's son [[Antonio Marziale Carracci|Antonio Carracci]] was also a painter, and attempted to compete with his father's Academy.

An engraving by Agostino Carraci after the painting ''Love in the Golden Age'' by the 16th-century Flemish painter [[Paolo Fiammingo]] was the inspiration for [[Matisse]]'s ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'' (Joy of Life).<ref>Thomas Puttfarken, “Mutual Love and Golden Age: Matisse and ‘gli Amori de’ Carracci,’” Burlington Magazine 124 (Apr. 1982): 203-208.</ref>
