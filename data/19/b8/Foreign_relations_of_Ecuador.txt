{{Politics of Ecuador}}
This article deals with the '''[[diplomacy|diplomatic affairs]], [[foreign policy]] and [[international relations]] of [[Ecuador]]'''.

Ecuador is a founding member of the [[United Nations|UN]] and a member of many of its specialized agencies; it is also a member of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]]. Is also a member of many regional groups, including the [[Rio Group]], the [[Latin American Economic System]], the Latin American Energy Organization, the [[Latin American Integration Association]], and the [[Andean Pact]].<ref>http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35761.htm</ref>

Ecuador's principal foreign-policy objectives have traditionally included defense of its territory from both external aggression and internal subversion as well as support for the objectives of the UN and the OAS. Although Ecuador's foreign relations were traditionally centered on the [[United States|USA]], Ecuador's membership in the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries|OPEC]] in the 1970s and 1980s allowed Ecuadorian leaders to exercise somewhat greater foreign policy autonomy. Ecuador's foreign policy goals under the [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos|Borja]] government in the late 1980s were more diversified than those of the [[León Febres Cordero|Febres Cordero]] administration, which closely identified with the United States. For example, Ecuador was more active in its relations with the [[Third World]], multilateral organizations, [[Western Europe]], and [[socialist]] countries.<ref>http://countrystudies.us/ecuador/76.htm</ref>

Ecuador has offered humanitarianian aid to many countries and a supporter of the United Nations and is now contributing troops in the [[MINUSTAH|UN mission in Haiti]]. Ecuador has also been an elective member of the [[UN Security Council]].

In Antarctica, Ecuador has maintained a peaceful research station for scientific study in the British-claimed territory and is a member nation of the [[Antarctica Treaty]].

{{further|Foreign policy of Rafael Correa}}
The Presidency of Rafael Correa in the early 21st century saw a radical change in the country's foreign policy. Traditional ties with the United States grew more acrimonious and there were increased ties with the governments of Russia and Iran.<ref>[http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/wcm/connect/cbdc99804f018bacbc18fc3170baead1/ARI61-2009_Malamud_Garcia-Calvo_Ecuador_Foreign_Policy.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=cbdc99804f018bacbc18fc3170baead1]</ref>

In September 2012, the two nations signed a Commercial and Security Agreement to allow Ecuador to sell easily seafood, cocoa and bananas in China, with the Chinese agreeing to ease tariffs on further food items.  In the same period China established an $80 million line of credit for Ecuador with the EximBank to help Ecuador build a road to the re-sited Quito airport.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://cuencanewsdigest.com/ecuador-and-china-sign-a-commercial-and-security-agreement-p384-90.htm | location=Cuenca, Ecuador | work=Cuenca News Digest | title=Ecuador and China Sign a Commercial and Security Agreement | date=September 30, 2012}}</ref>

===India===
On November 16, 2008, the Foreign Minister of Ecuador [[Maria Isabel Salvador]] met her counterpart, [[Pranab Mukherjee]], with a close relationship in oil and defence between these geographically distant countries high on the agenda.

In the defence sector, Ecuador became the first country to sign a contract for purchasing the Indian made [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters of which one will be for use by its President. The Embassy here{{Where|date=July 2011}} has expanded its setup with the appointment of a Military Attache and prospects appear bright for more defence exports as Ecuador has agreed to be the servicing hub in [[South America]] for Indian defence equipment.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/18/stories/2008111860331100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=India to boost oil, defence ties with Ecuador | date=November 18, 2008}}</ref>

===Peru===
The [[Paquisha War]] was a brief military clash that took place between January and February 1981 between Ecuador and Peru over the control of three watchposts. Since the 1990s, Ecuadoran foreign policy has been focused on the country's [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute|border dispute]] with [[Peru]], an issue that has festered since independence.  The boundary dispute led to the [[Cenepa War]] between Ecuador and Peru in early 1995; after a peace agreement brokered by the four Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ([[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], and the [[United States]]), the  Military Observers Mission to Ecuador-Peru (MOMEP) was set up to monitor the zone.
In 1998, Presidents [[Jamil Mahuad]] of Ecuador and [[Alberto Fujimori]] of Peru signed a comprehensive settlement over control of the disputed zone.

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|Foreign relations of the United Kingdom}}
Relations between the United Kingdom and Ecuador were traditionally regarded as "low-key but cordial", especially before the election of Rafael Correa; the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] and [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]] visited the country in 2009, as part of a tour celebrating the bicentenary of [[Charles Darwin]]. President Correa visited London in the same year, speaking mostly in English at the [[London School of Economics]] about the changes his government was making.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ecuador: Latin American country no friend of the US |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/19/julian-assange-haven-choice-ecuador |work=The Guardian |date=20 June 2012 |last=Borger |first=Julian |location=London}}</ref>
In 2012, relations came under strain when [[Julian Assange]], founder of the [[Wikileaks]] website, entered the [[Embassy of Ecuador, London|Ecuadorian embassy]] in [[London]] and sought asylum; Assange had recently lost a legal case against his extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual assault and rape, but when within the embassy he was on diplomatic territory and beyond the reach of the British police.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jun/19/julian-assange-wikileaks-asylum-ecuador |title=Assange seeks refuge at Ecuador 's embassy |work=The Guardian |date=19 June 2012 |page=1 |last=Addley |first=Esther |last2=Woolf |first2=Beatrice |location=London}}</ref> The United Kingdom [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] delivered a note to the Ecuadorian government in Quito reminding them of the provisions of the [[Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987]] which allow the British government to withdraw recognition of diplomatic protection from embassies; the move was interpreted as a hostile act by Ecuador, with Foreign Minister [[Ricardo Patiño]] stating that this "explicit threat" would be met with "appropriate responses in accordance with international law".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum |title=Julian Assange can be arrested in Ecuador embassy, UK warns |last=Pearse |first=Damien |work=The Guardian |date=16 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref> Assange was granted diplomatic asylum on 16 August 2012, with Foreign Minister Patiño stating that Assange's fears of political persecution were "legitimate".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19281492 | work=BBC News | title=Julian Assange: Ecuador grants Wikileaks founder asylum | date=August 16, 2012}}</ref>

===United States===
{{main|Ecuador–United States relations}}
The [[United States]] and [[Ecuador]] used to maintain close ties based on mutual interests in maintaining democratic institutions; combating [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[cocaine]]; building trade, investment, and financial ties; cooperating in fostering Ecuador's economic development; and participating in inter-American organizations. Ties were further strengthened by the presence of an estimated 150,000-200,000 Ecuadorians living in the United States and by 24,000 U.S. citizens visiting Ecuador annually, and by approximately 15,000 U.S. citizens residing in Ecuador.  The United States assisted Ecuador's economic development directly through the [[Agency for International Development]] (USAID) program in Ecuador and through multilateral organizations such as the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] and the [[World Bank]]. In addition, the U.S. [[Peace Corps]] operates a sizable program in Ecuador. More than 100 U.S. companies are doing business in Ecuador. The relations have deteriorated greatly in recent years, since [[Rafael Correa]] came to power in Ecuador. Correa has blamed the U.S. for intervening in its internal affairs.

===Venezuela===
{{main|Ecuador–Venezuela relations}}
Diplomatic ties trace back to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].  With the independence both countries united under the [[Gran Colombia]] along with [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] (then [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]]).
After the dissolution of the Gran Colombia, Ecuador named Don Pedro Gual as plenipotentiary minister with the main task of resolving the debt acquired while part of the Gran Colombia union as well as to establish diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]] and Venezuela.  On August 4, 1852 Venezuela sent a diplomatic delegation in [[Quito]] and named José Julián Ponce as finance administrator.
The relations remained cordial and entered into a second period between 1910 and 1963 with two diplomatic incidents occurring in 1928 and 1955. Ecuador and Venezuela strengthened ties in politics, diplomacy and military.
