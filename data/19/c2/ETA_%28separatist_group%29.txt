==Structure==
[[File:ArmaTiroPumEtaMilikiliklik26 8.jpg|thumb|ETA members fire blanks during the [[Euzko Gudarostea|Day of the Basque Soldier]] of 2006]]

ETA has changed its internal structure on several occasions, commonly for security reasons. The group used to have a very hierarchical organization with a leading figure at the top, delegating into three substructures: the logistical, military and political sections. Reports from Spanish and French police point towards significant changes in ETA's structures in recent years. ETA has divided the three substructures into a total of eleven. The change was a response to recent captures, and possible infiltration, by the different law enforcement agencies. ETA's intention is to disperse its members and reduce the impact of detentions.

The leading committee is formed by 7 to 11 individuals, and ETA's internal documentation refers to it as Zuba, an abbreviation of ''Zuzendaritza Batzordea'' (directorial committee). There is another committee named ''Zuba-hitu'' that functions as an advisory committee. The eleven different substructures are: logistics, politics, international relations with fraternal organisations, military operations, reserves, prisoner support, expropriation, information, recruitment, negotiation, and treasury.<ref>[http://www.elcorreodigital.com/vizcaya/pg060323/actualidad/politica/200603/23/ECD_eta_funcionamiento.html POLÍTICA – ETA ha modificado su estructura interna por motivos de seguridad]. El Correo Digital (1 December 1997). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref>

ETA's armed operations are organized in different ''taldes'' ("groups") or ''commandos'', generally composed of three to five members, whose objective is to conduct attacks in a specific geographic zone.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The ''taldes'' are coordinated by the ''cúpula militar'' ("military [[cupola]]"). To supply the ''taldes'', support groups maintain [[safe house]]s and ''zulos'' (small rooms concealed in forests, [[garret]]s or underground, used to store arms, explosives or, sometimes, kidnapped people; the Basque word ''zulo'' literally means "hole"). The small cellars used to hide the people kidnapped are named by ETA and ETA's supporters "people's jails".<ref name="La Razón Técnico">''[http://www.belt.es/noticias/2004/octubre/21/eta_zulo.htm «El técnico» construyó los zulos de ETA]'', [[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]], 18 October 2004.</ref> Currently the most common ''commandos'' are itinerant, not linked to any specific area, and thus are more difficult to capture.<ref>Riding, Alan.

Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref>

Among its members, ETA distinguishes between ''legales/legalak'' ("legal ones"), those members who do not have police records and live apparently normal lives; ''liberados'' ("liberated") members known to the police that are on ETA's payroll and working full-time for ETA; and ''apoyos'' ("support") who just give occasional help and logistics support to the group when required.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wayne Anderson|title=The ETA: Spain's Basque terrorists|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TZ5TNlhO5V8C&pg=PA42|accessdate=30 January 2011|date=January 2003|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3818-6|pages=42–}}</ref>

There are also the imprisoned members of the group, serving time scattered across Spain and France, that sometimes still have significant influence inside the organisation; and finally the ''quemados'' ("burnt out"), members freed after having been imprisoned or those that are suspected by the group of being under police vigilance. In the past there was also the figure of the deportees, expelled by the French government to remote countries where they live freely. France has since stopped the practice of deporting ETA members to other places than to Spain to be judged.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} ETA's internal bulletin is named ''[[Zutabe]]'' ("Column"), replacing the earlier one (1962) ''[[Zutik (publication)|Zutik]]'' ("Standing").

ETA also promotes the ''[[kale borroka]]'' ("street fight"), that is, violent acts against public transportation, political parties offices or cultural buildings, destruction of private property of politicians, police, military, journalist, council members, and anyone voicing criticism against ETA, bank offices, menaces, graffiti of political mottoes, and general rioting, usually using [[Molotov cocktails]]. These groups are made up mostly of young people, who are directed through youth organisations (such as [[Jarrai]], [[Haika]] and [[Segi (organization)|Segi]]). Many of the present-day members of ETA started their collaboration with the group as participants in the ''kale borroka''.

The political party [[Batasuna]] pursues the same political goals as ETA and does not condemn ETA's use of violence. Formerly known as [[Euskal Herritarrok]] and "[[Herri Batasuna]]", it is presently banned by the Spanish Supreme Court as an anti-democratic organisation following the Political Parties Law (''Ley de Partidos Políticos''<ref>[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo6-2002.html Party Law] in Spanish</ref>), It generally received 8% to 15% of the vote in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]].<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/especiales/2005/03/espana/elecciones_pv/resultados.html Elecciones en el País Vasco 2005]. elmundo.es. Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref>

Batasuna's political status is controversial. It was considered to be the political wing of ETA.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/56763.stm|work=BBC News  |title=ETA's political wing elects new leaders|date=14 February 1998|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-1272166/Batasuna Batasuna (Basque org.) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia]</ref> Moreover, after the investigations on the nature of the relationship between Batasuna and ETA by Judge [[Baltasar Garzón]], who suspended the activities of the political organisation and ordered police to shut down its headquarters, the [[Supreme Court of Spain]] finally declared Batasuna illegal on 18 March 2003. The court considered proven that Batasuna had links with ETA and that it constituted in fact part of ETA's structure. In 2003, the Constitutional Tribunal upheld the legality of the law.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

However, the party itself denies being the political wing of ETA,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} despite the fact that double membership – simultaneous or alternative – between Batasuna and ETA is often recorded, such as with the cases of prominent Batasuna leaders like Josu Ternera, [[Arnaldo Otegi]], Jon Salaberria and others.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4581987.stm|work=BBC News  |title=Basque nationalist leader jailed|date=26 May 2005|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref><ref name = "jvjtfe">[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/direccion/Batasuna/ETA/elpepuesp/20080521elpepunac_4/Tes De la dirección de Batasuna a la de ETA · ELPAÍS.com].

The Spanish [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] (the Spanish Parliament) began the process of declaring the party illegal in August 2002 by issuing a bill entitled the ''Ley de Partidos Políticos'' which bars political parties that use violence to achieve political goals, promotes hatred against different groups or seek to destroy the democratic system. The bill passed the Cortes with a 304 to 16 vote.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/2002/06/05/espana/1153258.html El Congreso aprueba la Ley de Partidos con el 95% de los votos], ''El Mundo'', 5 June 2002.</ref> Many within the Basque nationalistic movement strongly disputed the Law, which they consider too draconian or even unconstitutional; alleging that any party could be made illegal almost by choice, simply for not clearly stating their opposition to an attack.

Defenders of the new law argue that the ''Ley de Partidos'' does not necessarily require responses to individual acts of violence, but rather a declaration of principles explicitly rejecting violence as a means of achieving political goals. Defenders also argue that the ban of a political party is subject to judicial process, with all the guarantees of the State of Law. Batasuna has failed to produce such a statement. {{As of|2008|alt=As of February 2008}} other political parties linked to organizations such as ''[[Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted)|Partido Comunista de España (reconstituido)]]'' have also been declared illegal, and [[Acción Nacionalista Vasca]] and [[Communist Party of the Basque Lands]] (EHAK/PCTV, ''Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista/Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas'') were declared illegal in September 2008.

A new party called [[Aukera Guztiak]] ''(All the Options)'' was formed expressly for the elections to the [[Basque Parliament]] of April 2005. Its supporters claimed no heritage from Batasuna, asserting that their aim was to allow Basque citizens to freely express their political ideas, even those of independence. On the matter of political violence, Aukera Guztiak stated their right not to condemn some kinds of violence more than others if they did not see fit (in this regard, the [[Basque National Liberation Movement]] (MLNV) regards present police actions as violence, torture and state terrorism). Nevertheless, most of their members and certainly most of their leadership were former Batasuna supporters or affiliates. The Spanish Supreme Court unanimously considered the party to be a sequel to Batasuna and declared a ban on it.

After Aukera Guztiak had been banned, and less than two weeks before the election, another political group appeared born from an earlier schism from Herri Batasuna, the [[Communist Party of the Basque Lands]] (EHAK/PCTV, ''Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista/Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas''), a formerly unknown political party which had no representation in the Autonomous Basque Parliament. EHAK made the announcement that they would apply the votes they obtained to sustain the political programme of the now banned Aukera Guztiak platform.

This move left no time for the Spanish courts to investigate EHAK in compliance with the ''Ley de Partidos'' before the elections were held. The bulk of Batasuna supporters voted in this election for PCTV, a virtually unknown political formation until then. PCTV obtained 9 seats of 75 (12.44% of votes) at the Basque Parliament.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/especiales/2005/03/espana/elecciones_pv/resultados/ Elecciones en el País Vasco 2005]. elmundo.es. Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref>
The election of EHAK representatives eventually allowed the programme of the now-illegal Batasuna to continue being represented without having condemned violence as required by the ''Ley de Partidos''.

In February 2011, Sortu, a party described as "the new Batasuna",<ref name="LV8F">{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/politica/20110208/54111615502/el-nuevo-partido-de-la-izquierda-abertzale-se-denomina-sortu.html|title="El nuevo partido de la izquierda abertzale se denomina 'Sortu'", La Vanguardia, 8 February 2011|work=LA VANGUARDIA|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref> was launched. Unlike predecessor parties, Sortu explicitly rejects politically motivated violence, including that of ETA.<ref name="LV8F"/> However, on 23 March 2011, the Spanish Supreme Court banned Sortu from registering as a political party on the grounds that it was linked to ETA.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spanish supreme court bans Basque separatist party Sortu for links to ETA|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/858354060|work=BBC  Monitoring European|publisher=BBC  Worldwide Limited|accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Spanish transition to democracy]] from 1975 on and ETA's progressive radicalisation have resulted in a steady loss of support, which became especially apparent at the time of their 1997 kidnapping and countdown assassination of [[Miguel Ángel Blanco]]. Their loss of sympathisers has been reflected in an erosion of support for the political parties identified with them. In the 1998 Basque parliament elections Euskal Herritarrok, formerly Batasuna, polled 17.7% of the votes.<ref>[http://www.electionresources.org/es/eus/parliament.php?election=1998 Basque parliament election 1998].

Strong evidence was seen that a legal network had grown so wide as to lead to the arrest of numerous innocent people. According to [[Amnesty International]], [[torture]] was still "persistent", though not "systematic." Inroads could be undermined by judicial short-cuts and abuses of human rights.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/1122/1227293430430.html Sat, 22 Nov 2008 – Bringing an end to Eta campaign].

===Opinion polls===
The [[Euskobarometro]], the survey carried out by the [[Universidad del País Vasco]] (University of the Basque Country), asking about the views of ETA within the Basque population, obtained these results in May 2009:<ref name="Euskobarometro">[http://alweb.ehu.es/euskobarometro/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=78&Itemid=114 Euskobarómetro – EUSKOBAROMETRO MAYO 2009].

Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref> 64% rejected ETA totally, 13% identified themselves as former ETA sympathisers (mainly during the Franco dictatorship) who no longer support the group. Another 10% agreed with ETA's ends, but not their means. 3% said that their attitude towards ETA was mainly one of fear, 3% expressed indifference and 3% were undecided or did not answer. About 3% gave ETA "justified, with criticism" support (supporting the group but criticising some of their actions) and only 1% gave ETA total support. Even within Batasuna voters, at least 48% rejected ETA's violence.

This poll also reveals that the hope of a peaceful resolution to the issue of the constitutional status of the Basque region has fallen to 78% (from 90% in April).

These polls did not cover [[Navarre]], where support for Basque nationalist electoral options is weaker (around 25% of population) or the [[Northern Basque Country]] where support is even weaker (around 15% of population).

==History==

===During Franco's dictatorship===

ETA grew out of a student group called Ekin, founded in the early 1950s, which published a magazine and undertook direct action.<ref name=newandcourrier>{{cite news|title=Basques Stir Ferment in Spain|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fnZJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SAsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4795,3283737&dq=eta+bayonne+france+1962&hl=en|accessdate=21 October 2011|newspaper=The News and Courier|date=1 October 1968}}</ref> ETA was founded on 31 July 1959 as Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (Basque Homeland and Freedom) by students frustrated by the moderate stance of the [[Basque Nationalist Party]].<ref name=studentgroup>{{cite news|title=ETA: from student group to Basque bombers|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/8839645/ETA-from-student-group-to-Basque-bombers.html|accessdate=21 October 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=20 October 2011}}</ref> (Originally, the name for the organisation used the word ''Aberri'' instead of ''Euskadi'', creating the acronym ''ATA''.

ETA held their first assembly in [[Bayonne]], France, in 1962, during which a "declaration of principles" was formulated and following which a structure of activist cells was developed.<ref name=Conversi>{{cite book|last=Conversi|first=Daniele|title=The Basques, the Catalans, and Spain|year=1997|publisher=C.

Nationalists who refused to follow the tenets of Marxism–Leninism and who sought to create a [[united front]] appeared as ETA-V, but lacked the support to challenge ETA.<ref name=sullivan>{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=John|title=ETA and Basque nationalism: the fight for Euskadi|year=1988|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|pages=128–9|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FOMOAAAAQAAJ&dq=ETA+V&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref>

The most significant assassination performed by ETA during Franco's dictatorship was [[Operación Ogro]], the December 1973 bomb assassination in [[Madrid]] of Admiral [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], Franco's chosen successor and president of the government (a position roughly equivalent to being a prime minister). The assassination had been planned for months and was executed by placing a bomb in a tunnel dug below the street where Carrero Blanco's car passed every day. The bomb blew up beneath the politician's car and threw it five stories into the air and over the top of a nearby building onto a balcony in a nearby courtyard.<ref name=studentgroup/>

For some in the Spanish opposition, Carrero Blanco's assassination i.e. the elimination of Franco's chosen successor was an instrumental step for the subsequent establishment of democracy.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jGqNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT179&lpg=PT179&dq=CARRERO+BLANCO+ASSASSINATION+IMPORTANT&source=bl&ots=nWcIzdOuIg&sig=yUS15H9AAfX349-ZjGijM133bBQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFQQ6AEwCWoVChMI8P3a25ykxwIV6bNyCh2GyQOg#v=onepage&q=CARRERO%20BLANCO%20ASSASSINATION%20IMPORTANT&f=false The Identity of the Constitutional Subject: Selfhood, Citizenship, Culture, and Community], Chapter 4.3, Michel Rosenfeld, Routledge, 2009</ref> The government responded with new anti-terrorist laws which gave police greater powers and empowered military tribunals to pass death sentences against those found guilty. However, the [[last use of capital punishment in Spain]] when two ETA members were executed in September 1975, eight weeks before Franco's death, sparked massive domestic and international protests against the Spanish government.

===During the transition===
During the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] which began following Franco's death, ETA split into two separate groups: [[ETA political-military]] or ETA(pm), and [[ETA military]] or ETA(m).

Both ETA(m) and ETA(pm) refused offers of amnesty, and instead pursued and intensified their violent struggle. The years 1978–80 were to prove ETA's most deadly, with 68, 76, and 98 fatalities, respectively.

During the Franco dictatorship, ETA was able to take advantage of tolerance by the [[French government]], which allowed its members to move freely through French territory, believing that in this manner they were contributing to the end of Franco's regime. There is much controversy over the degree to which this policy of "[[sanctuary]]" continued even after the transition to democracy, but it is generally agreed that currently the French authorities collaborate closely with the Spanish government against ETA.

In the 1980s, ETA(pm) accepted the Spanish government's offer of individual pardons to all ETA prisoners, even those who had committed violent crimes, who publicly abandoned the policy of violence. This caused a new division in ETA(pm) between the seventh and eighth assemblies. ETA VII accepted this partial amnesty granted by the now democratic Spanish government and integrated into the political party ''[[Euskadiko Ezkerra]]'' ("[[left-wing politics|Left]] of the Basque Country").<ref>* Gaizka Fernández Soldevilla, ''Agur a las armas. EIA, Euskadiko Ezkerra y la disolución de ETA político-militar (1976–1985)'', en ''Sancho el sabio''. Revista de cultura e investigación vasca, ISSN 1131-5350, Nº 33, 2010, pp. 55–96 [http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3401994 Enlace al artículo en pdf] Consultado: 8 March 2011.</ref>

ETA VIII, after a brief period of independent activity, eventually integrated into ETA(m). With no factions existing anymore, ETA(m) revamped the original name of Euskadi Ta Askatasuna.

====GAL====
During the 1980s a "dirty war" ensued by means of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación]] (GAL, "Antiterrorist Liberation Groups"), a paramilitary group which billed themselves as [[counter-terrorist]], active between 1983 and 1987. The GAL committed assassinations, kidnappings and torture, not only of ETA members but of civilians supposedly related to those, some of whom turned out to have nothing to do with ETA. 27 people were killed by GAL.<ref name="santamaria437">{{cite book|author=[[Diego Carcedo]]|title=Sáenz de Santa María. El general que cambió de bando|page=437|isbn=84-8460-309-1|year=2004|publisher=Temas de Hoy|location=Madrid}}</ref> GAL activities were a follow-up of similar dirty war actions by death squads, actively supported by members of Spanish security forces and secret services, using names such as [[Batallón Vasco Español]] active from 1975 to 1981. They were responsible for the killing of about 48 people.<ref name="santamaria437"/>

One consequence of GAL's activities in France was the decision in 1984 by interior minister Pierre Joxe to permit the extradition of ETA suspects to Spain. Reaching this decision had taken 25 years and was critical in curbing ETA's capabilities by denial of previously safe territory in France.<ref>''Talking to Terrorists: Making Peace in Northern Ireland and the Basque Country'' (pp. 197–202), John Bew, Martyn Frampton, and Inigo Gurruchaga, Hurst & Co., London.</ref>

The airing of the state-sponsored "dirty war" scheme and the imprisonment of officials responsible for GAL in the early 1990s led to a political scandal in Spain. The group's connections with the state were unveiled by the Spanish journal [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]], with an [[investigative journalism|investigative]] series leading to the GAL plot being discovered and a national trial initiated. As a consequence, the group's attacks since the revelation have generally been dubbed [[state terrorism]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/168958.stm Europe | Former Spanish ministers jailed for 'terrorism']. BBC News (12 September 1998). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref>

In 1997 the Spanish [[Audiencia Nacional]] court finished its trial, which resulted in convictions and imprisonment of several individuals related to the GAL, including civil servants up to the highest levels of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) government, such as former Homeland Minister [[José Barrionuevo]]. Premier [[Felipe González]] was quoted as saying that the [[Rechtsstaat|constitutional state]] has to defend itself "also in the sewers" (''El Estado de derecho también se defiende en las cloacas'') something which, for some, indicated at least his knowledge of the scheme. However, his involvement with the GAL could never be proven.

These events marked the end of the armed "counter-terrorist" period in Spain and no major cases of foul play on the part of the Spanish government after 1987 (when GAL ceased to operate) have been proven in courts.

====Human rights====
According to the radical nationalist group, Euskal Memoria, between 1960 and 2010 there were 465 deaths in the Basque Country due to (primarily Spanish) "state violence".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minutodigital.com/2011/02/28/los-etarras-escriben-su-historia-euskal-memoria/|title=Los etarras escriben su historia…Euskal Memoria|work=Minuto digital|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref> This figure is considerably higher than those given elsewhere, which are usually between 250 and 300.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gara.naiz.info/paperezkoa/20101107/230664/es/474-personas-han-muerto-represion-desde-1960|title=474 personas han muerto por la represin desde 1960 - GARA|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref> Critics of ETA cite only  56 members of that organisation killed by state forces since 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-15-09-2003/abc/Nacional/cincuenta-y-seis-etarras-han-muerto-en-enfrentamientos-con-las-fuerzas-de-seguridad_207653.html|title=Cincuenta y seis etarras han muerto en enfrentamientos con las fuerzas de seguridad|work=ABC|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>

ETA members and supporters routinely claim [[torture]] at the hands of Spanish police forces.<ref name="publico"/> While these claims are hard to verify, some convictions are based on confessions while prisoners are held ''incomunicado'' and without access to a lawyer of their choice, for a maximum of five days. These confessions are routinely repudiated by the defendants during trials as having been extracted under torture. There have been some successful prosecutions of proven tortures during the "dirty war" period of the mid-1980s, although the penalties have been considered by [[Amnesty International]] as unjustifiably light and lenient with co-conspirators and enablers.<ref name="AIUN2002">[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGEUR410122002 October 2002 AI Index: EUR 41/12/2002: SPAIN: A briefing for the United Nations Committee against Torture]: ''Although convictions of torturers occur, these are rare.&nbsp;... examining judges and prosecutors may not always be displaying due diligence&nbsp;... trials involving torture complaints are often delayed for long periods.

===Under democracy===
ETA performed their first [[car bomb]] assassination in [[Madrid]] in September 1985, resulting in one death (American citizen Eugene Kent Brown, Johnson & Johnson employee) and sixteen injuries; the [[Plaza República Dominicana bombing]] in July 1986 killed 12 members of the Guardia Civil and injured 50; on 19 June 1987, the [[1987 Hipercor bombing|Hipercor bombing]] was an attack in a shopping center in [[Barcelona]], killing twenty-one and injuring forty-five; in the last case, entire families were killed. The horror caused then was so striking that ETA felt compelled to issue a communiqué stating that they had given warning of the Hipercor bomb, but that the police had declined to evacuate the area. The police claim that the warning came only a few minutes before the bomb exploded.

In 1986 [[Gesto por la Paz]] (known in English as [[Association for Peace in the Basque Country]]) was founded; they began to convene silent demonstrations in communities throughout the Basque Country the day after any violent killing, whether by ETA or by GAL. These were the first systematic demonstrations in the Basque Country against political violence. Also in 1986, in [[Ordizia]], ETA shot down [[María Dolores Katarain]], known as "Yoyes", while she was walking with her infant son. Yoyes was a former member of ETA who had abandoned the armed struggle and rejoined civil society: they accused her of "desertion" because of her taking advantage of the Spanish reinsertion policy which granted amnesty to those prisoners who publicly refused political violence (see below).

On 12 January 1988, all Basque political parties except ETA-affiliated [[Batasuna|Herri Batasuna]] signed the [[Ajuria-Enea pact]] with the intent of ending ETA's violence. Weeks later on 28 January, ETA announced a 60-day "ceasefire", later prolonged several times. Negotiations known as the [[Mesa de Argel]] ("[[Algiers]] Table") took place between the ETA representative [[Eugenio Etxebeste]] ("Antxon"), and the then PSOE government of Spain but no successful conclusion was reached, and ETA eventually resumed the use of violence.

During this period, the Spanish government had a policy referred to as "[[reinsertion]]", under which imprisoned ETA members whom the government believed had genuinely abandoned violence could be freed and allowed to rejoin society. Claiming a need to prevent ETA from coercively impeding this reinsertion, the PSOE government decided that imprisoned ETA members, who previously had all been imprisoned within the Basque Country, would instead be dispersed to prisons throughout Spain, some as far from their families as in the [[Salto del Negro]] prison in the [[Canary Islands]]. France has taken a similar approach.

In the event, the only clear effect of this policy was to incite social protest, especially from nationalists and families of the prisoners, claiming cruelty of separating family members from the insurgents. Much of the protest against this policy runs under the slogan "''Euskal Presoak – Euskal Herrira''" (''Basque prisoners to the Basque Country'', by "Basque prisoners" only ETA members are meant). It has to be noted that almost in any Spanish jail there is a group of ETA prisoners, as the number of ETA prisoners makes it difficult to disperse them.

[[File:EPPK 2008.jpg|thumb|Banner in support of imprisoned ETA members, by ''[[Gestoras pro-Amnistía]]/[[Amnistiaren Aldeko Batzordeak]]'' ("Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies", currently illegal)]]

''[[Gestoras pro-Amnistía]]/[[Amnistiaren Aldeko Batzordeak]]'' ("Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies", currently illegal), later ''[[Askatasuna]]'' ("Freedom") and ''[[Senideak]]'' ("The family members") provided support for prisoners and families. The [[Basque Government]] and several Nationalist town halls granted money on humanitarian reasons for relatives to visit prisoners. The long road trips have caused accidental deaths that are protested against by Nationalist Prisoner's Family supporters.

During the ETA ceasefire of the late 1990s, the PSOE government brought back to the mainland the prisoners on the islands and in Africa.<!-- Is this Ceuta and Melilla? -->{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Since the end of the ceasefire, ETA prisoners have not been sent back to overseas prisons. Some Basque authorities have established grants for the expenses of visiting families.

Another Spanish "counter-terrorist" law puts suspected terrorist cases under the central tribunal ''[[Audiencia Nacional]]'' in [[Madrid]], due to the threats by the group over the Basque courts. Under Article 509 suspected terrorists are subject to being held "incommunicado" for up to thirteen days, during which they have no contact with the outside world other than through the court appointed lawyer, including informing their family of their arrest, consultation with private lawyers or examination by a physician other than the [[coroner]]s. In comparison, the [[habeas corpus]] term for other suspects is three days.

In 1992, ETA's three top leaders—"military" leader [[Francisco Mujika Garmendia]] ("Pakito"), political leader [[José Luis Alvarez Santacristina]] ("Txelis") and logistical leader [[José María Arregi Erostarbe]] ("Fiti"), often referred to collectively as the "cúpula" of ETA or as the Artapalo collective<ref>[http://www.informativos.telecinco.es/dn_16360.htm Informativos Telecinco.com – Internacional – Trece muertos y más de cincuenta heridos en dos atentados suicidas en Bangladesh]. Informativos.telecinco.es. Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref>—were arrested in the northern Basque town of [[Bidart]], which led to changes in ETA's leadership and direction.

After a two-month truce, ETA adopted even more radical positions. The principal consequence of the change appears to have been the creation of the "''[[Y Groups]]''", formed by young militants of ETA parallel groups (generally [[minor (law)|minors]]), dedicated to so-called "''kale borroka''"—street struggle—and whose activities included burning buses, street lamps, benches, [[Automatic teller machine|ATMs]], garbage containers, and throwing [[Molotov cocktail]]s. The appearance of these groups was attributed by many to the supposed weakness of ETA, which obliged them to resort to minors to maintain or augment their impact on society after arrests of leading militants, including the "cupola". ETA also began to menace leaders of other parties besides rival Basque nationalist parties.

In 1995, the armed group again launched a peace proposal. The so-called "Democratic Alternative" replaced the earlier [[Koordinadora Abertzale Sozialista|KAS]] Alternative as a minimum proposal for the establishment of Euskal Herria. The Democratic Alternative offered the cessation of all armed ETA activity if the Spanish-government would recognize the Basque people as having sovereignty over Basque territory, the right to [[self-determination]] and that it freed all ETA members in prison. The Spanish government ultimately rejected this peace offer as it would go against the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. Changing the constitution was not considered.

Also in 1995 came a failed ETA car bombing attempt directed against [[José María Aznar]], a conservative politician who was leader of the then-opposition [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) and was shortly after elected to the presidency of the government; there was also an abortive attempt in [[Majorca]] on the life of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos&nbsp;I]]. Still, the act with the largest social impact came the following year. 10 July 1997, PP council member [[Miguel Ángel Blanco]] was kidnapped in the Basque town of [[Ermua]], with the separatist group threatening to assassinate him unless the Spanish government met ETA's demand of starting to bring all ETA's inmates to prisons of the Basque Country within two days after the kidnapping.

This demand was not met by the Spanish government and after three days Miguel Ángel Blanco was found shot dead when the deadline expired. More than six million people took out to the streets to demand his liberation, with massive demonstrations occurring as much in the Basque regions as elsewhere in Spain, chanting cries of "Assassins" and "Basques yes, ETA no". This response came to be known as the "Spirit of Ermua".

Later came acts of violence such as the 6 November 2001 car bomb in Madrid which injured 65 people, and attacks on [[Association football|football]] stadiums and tourist destinations throughout Spain.

The [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the USA appeared to have dealt a hard blow to ETA, owing to the worldwide toughening of "anti-terrorist" measures (such as the freezing of bank accounts), the increase in international police coordination, and the end of the toleration some countries had, up until then, extended to ETA. In addition, in 2002 the Basque nationalist youth movement, ''Jarrai'', was outlawed and the law of parties was changed outlawing Herri Batasuna, the "political arm" of ETA (although even before the change in law, Batasuna had been largely paralysed and under judicial investigation by judge [[Baltasar Garzón]]).

With ever-increasing frequency, attempted ETA actions have been frustrated by Spanish security forces.

On 24 December 2003, in San Sebastián and in [[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]], National Police arrested two ETA members who had left dynamite in a railroad car prepared to explode in [[Chamartín Station]] in Madrid. On 1 March 2004, in a place between [[Alcalá de Henares]] and [[Madrid]], a light truck with 536&nbsp;kg of explosives was discovered by the Guardia Civil.

ETA was initially blamed for the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|2004 Madrid bombings]] by the outgoing government<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL16484708|title=ANALYSIS-Spain's PM down but not out after ETA bomb|first=Jason|last=Webb|date=16 January 2007|agency=Reuters  }}</ref> and large sections of the press.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/3505422.stm Europe | Spain papers point finger at Eta].

In the context of negotiation with the Spanish government, ETA has declared what it has described as "truce" a number of times since its creation.

On 22 March 2006, ETA sent a DVD message to the Basque Network [[Euskal Irrati-Telebista]]<ref>[http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/effective-on-march-24-eta-cease-fire?itemId=D20829&cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&idioma=en ETA cease-fire], ''eitb24'', {{Nowrap|23 March 2006}}.</ref> and the journals ''[[Gara]]''<ref>{{es icon}} {{fr icon}} {{eu icon}} [http://gara.net/idatzia/20060323/art156940.php ETA declara un alto el fuego permanente para impulsar un proceso democrático] ("ETA declares a permanent ceasefire to give impetus to a democratic process"), ''Gara'', {{Nowrap|3 March 2006}} (article in Spanish, text of announcement in Basque, Spanish and French.</ref> and [[Berria]] with a communiqué from the group announcing what it called a "permanent ceasefire" that was broadcast over Spanish TV.

Talks with the group were then officially opened by Spanish ''Presidente del Gobierno'' [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]].

These took place all over 2006, not free from incidents such as an ETA cell stealing some 300 handguns, ammunition and spare parts in France on October 2006.<ref>{{es icon}} [http://www.gara.net/idatzia/20061025/art186010.php La Policía sospecha que fue ETA quien robó anteayer 350 pistolas en Nimes] ("The police suspect that it was ETA who stole 350 guns yesterday in Nîmes"), ''Gara'', {{Nowrap|25 October 2006}}</ref> or a series of warnings made by ETA such as the one of 23 September, when masked ETA militants declared that the group would "keep taking up arms" until achieving "independence and socialism in the Basque country",<ref>{{es icon}} [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/09/24/espana/1159091695.html El Mundo] {{Nowrap|24 September 2006}}</ref> which were regarded by some as a way to increase pressure on the talks, by others as a tactic to reinforce ETA's position in the negotiations.

Finally, on [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing|30 December 2006 ETA detonated a van bomb]] after three confusing warning calls, in a parking building at the [[Madrid]] Barajas international airport.

In January 2008, ETA stated that its call for independence is similar to that of the [[Kosovo status process|Kosovo status]] and [[Scottish independence|Scotland]].<ref>[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=01&dd=05&nav_id=46703 News – ETA to follow Kosovo example].

In the week of 8 September 2008, two Basque political parties were banned by a Spanish court for their secretive links to ETA. In another case in the same week, 21 people were convicted whose work on behalf of ETA prisoners actually belied secretive links to the armed separatists themselves.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}ETA reacted to these actions by placing three major car bombs in less than 24 hours in northern Spain.

In April 2009 [[Jurdan Martitegi]] was arrested, making the fourth consecutive ETA military chiefs to be captured within a single year, an unprecedented police record further weakening the group.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>
The group, and therefore the violence surged in summer 2009, with several ETA attacks leaving three people dead and dozens injured around Spain.

The Basque newspaper ''[[Gara]]'' published an article that suggested that ETA member Jon Anza could have been killed and buried by Spanish police in April 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Altuna|first=Iñaki|title=El refugiado donostiarra Jon Anza está desaparecido desde el pasado 18 de abril|url=http://www.gara.net/paperezkoa/20090516/137467/es/El-refugiado-donostiarra-Jon-Anza-esta-desaparecido-desde-pasado-18-abril|accessdate=20 October 2011|newspaper=Gara|date=16 May 2009}}</ref> The central prosecutor in the French town of Bayonne, Anne Kayanakis, announced, as the official version, that the autopsy carried out on the body of Jon Anza – a suspected member of the armed Basque group ETA, missing since April 2009 – revealed no signs of having been beaten, wounded or shot, which should rule out any suspicions that he died from unnatural causes.<ref name="eitb.com">{{cite web|title=CP reports verdict of death by natural causes in case of Anza |url=http://www.eitb.com/news/politics/detail/377714/cp-reports-verdict-death-natural-causes-case-anza/}}</ref> Nevertheless, that very magistrate denied the demand of the family asking for the presence of a family doctor during the autopsy. After this Jon Anza's family members asked for a second autopsy to be carried on.<ref name="gara.net">{{cite web|title= Autopsy carried out without family doctor |url=http://www.gara.net/azkenak/03/188405/es/Concluye-autopsia-Jon-Anza-sin-presencia-forense-confianza}}</ref>

In December 2009, Spain raised its terror alert after warning that ETA could be planning major attacks or high-profile kidnappings during Spain's European Union presidency. The next day, after being asked by the opposition, [[Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba]] said that warning was part of a strategy.

===2010 ceasefire===

On 5 September 2010, ETA declared a new ceasefire, its third, after two previous ceasefires were ended by the group. A spokesperson speaking on a video announcing the ceasefire said the group wished to use "peaceful, democratic means" to achieve its aims, though it was not specified whether the ceasefire was considered permanent by the group. ETA claimed that it had made the decision to initiate a ceasefire several months prior to the announcement. In part of the video, the spokesperson said that the group was "prepared today as yesterday to agree to the minimum democratic conditions necessary to put in motion a democratic process, if the Spanish government is willing."<ref name="bbc 5 sep"/>

The announcement was met with a mixed reaction; Basque nationalist politicians responded positively, and said that the Spanish and international governments should do the same, while the Spanish interior counselor of Basque, Rodolfo Ares, said that the commitment did not go far enough. He said that he considered ETA's statement "absolutely insufficient" because it did not commit to a complete termination of what Ares considered "terrorist activity" by the group.<ref name="bbc 5 sep"/>

===2011 permanent ceasefire and cessation of armed activity===

[[File:Konferentzia.ogv|thumb|400px|The final declaration of the [[Donostia-San Sebastián International Peace Conference]] (17 October 2011) led to an announcement of cessation of armed activity by ETA.]]

On 10 January 2011, ETA declared that their September 2010 ceasefire would be permanent and verifiable by international observers.<ref name="grauniad">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/10/eta-declares-permanent-ceasefire ETA declares permanent ceasefire], The Guardian, 10 January 2011</ref> Observers urged caution, pointing out that ETA had broken permanent ceasefires in the past,<ref name="grauniad"/> whereas Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] (who left office in December 2011) demanded that ETA declare that it had given up violence for once and for all.<ref name="grauniad"/> After the declaration, Spanish press started speculating of a possible [[Real IRA]]-type split within ETA, with hardliners forming a new more violent offshoot led by "Dienteputo".<ref>{{cite web|title=ETA hardliners warns of IRA-type split within ETA|url=http://www.barcelonareporter.com/index.php?/news/comments/eta_hardliners_warns_of_ira-type_split_within_eta/|work=Barcelona Reporter|publisher=barcelonareporter.com|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Doce pistoleros en estado de alerta|url=http://www.interviu.es/reportajes/articulos/doce-pistoleros-en-estado-de-alerta|work=Interviu|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Un 'histórico' dirige la posible escisión en ETA|url=http://www.diariocritico.com/2011/Febrero/exclusivo/256300/escision-eta.html|work=Diario Crítico|publisher=diariocritico.com|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>

On 20 October 2011, ETA announced a cessation of armed activity via video clip sent to media outlets following the [[Donostia-San Sebastián International Peace Conference]], which was attended by former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], former [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland [[Bertie Ahern]], former Prime Minister of Norway [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] (an international leader in sustainable development and public health), former Interior Minister of France [[Pierre Joxe]], president of Sinn Féin [[Gerry Adams]] (a [[Teachta Dála]] in [[Dáil Éireann]]), and British diplomat [[Jonathan Powell (aide)|Jonathan Powell]], who served as the first Downing Street Chief of Staff.

They all signed a final declaration that was supported also by former UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]],<ref name=EITB20111017>{{cite news|title=Annan and Adams top list of experts at Donostia Peace Conference|url=http://www.eitb.com/en/news/politics/detail/757117/annan-adams-top-list-experts-donostia-peace-conference/|accessdate=18 October 2011|publisher=EITB.com|date=17 October 2011}}</ref> the former US President and 2002 Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Jimmy Carter]], and the former US senator and former US Special Envoy for Middle East Peace [[George J.

The day after the ceasefire, in a contribution piece to the New York Times, Tony Blair indicated that lessons in dealing with paramilitary separatist groups can be learned from the way in which the Spanish administration handled ETA. Blair wrote, “governments must firmly defend themselves, their principles and their people against terrorists. This requires good police and intelligence work as well as political determination. [However], firm security pressure on terrorists must be coupled with offering them a way out when they realize that they cannot win by violence. Terrorist groups are rarely defeated by military means alone”.<ref name="nytimes1">Blair, Tony. “A Basque Peace.” The New York Times: Opinion Pages 21 October 2011. <http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/opinion/22iht-edblair22,1.html>.</ref> Blair also suggested that Spain will need to discuss weapon decommissioning, peace strategies, reparations for victims, and security with ETA, as Britain has discussed with the [[Provisional IRA]].<ref name="nytimes1"/>

ETA has declared ceasefires many times before, most significantly in 1999 and 2006, but the Spanish government and media outlets have expressed particularly hopeful opinions regarding the permanence of this most recent proclamation. Spanish premier [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] described the move as "a victory for democracy, law and reason".<ref name=BBC20111020/> Additionally, the effort of security and intelligence forces in Spain and France are cited by politicians as the primary instruments responsible for the weakening of ETA.<ref>Euronews. “ETA Ceasefire: Politicians and Public React.” Youtube.com. 21 October 2011. Euronews Channel. 27 October 2011 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OCkyZ7dlq8>.</ref> The optimism may come as a surprise considering ETA’s failure to renounce the independence movement, which has been one of the Spanish government’s requirements.<ref name="nytimes2">Burns, John F. “Basque Separatists Halt Campaign of Violence.” The New York Times: Europe 20 October 2011. <http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/world/europe/eta-basque-separatists-declare-halt-to-violence-in-spain-and-france.html>.</ref> In fact, ETA’s ceasefire video ended with the assertion that the struggle for the Basque homeland continues.<ref name="youtube1">TeleSur English. “Basque Group ETA Declares End to Armed Conflict.” Youtube.com. 20 October 2011. Telesur. 25 October 2011 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gtUk-Q6WkU&feature=related>.</ref>

Less optimistic, Spanish Prime Minister, [[Mariano Rajoy]], of the center-right [[People's Party (Spain)]], expressed the need to push for the full dissolution of ETA.<ref name="nytimes2"/> The People's Party has emphasized the obligation of the state to refuse negotiations with separatist movements since former Prime Minister [[José María Aznar]] was in office. Aznar was responsible for banning media outlets seen as subversive to the state and Batasuna, the political party of ETA.<ref>Blum, Andrew. “Ending with ETA?: Elusive Peace in the Basque Country.” Washington, D.C.: United States Institute for Peace, 2011.</ref> Additionally, in preparation for his party’s manifesto, on 30 October 2011, Rajoy declared that the People's Party would not negotiate with ETA under threats of violence nor announcements of the group’s termination, but would instead focus party efforts on remembering and honoring victims of separatist violence.<ref>“Mariano Rajoy Says the PP Will Not Talk to ETA”. Typically Spanish: Spain News: National. 30 October 2011. <http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_32500.shtml>.</ref>

Significantly, while ETA pledged to refrain from a violent separatist movement, the separatist movement was not denounced. In fact, the ETA announcement reinforced the struggle for the Basque homeland, but through the use of democratic means.<ref name="youtube1"/> It is crucial to understand that this event may not alter the goals of the Basque separatist movement, but will change the method of the fight for a more autonomous state. Negotiations with the newly elected administration may prove difficult with the return to the center-right People's Party, which is replacing Socialist control, due to pressure from within the party to refuse all ETA negotiations.<ref>Minder, Raphael. “Peace Deal with Basque Separatists Still Tentative.” The New York Times: Europe 28 October 2011. <http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/29/world/europe/peace-deal-with-basque-separatists-still-tentative.html?scp=1&sq=basque&st=cse>.</ref>

ETA's targets have expanded from the former military/police-related personnel and their families, to a wider array, which today includes the following:{{Clarify|date=April 2009}}

* Businessmen (such as [[Javier Ybarra Bergé|Javier Ybarra]], [[Joxe Mari Korta]] or [[Ignacio Uria Mendizabal]]):<ref>[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ETA/asesina/empresario/nacionalista/elpepiesp/20081204elpepinac_2/Tes ETA asesina a un empresario nacionalista · ELPAÍS.com].

Refusal to pay has been punished with assassinations, kidnappings for ransom or bombings of their business.
* Prison officers such as [[José Antonio Ortega Lara]].
* Elected parliamentarians, city councillors and ex-councillors, politicians in general: most prominently [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], killed in 1973). Dozens of politicians belonging to the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) and [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) have been assassinated or maimed. Some Basque nationalist politicians from the PNV party, such as [[Juan Mari Atutxa]], have also received threats. Hundreds of politicians in Spain require a constant bodyguard service. Bodyguards are contingent victims as well.

===Tactics===
ETA's tactics include:

* Direct attacks: killing by shooting the victim in the [[nape]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1350358.stm|work=BBC News  |title=European press review|date=25 May 2001|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref><ref>[url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/10/09/spain.eta/index.html]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jun/19/spain.nikkiknewstub|work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Eta to end attacks on elected politicians|first=Nikki|last=Knewstub|date=19 June 2005|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>
* Bombings (often with [[car bomb]]s). When the bombs target individuals for assassination they are made by rigging their cars with a bomb. The detonating systems vary: they are rarely manually ignited, but wired so the bomb may explode at ignition or when the car goes over a set speed limit, in the case the bomb is attached directly to the target victim vehicle. Sometimes the bomb is placed inside a stolen car with false plates, parked in the route of the objective, and the explosive remotely activated once the target passes by (i.e., V.I.P. cars, police patrols or military vehicles).

These bombs have sometimes killed family members of ETA's target victim and bystanders. When the bombs are large car-bombs seeking to produce large damage and terror, they are generally announced by one or more telephone calls made to newspapers speaking in the name of ETA. Charities (usually [[Detente Y Ayuda]]—DYA) have also been used to announce the threat if the bomb is in a populated area. The type of explosives used in these attacks were initially [[Goma-2]] or self-produced [[ammonal]]. After a number of successful robberies in France, ETA began using [[Titadyne]].

Their lack of precision is probably the reason they are not used anymore.
* Anonymous threats: often delivered in the Basque Country by placards or graffiti. Such threats have forced many people into hiding or into exile from the Basque Country, and have been used to prevent people from freely expressing political ideas other than Basque nationalist ones.
* [[Extortion]] or blackmail: called by ETA a "revolutionary tax", ETA demands money from a business owner in the Basque Country or elsewhere in Spain, under threats to him and his family, up to and including death threats. Occasionally some French Basques have also been threatened in this manner, such as footballer [[Bixente Lizarazu]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/internationals/eta-tries-to-justify-tax-on-lizarazu-688316.html|work=The Independent |location=London |title=ETA tries to justify 'tax' on Lizarazu|date=21 March 2001|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> ETA moves the extorted funds to accounts in [[Liechtenstein]] and other fiscal havens.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/bank-accounts-linked-to-eta-are-frozen-in-liechtenstein-802730.html|work=The Independent |location=London |title=Bank accounts linked to Eta are frozen in Liechtenstein|first=Elizabeth|last=Nash|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> According to French judiciary sources, ETA exacts an estimated 900,000 euros a year in this manner.<ref>[http://www.elconfidencial.com/cache/2008/02/19/28_recauda_anualmente_900000_segun_policia_francesa.html ETA recauda anualmente 900.000 €, según la Policía francesa]. elConfidencial.com. Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref>
* Kidnapping: often as a punishment for failing to pay the blackmail known as "revolutionary tax", but also has been used to try to force the government to free ETA's prisoners under the threat of killing the kidnapped, as in the kidnapping and subsequent execution of [[Miguel Angel Blanco]]. ETA hides the kidnapped in underground chambers without windows, called ''[[zulos]]'', of very reduced dimensions for extended periods.<ref>[http://www.elpais.com/fotogaleria//9-1/ El zulo de Aldaya y Delclaux – Los secuestros de ETA – ELPAÍS.com].

Similarly, over the 1990s and, especially, during the 2000s (decade), fluid cooperation between the French and Spanish police, state of the art tracking devices and techniques and, apparently, police [[mole (espionage)|infiltration]]<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/europe/20eta.html|work=The New York Times|title=Spain Hails Arrest of Man Seen as ETA Leader|first=Victoria|last=Burnett|date=20 April 2009|accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> have allowed increasingly repeating blows to ETA's leadership and structure (between May 2008 and April 2009 no less than four consecutive "military chiefs" were arrested<ref name="nytimes.com"/>).

ETA operates mainly in Spain, particularly in the Basque Country, Navarre, and (to a lesser degree) Madrid, Barcelona, and the tourist areas of the Spanish Mediterranean coast. To date, about 65% of ETA's killings have been committed in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], followed by [[Madrid (autonomous community)|Madrid]] with roughly 15%. [[Navarre]] and [[Catalonia]] also register significant numbers.<ref>[http://www.mir.es/DGRIS/Terrorismo_de_ETA/ultimas_victimas/p12b-esp.htm : Últimas víctimas mortales Cuadros Estadísticos- ???plantilla_home.title??? :].

Actions in France usually consist of assaults on arsenals or military industries in order to steal weapons or explosives; these are usually stored in large quantities in hide-outs located in the French Basque Country rather than Spain. The French judge [[Laurence Le Vert]] has been threatened by ETA and a plot arguably aiming to assassinate her was unveiled.<ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/037/article_15042.asp RFI – Question basque – Paris, cible du terrorisme basque ?].

===Financing===
More recently, 2007 police reports point out that, after the serious blows suffered by ETA and its political counterparts during the 2000s (decade), its budget would have been adjusted to 2,000,000 euros annually.<ref>[http://www.elimparcial.es/contenido/1589.html El Imparcial: Noticias: ETA maneja un presupuesto de dos millones de euros al ańo]. Elimparcial.es (25 January 2008). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref>

Although ETA used robbery as a means of financing its activities in its early days, it has since been accused both of arms trafficking and of benefiting economically from its political counterpart Batasuna. [[Extortion]] remains ETA's main source of funds.

==Basque Nationalist context==
ETA is considered to form part of what is informally known as the [[Basque National Liberation Movement]], a movement born much after ETA's creation. This loose term refers to a range of political organizations that are ideologically akin, comprising several distinct organizations that promote a type of [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalism that is often referred to by the Basque-language term ''Ezker [[Abertzale]]a'' (Nationalist Left). Other groups typically considered to belong to this independentist movement are: the political party [[Batasuna]], the nationalist youth organization [[Segi (organization)|Segi]], the labour union [[Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak]] (LAB), and [[Askatasuna]] among others. There are often strong interconnections between these groups, double or even triple membership are not infrequent.<ref name = "jvjtfe"/>

There are Basque nationalist parties with similar goals as those of ETA (namely, independence) but who openly reject their violent means. They are: [[EAJ-PNV]], [[Eusko Alkartasuna]], [[Aralar Party|Aralar]] and, in the [[French Basque country]], [[Abertzaleen Batasuna]]. In addition, a number of left-wing parties, such as [[United Left (Spain)|Ezker Batua]], [[Batzarre]] and some sectors of the [[EAJ-PNV]] party, also support self-determination but are not in favour of independence.

==French role==
Historically, members of ETA have taken refuge in France, particularly the [[French Basque Country]]. The leadership have typically chosen to live in France for security reasons, where police pressure is much less than in Spain.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/1386545/Payback-for-Eta-in-the-Pays-Basque.html|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Payback for Eta in the Pays Basque|first=Isambard|last=Wilkinson|date=2 March 2002|accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> Accordingly, ETA's tactical approach had been to downplay the issue of independence of the French Basque country so as to get French acquiescence for their activities. The [[French government]] quietly tolerated the group, especially during [[Francoist Spain|Franco's regime]], when ETA members could face the death penalty in Spain. In the 1980s, the advent of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación|GAL]] still hindered [[counter-terrorist]] cooperation between the France and Spain, with the French government considering ETA a Spanish domestic problem. At the time, ETA members often travelled to and from between the two countries using the French sanctuary as a base for operations.<ref>[http://www.france24.com/en/20080926-spain-basque-separatism-batasuna-eta Spain looks to France for help against Basque separatists]. France24 (26 September 2008). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref>

With the disbanding of the GAL, the French government considered that detainees' rights were being adequately defended in Spain. France changed its position in the matter and initiated in the 1990s the ongoing period of active cooperation with the Spanish government against ETA, including fast-track transfers of detainees to Spanish tribunals that are regarded as fully compliant with [[European Union]] legislation in human rights and the legal representation of detainees. Virtually all of the highest ranks within ETA –including their successive "military", "political" or finances chiefs– have been captured in French territory, from where they had been plotting their activities after having crossed the border from Spain.

In response to the new situation, ETA carried out attacks against French policemen and made threats to some French judges and prosecutors. This implied a change from the group's previous low-profile in the French Basque Country, which successive ETA leaders had used to discreetly manage their activities in Spain.<ref name="telegraph"/>

==Government response==
ETA considers its prisoners [[political prisoner]]s. Until 2003,<ref>''ETA pide el tercer grado para sus presos'' [[Libertad Digital]], 5 October 2003, quoted in {{PDFlink|[http://www.bastaya.org/actualidad/Violencia/InformeTorturas/Ladispersiondelospresosdeeta.pdf La dispersión de los presos de ETA]|47.2&nbsp;KB}} (p. 9), a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] in the [[¡Basta Ya!]] site.</ref> ETA consequently forbade them to ask penal authorities for progression to ''tercer grado'' (a form of [[open prison]] that allows single-day or weekend [[furlough]]s) or parole. Before that date, those who did so were menaced and expelled from the group. Some were assassinated by ETA for leaving the group and going through reinsertion programs.<ref name = "hizrqw"/>

The Spanish Government passed the ''Ley de Partidos Políticos''. This is a law barring political parties which support violence and do not condemn terrorist actions or are involved with terrorist groups.<ref name="Ley 6/2002">[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo6-2002.html Ley Orgánica 6/2002, de 27 de junio, de Partidos Políticos]. Noticias.juridicas.com (21 January 2011). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref> The law resulted in the banning of [[Herri Batasuna]] and its successor parties unless they explicitly condemned terrorist actions and, at times, imprisoning or trying some of its leaders who have been indicted for cooperation with ETA.

Judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] has initiated a judicial procedure (coded as ''18/98''), aimed towards the support structure of ETA. This procedure started in 1998 with the preventive closure of the newspaper ''[[Egin (newspaper)|Egin]]'' (and its associated radio-station ''Egin Irratia''), accused of being linked to ETA, and temporary imprisoning the editor of its "investigative unit", [[Pepe Rei]], under similar accusations. In August 1999 Judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] authorized the reopening of the newspaper and the radio, but they could not reopen due to economic difficulties.

Judicial procedure 18/98 has many ramifications, including the following:

* A trial against a little-known organization called ''[[Xaki]]'', acquitted in 2001 as the "international network" of ETA.
* A trial against the youths' movement ''[[Jarrai]]''-''Haika''-''Segi'', accused of contributing to street violence in an organized form and in connivance with ETA.
* Another trial against [[Pepe Rei]] and his new investigation magazine ''Ardi Beltza'' (''Black Sheep''). The magazine was also closed down.
* A trial against the political organization ''[[Ekin]]'' (''Action''), accused of promoting [[civil disobedience]].
* A trial against the organization ''[[Joxemi Zumalabe Fundazioa]]'', which was once again accused of promoting civil disobedience.
* A trial against the prisoner support movement ''[[Amnistiaren Aldeko Komiteak]]''.<!-- Isn't it Batzordeak? -->
* A trial against [[Batasuna]] and the ''[[Herriko Tabernak]]'' (''people's taverns''), accused of acting as a network of meeting centres for members and supporters of ETA. Batasuna was outlawed in all forms. Most taverns continue working normally as their ownership is not directly linked to Batasuna.
* A trial against the league of Basque-language academies [[Alfabetatze Euskalduntze Koordinakundea|AEK]]. The case was dropped in 2001.
* Another trial against ''Ekin'', accusing [[Iker Casnova]] of managing the finances of ETA.
* A trial against the association of Basque municipalities [[Udalbiltza]].
* The closing of the newspaper [[Euskaldunon Egunkaria]] in 2003 and the imprisonment and trial of its editor, [[Martxelo Otamendi]], due to links with ETA accounting and fundraising, and other journalists (some of whom reported torture).<ref name="Otamendi">[http://www.englishpen.org/writersintranslation/magazineofliteratureintranslat/basquecountry/martxelootamendi/ Testimony by Martxelo Otamendi] at the [[Universal Forum of Cultures]], Barcelona (May 2004).</ref>

{{As of|2007|alt=As of June 2007}}, indicted members of the youth movements Haika, Segi and Jarrai have been found guilty (January 2007) of a crime of [[connivance]] with terrorism. Most of the other trials are still under process.

On Tuesday 20 May 2008, leading ETA figures were arrested in [[Bordeaux]], France. [[Francisco Javier López Peña]], also known as 'Thierry,' had been on the run for twenty years before his arrest.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10511726 ETA terror leader's arrest hailed as 'heavy blow'], NZ Herald, 22 May 2008</ref> A final total of arrests brought in six people, including ETA members and supporters, including the ex-Mayor of [[Andoain]], [[José Antonio Barandiarán]], who is rumoured to have led police to 'Thierry'.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1809271,00.html|work=Time|title=The Fall of Spain's Most Wanted|date=24 May 2008|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> The Spanish Interior Ministry claimed the relevance of the arrests would come in time with the investigation. Furthermore, the Interior Minister said that those members of ETA now arrested had ordered the latest attacks, and that senior ETA member Francisco Javier López Peña was "not just another arrest because he is, in all probability, the man who has most political and military weight in the terrorist group."<ref>[http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_16604.shtml Spanish government speaks of the significance of latest ETA arrests in France].

After Lopez Pena's arrest, along with the [[Basque referendum, 2008|Basque referendum]] being put on hold, police work has been on the rise. On 22 July 2008, Spanish police dismantled the most active cell of ETA by detaining nine suspected members of the group. [[Interior Minister]] [[Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba]] said about the arrests: "We can't say this is the only ETA unit but it was the most active, most dynamic and of course the most wanted one."<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5imMCVAth4FzitUIFYwyNXdvxPeYw AFP: Spanish police dismantle ETA's 'most active' cell].

===International response===
The [[European Union]] and the [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|United States]] list ETA as a [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist group]] in their relevant watch lists. The United Kingdom lists ETA as a terrorist group under the [[Terrorism Act 2000]]. The [[Canada|Canadian Parliament]] listed ETA as a terrorist group in 2003.

France and Spain have often shown co-operation in the fight against ETA, after France's lack of co-operation during the Franco era. In late 2007, two Spanish guards were shot to death in France when on a joint operation with their French counterparts. Furthermore, in May 2008, the arrests of four people in Bordeaux led to a major breakthrough against ETA, according to the Spanish Interior Ministry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10511726|title=NZherald.co.nz|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>

On 2 October 2008, as ETA activity increased, France increased its pressure on ETA by arresting more ETA suspects, including [[Unai Fano]], [[María Lizarraga]] on 23 September.<ref>[http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_18290.shtml France arrests third alleged ETA terrorist in two weeks].

He had been wanted by the Spanish authorities since 2007 when a [[Europol]] arrest warrant was issued against him. French judicial authorities had already ordered that he be held in prison on remand.

Spain has also sought cooperation from the United Kingdom in dealing with ETA-IRA ties. In November 2008, this came to light after [[Iñaki de Juana Chaos]], whose release from prison was canceled on appeal, had moved to [[Belfast]]. He was thought to be staying at an [[Provisional IRA|IRA]] safe house while being sought by the Spanish authorities. Interpol notified the judge, Eloy Velasco, that he was in either the Republic of Ireland or [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5150232.ece|work=The Times |location=London |title=Eta terrorist Inaki de Juana Chaos to give himself up at Belfast court|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>
