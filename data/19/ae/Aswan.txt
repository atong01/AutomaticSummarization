'''Aswan''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˌ|æ|s|ˈ|w|ɑː|n|}}; {{lang-arz|أسوان}} ''{{transl|arz|Aswān&nbsp;}}'' {{IPA-arz|ʔɑsˈwɑːn|}}; [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]]: ''{{transl|egy|Swenett}}''<span style="margin:2.5px;">;</span> {{lang-cop|ⲥⲟⲩⲁⲛ}} ''{{transl|cop|Souan}}''<span style="margin:2.5px;">;</span> {{lang-grc|Συήνη}} ''{{transl|grc|Syene}}''), formerly spelled ''Assuan''<span style="margin:1px;">,</span> is a city in the south of [[Egypt]], the capital of the [[Aswan Governorate]].

Aswan is a busy market and tourist centre located just north of the [[Aswan Dams]] on the east bank of the [[Nile]] at the [[first cataract]]. The modern city has expanded and includes the formerly separate community on the island of [[Elephantine]].

== History ==

{{Hiero | ''swnt.t'' | <hiero>s-E34:n-t:niwt</hiero> | align=left | era=default}}
Aswan is the ancient city of '''''Swenett''''', which in antiquity was the frontier town of [[Ancient Egypt]] facing the south. Swenett is supposed to have derived its name from an Egyptian [[goddess]] with the same name.<ref name= altas>{{cite book| last = Baines | first =John  | last2 = Malek | first2 =Jaromir  | title = Atlas of Ancient Egypt (Cultural Atlas) | publisher = Facts On File Inc  | date = March 1983 | location = New York, NY  | pages = 240
 | isbn =9780871963345}}</ref> This goddess later was identified as [[Eileithyia]] by the Greeks and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]] by the Romans during their occupation of Ancient Egypt because of the similar association of their goddesses with childbirth, and of which the import is "the opener".  The ancient name of the city also is said to be derived from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] symbol for ''trade'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=Muhafazat Al Gumhuriya Al Arabiya Al Mutaheda wa Asaraha al baqiah fi al asr al islamim|year=1966|author=Suʻād Māhir|publisher=Majlis al-Aʻlá lil-Shuʼūn al-Islāmīyah|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jEL5GwAACAAJ}}</ref> or ''market''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Egypt, from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest |year=1912|author=James Henry Breasted|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|page=7|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofegyptfr00inbrea}}</ref>

Because the [[Ancient Egyptians]] oriented toward the origin of the life-giving waters of the Nile in the south, Swenett was the first town in the country, and [[Egypt]] always was conceived to "open" or begin at Swenett.<ref name= altas /> The city stood upon a peninsula on the right (east) bank of the [[Nile]], immediately below (and north of) the first cataract of the flowing waters, which extend to it from [[Philae]]. Navigation to the delta was possible from this location without encountering a barrier.

The [[stone quarries of ancient Egypt]] located here were celebrated for their stone, and especially for the granitic rock called Syenite. They furnished the colossal statues, [[obelisk]]s, and monolithal shrines that are found throughout Egypt, including the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]; and the traces of the quarrymen who wrought in these 3,000 years ago are still visible in the native rock. They lie on either bank of the [[Nile]], and a road, {{convert|6.5|km}} in length, was cut beside them from Syene to [[Philae]].

Swenett was equally important as a military station as that of a place of traffic. Under every dynasty it was a garrison town; and here tolls and customs were levied on all boats passing southwards and northwards. Around AD 330, the legion stationed here received a bishop from [[Alexandria]]; this later became the [[Coptic Diocese of Syene]].<ref>Dijkstra, J. Harm F.

The [[latitude]] of the city that would become Aswan – located at 24° 5′ 23″ – was an object of great interest to the ancient geographers. They believed that it was seated immediately under the [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic]], and that on the day of the [[summer solstice]], a vertical staff cast no shadow. They noted that the sun's disc was reflected in a well at noon. This statement is only approximately correct; at the summer solstice, the shadow was only <sup>1</sup>/<sub>400</sub>th of the staff, and so could scarcely be discerned, and the northern limb of the Sun's disc would be nearly vertical.
However, [[Eratosthenes]] used this information together with measurements of the shadow length on the solstice at [[Alexandria]] to perform the first known calculation of the [[circumference]] of the Earth.

The [[Nile]] is nearly {{convert|.4|mi|km}} wide above Aswan. From this frontier town to the northern extremity of Egypt, the river flows for more than {{convert|1200|km}} without bar or cataract. The voyage from Aswan to Alexandria usually took 21 to 28 days in favourable weather.

== Climate ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}

Aswan has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] BWh) like the rest of Egypt. Aswan and [[Luxor#Climate|Luxor]] have the hottest summer days of any city in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]]. Aswan is one of the hottest, sunniest and driest cities in the world. Averages high temperatures are consistently above {{convert|40|°C|1}} during summer (June, July, August and also September) while averages low temperatures remain above {{convert|25|°C|1}}. Summers are long, prolonged and extremely hot. Averages high temperatures remain above {{convert|23|°C|1}} during the coldest month of the year while averages low temperatures remain above {{convert|8|°C|1}}. Winters are short, brief and extremely warm. Wintertime is very pleasant and enjoyable while summertime is unbearably hot with blazing sunshine although desert heat is dry.

The climate of Aswan is extremely dry year-round, with less than {{convert|1|mm|0|abbr=on}} of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall doesn't occur every year, as of early 2001, the last rain there was seven years earlier. Aswan is one of the least humid cities on the planet, with an average relative humidity of only 26%, with a maximum mean of 42% during winter and a minimum mean of 16% during summer.

The climate of Aswan is extremely clear, bright and sunny year-round, in all seasons, with a low seasonal variation, with about some 4,000 hours of annual sunshine, very close of the maximum theoretical sunshine duration. Aswan is one of the sunniest places on Earth.

The highest record temperature was {{convert|51|°C}} on May 22, 1973 and the lowest record temperature was {{convert|-2|°C}} on January 6, 1989.<ref name="Voodoo Skies">{{cite web
