At the December summit in Paris in 1974, following a proposal from then-French president<space/><link><target>Valry Giscard d'Estaing</target></link>, it was agreed that more high level, political input was needed following the &quot;empty chair crisis&quot; and economic problems. The inaugural<space/><italics>European Council</italics>, as it became known, was held in<space/><link><target>Dublin</target></link><space/>on 10 and 11 March 1975 during Ireland's first Presidency of the<space/><link><target>Council of the European Union</target><part>Council of Ministers</part></link>. In 1987, it was included in the treaties for the first time (the<space/><link><target>Single European Act</target></link>) and had a defined role for the first time in the<space/><link><target>Maastricht Treaty</target></link>. At first only a minimum of two meetings per year were required, which resulted in an average of three meetings per year being held for the 1975-1995 period. Since 1996, the number of meetings were required to be minimum four per year. For the latest 2008-2014 period, this minimum was well exceeded, by an average of seven meetings being held per year. The<space/><link><target>#Seat</target><part>seat of the Council</part></link><space/>was formalised in 2002, basing it in Brussels. Three types of European Councils exist: Informal, Scheduled and Extraordinary. While the informal meetings are also scheduled 1 year in advance, they differ from the scheduled ordinary meetings by not ending with official<space/><italics>Council conclusions</italics>, as they instead end by more broad political<space/><italics>Statements</italics><space/>on some cherry picked policy matters. The extraordinary meetings always end with official<space/><italics>Council conclusions</italics><space/>- but differs from the scheduled meetings by not being scheduled more than a year in advance, as for example in 2001 when the European Council gathered to lead the European Union's response to the<space/><link><target>11 September attacks</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="seeToL"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Dragoman"></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (08) edited.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>The European Council at the signing of the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Lisbon</target></link><space/>in 2007</part></link>Some meetings of the European Council are seen by some as turning points in the<space/><link><target>history of the European Union</target></link>.
