After the council of<space/><link><target>tampes</target></link>, Bernard went to speak with the King of England,<space/><link><target>Henry I of England</target><part>Henry I</part></link>, also known as Henry Beauclerc, about the king's reservations regarding Pope<space/><link><target>Innocent II</target></link>. Beauclerc was sceptical because most of the bishops of England supported<space/><link><target>Anacletus II</target></link>; Bernard convinced him to support Innocent.<space/><link><target>Germany</target></link><space/>had decided to support Innocent through<space/><link><target>Norbert of Xanten</target></link>, who was a friend of Bernard's. However, Innocent insisted on Bernard's company when he met with<space/><link><target>Lothair III</target></link><space/>of Germany. Lothair became Innocent's strongest ally among the nobility. Despite the councils of tampes,<space/><link><target>Wurzburg</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Council of Clermont</target><part>Clermont</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>Rheims</target></link><space/>all supporting Innocent, there were still large portions of the Christian world supporting Anacletus. At the end of 1131, the kingdoms of France, England, Germany,<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Castile</target><part>Castile</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>Aragon</target></link><space/>supported Innocent; however, most of Italy, southern France, and<space/><link><target>Sicily</target></link>, with the patriarchs of<space/><link><target>Constantinople</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Antioch</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Jerusalem</target></link>, supported Anacletus. Bernard set out to convince these other regions to rally behind Innocent. The first person whom he went to was<space/><link><target>Gerard of Angoulme</target></link>. He proceeded to write a letter known as<space/><link><target>Letter 126</target></link>, which questioned Gerard's reasons for supporting Anacletus. Bernard would later comment that Gerard was his most formidable opponent during the whole schism. After convincing Gerard, Bernard traveled to visit<space/><link><target>William X, Duke of Aquitaine</target></link>. He was the hardest for Bernard to convince. He did not pledge allegiance to Innocent until 1135. After that, Bernard spent most of his time in<space/><link><target>Italy</target></link><space/>convincing the Italians to pledge allegiance to Innocent. He traveled to Sicily in 1137 to convince the king of Sicily to follow Innocent.

The regime was so austere that Bernard became ill, and only the influence of his friend<space/><link><target>William of Champeaux</target></link><space/>and the authority of the general chapter could make him mitigate the austerities. The monastery, however, made rapid progress. Disciples flocked to it in great numbers and put themselves under the direction of Bernard. The reputation of his holiness soon attracted 130 new monks, including his own father.<extension extension_name='ref' name="SHMI"></extension><space/>His father and all his brothers entered Clairvaux to pursue religious life, leaving only Humbeline, his sister, in the secular world.

The abbey became too small for its members and it was necessary to send out bands to found new houses.

In addition to these victories, Bernard also had his trials. During an absence from Clairvaux, the Grand Prior of<space/><link><target>Abbey of Cluny</target><part>Cluny</part></link><space/>went to Clairvaux and enticed away Bernard's cousin,<space/><link><target>Robert of Chtillon</target></link>.

Though not yet 30 years old, Bernard was listened to with the greatest attention and respect, especially when he developed his thoughts upon the revival of the primitive spirit of regularity and fervour in all the monastic orders. It was this general chapter that gave definitive form to the constitutions of the order and the regulations of the<space/><italics>Charter of Charity</italics><space/>which<space/><link><target>Pope Callixtus II</target></link><space/>confirmed 23 December 1119. In 1120, Bernard authored his first work,<space/><italics>De Gradibus Superbiae et Humilitatis</italics>, and his homilies which he entitled<space/><italics>De Laudibus Mariae.</italics><space/>The monks of the<space/><link><target>abbey of Cluny</target></link><space/>were unhappy to see Cteaux take the lead role among the religious orders of the Roman Catholic Church. For this reason, the<space/><link><target>Black Monks</target></link><space/>attempted to make it appear that the rules of the new order were impracticable. At the solicitation of William of St. Thierry, Bernard defended the order by publishing his<space/><italics>Apology</italics><space/>which was divided into two parts. In the first part, he proved himself innocent of the charges of Cluny and in the second he gave his reasons for his counterattacks. He protested his profound esteem for the Benedictines of Cluny whom he declared he loved equally as well as the other religious orders.<space/><link><target>Peter the Venerable</target></link>,<space/><link><target>abbot of Cluny</target></link>, answered Bernard and assured him of his great admiration and sincere friendship. In the meantime Cluny established a reform, and<space/><link><target>Abbot Suger</target></link>, the minister of<space/><link><target>Louis VI of France</target></link>, was converted by the<space/><italics>Apology</italics><space/>of Bernard. He hastened to terminate his worldly life and restore discipline in his monastery. The zeal of Bernard extended to the bishops, the clergy, and lay people. Bernard's letter to the<space/><link><target>archbishop of Sens</target></link><space/>was seen as a real treatise,<space/><italics>&quot;De Officiis Episcoporum.&quot;</italics><space/>About the same time he wrote his work on<space/><italics>Grace and Free Will</italics>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cedis"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Doctor of the Church (112846)</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Francisco Ribalta - Christ Embracing St Bernard - WGA19350.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Christ Embracing St Bernard by<space/><link><target>Francisco Ribalta</target></link></part></link>In the year 1128 AD, Bernard participated in the<space/><link><target>Council of Troyes</target></link>, which had been convoked by<space/><link><target>Pope Honorius II</target></link>, and was presided over by<space/><link><target>Matthew of Albano</target><part>Cardinal Matthew</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Bishop of Albano</target></link>.

The bishops made Bernard secretary of the council, and charged him with drawing up the synodal statutes. After the council, the<space/><link><target>bishop of Verdun</target></link><space/>was deposed. It was at this council that Bernard traced the outlines of the Rule of the<space/><link><target>Knights Templar</target></link><space/>who soon became the ideal of Christian nobility.

This action gave rise to a quarrel between the<space/><link><target>Cistercians</target><part>White Monks</part></link><space/>and the Black Monks which lasted 20 years. In May of that year, the pope, supported by the army of Emperor<space/><link><target>Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor</target><part>Lothair III</part></link>, entered Rome, but Lothair, feeling himself too weak to resist the partisans of Anacletus, retired beyond the Alps, and Innocent sought refuge in Pisa in September 1133. Bernard had returned to France in June and was continuing the work of peacemaking which he had commenced in 1130. Towards the end of 1134, he made a second journey into Aquitaine, where William X had relapsed into schism. Bernard invited William to the Mass which he celebrated in the Church of La Couldre. At the<space/><link><target>Eucharist</target></link>, he &quot;admonished the Duke not to despise God as he did His servants&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cedis"></extension><space/>William yielded and the schism ended. Bernard went again to Italy, where<space/><link><target>Roger II of Sicily</target></link><space/>was endeavouring to withdraw the Pisans from their allegiance to Innocent.

For this, he was offered, and he refused, the<space/><link><target>Archbishop of Milan</target><part>archbishopric of Milan</part></link>. He then returned to Clairvaux. Believing himself at last secure in his cloister, Bernard devoted himself with renewed vigour to the composition of the works which would win for him the title of &quot;<link><target>Doctor of the Church</target></link>&quot;. He wrote at this time his sermons on the<space/><italics><link><target>Song of Songs</target></link>.</italics><space/>In 1137, he was again forced to leave his solitude by order of the pope to put an end to the quarrel between Lothair and Roger of Sicily. At the conference held at Palermo, Bernard succeeded in convincing Roger of the rights of Innocent II. He also silenced the final supporters who sustained the schism.

Abelard's treatise on the<space/><link><target>Trinity</target></link><space/>had been condemned as heretical in 1121, and he was compelled to throw his own book into the fire. However, Abelard continued to develop his teachings, which were controversial in some quarters. Bernard, informed of this by<space/><link><target>William of St-Thierry</target></link>, is said to have held a meeting with Abelard intending to persuade him to amend his writings, during which Abelard repented and promised to do so. But once out of Bernard's presence, he reneged.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Evans 2000 p.115 - 123">Evans (2000) p.115 123.</extension><space/>Bernard then denounced Abelard to the pope and cardinals of the<space/><link><target>Roman Curia</target><part>Curia</part></link>. Abelard sought a debate with Bernard, but Bernard initially declined, saying he did not feel matters of such importance should be settled by logical analyses. Bernard's letters to William of St-Thierry also express his apprehension about confronting the preeminent logician. Abelard continued to press for a public debate, and made his challenge widely known, making it hard for Bernard to decline. In 1141, at the urgings of Abelard, the archbishop of Sens called a council of bishops, where Abelard and Bernard were to put their respective cases so Abelard would have a chance to clear his name.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Evans 2000 p.115 - 123"></extension><space/>Bernard lobbied the prelates on the evening before the debate, swaying many of them to his view.
