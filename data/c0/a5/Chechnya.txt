After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Chechen-Ingush ASSR]] was split into two parts: the [[Ingushetia|Republic of Ingushetia]] and the Chechen Republic. The latter proclaimed the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], which sought independence. Following the [[First Chechen War]] with Russia, Chechnya gained ''de facto'' independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Russian federal control was restored during the [[Second Chechen War]]. Since then there has been a systematic reconstruction and rebuilding process, though [[Insurgency in the North Caucasus|sporadic fighting]] continues in the mountains and southern regions of the republic.

==History==
{{Main|History of Chechnya}}

===Origin of Chechnya's population===
According to [[Leonti Mroveli]], the 11th-century Georgian chronicler, the word Caucasian is derived from the [[Nakh peoples|Vainakh]] ancestor [[Caucas|Kavkas]].<ref>The work of Leonti Mroveli: "The history of the Georgian Kings"dealing with the history of Georgia and the [[Caucasus]] since ancient times to the 5th century AD, is included in medieval code of Georgian annals "Kartlis Tskhovreba".</ref>
According to Professor George Anchabadze of [[Ilia State University]] {{quotation|The Vainakhs are the ancient natives of the [[Caucasus]]. It is noteworthy, that according to the genealogical table drawn up by Leonti Mroveli, the legendary forefather of the Vainakhs was "Kavkas", hence the name Kavkasians, one of the ethnicons met in the ancient Georgian written sources, signifying the ancestors of the [[Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]]. As appears from the above, the Vainakhs, at least by name, are presented as the most "Caucasian" people of all the Caucasians (Caucasus – Kavkas – Kavkasians) in the Georgian historical tradition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/1887/ |title=Caucasian Knot &#124; An Essay On the History of the Vainakh People.

Dr. [[Henry Harpending]], University of Utah, supports her claims.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/288/5469/1158.full?sid=b73d602d-8965-4c4a-90ba-26a04c20dab7 |title=Peering Into the Past, With Words}};Bernice Wuethrich, "Science" 2000: Vol. 288 no. 5469 p. 1158</ref>

===Russo-Persian Wars and Caucasian Wars===
{{Tone|section|date=February 2014}}
{{Main|Caucasian War}}

As Russia set off for the first time to increase its political influence in the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] at the expense of [[Safavid Persia]], [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] launched the [[Russo-Persian War (1722–1723)]], in which Russia succeeded in taking much of the Caucasian territories from Iran for several years. Notable in Chechen history, this particular Russo-Persian War marked the first military encounter between Imperial Russia and the [[Vainakh]].<ref name="books.google.nl">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=IGj4B1rdcu0C&pg=PA53&dq=russo+persian+war+1722+vainakh&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=tsibVKDgGoGVaunhgegH&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=russo%20persian%20war%201722%20vainakh&f=false |title=The Insurgency in Chechnya and the North Caucasus: From Gazavat to Jihad |accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref>

As the Russians took control of the Caspian corridor and moved into Persian-ruled [[Dagestan]], Peter's forces ran into mountain tribes. Peter sent a cavalry force to subdue them, but the Chechens routed them.<ref name="books.google.nl" /> In 1732, after Russia already ceded back most of the Caucasus to [[Persia]], now led by [[Nader Shah]], following the [[Treaty of Resht]], Russian troops clashed again with Chechens in a village called Chechen-aul along the [[Argun River (Caucasus)|Argun River]].<ref name="books.google.nl" /> The Russians were defeated again and withdrew, but this battle is responsible for the apocryphal story about how the Nokchi came to be known as "Chechens"-the people ostensibly named for the place the battle had taken place. The name Chechen was however already used since as early as 1692.<ref name="books.google.nl" />

Under intermittent Persian rule since 1555, in 1783 the eastern Georgians of [[Kartl-Kakheti]] led by [[Erekle II]] and Russia signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]]. According to this treaty, Kartl-Kakheti received protection from Russia, and Georgia abjured any dependence on [[Qajar dynasty|Iran]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=dUHhTPdJ6yIC&pg=PT273&lpg=PT273&dq=agha+mohammad+khan+conquer+georgia&source=bl&ots=LsL9F6bJNb&sig=dG6BUw5F3XlWpK38wbHsAhZE54w&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=ASKaVN2hIYX_UuOegbgL&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=agha%20mohammad%20khan%20conquer%20georgia&f=false |title=Iran at War: 1500–1988 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref> In order to increase its influence in the Caucasus and to secure communications with Kartli and other minority Christian regions of the Transcaucasia which it considered useful in its wars against Persia and Turkey, the Russian Empire began conquering the Northern Caucasus mountains. The Russian Empire used Christianity to justify its conquests, allowing Islam to spread widely because it positioned itself as the religion of liberation from tsardom, which viewed Nakh tribes as "bandits".<ref name="ling" /> The rebellion was led by [[Mansur Ushurma]], a Chechen [[Naqshbandi]] ([[Sufi]]) sheikh—with wavering military support from other North Caucasian tribes. Mansur hoped to establish a [[Transcaucasus]] Islamic state under [[shari'a]] law. He was unable to fully achieve this because in the course of the war he was betrayed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], handed over to Russians, and executed in 1794.<ref>John Frederick Baddeley, ''The Russian Conquest of the Caucasus'', London, Curzon Press, 1999, p. 49.</ref>

Following the forced ceding of the current territories of Dagestan, most of [[Azerbaijan]], and Georgia by Persia to Russia, following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)]] and its outcoming [[Treaty of Gulistan]], Russia significantly widened its foothold in the Caucasus at the expense of Persia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Ey63iJcVvbMC&pg=PA56&dq=treaty+of+gulistan+azerbaijan+dagestan&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=gc-bVKX-JMyv7Aa5m4CADw&ved=0CGIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=treaty%20of%20gulistan%20azerbaijan%20dagestan&f=false |title=Russian Imperialism: Development and Crisis |accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref> Another successful Caucasus war against [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] several years later, starting in [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|1826]] and ending in 1828 with the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], and a successful war against [[Ottoman Turkey]] in [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|1828]], enabled Russia to use a much larger portion of its army in subduing the natives of the [[North Caucasus]].

The resistance of the [[Nakh]] tribes never ended and was a fertile ground for a new Muslim-[[Caucasian Avars|Avar]] commander, [[Imam Shamil]], who fought against the Russians from 1834 to 1859 (see [[Murid War]]). In 1859, Shamil was captured by Russians at aul Gunib. Shamil left [[Boysangur Benoiski]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO--iigYIes |title=человек из камня БАЙСАНГУР БЕНОЕВСКИЙ |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-10 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref> a Chechen with one arm, one eye, and one leg, in charge of command at Gunib. Benoiski broke through the siege and continued to fight Russia for another two years until he was captured and killed by Russians. The Russian tsar hoped that by sparing the life of Shamil, the resistance in the North Caucasus would stop, but it did not. Russia began to use a colonization tactic by destroying Nakh settlements and building Cossack defense lines in the lowlands. The Cossacks suffered defeat after defeat, and were constantly attacked by mountaineers, who were robbing them of food and weaponry.

The tsarists' regime used a different approach at the end of the 1860s. They offered Chechens and Ingush to leave the Caucasus for the [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Muhajir (Caucasus)]]). It is estimated that about 80% of Chechens and Ingush left the Caucasus during the deportation. It weakened the resistance which went from open warfare to insurgent warfare. One of the notable Chechen resistance fighters at the end of the 19th century was a Chechen [[abrek]] [[Zelimxan|Zelimkhan Gushmazukaev]] and his comrade-in-arms Ingush abrek [[Sulom-Beck Sagopshinski]]. Together they built up small units which constantly harassed Russian military convoys, government mints, and government post-service, mainly in Ingushetia and Chechnya. Ingush aul Kek was completely burned when the Ingush refused to hand over Zelimkhan. Zelimkhan was killed in the beginning of the 20th century. The war between Nakh tribes and Russia resurfaced during the times of the [[Russian Revolution]], which saw the Nakh struggle against [[Anton Denikin]], and later against the [[Soviet Union]].

===Independent state===
On December&nbsp;21, 1917, [[Ingushetia]], Chechnya, and [[Dagestan]] declared independence from Russia and formed a single state: "United Mountain Dwellers of the North Caucasus" (also known as [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]]) which was recognized by major world powers.  The capital of the new state was moved to Temir-Khan-Shura (Dagestan).<ref>http://1900.ethnia.org/polity.php?ASK_CODE=KC__&ASK_YY=1919&ASK_MM=05&ASK_DD=07&SL=en</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Russia_war.html |title=Russian Civil War Polities |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://savechechnya.com/eng.news/press_1273.htm |title=Общественное движение ЧЕЧЕНСКИЙ КОМИТЕТ НАЦИОНАЛЬНОГО СПАСЕНИЯ |publisher=Savechechnya.com |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref> [[Tapa Tchermoeff|Tapa Chermoyev]], a prominent Chechen statesman, was elected the first prime minister of the state.

In 1921 the Russians attacked and occupied the country and forcefully absorbed it into the Soviet state.

[[File:Map of Mountain ASSR.png|thumb|The [[Mountain ASSR]] and the districts established after the [[Russian Civil War]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} (Chechnya is located on the far right)]]

During the Soviet rule, Chechnya and Ingushetia were combined together to form [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In the 1930s Chechnya was flooded with many Ukrainians fleeing the genocide known as [[Holodomor]]. Despite the threats from the Russian government not to provide food and shelter to starving Ukrainians the rebellious peoples did not follow Russian orders. As the result many of the Ukrainians settled in Chechen-Ingush ASSR on the permanent basis and were able to survive the famine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Umarova |first=Amina |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/chechnya-ukraine-holodomor-survivors/25177285.html |title=Chechnya's Forgotten Children Of The Holodomor |publisher=Rferl.org |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>

The territory of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was divided between [[Stavropol Krai]] (where [[Grozny Okrug]] was formed), the [[Dagestan ASSR]], the [[North Ossetian ASSR]], and the [[Georgian SSR]].

The Chechens and Ingush were allowed to return to their land after 1956 during [[de-Stalinization]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]]<ref name="Encarta 2008" /> when Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was restored but both boundaries and ethnic composition of the territory significantly changed.  There were many (predominantly Russian) migrants from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]], who often settled in the abandoned family homes of Chechens and Ingushes. The republic lost its [[Prigorodny District, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Prigorodny District]] which transferred to North Ossetian ASSR, but gained predominantly Russian [[Naursky District]] and [[Shelkovskoy District]] that is considered the homeland for [[Terek Cossacks]].

The [[Russification]] policies towards Chechens continued after 1956, with [[Russian language]] proficiency required in many aspects of life, and for advancement in the Soviet system.<ref name="ling" />

===Since 1990===
{{History of Chechnya}}

On November&nbsp;26, 1990, the Supreme Council of Chechen-Ingush ASSR adopted the "Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Chechen-Ingush Republic". This declaration was part of the reorganization of the Soviet Union. This new treaty would have been signed August 22, 1991, which would have transformed 15 republic states into more than 80. The August 19–21, [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] led to the abandonment of this reorganization.<ref>James Hughes. "The Peace Process in Chechnya", contained in Richard Sakwa's ''Chechnya: From Past to Future''. Page 271.</ref>

With the impending dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, an independence movement, the [[All-National Congress of the Chechen People|Chechen National Congress]], was formed, led by ex-[[Soviet Air Force]] general and new Chechen President [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]]. It campaigned for the recognition of Chechnya as a separate nation. This movement was opposed by [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s [[Russian Federation]], which argued that Chechnya had not been an independent entity within the Soviet Union—as the Baltic, Central Asian, and other Caucasian States had—but was part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] and hence did not have a right under the Soviet constitution to secede. It also argued that other [[republics of Russia]], such as [[Tatarstan]], would consider seceding from the Russian Federation if Chechnya were granted that right. Finally, it argued that Chechnya was a major hub in the oil infrastructure of the federation and hence its secession would hurt the country's economy and energy access.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the ensuing decade, the territory was locked in an ongoing struggle between various factions, usually fighting unconventionally and forgoing the position held by the several successive Russian governments through the current administration.

====First Chechen War====
{{Main|First Chechen War}}

The First Chechen War took place over a two-year period that lasted from 1994 to 1996, when Russian forces attempted to regain control over Chechnya, which had declared independence in November 1991. Despite overwhelming numerical superiority in men, weaponry, and [[air support]], the Russian forces were unable to establish effective permanent control over the mountainous area due to numerous successful full-scale battles and [[insurgency]] raids. In three months, Russia lost more tanks (over 1,997 tanks) in Grozny than during the [[Battle of Berlin]] in 1945.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/1990s/1998/no-1129-september-1998/book-reviews-chechnya-small-victorious-war-capi |title=Book Reviews: 'Chechnya: A Small Victorious War' & 'Capitalism and Class Struggle in the USSR' &#124; The Socialist Party of Great Britain |publisher=Worldsocialism.org |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>
The [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis]] in 1995 shocked the Russian public and led to international condemnation of the Chechen rebels.

In April 1996 the first democratically elected president of Chechnya, [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]], was killed by two laser guided missiles fired from a warplane which had an equipment of voice recognition and triangulation on Dudayev's position.

The widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of the Russian forces in the area and a successful offensive to re-take Grozny by Chechen resistance forces led by [[Aslan Maskhadov]] prompted [[Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] to declare a ceasefire in 1996, and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later that saw a withdrawal of Russian forces.

====Inter-war period====
{{Main|Chechen Republic of Ichkeria}}

After the war, parliamentary and presidential elections took place in January 1997 in Chechnya and brought to power new President Aslan Maskhadov, chief of staff and prime minister in the Chechen coalition government, for a five-year term. Maskhadov sought to maintain Chechen sovereignty while pressing the Russian government to help rebuild the republic, whose formal economy and infrastructure were virtually destroyed.<ref>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/modules/mod_call_dsp_country-fiw.cfm?year=2003&country=2593 Chechnya, reference article by Freedom House publications.]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> Russia continued to send money for the rehabilitation of the republic; it also provided pensions and funds for schools and hospitals.

President Maskhadov started a major campaign against hostage-takers, and on October 25, 1998, Shadid Bargishev, Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, was killed in a remote-controlled car bombing.  Bargishev's colleagues then insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and would go ahead with their offensive. Political violence and religious extremism, blamed on "[[Wahhabism]]", was rife. In 1998, Grozny authorities declared a [[state of emergency]]. Tensions led to open clashes between the Chechen National Guard and Islamist militants, such as the July 1998 confrontation in Gudermes.

====Second Chechen War====
{{Main|Second Chechen War}}

Much better organized and planned than the first Chechen War, the Russian military took control over most regions. The Russian forces used brutal force, killing 60 Chechen civilians during a mop-up operation in Aldy, Chechnya on February 5, 2000. After the re-capture of [[Grozny]] in February 2000, the Ichkerian regime fell apart.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/chechnya2.htm Second Chechnya War – 1999–2006] Retrieved on April 23, 2013</ref>

In response to the increasing terrorism, Russia tightened its grip on Chechnya and expanded its anti-terrorist operations throughout the region. Russia installed a pro-Russian Chechen regime.

At the end of the Soviet era, ethnic Russians (including Cossacks) comprised about 23% of the population (269,000 in 1989).

According to some Russian sources, from 1991 to 1994 tens of thousands of people of non-Chechen ethnicity (mostly Russians, Ukrainians and Armenians) left the [[republic]] amidst reports of violence and discrimination against the non-Chechen population, as well as widespread lawlessness and ethnic cleansing under the government of [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]].<ref>{{cite web |author=O.P.

However, regarding this exodus, there is an alternative view. According to the Russian economists Boris Lvin and Andrei Iliaronov,

<blockquote>
The Chechen authorities are regularly accused of crimes against the population, especially the Russian-speaking people. However, before the current war the emigration of the Russian-speaking population from Chechnya was no more intense than that from Kalmykia, Tuva and Sakha-Yakutia. In Grozny itself there remained a 200,000 strong Russian-speaking population which did not hasten to leave it.<ref>Written by economists Boris Lvin and [[Andrei Illarionov]]. ''Moscow News''. Feb 24 – March 2, 1995</ref><ref>Note: This source is written in 1995; it should be noted that in the modern day, however, the Russian population is far less than 200000</ref>

The languages used in the Republic are [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Chechen belongs to the Vaynakh or [[North-central Caucasian languages|North-central Caucasian]] language family, which also includes [[Ingush language|Ingush]] and [[Batsb language|Batsb]]. Some scholars place it in a wider [[Iberian-Caucasian languages|Iberian-Caucasian super-family]].

Chechnya has one of the youngest populations in the generally aging Russian Federation; in the early 1990s, it was among the few regions experiencing natural population growth. Since 2002, Chechnya has experienced a classic post-conflict baby-boom.<ref name=Fuller>{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Preliminary_Chechen_Census_Findings_Unveiled/2209723.html |title=Preliminary Chechen Census Findings Unveiled |author=Liz Fuller |date=3 November 2010 |work= |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> Chechen demographers in 2008 termed highly implausible the reported overall population growth as infant mortality in Chechnya was said to be 60 percent higher than the Russian average in 2007 and to have risen by 3.9 percent compared with 2006.<ref name=Fuller /> Many experts have expressed doubts about the increase from 1.1 million in the 1990 to an estimated nearly 1.3 million in 2010 following two devastating wars that displaced hundreds of thousands people and virtually eliminated the large ethnic Russian minority in the republic.<ref name="Dzutsev" /> According to Russian demographer Dmitry Bogoyavlensky, the 2002 census results were clearly manipulated in the North Caucasus: an estimated 800,000 to 1 million non-existent people were added to the actual population of the region.<ref name=Dzutsev /> Another Russian demographer, Anatoly Vishnevsky, pointed out that according to the 2002 census, some age groups, like those born in 1950, appeared to be larger in 2002 than in 1989.<ref name=Dzutsev /> With the 2002 census, Moscow wanted to show there were not too many casualties and that the refugees had returned to Chechnya, while the local authorities wanted to receive more funds and thus needed a higher population to justify their demands.<ref name=Dzutsev /> Also, in the multiethnic republics of North Caucasus normally unlike in other parts of Russia, government positions are distributed among the ethnicities according to their ratio in the general population.<ref name=Dzutsev /> So ethnicities are zealously guarding their numbers in order not to be outnumbered by others and thereby left with less representation in the government and the local economy.<ref name=Dzutsev /> Some 40 percent of newborns had some kind of genetic defect.<ref name=Fuller />

===Religion===
[[File:Achmat-Kadyrow-Mosche, Grosny 2.jpg|thumb|[[Akhmad Kadyrov Mosque]] in Grozny]]

[[Islam]] is the predominant religion in Chechnya. Chechens are overwhelmingly adherents to the [[Shafi'i]] [[Madhhab]] of Sunni Islam,<ref>http://www.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/ponars/pm_0388.pdf</ref> the republic having converted to Islam between the 16th and the 19th centuries.

In August 2011, Archbishop Zosima of [[Vladikavkaz]] and [[Makhachkala]] performed the first mass [[baptism]] ceremony in the history of Chechen republic in the [[Terek River]] of [[Naursky District]] in which 35 citizens of Naursky and Shelkovsky districts were converted to Orthodoxy.<ref>Interfax Information Services Group.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Chechnya}}

Since 1990, the Chechen Republic has had many legal, military, and civil conflicts involving separatist movements and pro-Russian authorities. Today, Chechnya is a relatively stable [[federal republic]], although there is still some separatist movement activity. Its regional constitution entered into effect on April 2, 2003 after an all-Chechen referendum was held on March 23, 2003. Some Chechens were controlled by regional [[teip]]s, or clans, despite the existence of pro- and anti-Russian political structures.

===Regional government===
[[File:Chechnya and Caucasus.png|thumb|300px|Chechnya and Caucasus map]]

The former separatist religious leader (mufti) [[Akhmad Kadyrov]], looked upon as a traitor by many separatists, was elected president with 83% of the vote in an internationally monitored election on October 5, 2003. Incidents of [[ballot stuffing]] and voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of separatist parties from the polls were subsequently reported by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) monitors. On May 9, 2004, Kadyrov was assassinated in Grozny football stadium by a [[land mine|landmine]] explosion that was planted beneath a VIP stage and detonated during a parade, and [[Sergey Abramov]] was appointed to the position of acting prime minister after the incident. However, since 2005 [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] (son of Akhmad Kadyrov) has been caretaker prime minister, and in 2007 was appointed a new president. Many allege he is the wealthiest and most powerful man in the republic, with control over a large private militia referred to as the ''[[Kadyrovtsy]]''. The militia, which began as his father's security force, has been accused of killings and kidnappings by human rights organizations such as [[Human Rights Watch]].

In 2009, the American organization [[Freedom House]] included Chechnya in the "Worst of the Worst" list of most repressive societies in the world, together with [[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], and others.<ref>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/WoW09/WOW%202009.pdf Worst of the Worst: The World's Most Repressive Societies] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]), ''[[Freedom House]]'', March 2009 {{wayback|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/WoW09/WOW%202009.pdf |date=20141223160752 }}</ref>

===Separatist government===
[[File:Shamil Basaev.jpg|thumb|[[Shamil Basayev]], Chechen militant [[Islamist]] and a leader of the Chechen rebel movement]]
[[File:Vladimir Putin 8 November 2000-1.jpg|thumb|Russian President [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] and [[Akhmad Kadyrov]], former separatist and [[head of the Chechen Republic]]]]
In addition to the Russian regional government, there was a separatist Ichkeria government that was not recognized by any state (although members have been given political asylum in European and Arab countries, as well as the United States).

Ichkeria is/was a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]]. Former president of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] deposed in a military coup of 1991 and a participant of the [[Georgian Civil War]], recognised the independence of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in 1993.<ref name="test">[http://pirweli.com.ge/eng/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3399&Itemid=45 in 1993, ex –President of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia recognized Chechnya ` s independence..], {{wayback|url=http://pirweli.com.ge/eng/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3399&Itemid=45 |date=20130821134007 }}</ref>  Diplomatic relations with Ichkeria were also established by the partially recognized [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] under the [[Taliban]] government on January 16, 2000. This recognition ceased with the fall of the Taliban in 2001.<ref>[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/5597-11.cfm Are Chechens in Afghanistan?] – By Nabi Abdullaev, Dec 14, 2001 Moscow Times</ref> However, despite Taliban recognition, there were no friendly relations between the Taliban and Ichkeria—Maskhadov rejected their recognition, stating that the Taliban were illegitimate.<ref name="Kullberg">Kullberg, Anssi. "The Background of Chechen Independence Movement III: The Secular Movement". ''The Eurasian politician''. 1 October 2003</ref> Ichkeria also received vocal support from the Baltic countries, a group of Ukrainian nationalists and Poland; Estonia once voted to recognize, but the act never was followed through due to pressure applied by both Russia and the EU.<ref name="Kullberg" /><ref>Kari Takamaa and Martti Koskenneimi.

''Central Asian Survey'', Volume 14, Issue 4 1995, pages 553–572</ref>

The president of this government was Aslan Maskhadov, the Foreign Minister was [[Ilyas Akhmadov]], who was the spokesman for Maskhadov. Aslan Maskhadov had been elected in an internationally monitored election in 1997 for 4 years, which took place after signing a peace agreement with Russia. In 2001 he issued a decree prolonging his office for one additional year; he was unable to participate in the 2003 presidential election, since separatist parties were barred by the Russian government, and Maskhadov faced accusations of terrorist offences in Russia. Maskhadov left Grozny and moved to the separatist-controlled areas of the south at the onset of the [[Second Chechen War]]. Maskhadov was unable to influence a number of warlords who retain effective control over Chechen territory, and his power was diminished as a result. Russian forces killed Maskhadov on March 8, 2005, and the assassination of Maskhadov was widely criticized since it left no legitimate Chechen separatist leader with whom to conduct peace talks. [[Akhmed Zakayev]], Deputy Prime Minister and a Foreign Minister under Maskhadov, was appointed shortly after the 1997 election and is currently living under asylum in [[England]]. He and others chose [[Abdul Khalim Saidullayev]], a relatively unknown Islamic judge who was previously the host of an Islamic program on Chechen television, to replace Maskhadov following his death. On June 17, 2006, it was reported that Russian special forces killed Abdul Khalim Saidullayev in a raid in a Chechen town Argun.

The successor of Saidullayev became [[Doku Umarov]]. On October 31, 2007 Umarov abolished the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] and its presidency and in its place proclaimed the [[Caucasian Emirate]] with himself as its [[Emir]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itstime.it/Commenti/CaucEmiri.pdf |title=What is Hidden Behind the Idea of the Caucasian Emirate? |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref> This change of status has been rejected by many Chechen politicians and military leaders who continue to support the existence of the republic.

==Human rights==
[[File:Mass grave in Chechnya.jpg|thumb|[[Mass graves in Chechnya|Mass grave in Chechnya]] (2000)]]
 
In 2006 [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that pro-Moscow Chechen forces under the command, in effect, of chapter of republic [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], as well as federal police personnel, used torture to get information about separatist forces. "If you are detained in Chechnya, you face a real and immediate risk of torture. And there is little chance that your torturer will be held accountable", said Holly Cartner, Director Europe and Central Asia division of HRW.<ref>[[Human Rights Watch]]:[http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/11/12/chechnya-research-shows-widespread-and-systematic-use-torture Chechnya: Research Shows Widespread and Systematic Use of Torture]</ref>

Human rights groups criticized the conduct of the 2005 parliamentary elections as unfairly influenced by the central Russian government and military.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5028949 Chechnya Holds Parliamentary Vote], Morning Edition, NPR, November 28, 2005.</ref>

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reports that after hundreds of thousands of [[Caucasus Russians|ethnic Russians]] and Chechens fled their homes following inter-ethnic and [[Separatism|separatist]] conflicts in Chechnya in 1994 and 1999, more than 150,000 people still remain displaced in Russia today.<ref>[http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpCountrySummaries)/441ED4F5458A7C1DC125733600369629?OpenDocument&count=10000 Government efforts help only some IDPs rebuild their lives], IDMC, August 13, 2007 {{wayback|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpCountrySummaries)/441ED4F5458A7C1DC125733600369629?OpenDocument&count=10000 |date=20130821165016 }}</ref>

On September&nbsp;1, 1997, Criminal Code reportedly being implemented in the Chechen Republic-Ichkeriya, Article 148 punishes "anal sexual intercourse between a man and a woman or a man and a man". For first- and second-time offenders, the punishment is caning. A third conviction leads to the death penalty, which can be carried out in a number of ways including stoning or beheading.<ref>[[Amnesty International]]:[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR040091997?open&of=ENG-AZE Amnesty International working against laws punishing sexual relations between men], September 1, 1997.</ref>

On February&nbsp;1, 2009, the ''[[New York Times]]'' released extensive evidence to support allegations of consistent torture and executions under the Kadyrov government. The accusations were sparked by the assassination in Austria of a former Chechen rebel who had gained access to Kadyrov's inner circle, 27-year-old [[Umar Israilov]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Chivers |first=C.&nbsp;J. |title=Slain Exile Detailed Cruelty of the Ruler of Chechnya |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/world/europe/01torture.html?_r=0&pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=31 January 2009}}</ref>

On July&nbsp;1, 2009, [[Amnesty International]] released a detailed report covering the human rights violations committed by the [[Russian Federation]] against Chechen citizens. Among the most prominent features was that those abused had no method of redress against assaults, ranging from kidnapping to torture, while those responsible were never held accountable. This led to the conclusion that Chechnya was being ruled without law, being run into further devastating destabilization.<ref>[[Amnesty International]]:[http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR46/012/2009/en/66cda198-85c0-452c-a2c5-98cac593a990/eur460122009en.pdfl Russian Federation Rule Without Law: Human Rights violations in the North Caucasus], July 1, 2009.</ref>

On March&nbsp;10, 2011, [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that since Chechenization, the government has pushed for enforced Islamic dress code and other traditions which violently repress women.<ref>[[Human Rights Watch]]:[http://www.hrw.org/print/reports/2011/03/10/you-dress-according-their-rules “You Dress According to Their Rules” Enforcement of an Islamic Dress Code for Women in Chechnya], March 10, 2011</ref> The president [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] is quoted as saying "I have the right to criticize my wife. She doesn’t. With us [in Chechen society], a wife is a [[housewife]]. A woman should know her place. A woman should give her love to us [men]... She would be [man’s] property. And the man is the owner. Here, if a woman does not behave properly, her husband, father, and brother are responsible. According to our tradition, if a woman fools around, her family members kill her... That’s how it happens, a brother kills his sister or a husband kills his wife... As a president, I cannot allow for them to kill. So, let women not wear shorts...".<ref>Interview with Ramzan Kadyrov, Komsomolskaya Pravda, September 24, 2008, http://www.kp.ru/daily/24169/380743/ (accessed December 7, 2010)</ref> He has also openly defended [[honor killing]]s on several occasions.<ref>[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?story_id=28409&action_id=2 Chechen President Kadyrov Defends Honor Killings] [[St. Petersburg Times]] March&nbsp;3, 2009</ref>

==Economy==
During the war, the Chechen economy fell apart. [[Gross domestic product]], if reliably calculable, would be only a fraction of the prewar level.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In 1994, the separatists planned to introduce a new currency, but that did not happen due to Russian troops re-taking Chechnya in the [[Second Chechen War]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  As an effect of the war, approximately 80% of the economic potential of Chechnya was destroyed.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The economic situation in Chechnya has improved considerably since 2000. According to the ''New York Times'', major efforts to rebuild Grozny have been made, and improvements in the political situation have led some officials to consider setting up a tourism industry, though there are claims that construction workers are being irregularly paid and that poor people have been displaced.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/world/europe/30grozny.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Chechnya's Capital Rises From the Ashes, Atop Hidden Horrors |first=Andrew E. |last=Kramer |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref>

According to estimates, the number of Chechnya's unemployed will fall to 170,000 people by January 1, 2013, while the number in 2008 was 298,500.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20121217/178215748.html |title=Chechnya’s Unemployment Plummets 40% |date=2012-12-17}}</ref>
