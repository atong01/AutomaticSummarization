'''Concrete''' is a [[composite material]] composed of [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] bonded together with a fluid [[cement]] which hardens over time. Most use of the term "concrete" refers to [[Portland cement]] concrete or to concretes made with other [[hydraulic cement]]s, such as [[calcium aluminate cements|ciment fondu]]. However, road surfaces are also a type of concrete, "asphaltic concrete", where the cement material is [[bitumen]].

In Portland cement concrete (and other hydraulic cement concretes), when the aggregate is mixed together with the dry cement and water, they form a fluid mass that is easily molded into shape. The cement reacts chemically with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix which binds all the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses.<ref>Zongjin Li; ''Advanced concrete technology''; 2011</ref> Often, additives (such as [[pozzolan]]s or [[superplasticizer]]s) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material. Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials (such as [[rebar]]) embedded to provide [[tensile strength]], yielding [[reinforced concrete]].

Famous concrete structures include the [[Hoover Dam]], the [[Panama Canal]] and the Roman [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. The earliest large-scale users of concrete technology were the [[ancient Romans]], and concrete was widely used in the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Colosseum]] in Rome was built largely of concrete, and the concrete dome of the Pantheon is the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.romanconcrete.com/docs/chapt01/chapt01.htm |title=The Pantheon |first=David |last=Moore |work=romanconcrete.com |date=1999|accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> Today, large concrete structures (for example, [[dam]]s and multi-storey car parks) are usually made with reinforced concrete.

After the Roman Empire collapsed, use of concrete became rare until the technology was redeveloped in the mid-18th century. Today, concrete is the most widely used man-made material (measured by tonnage).

== History ==
The word concrete comes from the Latin word "''concretus''" (meaning compact or condensed),<ref>{{cite web|title=concretus|url=http://latinlookup.com/word/12124/concretus|publisher=Latin Lookup |accessdate=1 October 2012 }}</ref> the perfect passive participle of "''concrescere''", from "''con''-" (together) and "''crescere''" (to grow).

Perhaps the earliest known occurrence of cement was twelve million years ago.  A deposit of cement was formed after an occurrence of oil shale located adjacent to a bed of limestone burned due to natural causes.  These ancient deposits were investigated in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=MAST>{{cite web|title=The History of Concrete|url=http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/hist.html|publisher=Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>

On a human time-scale, small usages of concrete go back for thousands of years.  The ancient [[Nabatea]] culture was using materials roughly analogous to concrete at least eight thousand years ago, some structures of which survive to this day.<ref name="nachi.org">From The History of Concrete - InterNACHI http://www.nachi.org/history-of-concrete.htm#ixzz31V47Zuuj</ref>

The Romans used concrete extensively from 300 BC to 476 AD, a span of more than seven hundred years.<ref name=MAST />  During the [[Roman Empire]], [[Roman concrete]] (or ''[[opus caementicium]]'') was made from [[quicklime]], [[pozzolana]] and an aggregate of [[pumice]]. Its widespread use in many [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman structures]], a key event in the [[history of architecture]] termed the [[Roman Architectural Revolution]], freed [[Roman engineering|Roman construction]] from the restrictions of stone and brick material and allowed for revolutionary new designs in terms of both structural complexity and dimension.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Lancaster| first = Lynne| title = Concrete Vaulted Construction in Imperial Rome. Innovations in Context| publisher=Cambridge University Press| date = 2005| isbn = 978-0-511-16068-4}}</ref>

<blockquote>Concrete, as the Romans knew it, was a new and revolutionary material. Laid in the shape of [[arch]]es, [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] and [[List of Roman domes|domes]], it quickly hardened into a rigid mass, free from many of the internal thrusts and strains that troubled the builders of similar structures in stone or brick.<ref>D.S.

Ce.memphis.edu. Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref>

<blockquote>Modern structural concrete differs from Roman concrete in two important details. First, its mix consistency is fluid and homogeneous, allowing it to be poured into forms rather than requiring hand-layering together with the placement of aggregate, which, in Roman practice, often consisted of [[rubble]]. Second, integral reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension, whereas Roman concrete could depend only upon the strength of the concrete bonding to resist tension.<ref>Robert Mark, Paul Hutchinson: "On the Structure of the Roman Pantheon", ''Art Bulletin'', Vol. 68, No. 1 (1986), p. 26, fn. 5</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Smeaton's Lighthouse00.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|<center>Smeaton's Tower</center>]]

The widespread use of concrete in many Roman structures ensured that many survive to the present day. The [[Baths of Caracalla]] in Rome are just one example. Many [[Roman aqueduct]]s and bridges such as the magnificent [[Pont du Gard]] have masonry cladding on a concrete core, as does the dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].

After the Roman Empire, the use of burned lime and pozzolana was greatly reduced until the technique was all but forgotten between 500 and the 14th century. From the 14th century to the mid-18th century, the use of cement gradually returned. The ''[[Canal du Midi]]'' was built using concrete in 1670,<ref>{{Wayback |date=20100505160054 |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/2/0/1/2/p20122_index.html |title=The Politics of Rediscovery in the History of Science: Tacit Knowledge of Concrete before its Discovery }}. allacademic.com</ref> and there are concrete structures in Finland that date from the 16th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Perhaps the greatest driver behind the modern usage of concrete was [[Smeaton's Tower]], the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] in Devon, England. To create this structure, between 1756 and 1759, British engineer [[John Smeaton]] pioneered the use of [[hydraulic lime]] in concrete, using pebbles and powdered brick as aggregate.<ref name=InterNACHI>{{cite web|title=the History of Concrete|url=http://www.nachi.org/history-of-concrete.htm|publisher=The International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI)|author=Nick Gromicko|author2=Kenton Shepard|last-author-amp=yes|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>

===Ancient additives===
Concrete like materials were used since 6500BC by the Nabataea traders or Bedouins who occupied and controlled a series of oases and developed a small empire in the regions of southern Syria and northern Jordan. They discovered the advantages of hydraulic lime, with some self-cementing properties by 700 BC.  They built kilns to supply mortar for the construction of rubble-wall houses, concrete floors, and underground waterproof cisterns. The cisterns were kept secret and were one of the reasons the Nabataea were able to thrive in the desert.<ref name="nachi.org"/>

In both Roman and Egyptian times it was re-discovered that adding [[Pozzolan|volcanic ash]] to the mix allowed it to set underwater. Similarly, the Romans knew that adding [[Horsehair|horse hair]] made concrete less liable to crack while it hardened, and adding blood made it more frost-resistant.<ref>[http://www.djc.com/special/concrete/10003364.htm Brief history of concrete].

==Composition of concrete==

There are many [[types of concrete]] available, created by varying the proportions of the main ingredients below. In this way or by substitution for the cementitious and aggregate phases, the finished product can be tailored to its application with varying strength, density, or chemical and thermal resistance properties.

[[#Aggregates|Aggregate]] consists of large chunks of material in a concrete mix, generally a coarse gravel or crushed rocks such as [[limestone]], or [[granite]], along with finer materials such as [[sand]].

[[#Cement|Cement]], most commonly [[Portland cement]], is associated with the general term "concrete."  A range of materials can be used as the cement in concrete.  One of the most familiar of these alternative cements is [[asphalt]]. Other cementitious materials such as [[fly ash]] and [[slag cement]], are sometimes added as mineral admixtures (see below) - either pre-blended with the cement or directly as a concrete component - and become a part of the binder for the aggregate.

[[Water]] is then mixed with this dry powder/aggregate blend, which produces a semi-liquid that workers can shape (typically by pouring it into a form). The concrete solidifies and hardens through a [[Chemical reaction|chemical process]] called [[mineral hydration|hydration]]. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other components together, creating a robust stone-like material.

[[#Chemical admixtures|Chemical admixtures]] are added to achieve varied properties. These ingredients may accelerate or slow down the rate at which the concrete hardens, and impart many other useful properties including increased tensile strength, entrainment of air, and/or water resistance.

[[#Reinforcement|Reinforcement]] is often included in concrete.  Concrete can be formulated with high [[compressive strength]], but always has lower [[tensile strength]].  For this reason it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension (often [[steel]]).

[[#Mineral admixtures and blended cements|Mineral admixtures]] are becoming more popular in recent decades. The use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation, and the discovery that such materials often have complementary and valuable properties. The most conspicuous of these are [[fly ash]], a by-product of [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plants]], [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]], and [[silica fume]], a byproduct of industrial [[electric arc furnace]]s. The use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required, as the mineral admixtures act as a partial cement replacement. This displaces some cement production, an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process, while reducing the amount of industrial waste that must be disposed of.

The ''[[types of concrete#Mix design|mix design]]'' depends on the type of structure being built, how the concrete is mixed and delivered, and how it is placed to form the structure.

===Cement===
{{main|Cement}}

[[File:Stockage de ciments.JPG|thumb|A few tons of bagged cement.  This amount represents about two minutes of output from a 10,000 ton per day cement kiln.]]

Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic ingredient of concrete, [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[plaster]]. English masonry worker [[Joseph Aspdin]] patented Portland cement in 1824. It was named because of the similarity of its color to [[Portland stone|Portland limestone]], quarried from the English [[Isle of Portland]] and used extensively in London architecture. It consists of a mixture of oxides of [[calcium oxide|calcium]], [[silicon dioxide|silicon]] and [[aluminium oxide|aluminium]]. Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating [[limestone]] (a source of calcium) with clay and grinding this product (called ''[[clinker (cement)|clinker]]'') with a source of [[sulfate]] (most commonly [[gypsum]]).

In modern [[cement kiln]]s many advanced features are used to lower the fuel consumption per ton of clinker produced.  Cement kilns are extremely large, complex, and inherently dusty industrial installations, and have emissions which must be controlled. Of the [[Rawmill|various ingredients]] used in concrete the cement is the most energetically expensive.  Even complex and efficient kilns require 3.3 to 3.6 gigajoules of energy to produce a ton of clinker and then [[Cement mill|grind it into cement]].  Many kilns can be fueled with difficult-to-dispose-of wastes, the most common being used tires.  The extremely high temperatures and long periods of time at those temperatures allows cement kilns to efficiently and completely burn even difficult-to-use fuels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cement Production|url=http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/E-TechDS/PDF/I03_cement_June%202010_GS-gct.pdf|publisher=IEA ETSAP- Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme|accessdate=9 January 2013|author=Evelien Cochez|author2=Wouter Nijs|last-author-amp=yes|author3=Giorgio Simbolotti|author4=Giancarlo Tosato|location=IEA ETSAP – Technology Brief I03 – June 2010}}</ref>

===Water===
Combining [[water]] with a cementitious material forms a cement paste by the process of hydration. The cement paste glues the aggregate together, fills voids within it, and makes it flow more freely.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gibbons|first=Jack|title=Measuring Water in Concrete|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/concrete-construction/measuring-water-in-concrete.aspx|publisher=Concrete Construction|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>

A lower water-to-cement ratio yields a stronger, more durable concrete, whereas more water gives a freer-flowing concrete with a higher [[Workability|slump]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CHAPTER 9 Designing and Proportioning Normal Concrete Mixtures|url=http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1112/notes/project_2/PCA_manual/Chap09.pdf|work=PCA manual|publisher=Portland Concrete Association|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref> Impure water used to make concrete can cause problems when setting or in causing premature failure of the structure.<ref>{{cite web|last=Taha|first=Ramzi A.|title=Use of Production and Brackish Water in Concrete Mixtures|url=http://www.iasks.org/sites/default/files/swes20100102039043.pdf|work=Int. J. of Sustainable Water and Environmental System|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>

Hydration involves many different reactions, often occurring at the same time. As the reactions proceed, the products of the cement hydration process gradually bond together the individual sand and gravel particles and other components of the concrete to form a solid mass.<ref name=Hydration>{{cite web|title=Cement hydration|url=http://www.understanding-cement.com/hydration.html|publisher=Understanding Cement|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>

===Aggregates===
[[File:Gravel 03375C.JPG|thumbnail|right|Crushed stone aggregate]]

{{main|Construction aggregate}}

Fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture. [[Sand]], natural gravel, and [[crushed stone]] are used mainly for this purpose. Recycled aggregates (from construction, demolition, and excavation waste) are increasingly used as partial replacements of natural aggregates, while a number of manufactured aggregates, including air-cooled [[blast furnace]] slag and [[bottom ash]] are also permitted.

The presence of aggregate greatly increases the durability of concrete above that of cement, which is a brittle material in its pure state.  Thus concrete is a true composite material.<ref>[http://www.engr.psu.edu/ce/courses/ce584/concrete/library/materials/Aggregate/Aggregatesmain.htm The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete]. Engr.psu.edu. Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref>

Redistribution of aggregates after compaction often creates inhomogeneity due to the influence of vibration. This can lead to strength gradients.<ref>{{Cite conference| first = Vitaliy I.| last = Veretennykov| first2 = Anatoliy M.| last2 = Yugov| first3 = Andriy O.| last3 = Dolmatov| first4 = Maksym S.| last4 = Bulavytskyi| first5 = Dmytro I.| last5 = Kukharev| first6 = Artem S.| last6 = Bulavytskyi| editor = Mohammed Ettouney| isbn = 978-0-7844-1002-8| title = Concrete Inhomogeneity of Vertical Cast-in-Place Elements in Skeleton-Type Buildings| booktitle = AEI 2008: Building Integration Solutions

Decorative stones such as [[quartzite]], small river stones or crushed glass are sometimes added to the surface of concrete for a decorative "exposed aggregate" finish, popular among landscape designers.

In addition to being decorative, exposed aggregate adds robustness to a concrete driveway.<ref>[http://www.uniquepaving.com.au/exposed_aggregate.htm Exposed Aggregate]. Uniquepaving.com.au. Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref>

===Reinforcement===

{{main|reinforced concrete}}

Concrete is strong in [[compression (physical)|compression]], as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load. However, it is weak in [[Tension (physics)|tension]] as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack, allowing the structure to fail. [[Reinforced concrete]] adds either [[rebar|steel reinforcing bars]], steel fibers, glass fibers, or plastic fibers to carry [[tension (physics)|tensile loads]].

===Chemical admixtures===
''[[Chemistry|Chemical]] admixtures'' are materials in the form of powder or fluids that are added to the concrete to give it certain characteristics not obtainable with plain concrete mixes. In normal use, admixture dosages are less than 5% by mass of cement and are added to the concrete at the time of batching/mixing.<ref name = "FHWA Admixtures">{{cite web | author=U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Admixtures | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/admixture.html | accessdate =25 January 2007 | date = 14 June 1999}}</ref> (See the section on Concrete Production, below.)The common types of admixtures<ref>{{cite web | author=Cement Admixture Association | url = http://www.admixtures.org.uk/types.asp | title = Admixture Types | accessdate =25 December 2010}}</ref> are as follows.
* [[Accelerant|Accelerators]] speed up the hydration (hardening) of the concrete. Typical materials used are [[calcium chloride|{{chem|CaCl|2}}]], [[Calcium nitrate|Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Sodium nitrate|NaNO<sub>3</sub>]]. However, use of chlorides may cause corrosion in steel reinforcing and is prohibited in some countries, so that nitrates may be favored. Accelerating admixtures are especially useful for modifying the properties of concrete in cold weather.
* [[Retarder (chemistry)|Retarders]] slow the hydration of concrete and are used in large or difficult pours where partial setting before the pour is complete is undesirable. Typical [[polyol]] retarders are [[sugar]], [[sucrose]], [[sodium gluconate]], [[glucose]], [[citric acid]], and [[tartaric acid]].
* [[Air entrainment|Air entraining agents]] add and entrain tiny air bubbles in the concrete, which reduces damage during [[Weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles, increasing durability. However, entrained air entails a trade off with strength, as each 1% of air may decrease compressive strength 5%.{{citation needed|date= October 2014}} If too much air becomes trapped in the concrete as a result of the mixing process, [[Defoamer]]s can be used to encourage the air bubble to agglomerate, rise to the surface of the wet concrete and then disperse.
* [[Plasticizer]]s increase the workability of plastic or "fresh" concrete, allowing it be placed more easily, with less consolidating effort. A typical plasticizer is lignosulfonate. Plasticizers can be used to reduce the water content of a concrete while maintaining workability and are sometimes called ''water-reducers'' due to this use. Such treatment improves its strength and durability characteristics. [[Superplasticizer]]s (also called ''high-range water-reducers'') are a class of plasticizers that have fewer deleterious effects and can be used to increase workability more than is practical with traditional plasticizers. Compounds used as superplasticizers include sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensate, sulfonated melamine formaldehyde condensate, acetone formaldehyde condensate and polycarboxylate ethers.
* [[Pigment]]s can be used to change the color of concrete, for aesthetics.
* [[Corrosion inhibitor]]s are used to minimize the corrosion of steel and steel bars in concrete.
* Bonding agents are used to create a bond between old and new concrete (typically a type of polymer) with wide temperature tolerance and corrosion resistance.
* Pumping aids improve pumpability, thicken the paste and reduce separation and bleeding.

* [[Fly ash]]: A by-product of coal-fired [[power station|electric generating plants]], it is used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 60% by mass).

==Concrete production==
[[File:Concrete plant in Mansfield, Ohio.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Concrete plant]] facility showing a [[Concrete mixer]] being filled from the ingredient silos.]]

Concrete production is the process of mixing together the various ingredients—water, aggregate, cement, and any additives—to produce concrete.  Concrete production is time-sensitive. Once the ingredients are mixed, workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens.  In modern usage, most concrete production takes place in a large type of industrial facility called a [[concrete plant]], or often a batch plant.

In general usage, concrete plants come in two main types, ready mix plants and central mix plants.  A ready mix plant mixes all the ingredients except water, while a central mix plant mixes all the ingredients including water.  A central mix plant offers more accurate control of the concrete quality through better measurements of the amount of water added, but must be placed closer to the work site where the concrete will be used, since hydration begins at the plant.

A concrete plant consists of large storage hoppers for various reactive ingredients like cement, storage for bulk ingredients like aggregate and water, mechanisms for the addition of various additives and amendments, machinery to accurately weigh, move, and mix some or all of those ingredients, and facilities to dispense the mixed concrete, often to a [[concrete mixer]] truck.

Modern concrete is usually prepared as a viscous fluid, so that it may be poured into forms, which are containers erected in the field to give the concrete its desired shape.  There are many different ways in which concrete [[formwork]] can be prepared, such as [[Slip forming]] and [[Steel plate construction]].  Alternatively, concrete can be mixed into dryer, non-fluid forms and used in factory settings to manufacture [[Precast concrete]] products.

There is a wide variety of equipment for processing concrete, from hand tools to heavy industrial machinery.  Whichever equipment builders use, however, the objective is to produce the desired building material; ingredients must be properly mixed, placed, shaped, and retained within time constraints.  Once the mix is where it should be, the curing process must be controlled to ensure that the concrete attains the desired attributes. During concrete preparation, various technical details may affect the quality and nature of the product.

When initially mixed, Portland cement and water rapidly form a [[gel]] of tangled chains of interlocking crystals, and components of the gel continue to react over time. Initially the gel is fluid, which improves workability and aids in placement of the material, but as the concrete sets, the chains of crystals join into a rigid structure, counteracting the fluidity of the gel and fixing the particles of aggregate in place. During curing, the cement continues to react with the residual water in a process of [[hydration reaction|hydration]]. In properly formulated concrete, once this curing process has terminated the product has the desired physical and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Among the qualities typically desired, are [[Strength of materials|mechanical strength]], low moisture permeability, and chemical and volumetric stability.

===Mixing concrete===
{{See also|Volumetric concrete mixer|Concrete mixer}}
Thorough mixing is essential for the production of uniform, high-quality concrete. For this reason equipment and methods should be capable of effectively mixing concrete materials containing the largest specified aggregate to produce ''uniform mixtures'' of the lowest slump practical for the work.

''Separate paste mixing'' has shown that the mixing of cement and water into a paste before combining these materials with [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] can increase the [[compressive strength]] of the resulting concrete.<ref>[http://www.concreteinternational.com/pages/featured_article.asp?ID=3491 Premixed cement paste]. Concreteinternational.com (1989-11-01). Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref> The paste is generally mixed in a ''high-speed'', shear-type mixer at a [[Water-cement ratio|w/cm]] (water to cement ratio) of 0.30 to 0.45 by mass. The cement paste premix may include admixtures such as accelerators or retarders, [[Plasticizer|superplasticizers]], [[pigment]]s, or [[silica fume]]. The premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water and final mixing is completed in conventional concrete mixing equipment.<ref>[http://www.concrete.org/COMMITTEES/committeehome.asp?committee_code=0000304-00 Measuring, mixing, transporting and placing concrete].

===Workability===
[[File:Concreteathruz.jpg|thumb|Pouring and smoothing out concrete at Palisades Park in Washington DC.]]

{{Main|Concrete slump test}}

''Workability'' is the ability of a fresh (plastic) concrete mix to fill the form/mold properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of [[hydration reaction|hydration]]) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding and/or [[Segregation in concrete|segregation of aggregates]] (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water.

Workability can be measured by the [[concrete slump test]], a simplistic measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the [[ASTM]] C 143 or EN 12350-2 test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an "[[Duff Abrams|Abrams cone]]" with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level, non-absorptive surface. It is then filled in three layers of equal volume, with each layer being tamped with a steel rod to consolidate the layer. When the cone is carefully lifted off, the enclosed material slumps a certain amount, owing to gravity. A relatively dry sample slumps very little, having a slump value of one or two inches (25 or 50&nbsp;mm) out of one foot (305&nbsp;mm). A relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as eight inches. Workability can also be measured by the [[flow table test]].

Slump can be increased by addition of chemical admixtures such as plasticizer or [[superplasticizer]] without changing the [[water-cement ratio]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ferrari|first1=L|last2=Kaufmann|first2=J|last3=Winnefeld|first3=F|last4=Plank|first4=J|title=Multi-method approach to study influence of superplasticizers on cement suspensions|journal=Cement and Concrete Research|volume=41|page=1058|date=2011|doi=10.1016/j.cemconres.2011.06.010|issue=10}}</ref> Some other admixtures, especially air-entraining admixture, can increase the slump of a mix.

High-flow concrete, like [[self-consolidating concrete]], is tested by other flow-measuring methods. One of these methods includes placing the cone on the narrow end and observing how the mix flows through the cone while it is gradually lifted.

After mixing, concrete is a fluid and can be pumped to the location where needed.

===Curing===
[[File:Curing-concrete.jpg|thumb|A concrete slab ponded while curing.]]

A common misconception is that concrete dries as it sets, but the opposite is true -  damp concrete sets better than dry concrete. In other words, cement is "hydraulic": water allows it to gains strength.  Too much water is counterproductive but too little water is deleterious. Curing allows concrete to achieve optimal strength and hardness.<ref>"Curing Concrete" Peter C. Taylor CRC Press 2013. ISBN 978-0-415-77952-4. eBook ISBN 978-0-203-86613-9</ref> Curing is the hydration process that occurs after the concrete has been placed. In chemical terms, curing allows calcium-silicate hydrate (C-S-H) to form.  To gain strength and harden fully, concrete curing requires time, initially setting and becoming rigid though very weak and gaining in strength in the weeks following. In around 4 weeks, typically over 90% of the final strength is reached, though strengthening may continue for decades.<ref>{{cite web | title=Concrete Testing | url=http://technology.calumet.purdue.edu/cnt/rbennet/concrete%20lab.htm | accessdate=10 November 2008}}</ref> The conversion of [[calcium hydroxide]] in the concrete into [[calcium carbonate]] from absorption of [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] over several decades further strengthens the concrete and makes it more resistant to damage. However, this reaction, called [[carbonation]], lowers the pH of the cement pore solution and can cause the reinforcement bars to corrode.

Hydration and hardening of concrete during the first three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses at a time when it has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation.<ref>Resulting strength distribution in vertical elements researched and presented at the article [http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf "Concrete inhomogeneity of vertical cast-in-place elements in skeleton-type buildings".]</ref>

During this period concrete must be kept under controlled temperature and humid atmosphere. In practice, this is achieved by spraying or ponding the concrete surface with water, thereby protecting the concrete mass from ill effects of ambient conditions. The picture to the right shows one of many ways to achieve this, ponding&nbsp;– submerging setting concrete in water and wrapping in plastic to contain the water in the mix. Additional common curing methods include wet burlap and/or plastic sheeting covering the fresh concrete, or by spraying on a water-impermeable temporary curing membrane.

Properly curing concrete leads to increased strength and lower permeability and avoids cracking where the surface dries out prematurely. Care must also be taken to avoid freezing or overheating due to the [[exothermic]] setting of cement. Improper curing can cause [[Spalling#Spalling in mechanical weathering|scaling]], reduced strength, poor [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] resistance and [[fracture|cracking]].

===Specialty Concretes===

====Pervious concrete====
{{Main|Pervious concrete}}

Pervious concrete is a mix of specially graded coarse aggregate, cement, water and little-to-no fine aggregates. This concrete is also known as "no-fines" or porous concrete. Mixing the ingredients in a carefully controlled process creates a paste that coats and bonds the aggregate particles. The hardened concrete contains interconnected air voids totalling approximately 15 to 25 percent. Water runs through the voids in the pavement to the soil underneath. Air entrainment admixtures are often used in freeze&ndash;thaw climates to minimize
the possibility of frost damage.

====Nano concrete====
'''Nano concrete''' is created by ''High-energy mixing'' (HEM) of cement, sand and water using a specific consumed power of 30 - 600 watt/kg for a net [[Energy density|specific energy]] consumption of at least 5 kJ/kg of the mix.<ref>{{Citation | inventor-last = Fridman  | inventor-first = Vladen  | issue-date = August 22, 1995  | title = Method for producing Construction Mixture for concrete | country-code = US | patent-number = 5443313}}</ref> A [[plasticizer]] or a [[superplasticizer]] is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional [[concrete mixer]]. In the HEM process sand provides dissipation of energy and increases shear stresses on the surface of cement particles. The quasi-laminar flow of the mixture characterized with [[Reynolds number]] less than 800 <ref>{{Citation|author-first=Vladlen|author-last= Fridman|title=Method of producing activated construction mixture|publication-date=November 21, 2013 | url =http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220130305963%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20130305963&RS=DN/20130305963}}</ref> is necessary to provide more effective energy absorption.  This results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of [[Calcium Silicate Hydrate]] (C-S-H) colloid creation.

HEM is the "bottom-up" approach in  [[Nanotechnology]] of concrete. The liquid activated mixture is used by itself for casting small architectural details and decorative items, or foamed ([[Expanded polystyrene concrete|expanded]]) for [[lightweight concrete]]. HEM Nano concrete hardens in low and subzero temperature conditions and possesses an increased volume of gel, which drastically reduces [[capillarity]] in solid and porous materials.

====Microbial concrete====
Bacteria such as ''[[Bacillus pasteurii]]'', ''[[Bacillus pseudofirmus]]'', ''Bacillus cohnii'', ''Sporosarcina pasteuri'', and ''[[Arthrobacter crystallopoietes]]'' increase the compression strength of concrete through their biomass.

==Properties==
{{Main|Properties of concrete}}
Concrete has relatively high [[compressive strength]], but much lower [[tensile strength]].  For this reason it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension (often steel). The elasticity of concrete is relatively constant at low stress levels but starts decreasing at higher stress levels as matrix cracking develops. Concrete has a very low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] and shrinks as it matures. All concrete structures crack to some extent, due to shrinkage and tension. Concrete that is subjected to long-duration forces is prone to [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].

Tests can be performed to ensure that the properties of concrete correspond to specifications for the application.
[[File:Concrete Compression Testing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Compression testing of a concrete cylinder]]

Different mixes of concrete ingredients produce different strengths. Concrete strength values are usually specified as the compressive strength of either a cylindrical or cubic specimen, where these values usually differ by around 20% for the same concrete mix.

Different strengths of concrete are used for different purposes.  Very low-strength - {{convert|14|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} or less -  concrete may be used when the concrete must be lightweight.<ref name=lightweight>{{cite web|title=Structural lightweight concrete|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf|work=Concrete Construction|publisher=The Aberdeen Group|date=March 1981}}</ref>  Lightweight concrete is often achieved by adding air, foams, or lightweight aggregates, with the side effect that the strength is reduced.  For most routine uses, {{convert|20|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|32|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} concrete is often used.  {{convert|40|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} concrete is readily commercially available as a more durable, although more expensive, option.  Higher-strength concrete is often used for larger civil projects.<ref name=American>{{cite web|title=Ordering Concrete by PSI|url=http://www.americanconcreteofiowa.com/aspx/diy.aspx?id=30|publisher=American Concrete|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>  Strengths above {{convert|40|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} are often used for specific building elements.  For example, the lower floor columns of high-rise concrete buildings may use concrete of {{convert|80|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} or more, to keep the size of the columns small.  Bridges may use long beams of high-strength concrete to lower the number of spans required.<ref name=Russel /><ref name=NRMCA>{{cite web|title=Concrete in Practice: What, Why, and How?|url=http://www.nrmca.org/aboutconcrete/cips/33p.pdf|publisher=NRMCA-National Ready Mixed Concrete Association|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>  Occasionally, other structural needs may require high-strength concrete. If a structure must be very rigid, concrete of very high strength may be specified, even much stronger than is required to bear the service loads. Strengths as high as {{convert|130|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} have been used commercially for these reasons.<ref name=Russel>{{cite web|title=Why Use High Performance Concrete?|url=http://www.silicafume.org/pdf/reprints-whyhpc.pdf|work=Technical Talk|accessdate=10 January 2013|author=Henry G.

==Building with concrete==
[[File:Buffalo City Court Building, 1971-74, Pfohl, Roberts and Biggie (8448022295).jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Buffalo City Court Building]] in [[Buffalo, NY]].]]

Concrete is one of the most durable building materials. It provides superior fire resistance compared with wooden construction and gains strength over time. Structures made of concrete can have a long service life.  Concrete is used more than any other manmade material in the world.<ref name=Lomborg>{{cite book|title=The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World|authorlink=Bjørn Lomborg|last=Lomborg|first=Bjørn|date=2001|isbn=978-0-521-80447-9|page=138}}</ref> As of 2006, about 7.5 billion cubic meters of concrete are made each year, more than one cubic meter for every person on Earth.<ref>{{cite web | title = Minerals commodity summary – cement – 2007 | publisher=US [[United States Geological Survey]]|date=1 June 2007|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/index.html|accessdate=16 January 2008}}<!--Computed by taking 2007 figure for world concrete production and the mix at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#Regular_concrete and computing the volume--></ref>

===Mass concrete structures===
{{main|Mass concrete}}
[[File:UserKTrimble-AP Taum Sauk Reservoir UnderConstruction Nov 22 2009 crop1.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial photo of reconstruction at [[Taum Sauk Hydroelectric Power Station|Taum Sauk]] (Missouri) pumped storage facility in late November, 2009. After the original reservoir failed, the new reservoir was made of roller-compacted concrete.]]

Large concrete structures such as [[dam]]s, [[navigation lock]]s, large mat foundations, and large [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] generate excessive heat during cement hydration and associated expansion. To mitigate these effects post-cooling<ref name="BerkCE">[http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~paulmont/165/Mass_concrete2.pdf Mass Concrete]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref> is commonly applied during construction. An early example at Hoover Dam, installed a network of pipes between vertical concrete placements to circulate cooling water during the curing process to avoid damaging overheating.  Similar systems are still used; depending on volume of the pour, the concrete mix used, and ambient air temperature, the cooling process may last for many months after the concrete is placed. Various methods also are used to pre-cool the concrete mix in mass concrete structures.<ref name="BerkCE"/>

Another approach to mass concrete structures that is becoming more widespread is the use of [[roller-compacted concrete]], which uses much lower amounts of cement and water than conventional concrete mixtures and is generally not poured into place.  Instead it is placed in thick layers as a semi-dry material and compacted into a dense, strong mass with rolling compactors. Because it uses less cementitious material, roller-compacted concrete has a much lower cooling requirement than conventional concrete.

===Prestressed concrete structures===
[[File:Scott System cacti.jpg|40-foot cacti decorate a sound/retaining wall in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]|thumb]]
{{Main|Prestressed concrete}}
[[Prestressed concrete]] is a form of reinforced concrete that builds in [[compressive stress]]es during construction to oppose those experienced in use. This can greatly reduce the weight of beams or slabs, by
better distributing the stresses in the structure to make optimal use of the reinforcement. For example, a horizontal beam tends to sag. Prestressed reinforcement along the bottom of the beam counteracts this.
In pre-tensioned concrete, the prestressing is achieved by using steel or polymer tendons or bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting, or for post-tensioned concrete, after casting.

More than {{convert|55000|mi|km}} of highways in the United States are paved with this material. [[Reinforced concrete]], [[prestressed concrete]] and [[precast concrete]] are the most widely used types of concrete functional extensions in modern days. See [[Brutalism]].

===Concrete Roads===
Concrete roads are more fuel efficient to drive on,<ref>{{cite web|title=Mapping of Excess Fuel Consumption|url=https://cshub.mit.edu/news/lca-research-brief-mapping-excess-fuel-consumption}}</ref> more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, yet have a much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of concrete paving, so that a well designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that [[pervious concrete]] can be used, which eliminates the need of placing [[storm drain]]s near the road, nor making it slightly sloped to help rainwater to run off of it. No longer requiring to discard the rainwater using drains, also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise needed in the water distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water; rather it is immediately absorbed by the ground.

===Energy efficiency===
Energy requirements for transportation of concrete are low because it is produced locally from local resources, typically manufactured within 100 kilometers of the job site. Similarly, relatively little energy is used in producing and combining the raw materials (although large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> are produced by the chemical reactions in [[Cement#CO2 emissions|cement manufacture]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The overall [[embodied energy]] of concrete is therefore lower than for most structural materials other than wood.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Once in place, concrete offers great energy efficiency over the lifetime of a building.<ref>John Gajda (2001) [http://www.arxx.com/Assets/CMS/WYSIWYGBase/file/5825%20PCA%20CD026.pdf Energy Use of Single Family Houses with Various Exterior Walls], Construction Technology Laboratories Inc.</ref> Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames.<ref>{{cite book|title=Green Building with Concrete|publisher=Taylor & Francis Group|isbn=978-1-4987-0411-3}}</ref> Air leakage accounts for a large percentage of energy loss from a home. The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs.<ref name="Features and Usage of Foam Concrete">{{cite web|title=Features and Usage of Foam Concrete|url=http://www.chinaconcretepump.com/Foam-Concrete-Machine.html/}}</ref> While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope, thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or [[rastra]] that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.

===Fire safety===
[[File:1981 BostonCityHall byLebovich8 HABS MA1176.jpg|thumb|A modern building: [[Boston City Hall]] (completed 1968) is constructed largely of concrete, both precast and poured in place. Of [[Brutalist]] architecture, it was voted "The World's Ugliest Building" in 2008.]]

Concrete buildings are more resistant to fire than those constructed using steel frames, since concrete has lower heat conductivity than steel and can thus last longer under the same fire conditions. Concrete is sometimes used as a fire protection for steel frames, for the same effect as above. Concrete as a fire shield, for example [[Fondu fyre]], can also be used in extreme environments like a missile launch pad.

Options for non-combustible construction include floors, ceilings and roofs made of cast-in-place and hollow-core precast concrete. For walls, concrete masonry technology and [[Insulating concrete forms|Insulating Concrete Forms]] (ICFs) are additional options. ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of fireproof insulating foam that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.

Concrete also provides good resistance against externally applied forces such as high winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes owing to its lateral stiffness, which results in minimal horizontal movement. However this stiffness can work against certain types of concrete structures, particularly where a relatively higher flexing structure is require to resist more extreme forces.

===Earthquake safety===
As discussed above, concrete is very strong in compression, but weak in tension. Larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures. These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads. Concrete structures without reinforcement, like other unreinforced masonry structures, can fail during severe earthquake shaking. Unreinforced masonry structures constitute one of the largest earthquake risks globally.<ref>[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=4067 Unreinforced Masonry Buildings and Earthquakes: Developing Successful Risk Reduction Programs], FEMA P-774 / October 2009</ref> These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings, (e.g. school buildings in Istanbul, Turkey<ref>[http://www.curee.org/architecture/docs/S08-034.pdf Seismic Retrofit Design Of Historic Century-Old School Buildings In Istanbul, Turkey], C.C. Simsir, A. Jain, G.C. Hart, and M.P. Levy, The 14th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering,  12–17 October 2008, Beijing, China</ref>).

==Impact of modern concrete use==
[[File:Concrete mixing plant, Birmingham, Alabama, view 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Concrete mixing plant in Birmingham, Alabama in 1936]]

Concrete is widely used for making [[architectural structure]]s, [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], brick/[[Concrete masonry unit|block]] walls, [[Sidewalk|pavements]], bridges/[[overpass]]es, highways, runways, [[parking]] structures, [[dam]]s, pools/[[reservoirs]], pipes, [[foundation (engineering)|footings]] for gates, [[fence]]s and [[Utility pole|poles]] and even [[boat]]s.  Concrete is used in large quantities almost everywhere mankind has a need for infrastructure.

The amount of concrete used worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.  Concrete's use in the modern world is exceeded only by that of naturally occurring water.<ref name="Cement Trust">{{cite web|title=What is the development impact of concrete?|url=http://cementtrust.wordpress.com/a-concrete-plan/|publisher=Cement Trust|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>

Concrete is also the basis of a large commercial industry. Globally, the ready-mix concrete industry, the largest segment of the concrete market, is projected to exceed $100 billion in revenue by 2015.<ref>http://www.prweb.com/releases/ready_mix_concrete/cement/prweb3747364.htm</ref> In the United States alone, concrete production is a $30-billion-per-year industry, considering only the value of the ready-mixed concrete sold each year.<ref name=NRMCA2>{{cite web|title=Ready Mixed Concrete Production Statistics|url=http://www.nrmca.org/concrete/data.asp|publisher=NRMCA-National Ready Mixed Concrete Association|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>  Given the size of the concrete industry, and the fundamental way concrete is used to shape the infrastructure of the modern world, it is difficult to overstate the role this material plays today.

The manufacture and use of concrete produce a wide range of environmental and social consequences. Some are harmful, some welcome, and some both, depending on circumstances.

A major component of concrete is [[cement]], which similarly exerts [[Cement#Environmental impacts|environmental and social effects]].<ref name=Navdeep2012/>{{rp|142}}
The cement industry is one of the three primary producers of [[carbon dioxide]], a major [[greenhouse gas]] (the other two being the energy production and transportation industries). As of 2001, the production of Portland cement contributed 7% to global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, largely due to the sintering of limestone and clay at {{convert|1500|C}}.{{refn|name=Worrell2001|{{cite journal| author1=Worrell, E. |author2=Price, L.| author3=Martin, N.| author4=Hendriks, C.| author5=Ozawa Meida, L.|date=2001|title=Carbon dioxide emissions from the global cement industry| journal=Annu.

Concrete is used to create hard surfaces that contribute to [[surface runoff]], which can cause heavy soil erosion, water pollution, and flooding, but conversely can be used to divert, dam, and control flooding.

Concrete is a contributor to the [[urban heat island]] effect, though less so than asphalt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reducing Urban Heat Islands|url=http://www.epa.gov/heatisld/resources/pdf/CoolPavesCompendium.pdf|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}</ref>

Workers who cut, grind or polish concrete are at risk of inhaling airborne silica, which can lead to [[silicosis]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Shepherd|author2=Woskie|last-author-amp=yes|title=Controlling Dust from Concrete Saw Cutting|url=http://www.cpwr.com/sites/default/files/publications/shepherdwoskieconcretecuttingkf.pdf|work=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>  Concrete dust released by building demolition and natural disasters can be a major source of dangerous air pollution.

The presence of some substances in concrete, including useful and unwanted additives, can cause health concerns due to toxicity and radioactivity.
Fresh concrete (before curing is complete) is highly alkaline and must be handled with proper protective equipment.

===Concrete recycling===
{{Main|Concrete recycling}}

Concrete recycling is an increasingly common method for disposing of concrete structures. Concrete debris was once routinely shipped to [[landfill]]s for disposal, but recycling is increasing due to improved environmental awareness, governmental laws and economic benefits.

Concrete, which must be free of trash, wood, paper and other such materials, is collected from demolition sites and put through a [[crusher|crushing machine]], often along with [[asphalt]], bricks and rocks.

Reinforced concrete contains [[rebar]] and other metallic reinforcements, which are removed with [[magnet]]s and recycled elsewhere. The remaining aggregate chunks are sorted by size. Larger chunks may go through the crusher again. Smaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects. [[Aggregate base]] gravel is laid down as the lowest layer in a road, with fresh concrete or asphalt placed over it. Crushed recycled concrete can sometimes be used as the dry aggregate for brand new concrete if it is free of contaminants, though the use of recycled concrete limits strength and is not allowed in many jurisdictions. On 3 March 1983, a government-funded research team (the VIRL research.codep) estimated that almost 17% of worldwide landfill was by-products of concrete based waste. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==World records==
The world record for the largest concrete pour in a single project is the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in Hubei Province, China by the Three Gorges Corporation. The amount of concrete used in the construction of the dam is estimated at 16 million cubic meters over 17 years. The previous record was 12.3 million cubic meters held by [[Itaipu Dam|Itaipu hydropower station]] in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web
