Thus, Anne was left as the last remaining legal heir to the throne. The Bill of Rights excluded Catholics from the throne, which ruled out James II and his descendants. However, it also provided for no further succession after Anne. Parliament thus saw the need to settle the succession on Sophia and her descendants, and thereby guarantee the continuity of the Crown in the Protestant line.</paragraph><paragraph>With religion and lineage initially decided, the ascendancy of William of Orange in 1689 would also bring his partiality to his foreign favourites that followed; by 1701 English jealousy of foreigners was rampant and action considered necessary for correction.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Henriq"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Provisions</heading><paragraph>The Act of Settlement provided that the throne would pass to the<space/><link><target>Sophia of Hanover</target><part>Electress Sophia of Hanover</part></link>&amp;nbsp; a granddaughter of<space/><link><target>James I of England</target><part>James VI and I</part></link><space/>and a niece of<space/><link><target>Charles I of England</target><part>King Charles I</part></link>&amp;nbsp; and her descendants, but it excluded &quot;all and every Person and Persons who... is are or shall be reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the<space/><link><target>Holy See</target><part>See</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Roman Catholic Church</target><part>Church of Rome</part></link><space/>or shall profess the Popish Religion or shall marry a Papist&quot;.
