In chemical terms, curing allows calcium-silicate hydrate (C-S-H) to form. To gain strength and harden fully, concrete curing requires time, initially setting and becoming rigid though very weak and gaining in strength in the weeks following. In around 4 weeks, typically over 90% of the final strength is reached, though strengthening may continue for decades.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Concrete Testing<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://technology.calumet.purdue.edu/cnt/rbennet/concrete%20lab.htm<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">10 November 2008</arg></template></extension><space/>The conversion of<space/><link><target>calcium hydroxide</target></link><space/>in the concrete into<space/><link><target>calcium carbonate</target></link><space/>from absorption of<space/><link><target>carbon dioxide</target><part>CO<xhtml:sub>2</xhtml:sub></part></link><space/>over several decades further strengthens the concrete and makes it more resistant to damage.

Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses at a time when it has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation.<extension extension_name='ref'>Resulting strength distribution in vertical elements researched and presented at the article<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf'>&quot;Concrete inhomogeneity of vertical cast-in-place elements in skeleton-type buildings&quot;.</link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>During this period concrete must be kept under controlled temperature and humid atmosphere.
