Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years; the oldest still in existence, ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'', was written starting in [[circa|ca.]] AD 77 by [[Pliny the Elder]] and was not fully revised at the time of his death in AD 79. The modern encyclopedia evolved out of dictionaries around the 17th century. Historically, some encyclopedias were contained in one [[volume]], whereas others, such as the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the ''[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]'' (62 volumes, 56,000 pages) or the world's largest, ''[[Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana]]'' (118 volumes, 105,000 pages), became huge multi-volume works. Some modern encyclopedias, such as [[Wikipedia]], are electronic and often freely available.

Copyists of Latin manuscripts took this phrase to be a single Greek word, ''enkyklopaidia'', with the same meaning, and this spurious Greek word became the New Latin word "encyclopaedia", which in turn came into English. Though the notion of a compendium of knowledge dates back thousands of years, the term was first used in the title of a book in 1517 by Johannes Aventinus: ''Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio'', and in 1538 by [[Joachimus Fortius Ringelbergius]], ''Lucubrationes vel potius absolutissima kyklopaideia'' ([[Basel]], 1538).

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1989) records ''encyclopædia'' and ''encyclopaedia'' as equal alternatives (in that order), and notes the ''æ'' would be obsolete except that it is preserved in works that have Latin titles. ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' (1997–2002) features ''encyclopedia'' as the main headword and ''encyclopaedia'' as a minor variant. In addition, ''cyclopedia'' and ''cyclopaedia'' are now rarely used shortened forms of the word originating in the 17th century.

==Characteristics==

The modern encyclopedia was developed from the [[dictionary]] in the 18th century. Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been researched and written by well-educated, well-informed content [[expert]]s, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of [[words]] and their [[definitions]]. [[Synonym]]ous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited [[information]], [[wikt:Analysis|analysis]] or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in [[understanding]] the meaning, significance or limitations of a [[Term (language)|term]], and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge. An encyclopedia is, allegedly, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader about its own veracity. In the terms of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Modes of persuasion]], a dictionary should persuade the reader through ''[[logos]]'' (conveying only appropriate emotions); it will be expected to have a lack of [[pathos]] (it should not stir up irrelevant emotions), and to have little [[ethos]] except that of the dictionary itself.

To address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a ''subject or [[list of academic disciplines|discipline]]''. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many [[map]]s and [[illustration]]s, as well as [[bibliography]] and [[statistics]].

Four major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:
* Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field (the English-language ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and German ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Brockhaus]]'' are well-known examples). General encyclopedias often contain guides on how to do a variety of things, as well as embedded dictionaries and [[gazetteer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics but from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' or ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''.
* Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopedia of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], or [[law]]. Works vary in the breadth of material and the depth of discussion, depending on the [[target audience]]. (For example, the [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encyclopedia.html Medical encyclopedia] produced by A.D.A.M., Inc. for the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]].)
* Some systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable as a work of reference. There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the [[alphabetical order|alphabetical]] method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organized in alphabetical order), or organization by [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] categories. The former method is today the most common by far, especially for general works. The fluidity of electronic media, however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content. Further, electronic media offer previously unimaginable capabilities for search, [[Subject indexing|indexing]] and [[cross reference]]. The [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from [[Horace]] on the title page of the 18th century ''Encyclopédie'' suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: "What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection."
* As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, they have had an ever-increasing effect on the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds. Projects such as [[Everything2]], [[Encarta]], [[h2g2]], and Wikipedia are examples of new forms of the encyclopedia as [[information retrieval]] becomes simpler. The method of production for an encyclopedia historically has been supported in both for-profit and non-profit contexts. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' mentioned above was entirely state sponsored, while the ''Britannica'' was supported as a for-profit institution. By comparison, [[Wikipedia]] is supported by volunteers contributing in a non-profit environment under the organization of the  [[Wikimedia]] Foundation.

Some works entitled "dictionaries" are actually similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', and ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''). The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]],'' Australia's national dictionary, became an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.

There are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries. Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries.<ref name=DOLencyclopedia/><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition/> There are differences in content as well. Generally speaking, dictionaries provide [[linguistics|linguistic]] information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the thing for which those words stand.<ref name=bejoint/><ref name=EB/><ref name=DOLei/><ref name=OHEL22/> Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name. As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be.<ref name=bejoint/>

In practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, "encyclopedic" information and linguistic information such as appears in dictionaries.<ref name=DOLei/><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition>{{cite journal|journal= Dictionary of Lexicography|last= Hartmann|first=R.

==History==
{{Main|History of encyclopedias}}
Encyclopedias have progressed from the beginning of history in written form, through medieval and modern times in print, and most recently, displayed on computer and distributed via computer networks.

=== Ancient times ===
[[Image:naturalishistoria.jpg|thumb|''Naturalis Historiæ'', 1669 edition, title page]]
One of the earliest encyclopedic works to have survived to modern times is the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman living in the 1st century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and all aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77-79, although he probably never finished proofing the work before his death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79.<ref name=naturalis>Naturalis Historia</ref>

===Middle Ages===
[[Isidore of Seville]], one of the greatest scholars of the early Middle Ages, is widely recognized for writing the first encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (''The Etymologies'') or ''Origines'' (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and modern. The work has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had he not collected them.

The most popular encyclopedia of the [[Carolingian]] Age was the ''De universo'' or ''De rerum naturis'' by [[Rabanus Maurus]], written about 830; it was based on ''Etymologiae''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The  encyclopedia of [[Suda]], a massive 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, had 30 000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers. The text was arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and place in the Greek alphabet.

The [[Historiography of early Islam|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the [[Brethren of Purity]] of [[Basra]]<ref>P.D. Wightman (1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas''</ref> were engaged in their [[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]. Notable works include [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of [[universal history]] (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[Masudi|al-Masudi]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Ibn Rustah]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose [[The Muqadimmah|Muqadimmah]] contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.

The enormous encyclopedic work in China of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'', compiled by the 11th century AD during the early [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', amounted to 9.4 million [[Chinese characters]] in 1000 written volumes.

In the late Middle Ages, several authors had the ambition of compiling the sum of human knowledge in a certain field or overall, for example [[Bartholomew of England]], [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Radulfus Ardens]], [[Book of Sydrac|Sydrac]], [[Brunetto Latini]], Giovanni da Sangiminiano, [[Pierre Bersuire]]. Some were women, like [[Hildegard of Bingen]] and [[Herrad of Landsberg]]. The most successful of those publications were the ''Speculum maius (Great Mirror)'' of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and the ''De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things)'' by [[Bartholomew of England]]. The latter was translated (or adapted) into French, Provençal, Italian, English, Flemish, Anglo-Norman, Spanish and German during the Middle Ages. Both were written in the middle of the 13th century. No medieval encyclopedia bore the title ''Encyclopaedia'' – they were often called ''On nature (De natura, De naturis rerum)'', ''Mirror (Speculum maius, Speculum universale)'', ''Treasure (Trésor)''.<ref>Monique Paulmier-Foucart, "Medieval Encyclopaedias", in André Vauchez (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'', James Clarke & Co, 2002.</ref>

===Renaissance===
[[File:Margarita Philosopica by Reisch 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy in ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1565]]
These works were all hand copied and thus rarely available, beyond wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning: they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.<ref name="dotma">See "Encyclopedia" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''.</ref>

During [[Renaissance]] the creation of [[printing]] allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy. The ''De expetendis et fugiendis rebus'' by Giorgio Valla was posthumously printed in 1501 by [[Aldo Manuzio]] in [[Venice]]. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by [[Archimedes]]), newly discovered and translated.  The ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the seven liberal arts.

The term encyclopaedia was coined by 16th century humanists who misread copies of their texts of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Quintilian]], and combined the two Greek words "''enkyklios paideia''" into one word, έγκυκλοπαιδεία.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29gkuklopaidei%2Fa Ἐγκυκλοπαιδεία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus project</ref> The phrase ''enkyklios paideia'' (ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία) was used by Plutarch and the Latin word Encyclopedia came from him.

The first work titled in this way was the ''Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio'' written by [[Johannes Aventinus]] in 1517.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The English physician and philosopher, Sir [[Thomas Browne]] used the word 'encyclopaedia' in 1646 in the preface [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo1.html to the reader] to define his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'', a major work of the 17th-century scientific revolution. Browne structured his encyclopaedia upon the time-honoured schemata of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends through the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary and cosmological worlds. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' was a European best-seller, translated into French, Dutch and German as well as Latin it went through no less than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672.

===18th–19th centuries===
[[Image:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|[[Encyclopédie]], 1773]]
The beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1728), and the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1751 onwards), as well as ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Conversations-Lexikon]]'', were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content "A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves".

During the 19th and early 20th century, many smaller or less developed languages{{which|date=December 2014}} saw their first encyclopedias, using French, German, and English role models. While encyclopedias in larger languages, having large markets that could support a large editorial staff, churned out new 20-volume works in a few years and new editions with brief intervals, such publication plans often spanned a decade or more in smaller languages.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===20th century===
[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|left|1913 advertisement for ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias]]
Popular and affordable encyclopedias such as [[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]] and the [[Children's Encyclopaedia]] appeared in the early 1920s.

In the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were ''[[World Book]]'' and ''[[Funk and Wagnalls]]''.

The second half of the 20th century also saw the proliferation of specialized encyclopedias that compiled topics in specific fields.  This trend has continued.  Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size now exist for most if not all [[academic discipline]]s, including such narrow topics such as [[bioethics]].

By the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM]]s for use with personal computers. [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'', launched in 1993, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with both video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images. After sixteen years, Microsoft discontinued the Encarta line of products in 2009.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html|title= Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued|publisher=MSN Encarta|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257023810258996|archivedate=2009-10-31}}</ref>

In 2001, [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Larry Sanger]] launched [[Wikipedia]], a collaboratively edited, multilingual, open-source, free [[Internet]] encyclopedia supported by the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]].

While Wikipedia is by far the largest web-based encyclopedia, it is not the only one in existence. There are several much smaller, usually more specialized, encyclopedias on various themes, sometimes dedicated to a specific geographic region or time period.<ref>Sideris A., [https://www.academia.edu/481168/The_Encyclopedic_Concept_in_the_Web_Era= "The Encyclopedic Concept in the Web Era"], in Ioannides M., Arnold D., Niccolucci F. and K.
