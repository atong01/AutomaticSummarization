'''Traditional Chinese medicine''' ('''TCM'''; {{zh|t=中醫|s=中医|p=Zhōngyī}}) is a broad range of medicine practices sharing common concepts which have been developed in China and are based on a tradition of more than 2,000 years, including various forms of [[Chinese herbology|herbal medicine]], [[acupuncture]], [[Tui na|massage (Tui na)]], [[Qigong|exercise (qigong)]], and dietary therapy.<ref name="TCMNCCIH" /> It is primarily used as a complementary [[alternative medicine]] approach.<ref name="TCMNCCIH" /> TCM is widely used in China and it is also used in the West.<ref name="TCMNCCIH" />

TCM "holds that the body's [[vital energy]] (''chi'' or ''qi'') circulates through channels, called ''meridians'', that have branches connected to bodily organs and functions."<ref name="Quackwatch" /> Concepts of the body and of disease used in TCM reflect its origins in pre-scientific culture, similar to European [[humoral theory]].<ref name="Novella2012"/> Scientific investigation has found no [[histology|histological]] or [[physiology|physiological]] evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as ''qi'', meridians, and acupuncture points.{{efn |name= "SinghErnst2008" |Singh & Ernst (2008) stated, "Scientists are still unable to find a shred of evidence to support the existence of meridians or Ch'i",<ref>{{harvnb|Singh & Ernst|2008|page = 72}}</ref> "The traditional principles of acupuncture are deeply flawed, as there is no evidence at all to demonstrate the existence of Ch'i or meridians"<ref>{{harvnb|Singh & Ernst|2008|page = 107}}</ref> and "Acupuncture points and meridians are not a reality, but merely the product of an ancient Chinese philosophy"<ref>{{harvnb|Singh & Ernst|2008|page= 387}}</ref>}} The TCM theory and practice are not based upon [[scientific knowledge]], and its own practitioners disagree widely on what diagnosis and treatments should be used for any given patient.<ref name="Quackwatch" /> The effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine remains poorly researched and documented.<ref name="Shang-2007" /> There are concerns over a number of potentially toxic plants, animal parts, and mineral Chinese medicinals.<ref name="Shaw-2012" /> A review of [[cost-effectiveness]] research for TCM found that studies had low [[levels of evidence]], but so far have not shown benefit outcomes.<ref name="Zhang2012" /> Pharmaceutical research has explored the potential for creating new drugs from traditional remedies, with few successful results.<ref name="swallow" /> A ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editorial described TCM as "fraught with [[pseudoscience]]", and said that the most obvious reason why it hasn't delivered many cures is that the majority of its treatments have no logical [[mechanism of action]].<ref name="swallow" /> Proponents propose that research has so far missed key features of the art of TCM, such as unknown interactions between various ingredients and complex interactive biological systems.<ref name="swallow" />

The doctrines of Chinese medicine are rooted in books such as the ''[[Huangdi Neijing|Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon]]'' and the ''[[Shanghan lun|Treatise on Cold Damage]]'', as well as in cosmological notions such as [[Yin and yang|yin-yang]] and the [[Wu Xing|five phases]]. Starting in the 1950s, these precepts were standardized in the People's Republic of China, including attempts to integrate them with modern notions of [[anatomy]] and [[pathology]]. In the 1950s, the Chinese government promoted a systematized form of TCM.<ref name="Levinovitz2013" />

TCM's view of the body places little emphasis on anatomical structures, but is mainly concerned with the identification of functional entities (which regulate digestion, breathing, aging etc.). While health is perceived as harmonious interaction of these entities and the outside world, disease is interpreted as a disharmony in interaction. TCM diagnosis aims to trace symptoms to [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Patterns|patterns]] of an underlying disharmony, by measuring the pulse, inspecting the tongue, skin, and eyes, and looking at the eating and sleeping habits of the person as well as many other things.

In the centuries that followed the completion of the ''Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon'', several shorter books tried to summarize or systematize its contents.

==Philosophical background==
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a broad range of medicine practices sharing common concepts which have been developed in China and are based on a tradition of more than 2,000 years, including various forms of [[Chinese herbology|herbal medicine]], acupuncture, massage (Tui na), exercise (qigong), and dietary therapy.<ref name=TCMNCCIH>Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, [http://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm Traditional Chinese Medicine: An Introduction]</ref> It is primarily used as a complementary [[alternative medicine]] approach.<ref name=TCMNCCIH/> TCM is widely used in China and it is also used in the West.<ref name=TCMNCCIH/> Its philosophy is based on [[School of Yin Yang|Yinyangism]] (i.e., the combination of Five Phases theory with Yin-yang theory),<ref name="Zou Yan">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref> which was later absorbed by [[Daoism]].<ref>Liu, Zheng-Cai (1999): [http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=UNUiHP7MPJMC&pg=PA39&dq=liu+1999+daoism+yin+yang&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q&f=false "A Study of Daoist Acupuncture & Moxibustion"] Blue Poppy Press, first edition.

===Yin and yang===
{{Main|Yin and yang}}

Yin and yang are ancient Chinese concepts which can be traced back to the Shang dynasty<ref name="Men 2010">Men, J. & Guo, L. (2010) [http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=KxoVAXt09F8C&pg=PA60&dq=tcm+yin+yang&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q=tcm%20yin%20yang&f=false "A General Introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine"] Science Press. ISBN 978-1-4200-9173-1</ref> (1600–1100&nbsp;BC). They represent two abstract<ref name="Men 2010"/> and complementary aspects that every phenomenon in the universe can be divided into.<ref name="Men 2010"/> Primordial analogies for these aspects are the sun-facing (yang) and the shady (yin) side of a hill.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> Two other commonly used representational allegories of yin and yang are water and fire.<ref name="Men 2010"/> In the yin-yang theory, detailed attributions are made regarding the yin or yang character of things:

|}

The concept of yin and yang is also applicable to the human body; for example, the upper part of the body and the back are assigned to yang, while the lower part of the body are believed to have the yin character.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> Yin and yang characterization also extends to the various body functions, and – more importantly – to disease symptoms (e.g., cold and heat sensations are assumed to be yin and yang symptoms, respectively).<ref name="Wiseman 1996">Wiseman, N. & Ellis, A. (1996): [http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=3SOAjUt53UgC&pg=PA199&dq=summerheat+tcm&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q&f=false "Fundamentals of Chinese medicine] Paradigm Publications. ISBN 978-0-912111-44-5</ref> Thus, yin and yang of the body are seen as phenomena whose lack (or overabundance) comes with characteristic symptom combinations:

*Yin vacuity (also termed "vacuity-heat"): heat sensations, possible night sweats, insomnia, dry pharynx, dry mouth, dark urine, a red tongue with scant fur, and a "fine" and rapid pulse.<ref name="Kaptchuck 2000">Kaptchuck, Ted J., (2000): [http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=6BiGl562OgEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+web+that+has+no+weaver&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q&f=false "The Web That Has No Weaver"] 2nd edition. Contemporary Books. ISBN 978-0-8092-2840-9</ref>
*Yang vacuity ("vacuity-cold"): aversion to cold, cold limbs, bright white complexion, long voidings of clear urine, diarrhea, pale and enlarged tongue, and a slightly weak, slow and fine pulse.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>

TCM also identifies drugs believed to treat these specific symptom combinations, i.e., to reinforce yin and yang.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/>

===Five Phases theory===
{{Main|Wu Xing}}
Five Phases (五行, {{zh|p=wǔ xíng}}), sometimes also translated as the "Five Elements"<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> theory, presumes that all phenomena of the universe and nature can be broken down into five elemental qualities – represented by wood (木, {{zh|p=mù}}), fire (火{{zh|p=huǒ}}), earth (土, {{zh|p=tǔ}}), metal (金, {{zh|p=jīn}}), and water (水, {{zh|p=shuǐ}}).<ref name="Aung 2007">Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D.

Strict rules are identified to apply to the relationships between the Five Phases in terms of sequence, of acting on each other, of counteraction, etc.<ref name="Aung 2007"/> All these aspects of Five Phases theory constitute the basis of the [[Zang-fu|zàng-fǔ]] concept, and thus have great influence regarding the TCM model of the body.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> Five Phase theory is also applied in diagnosis and therapy.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/>

Correspondences between the body and the universe have historically not only been seen in terms of the Five Elements, but also of the "Great Numbers" (大數, {{zh|p=dà shū}})<ref name="Matuk 2006"/> For example, the number of acu-points has at times been seen to be 365, corresponding with the number of days in a year; and the number of main meridians–12–has been seen as corresponding with the number of rivers flowing through the [[History of China|ancient Chinese empire]].<ref name="Matuk 2006">{{cite journal |title=Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chinese and Western Medical Illustration |author=Camillia Matuk |journal=Journal of Biocommunication |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2006 |url=http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf |pmid= |ref=harv }}</ref><ref name=SDAM>''"There are 365 days in the year, while humans have 365 joints [or acu-points]...

==Model of the body==
{{main|TCM model of the body}}

[[File:ChineseMedecine.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Old Chinese medical chart on acupuncture meridians]]

TCM "holds that the body's [[vital energy]] (''chi'' or ''qi'') circulates through channels, called ''[[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]]'', that have branches connected to bodily organs and functions."<ref name="Quackwatch"/> Its view of the human body is only marginally concerned with anatomical structures, but focuses primarily on the body's ''functions''<ref>Matuk, C. [http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf "Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chinese and Western Medical Illustration"], JBC Vol. 32, No. 1 2006, page 5</ref><ref name="Ross 1984"/> (such as digestion, breathing, temperature maintenance, etc.):

{{Quote|"The tendency of Chinese thought is to seek out dynamic functional activity rather than to look for the fixed somatic structures that perform the activities. Because of this, the Chinese have no system of anatomy comparable to that of the West."|Ted Kaptchuk|''The Web That Has No Weaver''}}

These functions are aggregated and then associated with a primary functional entity – for instance, nourishment of the tissues and maintenance of their moisture are seen as connected functions, and the entity postulated to be responsible for these functions is xuě (blood).<ref name="Ross 1984"/> These functional entities thus constitute ''concepts'' rather than something with biochemical or anatomical properties.<ref>Ross, Jeremy (1984) [http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=t23zKB1FSVYC&pg=PA6&dq=Chinese+medicine+is+completely+different;+it+emphasizes+function.+Little&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q=Chinese%20medicine%20is%20completely%20different%3B%20it%20emphasizes%20function.%20Little&f=false "Zang Fu, the organ systems of traditional Chinese medicine"] Elsevier. First edition 1984. ISBN 978-0-443-03482-4 pp. 12–13. "For example, [the term] Xue is used rather than Blood, since the latter implies the blood of Western medicine, with its precise parameters of biochemistry and histiology. Although Xue and blood share some common attributes, fundamentally, Xue is a different concept."</ref>

The primary functional entities used by traditional Chinese medicine are qì, xuě, the five zàng organs, the six fǔ organs, and the meridians which extend through the organ systems.<ref name="Aung, S.K.H. 2007 p. 19">Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D.

=== Qi ===
{{Main|Qi}}

TCM distinguishes many kinds of qi ({{zh |p = qì |s = 气 |t = 氣}}).<ref name="Aung & Chen" /> In a general sense, qi is something that is defined by five "cardinal functions":<ref name="Aung & Chen">Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D.

# Actuation ({{zh |t = 推動 |s = 推动 |p = tuīdòng}}) – of all physical processes in the body, especially the circulation of all body fluids such as blood in their vessels. This includes actuation of the functions of the zang-fu organs and meridians.
# Warming ({{zh |t = 溫煦 |p = wēnxù}}) – the body, especially the limbs.
# Defense ({{zh |c = 防御 |p = fángyù}}) – against [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Six Excesses|Exogenous Pathogenic Factors]]
# Containment ({{zh |t = 固攝 |s = 固摄 |p = gùshè}}) – of body fluids, i.e., keeping blood, sweat, urine, semen, etc. from leakage or excessive emission.
# Transformation ({{zh |t = 氣化 |s = 气化 |p = qìhuà}}) – of food, drink, and breath into qi, [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Xue|xue]] (blood), and [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Bodily fluids (Jinye)|jinye]] (“fluids”), and/or transformation of all of the latter into each other.
Vacuity of qi will be characterized especially by pale complexion, lassitude of spirit, lack of strength, spontaneous sweating, laziness to speak, non-digestion of food, shortness of breath (especially on exertion), and a pale and enlarged tongue.<ref name="Wiseman 1996" />

Qi is believed to be partially generated from food and drink, and partially from air (by breathing).<ref name="yinyanghouse.com">{{cite web |url = http://www.yinyanghouse.com/theory/chinese/what_is_qi#jing |title = What is Qi?

TCM uses special terms for qi running inside of the blood vessels and for qi that is distributed in the skin, muscles, and tissues between those. The former is called yíng-qì ({{zh |s = 营气 |t = 營氣}}); its function is to complement xuè and its nature has a strong yin aspect (although qi in general is considered to be yang).<ref name="Elizabeth Reninger">{{cite web |url = http://taoism.about.com/od/qi/a/Qi_Forms.htm |title=Qi (Chi): Various Forms Used In Qigong & Chinese Medicine – How Are The Major Forms Of Qi Created Within The Body? |author=Elizabeth Reninger |accessdate = 6 December 2010}}</ref> The latter is called weì-qì ({{zh |t = 衛氣 |s = 卫气}}); its main function is defence and it has pronounced yang nature.<ref name="Elizabeth Reninger" />

Qi is said to circulate in the meridians.

===Xue===
In contrast to the majority of other functional entities, xuè (血, "blood") is correlated with a physical form – the red liquid running in the blood vessels.<ref name="Blood from a TCM Perspective">{{cite web |url=http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/blood.html|title=Blood from a TCM Perspective |publisher=Shen-Nong Limited |accessdate=4 April 2011}}</ref> Its concept is, nevertheless, defined by its functions: nourishing all parts and tissues of the body, safeguarding an adequate degree of moisture,<ref name="http">{{cite web |url=http://www.yinyanghouse.com/theory/chinese/blood_theory_and_disharmonies |title=The Concept of Blood (Xue) in TCM Acupuncture Theory |date=24 June 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2010}}</ref> and sustaining and soothing both consciousness and sleep.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/blood.html|title=Blood from a TCM Perspective |publisher=Shen-Nong Limited |accessdate=3 March 2011}}</ref>

Typical symptoms of a lack of xuě (usually termed "blood vacuity" [血虚, {{zh|p=xuě xū}}]) are described as: Pale-white or withered-yellow complexion, dizziness, flowery vision, palpitations, insomnia, numbness of the extremities; pale tongue; "fine" pulse.<ref>Wiseman, N. & Ellis, A.

ISBN 978-0-912111-44-5, p. 147</ref>

====Jinye====
Closely related to xuě are the jīnyė (津液, usually translated as "body fluids"), and just like xuě they are considered to be yin in nature, and defined first and foremost by the functions of nurturing and moisturizing the different structures of the body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacredlotus.com/theory/substances/jinye.cfm |title=Body Fluids (Yin Ye) |publisher=copyright 2001–2010 by Sacred Lotus Arts |accessdate=9 December 2010}}</ref> Their other functions are to harmonize yin and yang, and to help with the secretion of waste products.<ref>"三、津液的功能 ...（三）调节阴阳 ...（四）排泄废物 ..."

Chapter 4: Essence, qi, blood, jinye. Section 4: jinye}}</ref>

Jīnyė are ultimately extracted from food and drink, and constitute the raw material for the production of xuě; conversely, xuě can also be transformed into jīnyė.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacredlotus.com/theory/substances/jinye.cfm |title=Body Fluids (Yin Ye) |publisher=copyright 2001–2010 by Sacred Lotus Arts |accessdate=3 March 2011}}</ref> Their palpable manifestations are all bodily fluids: [[tears]], [[sputum]], [[Salivary gland|saliva]], [[gastric acid]], [[Synovial fluid|joint fluid]], [[Persperation|sweat]], [[urine]], etc.<ref>"津液包括各脏腑组织的正常体液和正常的分泌物，胃液、肠液、唾液、关节液等。习惯上也包括代谢产物中的尿、汗、泪等。" [The (term) jinye comprises all physiological bodily fluids of the zang-fu and tissues, and physiological secretions, gastric juice, intestinal juice, saliva, joint fluid, etc. Customarily, this also includes metabolic products like urine, sweat, tears, etc.] As seen at: {{cite web |url=http://www.zysj.com.cn/lilunshuji/jichulilun/44-4-4.html |script-title=zh:《中医基础理论》第四章 精、气、血、津液. 第四节 津液 |accessdate=9 December 2010 |language=Chinese |trans_title=Basics of TCM theory.

===Zang-fu===
{{Main|Zang-fu}}
The '''zàng-fǔ''' ({{zh|s=脏腑|t=臟腑}}) constitute the centre piece of TCM's systematization of bodily functions. Bearing the names of organs, they are, however, only secondarily tied to (rudimentary) anatomical assumptions (the fǔ a little more, the zàng much less).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/118Kaleidoscope4651.html |title= Cultural China–Chinese Medicine–Basic Zang Fu Theory |accessdate=8 January 2011}}</ref> As they are primarily defined by their functions,<ref name="Kaptchuck 2000"/><ref name="Ross 1984"/> they are not equivalent to the anatomical organs–to highlight this fact, their names are usually capitalized.

The term zàng (臟) refers to the five entities considered to be yin in nature–[[Heart (Chinese medicine)|Heart]], [[Liver (Chinese medicine)|Liver]], [[Spleen (Chinese medicine)|Spleen]], [[Lung (Chinese medicine)|Lung]], [[Kidney (Chinese medicine)|Kidney]]–, while fǔ (腑) refers to the six yang organs–[[Small intestine (Chinese medicine)|Small Intestine]], [[Large Intestine (Chinese medicine)|Large Intestine]], [[Gallbladder (Chinese medicine)|Gallbladder]], [[Urinary Bladder (Chinese medicine)|Urinary Bladder]], [[Stomach (Chinese medicine)|Stomach]] and [[San Jiao|Sānjiaō]].<ref>by citation from the [[Huangdi Neijing]]'s Suwen: ‘’言人身臟腑中陰陽，則臟者為陰，腑者為陽。‘’[Within the human body's zang-fu, there's yin and yang; the zang are yin, the fu are yang].

The zàng's essential functions consist in production and storage of qì and xuě; they are said to regulate digestion, breathing, water metabolism, the musculoskeletal system, the skin, the sense organs, aging, emotional processes, and mental activity, among other structures and processes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/118Kaleidoscope4651.html |title= Cultural China–Chinese Medicine–Basic Zang Fu Theory |accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref> The fǔ organs' main purpose is merely to transmit and digest (傳化, {{zh|p=chuán-huà}})<ref>"六腑：膽、胃、小腸、大腸、膀胱、三焦；“傳化物質”。 [The Six Fu: gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, bladder, sanjiao; "transmit and digest"] as seen at {{cite web |url=http://www.notedyy.com/news/html/?341.html |script-title=zh:中醫基礎理論-髒腑學說 |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=14 December 2010 |language=Chinese |trans_title=Basics of TCM theory–The zangfu concept}}</ref> substances such as waste and food.

Since their concept was developed on the basis of Wǔ Xíng philosophy, each zàng is paired with a fǔ, and each zàng-fǔ pair is assigned to one of five elemental qualities (i.e., the Five Elements or Five Phases).<ref>Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D. (2007): Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture. Thieme Mecial Publishers. ISBN 978-1-58890-221-4, pp 15–16</ref> These correspondences are stipulated as:
*Fire (火) = Heart (心, {{zh|p=xīn}}) and Small Intestine (小腸, {{zh|p=xiaǒcháng}}) (and, secondarily, Sānjiaō [三焦, "Triple Burner"] and Pericardium [心包, {{zh|p=xīnbaò}}])
*Earth (土) = Spleen (脾, {{zh|p=pí}}) and Stomach (胃, {{zh|p=weì}})
*Metal (金) = Lung (肺, {{zh|p=feì}}) and Large Intestine (大腸, {{zh|p=dàcháng}})
*Water (水) = Kidney (腎, {{zh|p=shèn}}) and Bladder (膀胱, {{zh|p=pángguāng}})
*Wood (木) = Liver (肝, {{zh|p=gān}}) and Gallbladder (膽, {{zh|p=dān}})

The zàng-fǔ are also connected to the [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)#Twelve standard meridians|twelve standard meridians]]–each yang meridian is attached to a fǔ organ, and five of the yin meridians are attached to a zàng. As there are only five zàng but six yin meridians, the sixth is assigned to the [[Pericardium (Chinese medicine)|Pericardium]], a peculiar entity almost similar to the Heart zàng.<ref>Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D.

===Jing-luo===
[[File:Acupuncture chart 300px.jpg|thumb|Acupuncture chart from the [[Ming Dynasty]] (c. 1368–1644)|200px]]
{{Main|Meridian (Chinese medicine)}}

The meridians (经络, {{zh|p=jīng-luò}}) are believed to be channels running from the
zàng-fǔ in the interior (里, {{zh|p=lǐ}}) of the body to the limbs and joints ("the surface" [表, {{zh|p=biaǒ}}]), transporting qi and xuĕ.<ref>"经络是运行全身气血，联络脏腑肢节，沟通表里上下内外，..."

==Concept of disease==
In general, disease is perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of yin, yang, qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> Therapy is based on which "pattern of disharmony" can be identified.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/><ref name="Flaws 1996"/> Thus, "pattern discrimination" is the most important step in TCM diagnosis.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/><ref name="Flaws 1996"/> It is also known to be the most difficult aspect of practicing TCM.<ref name="Flaws 1990"/>

In order to determine which pattern is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice.<ref>"Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine", Giovanni Maciocia, Eastland Press; Revised edition (June 1995)</ref><ref name=Maciocia>{{Cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Maciocia|title=The Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=1989}}</ref> For example, depending on tongue and pulse conditions, a TCM practitioner might diagnose bleeding from the mouth and nose as: "Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung, injuring the blood vessels and giving rise to reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose.".<ref name=Deadman>Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji. [http://www.jcm.co.uk/product/catalog/product/view/7937/some-acupuncture-points-which-treat-disorders-of-blood/ "Some acupuncture points which treat disorders of blood"], ''[[Journal of Chinese Medicine]]''</ref> He might then go on to prescribe treatments designed to [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Traditional categorization|clear heat]] or supplement the Lung.

===Disease entities===
In TCM, a disease has two aspects: "bìng" and "zhèng".<ref name="Clavey 1995">Clavey, Steven (1995): [http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=2RQMLGcFe6kC&pg=PR30&dq=tcm+ba+gang+diagnosis&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q=tcm%20ba%20gang%20diagnosis&f=false "Fluid physiology and pathology in traditional Chinese medicine"]. Elsevier. 2nd edition, 2003. ISBN 978-0-443-07194-2</ref> The former is often translated as "disease entity",<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> "disease category",<ref name="Flaws 1990"/> "illness",<ref name="Clavey 1995"/> or simply "diagnosis".<ref name="Clavey 1995"/> The latter, and more important one, is usually translated as "pattern"<ref name="Ergil 2009"/><ref name="Flaws 1990"/> (or sometimes also as "syndrome"<ref name="Clavey 1995"/>). For example, the disease entity of a common cold might present with a pattern of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Six Excesses|wind-cold]] in one person, and with the pattern of wind-heat in another.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/>

From a scientific point of view, most of the disease entitites (病, {{zh|p=bìng}}) listed by TCM constitute mere symptoms.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> Examples include headache, cough, abdominal pain, constipation etc.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/>

Since therapy will not be chosen according to the disease entity but according to the pattern, two people with the same disease entity but different patterns will receive different therapy. Vice versa, people with similar patterns might receive similar therapy even if their disease entities are different. This is called 异病同治，同病异治 ({{zh|p=yì bìng tóng zhì, tóng bìng yì zhì}},<ref name="Flaws 1996"/>"different diseases, same treatment; same disease, different treatments").

===Patterns===
In TCM, "pattern" (证, {{zh|p=zhèng}}) refers to a "pattern of disharmony" or "functional disturbance" within the functional entities the TCM model of the body is composed of.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> There are disharmony patterns of qi, xuě, the body fluids, the zàng-fǔ, and the meridians.<ref name="Clavey 1995"/> They are ultimately defined by their symptoms and "signs" (i.e., for example, pulse and tongue findings).<ref name="Flaws 1996"/>

In clinical practice, the identified pattern usually involves a combination of affected entities<ref name="Flaws 1990">Flaws, Bob (1990): [http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=hID3SfkAuzUC&pg=PA5&dq=tcm+ba+gang+diagnosis&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q=tcm%20ba%20gang%20diagnosis&f=false "Sticking to the Point"] Blue Poppy Press. 10th Printing, 2007. ISBN 978-0-936185-17-0</ref> (compare with [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Typical examples of patterns|typical examples of patterns]]). The concrete pattern identified should account for ''all'' the symptoms a person has.<ref name="Flaws 1996">Flaws, B., & Finney, D., (1996): [http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=iJT3mz20yHoC&pg=PA1&dq=tcm+pattern&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q=tcm%20pattern&f=false "A handbook of TCM patterns & their treatments"] Blue Poppy Press. 6th Printing 2007.

The Six Excesses (六淫, {{zh|p=liù yín}},<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> sometimes also translated as "Pathogenic Factors",<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WbThUt45ZXgC&pg=PA159&dq=tcm+six#v=onepage&q=tcm%20six&f=false|title=Foundations for integrative musculoskeletal medicine: an east-west approach|author=Marcus & Kuchera|publisher=North Atlantic Books|year=2004|accessdate=22 March 2011|isbn=978-1-55643-540-9}} p. 159</ref> or "Six Pernicious Influences";<ref name="Ross 1984"/> with the alternative term of  六邪, {{zh|p=liù xié}}, – "Six Evils" or "Six Devils"<ref name="Ross 1984"/>) are allegorical terms used to describe disharmony patterns displaying certain typical symptoms.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> These symptoms resemble the effects of six climatic factors.<ref name="Ross 1984"/> In the allegory, these symptoms can occur because one or more of those climatic factors (called 六气, {{zh|p=liù qì}}, "the six qi"<ref name="Deng 1999"/>) were able to invade the body surface and to proceed to the interior.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> This is sometimes used to draw causal relationships (i.e., prior exposure to wind/cold/etc. is identified as the cause of a disease),<ref name="Deng 1999"/> while other authors explicitly deny a direct cause-effect relationship between weather conditions and disease,<ref name="Ergil 2009"/><ref name="Ross 1984"/> pointing out that the Six Excesses are primarily descriptions of a certain combination of symptoms<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> translated into a pattern of disharmony.<ref name="Ross 1984"/> It is undisputed, though, that the Six Excesses can manifest inside the body without an external cause.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/><ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> In this case, they might be denoted "internal", e.g., "internal wind"<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> or "internal fire (or heat)".<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>

The Six Excesses and their characteristic clinical signs are:
#Wind (风, {{zh|p=fēng}}): rapid onset of symptoms, wandering location of symptoms, itching, nasal congestion, "floating" pulse;<ref name="Deng 1999"/> tremor, paralysis, convulsion.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/>
#Cold (寒, {{zh|p=hán}}): cold sensations, aversion to cold, relief of symptoms by warmth, watery/clear excreta, severe pain, abdominal pain, contracture/hypertonicity of muscles, (slimy) white tongue fur, "deep"/"hidden" or "string-like" pulse,<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, pp. 80 & 142</ref> or slow pulse.<ref name="Ross 1984"/>
#Fire/Heat (火, {{zh|p=huǒ}}): aversion to heat, high fever, thirst, concentrated urine, red face, red tongue, yellow tongue fur, rapid pulse.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> (Fire and heat are basically seen to be the same)<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>
#Dampness (湿, {{zh|p=shī}}): sensation of heaviness, sensation of fullness, symptoms of Spleen dysfunction, greasy tongue fur, "slippery" pulse.<ref name="Ross 1984"/>
#Dryness (燥, {{zh|p=zào}}): dry cough, dry mouth, dry throat, dry lips, nosebleeds, dry skin, dry stools.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/>
#Summerheat (暑, {{zh|p=shǔ}}): either heat or mixed damp-heat symptoms.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>
Six-Excesses-patterns can consist of only one or a combination of Excesses (e.g., wind-cold, wind-damp-heat).<ref name="Deng 1999"/> They can also transform from one into another.<ref name="Deng 1999"/>

====Typical examples of patterns====
For each of the functional entities (qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians etc.), typical disharmony patterns are recognized; for example: qi vacuity and qi stagnation in the case of qi;<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> blood vacuity, blood stasis, and blood heat in the case of xuĕ;<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> Spleen qi vacuity, Spleen yang vacuity, Spleen qi vacuity with down-bearing qi, Spleen qi vacuity with lack of blood containment, cold-damp invasion of the Spleen, damp-heat invasion of Spleen and Stomach in case of the Spleen zàng;<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> wind/cold/damp invasion in the case of the meridians.<ref name="Flaws 1996"/>

TCM gives detailed prescriptions of these patterns regarding their typical symptoms, mostly including characteristic tongue and/or pulse findings.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/><ref name="Flaws 1996"/> For example:
* "Upflaming Liver fire" (肝火上炎, {{zh|p=gānhuǒ shàng yán}}): Headache, red face, reddened eyes, dry mouth, nosebleeds, constipation, dry or hard stools, profuse menstruation, sudden [[tinnitus]] or deafness, vomiting of sour or bitter fluids, expectoration of blood, [[irascibility]], impatience; red tongue with dry yellow fur; slippery and string-like pulse.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>

====Basic principles of pattern discrimination====
The process of determining which actual pattern is on hand is called 辩证 ({{zh|p=biàn zhèng}}, usually translated as "pattern diagnosis",<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> "pattern identification"<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> or "pattern discrimination"<ref name="Flaws 1990"/>). Generally, the first and most important step in pattern diagnosis is an evaluation of the present signs and symptoms on the basis of the "Eight Principles" (八纲, {{zh|p=bā gāng}}).<ref name="Ergil 2009"/><ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>
These eight principles refer to four pairs of fundamental qualities of a disease: exterior/interior, heat/cold, vacuity/repletion, and yin/yang.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> Out of these, heat/cold and vacuity/repletion have the biggest clinical importance.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> The yin/yang quality, on the other side, has the smallest importance and is somewhat seen aside from the other three pairs, since it merely presents a general and vague conclusion regarding what other qualities are found.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> In detail, the Eight Principles refer to the following:
* ''Exterior'' (表, {{zh|p=biǎo}}) refers to a disease manifesting in the superficial layers of the body – skin, hair, flesh, and meridians.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> It is characterized by aversion to cold and/or wind, headache, muscle ache, mild fever, a "floating" pulse, and a normal tongue appearance.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>
* ''Interior'' (里, {{zh|p=lǐ}}) refers to disease manifestation in the zàng-fǔ, or (in a wider sense) to any disease that can not be counted as exterior.<ref name="Deng 1999"/> There are no generalized characteristic symptoms of interior patterns, since they'll be determined by the affected zàng or fǔ entity.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>
* ''Cold'' (寒, {{zh|p=hán}}) is generally characterized by aversion to cold, absence of thirst, and a white tongue fur.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> More detailed characterization depends on whether cold is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>
* ''Heat'' (热, {{zh|p=rè}}) is characterized by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>
* ''Vacuity'' (虚, {{zh|p=xū}}) often referred to as "deficiency", can be further differentiated into vacuity of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Qi|qi]], xuě, [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|yin and yang]], with all their respective characteristic symptoms.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> Yin vacuity can also be termed "vacuity-heat", while yang vacuity is equivalent to "vacuity-cold".<ref name="Kaptchuck 2000"/>
* ''Repletion'' (实, {{zh|p=shí}}) often called "excess", generally refers to any disease that can't be identified as a vacuity pattern, and usually indicates the presence of one of the Six Excesses,<ref name="Deng 1999"/> or a pattern of stagnation (of qi, xuě, etc.).<ref>Tierra & Tierra 1998, p. 108</ref> In a concurrent exterior pattern, repletion is characterized by the absence of sweating.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> The signs and symptoms of repletion-cold patterns are equivalent to cold excess patterns, and repletion-heat is similar to heat excess patterns.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>
* ''Yin and yang'' are universal aspects all things can be classified under, this includes diseases in general as well as the Eight Principles' first three couples.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> For example, cold is identified to be a yin aspect, while heat is attributed to yang.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> Since descriptions of patterns in terms of yin and yang lack complexity and clinical practicality, though, patterns are usually not labelled this way anymore.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> Exceptions are vacuity-cold and repletion-heat patterns, who are sometimes referred to as "yin patterns" and "yang patterns" respectively.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>

After the fundamental nature of a disease in terms of the Eight Principles is determined, the investigation focuses on more specific aspects.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> By evaluating the present signs and symptoms against the background of typical disharmony patterns of the various entities, evidence is collected whether or how specific entities are affected.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> This evaluation can be done
# in respect of the meridians (经络辩证, {{zh|p=jīng-luò biàn zhèng}})<ref name="Flaws 1990"/>
# in respect of qi (气血辩证, {{zh|p=qì xuě biàn zhèng}})<ref name="Flaws 1990"/>
# in respect of xuě (气血辩证, {{zh|p=qì xuě biàn zhèng}})<ref name="Flaws 1990"/>
# in respect of the body fluids (津液辩证, {{zh|p= jīn-yė biàn zhèng}})<ref name="Flaws 1990"/>
# in respect of the zàng-fǔ (脏腑辩证, {{zh|p= zàng-fǔ biàn zhèng}})<ref name="Flaws 1990"/> – very similar to this, though less specific, is disharmony pattern description in terms of the Five Elements [五行辩证, {{zh|p=wǔ xíng biàn zhèng}}]<ref name="Flaws 1996"/>)

There are also three special pattern diagnosis systems used in case of febrile and infectious diseases only ("Six Channel system" or "six division pattern" [六经辩证, {{zh|p=liù jīng biàn zhèng}}]; "Wei Qi Ying Xue system" or "four division pattern" [卫气营血辩证, {{zh|p=weì qì yíng xuě biàn zhèng}}]; "San Jiao system" or "three burners pattern" [三角辩证, {{zh|p=sānjiaō biàn zhèng}}]).<ref name="Flaws 1996"/><ref name="Clavey 1995"/>

====Considerations of disease causes====
Although TCM and its concept of disease do not strongly differentiate between cause and effect,<ref name="Ross 1984">Ross, Jeremy (1984) [http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=t23zKB1FSVYC&pg=PA6&dq=Chinese+medicine+is+completely+different;+it+emphasizes+function.+Little&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q=Chinese%20medicine%20is%20completely%20different%3B%20it%20emphasizes%20function.%20Little&f=false "Zang Fu, the organ systems of traditional Chinese medicine"] Elsevier. First edition 1984. ISBN 978-0-443-03482-4</ref> pattern discrimination can include considerations regarding the disease cause; this is called 病因辩证 ({{zh|p=bìngyīn biàn zhèng}}, "disease-cause pattern discrimination").<ref name="Flaws 1990"/>

There are three fundamental categories of disease causes (三因, {{zh|p=sān yīn}}) recognized:<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>
# external causes: these include the Six Excesses and "Pestilential Qi".<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>
# internal causes: the "Seven Affects" (七情, {{zh|p=qì qíng}},<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> sometimes also translated as "Seven Emotions"<ref name="Ross 1984"/>) – joy, anger, brooding, sorrow, fear, fright and grief.<ref name="Ross 1984"/> These are believed to be able to cause damage to the functions of the zàng-fú, especially of the Liver.<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>
# non-external-non-internal causes: dietary irregularities (especially: too much raw, cold, spicy, fatty or sweet food; voracious eating; too much alcohol),<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/> fatigue, sexual intemperance, trauma, and parasites (虫, {{zh|p=chóng}}).<ref name="Wiseman 1996"/>

==Diagnostics==
In TCM, there are five diagnostic methods: inspection, auscultation, olfaction, inquiry, and palpation.<ref name="Cheng 1987">{{cite book | last =Cheng | first = X. | title = Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion (1st ed.) | year = 1987 | publisher = Foreign Languages Press | isbn = 7-119-00378-X}}</ref>

*Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.
*Auscultation refers to listening for particular sounds (such as wheezing).
*Olfaction refers to attending to body odor.
*Inquiry focuses on the "seven inquiries", which involve asking the person about the regularity, severity, or other characteristics of: chills, fever, perspiration, appetite, thirst, taste, defecation, urination, pain, sleep, [[menses]], [[leukorrhea]], and palpation which includes feeling the body for tender [[Acupuncture#Qi, meridians and acupuncture points|A-shi points]], and the palpation of the wrist pulses as well as various other pulses, and palpation of the abdomen.

=== Tongue and pulse ===

Examination of the tongue and the pulse are among the principal diagnostic methods in TCM. Certain sectors of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the zàng-fŭ. For example, teeth marks on one part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the Heart, while teeth marks on another part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the Liver.
  
Pulse palpation involves measuring the pulse both at a superficial and at a deep level at three different locations on the [[radial artery]] (''Cun, Guan, Chi'', located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain zàng-fŭ.  The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength and volume, and described with qualities like "floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick"; each of these qualities indicate certain [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Patterns|disease patterns]]. Learning TCM pulse diagnosis can take several years.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wright, Thomas; Eisenberg, David |title=Encounters with Qi: exploring Chinese medicine |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1995 |pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=DgFA–kVkuZEC&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=false 53–4]|isbn=0-393-31213-5 |oclc= }}</ref>

The term "herbal medicine" is misleading in so far as plant elements are by far the most commonly, but not solely used substances in TCM; animal, human, and mineral products are also utilized.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Thus, the term "medicinal" (instead of herb) is usually preferred.<ref>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.com/?id=uRdIuISvjo4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=wiseman+chinese#v=onepage&q=medicinal&f=false |title=Introduction to English Terminology of Chinese Medicine |author=Nigel Wiseman & Ye Feng |accessdate=10 June 2011|isbn= 9780912111643|date= 2002-08-01}}</ref>

===Prescriptions===
Typically, one batch of medicinals is prepared as a [[decoction]] of about 9 to 18 substances.<ref>"Nach der Erfahrung des Verfassers bewegen sich in der VR China 99% der Rezepturen in einem Bereich zwischen 6 und 20 Kräutern; meist sind es aber zwischen 9 und 18,... ("According to the author's experience, 99% of prescriptions in the PR of China range from 6 to 20 herbs; in the majority, however, it is 9 to 12,...") A seen at: Kiessler, (2005), p. 24</ref> Some of these are considered as main herbs, some as ancillary herbs; within the ancillary herbs, up to three categories can be distinguished.<ref>"Innerhalb einer Rezeptur wird grob zwischen Haupt- und Nebenkräuter unterschieden. Bei klassischen Rezepturen existieren sehr genaue Analysen zur Funktion jeder einzelnen Zutat, die bis zu drei Kategorien (''Chen'', ''Zun'' und ''Chi'') von Nebenkräutern differenzieren." ("Regarding the content of the prescription, one can roughly differentiate between main herbs and ancillary herbs. For classical prescriptions, detailed analyses exist for the function of each single ingredient, discriminating between up to three categories (''Chen'', ''Zun'', and ''Chi'') of ancillary herbs.") As seen at: Kiessler (2005), p. 25</ref>

===Raw materials===

===Traditional categorization===
The traditional categorizations and classifications that can still be found today are:

The classification according to the [[Chinese herbology#Four Natures|Four Natures]] (四气, {{zh|p=sì qì}}): hot, warm, cool, or cold (or, neutral in terms of temperature)<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> and hot and warm herbs are used to treat [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Basic principles of pattern discrimination|cold]] diseases, while cool and cold herbs are used to treat heat diseases.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/>

The classification according to the [[Chinese herbology#The Five Tastes|Five Flavors]], (五味, {{zh|p=wǔ wèi}}, sometimes also translated as Five Tastes): acrid, sweet, bitter, sour, and salty.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> Substances may also have more than one flavor, or none (i.e., a "bland" flavor).<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> Each of the Five Flavors corresponds to one of zàng organs, which in turn corresponds to one of the [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Five Phases theory|Five Phases]].<ref name="Ergil 2009"/> A flavor implies certain properties and therapeutic actions of a substance; e.g., saltiness drains downward and softens hard masses, while sweetness is supplementing, harmonizing, and moistening.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/>

The classification according to the meridian – more precise, the zàng-organ including its associated meridian – which can be expected to be primarily affected by a given medicinal.<ref name="Ergil 2009"/>

===Cupping===
{{Main|Cupping therapy}}
[[File:Kyutoshin.JPG|thumb|Acupuncture and moxibustion after cupping in Japan]]
Cupping (Chinese: 拔罐; pinyin: báguàn) is a type of Chinese massage, consisting of placing several glass "cups" (open spheres) on the body. A match is lit and placed inside the cup and then removed before placing the cup against the skin. As the air in the cup is heated, it expands, and after placing in the skin, cools, creating lower pressure inside the cup that allows the cup to stick to the skin via [[suction]]. When combined with massage oil, the cups can be slid around the back, offering "reverse-pressure massage".

[[Gua Sha]] (Chinese: 刮痧； pinyin: guāshā) is abrading the skin with pieces of smooth jade, bone, animal tusks or horns or smooth stones; until red spots then bruising cover the area to which it is done. It is believed that this treatment is for almost any ailment including cholera. The red spots and bruising take 3 to 10 days to heal, there is often some soreness in the area that has been treated.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tcmwell.com/TCMNaturalTherapy/GuashaCupping/GuaSha-Treatment-of-Disease.html |title = GuaSha Treatment of Disease |publisher=Tcmwell.com |accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref>
