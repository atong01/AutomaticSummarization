'''''Doctor Who''''' is a [[British television science fiction|British]] [[science fiction on television|science-fiction television]] programme produced by the [[BBC]] from 1963 to the present day. The programme depicts the adventures of [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], a [[Time Lord]]—a [[Spacefaring|space]] and [[time travel|time-travelling]] [[humanoid]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]. He explores the universe in his [[TARDIS]], a [[Sentience|sentient]] time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British [[police box]], which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]], the Doctor combats a variety of [[List of Doctor Who villains|foes]], while working to save civilisations<!-- This is acceptable spelling in British English.

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a [[Doctor Who (film)|television film]]. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]] by [[Russell T Davies]], who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. The [[Doctor Who (series 1)|first series]] of the 21st century featured [[Christopher Eccleston]] in the title role and was produced by the BBC. [[Doctor Who (series 2)|Series two]] and [[Doctor Who (series 3)|three]] had some development money contributed by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC), which was credited as a co-producer.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Andrew|last=Gurudata|title=Rage Against the Machine|journal=Enlightenment|issue=147}}</ref> ''Doctor Who'' also spawned [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]] in multiple media, including ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006–2011) and ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007–2011), both created by Russell T Davies; ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009–2010); and a single pilot episode of ''[[K-9 and Company]]'' (1981). There also have been many [[Doctor Who spoofs|spoofs and cultural references]] to the character in other media.

Twelve actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show, as well as the differing approach to the role that each brings, under the concept of [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]]. The show's premise is that this is a life process of [[Time Lord]]s through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality, which occurs after sustaining an injury which would be fatal to most other species. Each actor's portrayal differs, but they are all intended to be aspects of the same character and form part of the same [[Narrative|storyline]]. The time-travelling nature of the plot means that, on occasion, [[story arc]]s have involved different Doctors meeting each other. [[Peter Capaldi]] took on the role after [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith's]] exit in the 2013 Christmas special "[[The Time of the Doctor]]".<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite news|title=Doctor Who: Peter Capaldi revealed as 12th Doctor|date=4 August 2013|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23570354}}</ref>

==Premise==
''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the primary character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]], who simply goes by the name "[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]]". He fled from Gallifrey in a stolen Mark I Type 40 [[TARDIS]] - "Time and Relative Dimension in Space" - time machine which allows him to travel across time and space. The TARDIS has a "chameleon circuit" which normally allows the machine to take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise. However, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[Police box]] due to a malfunction in the chameleon circuit. 

The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. His companions are usually humans, as he has found a fascination with planet Earth. He often finds events that pique his curiosity as he tries to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only his ingenuity and minimal resources, such as his versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. As a Time Lord, the Doctor has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] when his body is mortally damaged, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during his travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.

==History==
{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}
''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]], eighty seconds after the scheduled programme time, 5:15&nbsp;pm, on [[November 1963#November 23, 1963 (Saturday)|Saturday, 23 November 1963]].<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), p. 54</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml|title=An Unearthly Child|publisher=BBC|date=16 August 2012}}</ref> It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]], Canadian [[Sydney Newman]], was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157–230 ("Production Diary")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947–1979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode "[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience,<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]]s were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any "[[bug-eyed monster]]s". The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but ''The Mutants'' was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; "We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;— we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that." Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' [[List of Doctor Who serials|serial]]&nbsp;– ''[[The Daleks]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 ISBN 978-1-84990-232-8 Pg9</ref>

The BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]]. Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by [[Jonathan Powell (producer)|Jonathan Powell]], controller of BBC 1.<ref name="powell">{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/bbc/story/0,,1511487,00.html|title=Doctor Who makes the Grade|first=Jason|last=Deans|work=The Guardian|quote=But Mr Grade was not at the helm when Doctor Who was finally retired for good in 1989&nbsp;— that decision fell to the then BBC1 controller, Jonathan Powell.|date=21 June 2005|accessdate=4 February 2007|location=London}}</ref> Although (as series co-star [[Sophie Aldred]] reported in the documentary ''Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS'') it was effectively, if not formally, [[cancellation (television)|cancelled]] with the decision not to commission a planned 27th series of the show for transmission in 1990, the BBC repeatedly affirmed that the series would return.<ref name="8thdrspecial"/>

While in-house production had ceased, the BBC hoped to find an independent production company to relaunch the show. [[Philip Segal]], a British [[expatriate]] who worked for [[Columbia Pictures]]' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th series was still in production.<ref name="8thdrspecial">Doctor Who Magazine Eighth Doctor Special, Panini Comics 2003</ref> Segal's negotiations eventually led to a [[Doctor Who (film)|''Doctor Who'' television film]], broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], the BBC and [[BBC Worldwide]]. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1&nbsp;million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.<ref name="8thdrspecial" />

Licensed media such as novels and audio plays provided [[Doctor Who spin-offs|new stories]], but as a television programme ''Doctor Who'' remained dormant until 2003. In September of that year,<ref>{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|title=Doctor Who returns to BBC1 screens|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/sep/26/bbc.broadcasting|work=The Guardian|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=26 September 2003|location=London}}</ref> [[BBC Television]] announced the in-house production of a new series after several years of attempts by BBC Worldwide to find backing for a feature film version. The executive producers of the new incarnation of the series were writer [[Russell T Davies]] and [[BBC Cymru Wales]] head of drama [[Julie Gardner]].

''Doctor Who'' finally returned with the episode [[Rose (Doctor Who)|"Rose"]] on BBC One on 26 March 2005.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who is Saturday night hit|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4385801.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> There have since been nine further series in 2006–2008 and 2010–2015, and Christmas Day specials every year since 2005.

In 2010, [[Steven Moffat]] replaced Davies as [[head writer]] and executive producer.<ref name=RTDgone>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who guru Davies steps down|publisher=BBC News|date=20 May 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref>

The 2005 version of ''Doctor Who'' is a direct [[Continuity (fiction)|plot continuation]] of the original 1963–1989 series<ref group=note>This is often emphasised in the accompanying making-of documentaries in the series ''Doctor Who Confidential'', as well as in occasional flashbacks to images of earlier versions of the Doctor.</ref> and the 1996 telefilm. This differs from other series relaunches which have either been reboots (for example, ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and ''[[Bionic Woman (2007 TV series)|Bionic Woman]]'') or set in the same universe as the original but in a different time period and with different characters (for example, ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and spin-offs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/newseriesfaq.php |title=Outpost Gallifrey: TV Series FAQ |publisher=gallifreyone.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090601210834/http://www.gallifreyone.com:80/newseriesfaq.php |archivedate=1 June 2009 }}</ref>

The programme has been sold to many other countries worldwide (see [[#Viewership|Viewership]]).

===Public consciousness===
It has been claimed that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the [[Assassination of John F.

With popularity came controversy over the show's suitability for children.

The phrase "[[Behind the sofa|Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa]]" entered British [[popular culture|pop culture]], signifying in humour the stereotypical early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a [[television program]]me while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|first=Sam|last=Leith|title=Worshipping Doctor Who from behind the sofa|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/samleith/3560202/Worshipping-Doctor-Who-from-behind-the-sofa.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-07-04|accessdate=2008-07-05|quote=The cliché about ''Doctor Who'' — that it had us "hiding behind the sofa" — is more telling in its tone than its questionable factuality.

A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that, by their own definition of violence ("any act[s] which may cause physical and/or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental") ''Doctor Who'' was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time.<ref name="times-violence">{{cite news|title=Violence is not really Dr Who's cup of tea|work=The Times|first=Philip|last=Howard|date=29 January 1972|page=2}}</ref> The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as "very unsuitable" for family viewing.<ref name="times-audience">{{cite news|title=The Times Diary&nbsp;— Points of view|work=The Times|date=27 January 1972|page=16}}</ref> Responding to the findings of the survey in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that, "to compare the violence of ''Dr Who'', sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously."<ref name="times-violence"/>

The image of the [[TARDIS]] has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness; BBC scriptwriter [[Anthony Coburn]], who lived in the resort of [[Herne Bay, Kent]], was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-13411516|title=Doctor Who fan in tardis replica plan for Herne Bay|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref> In 1996, the BBC applied for a trade mark to use the TARDIS' blue [[police box]] design in merchandising associated with ''Doctor Who''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002104259|title=Case details for Trade Mark UK00002104259|accessdate=27 October 2013|work=[[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|UK Patent Office]]}}</ref> In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trade mark claim; but in 2002, the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|Patent Office]] ruled in favour of the BBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm/t-decisionmaking/t-challenge/t-challenge-decision-results/t-challenge-decision-results-bl?BL_Number=O/336/02|title=Trade mark decision|accessdate=17 January 2007|work=[[UK Intellectual Property Office|UK Patent Office]] website}}<br />{{cite web|url=http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm//legal/decisions/2002/o33602.pdf|title=In the matter of application No. 2104259 by The British Broadcasting Corporation to register a series of three marks in Classes 9, 16, 25 and 41 AND IN THE MATTER OF Opposition thereto under No. 48452 by The Metropolitan Police Authority|accessdate=17 January 2007|last=Knight|first=Mike|work=[[UK Intellectual Property Office|UK Patent Office]]|format=PDF}}<br />{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2352743.stm|title=BBC wins police Tardis case|accessdate=17 January 2007|date=23 October 2002|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

{{Further|List of Doctor Who serials}}
''Doctor Who'' originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989.

The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule.<ref name="Doctor Who Education">{{cite web|title=10 things you didn't know about Doctor Who|url=http://uktv.co.uk/watch/stepbystep/aid/576125|publisher=[[Watch (TV channel)|Watch]]|accessdate=20 January 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110116052952/http://uktv.co.uk/watch/stepbystep/aid/576125|archivedate=16 January 2011}}</ref> Initially, it alternated stories set in the past, which were intended to teach younger audience members about history, with stories set either in the future or in outer space to teach them about science.<ref name="Doctor Who Education" /> This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.<ref name="Doctor Who Education" />

However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme and the "historicals", which were not popular with the production team,<ref name="Doctor Who Education" /> were dropped after ''[[The Highlanders (Doctor Who)|The Highlanders]]'' (1967). While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: ''[[Black Orchid (Doctor Who)|Black Orchid]]'' set in 1920s England.<ref name=Orchid>''[[Black Orchid (Doctor Who)|Black Orchid]]''.

The early stories were serial-like in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes.<ref name="BBC Doctor Who Episode List">{{cite web|title=Doctor Who Episode List|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/treasurehunt/missing/drwho.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 October 2013}}</ref> Following ''[[The Gunfighters]]'' (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, with the individual parts simply being assigned episode numbers.<ref name="BBC Doctor Who Episode List" />

The serial format changed for the [[Doctor Who (series 1)|2005 revival]], with each series usually consisting of 13 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended episode broadcast on Christmas Day. Each series includes several standalone and multi-part stories, linked with a loose story arc that resolves in the series finale. As in the early "classic" era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title. Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]" from 2008 and "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length.

{{DW episode count}} ''Doctor Who'' instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes (the most common format), 45-minute episodes (for ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'' in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the revival), two feature-length productions (1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' and the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]]), eight [[Christmas special#Television series specials|Christmas specials]] (most of 60 minutes' duration, one of 72 minutes), and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010 and 2013. Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005 and 2007 [[Children in Need]] charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a ''Doctor Who''-themed edition of [[The Proms]]. The 1993 2-part story, entitled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' and was filmed partly on the ''EastEnders'' set. A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of [[Comic Relief]]. Starting with the 2009 special "[[Planet of the Dead]]", the series was filmed in [[1080i]] for [[HDTV]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Doctor Who to be filmed in HD |url=http://www.drwho-online.co.uk/news/#newseries-hd0 |work=Doctor Who Online |date=4 February 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090129135006/http://drwho-online.co.uk:80/news/ |archivedate=29 January 2009 }}</ref> and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and [[BBC HD]].

===Missing episodes===
{{Main|Doctor Who missing episodes}}
Between about 1964 and 1973, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC's various video tape and film libraries were either destroyed,<ref group=note>The tapes, based on a [[405-line television system|405-line broadcast standard]], were rendered obsolete when UK television changed to a [[625-line television system|625-line signal]] in preparation for the soon-to-begin colour transmissions.</ref> [[wiping|wiped]], or suffered from poor storage which led to severe deterioration from [[broadcast quality]]. This included many old episodes of ''Doctor Who'', mostly stories featuring the first two Doctors: [[William Hartnell]] and [[Patrick Troughton]]. In all, 97 of 253 episodes produced during the first six years of the programme are not held in the BBC's archives (most notably seasons 3, 4, & 5, from which 79 episodes are missing). In 1972, almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the BBC,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/archive.htm|title=BBC Archive Holdings|first=Richard|last=Molesworth|work=[[Doctor Who Restoration Team]]|quote=A full set was held at least until early 1972, as 16 mm black and white film negatives (apart&nbsp;— of course&nbsp;— from 'Masterplan' 7). .|accessdate=30 April 2007}}</ref> while by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes and destroying "spare" film copies had been brought to a stop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/archive.htm|title=BBC Archive Holdings|first=Richard|last=Molesworth|work=[[Doctor Who Restoration Team]]|quote=the videotapes began to be wiped, or re-used, until the formation of the BBC's Film and Videotape Library in 1978 put a stop to this particular practice.|accessdate=30 April 2007}}</ref>

No 1960s episodes exist on their original videotapes (all surviving prints being film transfers), though some were transferred to film for editing before transmission, and exist in their broadcast form.<ref name="Doctor Who Restoring and Reconstructing Missing Episodes">{{cite news|title='Doctor Who': Restoring and Reconstructing Missing Episodes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A14066589|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 January 2012}}</ref>

Some episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries who bought prints for broadcast, or by private individuals who acquired them by various means. Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts filmed from the television screen onto 8&nbsp;mm [[cine film]] and clips that were shown on other programmes. Audio versions of all of the lost episodes exist from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show. Short clips from every story with the exception of ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', "[[Mission to the Unknown]]" and ''[[The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve]]'' also exist.

In addition to these, there are off-screen photographs made by photographer [[John Cura]], who was hired by various production personnel to document many of their programmes during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''Doctor Who''. These have been used in [[Doctor Who missing episodes#Reconstruction|fan reconstructions]] of the serials. These amateur reconstructions have been tolerated by the BBC, provided they are not sold for profit and are distributed as low-quality VHS copies.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewinski|first=John Scott|title=Fans Reconstruct Doctor Who's Trashed Past|url=http://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/09/who-recon/|work=Wired|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=29 September 2008}}</ref>

One of the most sought-after lost episodes is part four of the last William Hartnell serial, ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' (1966), which ends with the [[First Doctor]] transforming into the [[Second Doctor|Second]]. The only portion of this in existence, barring a few poor-quality silent 8&nbsp;mm clips, is the few seconds of the regeneration scene, as it was shown on the children's magazine show ''[[Blue Peter]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Lara|title=Zimbabwe 'hoarding lost 'Who' episodes'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a147355/zimbabwe-hoarding-lost-who-episodes.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=20 February 2009}}</ref> With the approval of the BBC, efforts are now under way to restore as many of the episodes as possible from the extant material.

"Official" reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on MP3 [[CD-ROM]], and as special features on DVD. The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio [[Cosgrove Hall Films|Cosgrove Hall]], reconstructed the missing episodes 1 and 4 of ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'' (1968), using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial's DVD release in November 2006. The missing episodes of ''[[The Reign of Terror (Doctor Who)|The Reign of Terror]]'' were animated by animation company Theta-Sigma, in collaboration with [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]], and became available for purchase in May 2013 through Amazon.com.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2011/06/dwn210611211508-reign-of-terror-update.html|title=The Reign of Terror&nbsp;— animation update|publisher=[[Doctor Who News Page]]|first=Chuck|last=Foster|date=21 June 2011}}</ref> Subsequent animations made in 2013 include ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', ''[[The Ice Warriors]]'' and ''[[The Moonbase]]''.

In April 2006, ''[[Blue Peter]]'' launched a challenge to find missing Doctor Who episodes with the promise of a full-scale [[Dalek]] model as a reward.<ref>{{cite web|date=April 2006|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/bluepeter/content/articles/2006/04/19/doctor_who_feature.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060424144255/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/bluepeter/content/articles/2006/04/19/doctor_who_feature.shtml|archivedate=24 April 2006|title=Blue Peter&nbsp;— Missing Doctor Who tapes|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 April 2006}}</ref>

In December 2011, it was announced that part 3 of ''[[Galaxy 4]]'' and part 2 of ''[[The Underwater Menace]]'' had been returned to the BBC by a fan who had purchased them in the mid-1980s without realising that the BBC did not hold copies of them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mulkern|first=Patrick|title=Doctor Who: two long-lost episodes uncovered|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-12-11/doctor-who-two-long-lost-episodes-uncovered|accessdate=11 December 2011|newspaper=Radio Times|date=11 December 2011}}</ref>

==Characters==
{{See also|List of Doctor Who cast members}}

===The Doctor===
{{Main|The Doctor (Doctor Who)}}
[[File:Versions of the Doctor.jpg|thumb|right|251px|<div class="center">The Doctor portrayed by series leads in chronological order. Left to right from top row; [[William Hartnell]], [[Patrick Troughton]], [[Jon Pertwee]], [[Tom Baker]], [[Peter Davison]], [[Colin Baker]], [[Sylvester McCoy]], [[Paul McGann]], [[Christopher Eccleston]], [[David Tennant]], [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] and [[Peter Capaldi]].</div>]]

The character of the Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. All that was known about him in the programme's early days was that he was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable [[Time travel|time machine]], the "[[TARDIS]]" (an [[acronym]] for time and relative dimension(s) in space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside (a quality referred to as "dimensional transcendentality").<ref group=note>When it became an entry in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word "TARDIS" often came to be used to describe anything that appeared larger on the inside than its exterior implied.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/424|title=Full record for Tardis-like adj.|work=Science Fiction Citations|accessdate=7 September 2007}}</ref>

The initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellowed into a more compassionate figure. It was eventually revealed that he had been on the run from his own people, the [[Time Lord]]s of the planet [[Gallifrey]].

====Changes of appearance====
Producers introduced the concept of [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] to permit the recasting of the main character. This was first prompted by original star [[William Hartnell]]'s poor health. The actual term "regeneration" was not initially conceived of until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration however; Hartnell's Doctor had merely described undergoing a "renewal," and the Second Doctor underwent a "change of appearance".{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The serials ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' and ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' and the 1996 [[Doctor Who (film)|TV film]] would later establish that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This line became stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Berriman|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2010/10/26/interview-russell-t-davies-talks-about-that-sarah-jane-adventures-line/|title=Interview: Russell T Davies Talks About THAT Sarah Jane Adventures Line|publisher=SFX.co.uk|date=26 October 2010|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwho.tv/whats-new/article/steven-moffat-on-doctor-numbers-and-the-regeneration-limit|title=Steven Moffat on ‘Doctor numbers’ and the regeneration limit|author=Darren Scott|date=26 November 2013}}</ref> The episode "[[The Time of the Doctor]]" depicted the Doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations, starting from the [[Twelfth Doctor]], due to the [[Eleventh Doctor]] being the product of the Doctor's twelfth regeneration from his original set.<!--A note explaining this can go here, but it would be best not to digress into an explanation of the circumstances of a particular regeneration in the paragraph which introduces the general concept--><ref name=507joke>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2010/10/26/interview-russell-t-davies-talks-about-that-sarah-jane-adventures-line/|publisher=http://www.sfx.co.uk/|title=INTERVIEW Russell T Davies talks about THAT Sarah Jane Adventures line|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/12/doctor-who-immortal-reveals-bbc|title=Doctor Who is now immortal, reveals the BBC |author=Emily Barr |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref>

In addition to those actors who have headlined the series, others have portrayed versions of the Doctor in guest roles. Notably, in 2013, [[John Hurt]] guest-starred as a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the [[War Doctor]] in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]".<ref name="HurtDoctor">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/10065201/Doctor-Who-The-Name-of-the-Doctor-BBC-One-review.html|title=Doctor Who: The Name of the Doctor, BBC One, review|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=22 May 2013|author=Hogan, Michael}}</ref> He is shown in mini-episode "[[The Night of the Doctor]]" to have been [[retroactive continuity|retroactively inserted]] into the show's fictional chronology between McGann and Eccleston's Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors.<ref name="HurtDoctorNumber">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a533505/doctor-who-steven-moffat-on-regeneration-limit.html?rss|title='Doctor Who': Steven Moffat on regeneration limit|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=24 November 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013|author=Rigby, Sam}}</ref> Another example is from the 1986 serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'', where [[Michael Jayston]] portrayed the [[Valeyard]], who is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between his twelfth and final incarnation.

On rare occasions, other actors have stood in for the lead. In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].

The casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation: in particular, the desirability or possibility of a new Doctor being played by a woman.<ref>Ted B. Kissell.

====Meetings of different incarnations====
There have been instances of actors returning at later dates to reprise the role of their specific Doctor. In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted [[Shada]] episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short "[[Time Crash]]" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, "[[The Day of the Doctor]]", [[David Tennant]]'s [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|city=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story ''[[The Space Museum]]'' (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story ''[[Day of the Daleks]]'', the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story ''[[Logopolis]]'', the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in "[[Father's Day (Doctor Who)|Father's Day]]", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in "[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]". In "[[The Almost People]]" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica. In "[[The Name of the Doctor]]", the [[Eleventh Doctor]] meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as "his secret" and who is subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name="HurtDoctor" />

Additionally, multiple Doctors have returned in new adventures together in audio dramas based on the series. Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy appeared together in the 1999 audio adventure ''[[The Sirens of Time]]''. To celebrate the 40th anniversary in 2003, an audio drama titled ''[[Zagreus (audio drama)|Zagreus]]'' featuring Paul McGann, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Peter Davison was released with additional archive recordings of Jon Pertwee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/50-Doctor-Who-Zagreus|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;— Zagreus|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref> Again in 2003, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy appeared together in the audio adventure ''[[Project Lazarus|Project: Lazarus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/45-Doctor-Who-Project--Lazarus|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;— Project: Lazarus|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref> In 2010, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann came together again to star in the audio drama ''[[The Four Doctors]]''.

====Revelations about the Doctor====
{{See also|Doctor (Doctor Who)#Continuity inconsistencies|l1=Doctor Who Continuity inconsistencies}}

Throughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor may not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted may have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms "Fourth", the First Doctor excitedly replies "Goodness me. So there are five of me now." In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself "the Eleventh" in "[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]". In the 2013 episode "The Time of the Doctor," the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied "Fall of the Eleventh" which had been trailed throughout the series.

During the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]], the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being "half human".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|title=Doctor Who: the TV movie|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2008}}</ref> The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that "purists tend to disregard this",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;— FAQ&nbsp;— Plot and Continuity|publisher=BBC|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.

The programme's first serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]]. In the 1967 serial, ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', when [[Victoria Waterfield]] doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, "being so ancient", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to—"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in "[[The Empty Child]]" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, "Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither." The Doctor remarks in response, "Yeah, I know the feeling." In "[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, "No, not any more." In both "[[Fear Her]]" (2006) and "[[The Doctor's Daughter]]" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.

In "[[The Wedding of River Song]]" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in "The Name of the Doctor" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the [[Great Intelligence]] to enter his tomb, and in "The Time of the Doctor" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe, an event opposed by many species.

===Companions===
{{Main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}
The companion figure - generally a human - has been a constant feature in ''Doctor Who'' since the programme's inception in 1963. One of the roles of the companion is to remind the Doctor of his "moral duty".<ref name=Overview>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7736130.stm|title=Doctor Who (before the Tardis)|publisher=BBC News|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]) and her teachers [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]) and [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (actor)|William Russell]]). These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]''. Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;— or loves&nbsp;— on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.

Since the 2005 revival, The Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|title=Steven Moffat: the companion is the main character in Doctor Who, not the Doctor|work=Radio Times|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|title='Doctor Who' returns: Steven Moffat talks new companion Clara and Jenna-Louise Coleman|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|last=Berkshire|first=Geoff|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref> The primary companions of the [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors were [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) with [[Mickey Smith]] ([[Noel Clarke]]), [[Jackie Tyler]] ([[Camille Coduri]]) and [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) recurring as secondary companion figures.<ref name=AbsentPostcolonial>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature|doi=10.1177/0021989410366891|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/207|title="Sociopathetic Abscess" or "Yawning Chasm"?

Some companions have gone on to re-appear either in the main series, or in spin-offs. Sarah Jane Smith became the central character in ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007-2011) following a return to ''Doctor Who'' in 2006. Guest stars in the series included former companions Jo Grant, [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]], and [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] ([[Nicholas Courtney]]). The character of Jack Harkness also served to launch a spin-off, ''[[Torchwood]]'', (2006-2011) in which Martha Jones also appeared.

===Adversaries===
{{See also|List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens|List of Doctor Who villains}}
When Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the cliché of the "[[bug-eyed monster]]" of science fiction.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who (before the Tardis)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7736130.stm|publisher=BBC Magazine|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=3 January 2009}}</ref> However, [[monster]]s were popular with audiences and so became a staple of ''Doctor Who'' almost from the beginning.

With the show's 2005 revival, executive producer Russell T Davies stated<ref>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who series two secrets revealed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4100000/newsid_4104500/4104586.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 August 2013|date=19 June 2005}}</ref> his intention to reintroduce classic [[Cultural icon|icons]] of ''Doctor Who'' one step at a time: the [[Auton]]s with the Nestene Consciousness and [[Dalek]]s in series 1, [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] in series 2, the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Macra|Macra]] and [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] in series 3, the [[Sontaran]]s and [[Davros]] in series 4, and the [[Time Lord]]s ([[Rassilon]]) in the 2009–10 Specials. Davies' successor, Steven Moffat, has continued the trend by reviving the [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurians]] in series 5, [[Cybermat]]s in series 6, the [[Great Intelligence]] and the [[Ice Warrior]]s in Series 7, and [[Zygon]]s in the 50th Anniversary Special.<ref>{{cite video|people=|year=2011|title=Monster Files: Cybermats|medium=|publisher=iTunes Store|time=}}</ref> Since its 2005 return, the series has also introduced new recurring aliens: [[Slitheen]] (Raxacoricofallapatorian), [[Ood]], [[Judoon]], [[Weeping Angel]]s and [[Silence (Doctor Who)|the Silence]].

Besides infrequent appearances by the Ice Warriors, [[Ogron]]s, the [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]], and [[Black Guardian]], three adversaries have become particularly iconic: the Daleks, the Cybermen, and the Master.

====Daleks====
{{Main|Dalek}}
The Dalek race, which first appeared in the show's second serial in 1963,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0562905/|title=The Dead Planet|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> are ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s oldest villains. The Daleks were [[Kaled]]s from the planet [[Skaro]], mutated by the scientist [[Davros]] and housed in tank-like mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopi with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells contain a single eye-stalk to allow them vision, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a [[directed-energy weapon]]. Their main weakness is their eyestalk; most attacks on them, including those from guns and [[baseball bat]]s, will blind them, making them go mad. Their chief role in the plot of the series, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to "exterminate" all non-Dalek beings, even attacking the [[Time Lord]]s in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], which was not shown until the 50th Anniversary celebrating the show, where some snippets of the Time War are shown. The Daleks' most recent appearance was in the 2014 episode "[[Into the Dalek]]". They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise. Davros himself has also been a recurring figure since his debut in ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'', although played by several different actors.

The Daleks were created by writer [[Terry Nation]] (who intended them to be an [[allegory]] of the [[Nazism|Nazis]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nationterry/nationterry.htm|title=NATION, TERRY|accessdate=19 May 2008}}</ref> and BBC designer [[Raymond Cusick]].<ref name="cusick">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21563344|title=Doctor Who Dalek designer Ray Cusick dies after illness|publisher=BBC|date=24 February 2013|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref> The Daleks' début in the programme's second serial, ''[[The Daleks]]'' (1963–64), made both the Daleks and ''Doctor Who'' very popular. A Dalek appeared on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Lord Snowdon]]. In the new series, Daleks come in a range of colours; the colour of a Dalek denotes its role within the species. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In the 2012 episode "Asylum of the Daleks", every generation of the Dalek species made an appearance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Every generation of The Daleks returning to 'Doctor Who'|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/showbiz/302328-every-generation-of-the-daleks-returning-to-doctor-who/|work=[[BANG Showbiz]]|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=3 April 2012|location=England}}</ref>

====Cybermen====
{{Main|Cyberman}}

Cybermen were originally a wholly organic species of humanoids originating on Earth's [[Counter-Earth|twin planet]] Mondas that began to implant more and more artificial parts into their bodies. This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating [[cyborg]]s, with emotions usually only shown when naked aggression was called for. With the demise of Mondas, they acquired Telos as their new home planet. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the ''Doctor Who'' franchise.

The 2006 series introduced a totally new variation of Cybermen. These Cybus Cybermen were created in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] by the mad inventor John Lumic; he was attempting to preserve the humans by transplanting their brains into powerful metal bodies, sending them orders using a mobile phone network and inhibiting their emotions with an electronic chip.

====The Master====
{{Main|Master (Doctor Who)}}
The Master is the Doctor's [[archenemy]], a renegade [[Time Lord]] who desires to rule the universe. Conceived as "[[Professor Moriarty]] to the Doctor's [[Sherlock Holmes]]",<ref>''Doctor Who Magazine Special Edition'' No. 2, 5 September 2002, [subtitled ''The Complete Third Doctor''], p. 14.</ref> the character first appeared in 1971. As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, since the Master is a Time Lord as well and able to regenerate; the first of these actors was [[Roger Delgado]], who continued in the role until his death in 1973. The Master was briefly played by [[Peter Pratt]] and [[Geoffrey Beevers]] until [[Anthony Ainley]] took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's hiatus in 1989. The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of ''[[Doctor Who (1996 film)|Doctor Who]]'', and was played by American actor [[Eric Roberts]].

Following the series revival in 2005, [[Derek Jacobi]] provided the character's re-introduction in the 2007 episode "[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]". During that story the role was then assumed by [[John Simm]] who returned to the role multiple times through the [[Tenth Doctor]]'s tenure.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/news/latest/090728_news_02 John Simm Returns for the Finale!]</ref>
As of the 2014 episode "[[Dark Water (Doctor Who)|Dark Water]]," it was revealed that the Master had become a female incarnation or "Time Lady," going by the name of "Missy" (short for Mistress, the feminine equivalent of "Master"). This incarnation is played by [[Michelle Gomez]].

==Music==
{{See also|List of Doctor Who composers}}

===Theme music===
{{Main|Doctor Who theme music}}
{{Listen|filename=Doctor Who theme excerpt.ogg|title=Doctor Who theme excerpt|description=An excerpt from the original (1963) classic theme music to ''Doctor Who''}}

The [[Doctor Who theme music|''Doctor Who'' theme music]] was one of the first [[electronic music]] signature tunes for television, and after five decades remains one of the most easily recognised. It has been often called both memorable and frightening, priming the viewer for what was to follow. During the 1970s, the ''[[Radio Times]]'', the BBC's own [[listings magazine]], announced that a child's mother said the theme music terrified her son. The ''Radio Times'' was apologetic, but the theme music remained.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]]. The various parts were built up using [[musique concrète]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 17 (1979–80)|season 17]] (1979–80). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines.

A different arrangement was recorded by [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] for [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 18 (1980–81)|season 18]] (1980), which was in turn replaced by [[Dominic Glynn]]'s arrangement for the season-long serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' in [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 23 (1986)|season 23]] (1986). [[Keff McCulloch]] provided the new arrangement for the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s era which lasted from [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 24 (1987)|season 24]] (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989. American composer [[John Debney]] created a new arrangement of [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme for ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]'' in 1996. For the return of the series in 2005, [[Murray Gold]] provided a new arrangement which featured [[sampling (music)|samples]] from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode "[[The Christmas Invasion]]", Gold introduced a modified closing credits arrangement that was used up until the conclusion of the 2007 series.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, "[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]"; Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gallifreynewsbase.blogspot.com/2010/01/murray-gold-returns.html|title=Murray Gold Returns|date=3 January 2010|work=Doctor Who News Page}}</ref> He was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/7603262/Doctor-Who-nasty-new-theme-tune-angers-fans.html|title=Doctor Who: 'nasty' new theme tune angers fans|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 April 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes.

Versions of the "Doctor Who Theme" have also been released as pop music over the years. In the early 1970s, Jon Pertwee, who had played the Third Doctor, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, "Who Is the Doctor".<ref group=note>Often mistitled "I am the Doctor" on YouTube uploads. Originally released as a 7" vinyl single, plain sleeve, December 1972 on label Purple PUR III</ref> In 1978 a disco version of the theme was released in the UK, Denmark and Australia by the group Mankind, which reached number 24 in the UK charts. In 1988 the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as [[The KLF]]) released the single "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including "Rock and Roll Part 2" by [[Gary Glitter]] (who recorded vocals for some of the CD-single remix versions of "Doctorin' the Tardis").<ref name="guardianmusic">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/07/doctor_who_a_musical_force.html|title=Doctor Who: a musical force?|accessdate=7 July 2008|last=Peel|first=Ian|date=7 July 2008|work=The Guardian|publisher=blog|location=London}}</ref> Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]],<ref name="guardianmusic" /> [[Pink Floyd]],<ref name="guardianmusic" /> the Australian string ensemble [[FourPlay Electric String Quartet|Fourplay]], New Zealand punk band [[Blam Blam Blam]], [[The Pogues]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Dub Syndicate]], and the comedians [[Bill Bailey]] and [[Mitch Benn]]. Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]''. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme. In January 2011 the Mankind version was released as a [[music download|digital download]] on the album ''Gallifrey And Beyond''.

===Incidental music===
{{Main|List of music featured on Doctor Who}}
{{See also|List of Doctor Who music releases}}
Most of the innovative incidental music for ''Doctor Who'' has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used [[Royalty free music|stock music]], as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or [[cover version]]s of songs by popular music acts such as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]]. Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.

The incidental music for the first ''Doctor Who'' adventure, ''An Unearthly Child'', was written by [[Norman Kay (composer)|Norman Kay]]. Many of the stories of the [[William Hartnell]] period were scored by electronic music pioneer [[Tristram Cary]], whose ''Doctor Who'' credits include ''The Daleks'', ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', ''The Daleks' Master Plan'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''[[The Mutants]]''. Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].

The most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).

In 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. [[Paddy Kingsland]] and [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included [[Roger Limb]], [[Malcolm Clarke]] and [[Jonathan Gibbs (composer)|Jonathan Gibbs]].

The Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' series, and [[Keff McCulloch]] took over as the series' main composer until the end of its run, with [[Dominic Glynn]] and [[Mark Ayres]] also contributing scores.

All the incidental music for the 2005 revived series has been composed by [[Murray Gold]] and [[Ben Foster (orchestrator)|Ben Foster]] and has been performed by the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] from the 2005 Christmas episode "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" onwards. A concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series took place on 19 November 2006 to raise money for Children in Need. David Tennant hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert. Murray Gold and [[Russell T Davies]] answered questions during the interval and [[Dalek]]s and [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] appeared whilst music from their stories was played. The concert aired on [[BBC Red Button|BBCi]] on Christmas Day 2006. A [[Doctor Who Prom (2008)|Doctor Who Prom]] was celebrated on 27 July 2008 in the [[Royal Albert Hall]] as part of the annual [[BBC Proms]]. The BBC Philharmonic and the [[London Philharmonic Choir]] performed Murray Gold's compositions for the series, conducted by Ben Foster, as well as a selection of classics based on the theme of space and time. The event was presented by [[Freema Agyeman]] and guest-presented by various other stars of the show with numerous monsters participating in the proceedings. It also featured the specially filmed mini-episode "[[Music of the Spheres (Doctor Who)|Music of the Spheres]]", written by Russell T Davies and starring David Tennant.<ref>{{cite web|date=27 July 2008|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2008/whatson/2707.shtml|title=BBC Prom 27 July 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref>

== Logo history ==
Below is a collection of current and past ''Doctor Who'' logos from the classic and current series. The different doctors have been named below the logos that have appeared during their tenure.

The original logo used for the First Doctor (and briefly for the Second Doctor) was reused in a slightly modified format for the 50th anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]" during the Eleventh Doctor's run. The logo used in the [[Doctor Who (film)|television movie]] featuring the Eighth Doctor was an updated version of the logo used for the Third Doctor. The logo from 1973–80 was used for the Third Doctor's final season and for the majority of the Fourth Doctor's tenure. The following logo, while most associated with the Fifth Doctor, was also used for the Fourth Doctor's final season. The logo used for the Ninth Doctor was slightly edited for the Tenth Doctor, but it retained the same general appearance. The logo used for the Eleventh Doctor had the "DW" TARDIS portion removed in 2012, but the same font remained, albeit with a slight edit to the texture every episode, with the texture relating to some aspect of the story, and the font was later subtly altered, as well as made slightly larger. for the Twelfth Doctor. As of 2014, the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors is the primary logo used on all media and merchandise relating to past Doctors, and the current ''Doctor Who'' logo is used for all merchandise relating to the current Doctor.

Premiering the day after the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], the first episode of ''Doctor Who'' was repeated with the second episode the following week. ''Doctor Who'' has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; episodes are now repeated on [[BBC Three]]. The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings.<ref name="ratings chart">{{cite news|first=Matt |last=Hilton |title=Doctor Who&nbsp;— Top Chart Placing&nbsp;– 1963–2008 |url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/picview.php?ret=news&sub=news&id=season4_final_4.jpg |work=Doctor Who News Page |publisher=[[Outpost Gallifrey]] |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=16 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080719041204/http://www.gallifreyone.com:80/picview.php?ret=news&sub=news&id=season4_final_4.jpg |archivedate=19 July 2008 }};{{cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/picview.php?ret=news&sub=news&id=2007_ratings.jpg|title=Doctor Who Top Ratings: 1963–2007|accessdate=17 July 2008|first=Matt|last=Hilton|date=11 January 2008|work=Doctor Who News Page|publisher=[[Outpost Gallifrey]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080315003100/http://www.gallifreyone.com/picview.php?ret=news&sub=news&id=2007_ratings.jpg|archivedate=15 March 2008}}</ref> The first of these was the "[[Dalekmania]]" period (circa 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought ''Doctor Who'' ratings of between 9 and 14&nbsp;million, even for stories which did not feature them.<ref name="ratings chart" /><ref>{{cite news|first=Douglas |last=Marlborough |title=Dead, but they won't lie down |url=http://www.cuttingsarchive.org.uk/news_mag/1960s/cuttings/dead.htm |format=Reprint, hosted on Doctor Who Cuttings Archive |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=28 December 1964 |accessdate=16 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060619093807/http://cuttingsarchive.org.uk:80/news_mag/1960s/cuttings/dead.htm |archivedate=19 June 2006 }}</ref> The second was the late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12&nbsp;million.<ref name="ratings chart" />

During the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Figures remained respectable into the 1980s, but fell noticeably after the programme's 23rd series was postponed in 1985 and the show was off the air for 18 months. Its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme's 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'', the most popular show at the time. After the series' revival in 2005 (the third notable period of high ratings), it has consistently had high viewership levels for the evening on which the episode is broadcast.<ref name="ratings chart" />

''Doctor Who'' is one of the five top grossing titles for [[BBC Worldwide]], the BBC's commercial arm.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Sweney|title=Profits grow at BBC Worldwide|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jul/08/bbc.television2|work=The Guardian|date=8 July 2008|accessdate=8 July 2008|location=London}}</ref> BBC Worldwide CEO [[John Smith (BBC executive)|John Smith]] has said that ''Doctor Who'' is one of a small number of "Superbrands" which Worldwide will promote heavily.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gavin|last=O'Connor|title=Daleks speak to all nations|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/07/13/daleks-speak-to-all-nations-91466-21331585/|work=[[Wales on Sunday]]|date=13 July 2008|accessdate=13 July 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080715043335/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/07/13/daleks-speak-to-all-nations-91466-21331585/|archivedate=15 July 2008}}</ref>

Only four episodes have ever had their premiere showings on channels other than BBC One. The 1983 20th anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' had its début on 23 November (the actual date of the anniversary) on a number of PBS stations two days prior to its BBC One broadcast. The 1988 story ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'' was broadcast with all three episodes airing back to back on [[Television New Zealand|TVNZ]] in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there. Finally, the 1996 television film premièred on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in Edmonton, Canada, 15 days before the BBC One showing, and two days before it aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====Oceania====

[[New Zealand]] was the first country outside the United Kingdom to screen ''Doctor Who'', beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new series from 2005.

In [[Australia]], the show has had a strong fan base since its inception, having been exclusively first run by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) since January 1965. The ABC has periodically repeated episodes; of note were the weekly screenings of all available classic episodes starting in 2003, for the show's 40th anniversary, and the weekdaily screenings of all available revived episodes in 2013 for the show's 50th anniversary. The ABC broadcasts the modern series first run on [[ABC1]], with repeats on [[ABC2]]. The ABC also provided partial funding for the 20th anniversary special ''The Five Doctors'' in 1983. Repeats of both the classic and modern series have also been shown on subscription television channels [[BBC UKTV]], [[SF Channel (Australia)|SF]] and later on [[Syfy (Australia)|SyFy]] upon SF's closure.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====Americas====
{{Main|Doctor Who in Canada and the United States}}

The series also has a fan base in the [[United States]], where it was shown in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly on [[PBS]] stations.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[TVOntario]] picked up the show in 1976 beginning with ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'' and aired each series (several years late) through to series 24 in 1991. From 1979 to 1981, TVO airings were bookended by science-fiction writer [[Judith Merril]] who would introduce the episode and then, after the episode concluded, try to place it in an educational context in keeping with TVO's status as an educational channel. Its airing of ''[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]'' was cancelled as a result of accusations that the story was [[racism|racist]]; the story was later broadcast in the 1990s on cable station YTV. CBC began showing the series again in 2005. The series moved to the Canadian cable channel [[Space (TV channel)|Space]] in 2009.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

For the [[Canada|Canadian]] broadcast, Christopher Eccleston recorded special video introductions for each episode (including a trivia question as part of a viewer contest) and excerpts from the ''Doctor Who Confidential'' documentary were played over the closing credits; for the broadcast of "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" on 26 December 2005, [[Billie Piper]] recorded a special video introduction. CBC began airing series two on 9 October 2006 at 20:00 E/P (20:30 in Newfoundland and Labrador), shortly after that day's [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] double header on [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]] in most of the country.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Adaptations and other appearances==

===''Doctor Who'' films===
{{Main|Dr. Who (Dalek films)}}
There are two ''Doctor Who'' feature films: ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'', released in 1965 and ''[[Daleks&nbsp;– Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]'' in 1966. Both are retellings of existing television stories (specifically, the first two Dalek serials, ''[[The Daleks]]'' and ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'' respectively) with a larger budget and alterations to the series concept.

In these films, [[Peter Cushing]] plays a human scientist<ref name=Tele1>{{cite news|title=Matt Smith is the eleventh, and youngest, actor to play Doctor Who|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/4124547/Matt-Smith-is-the-eleventh-and-youngest-actor-to-play-Doctor-Who.html?image=4|work=News|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (online)|accessdate=15 June 2011|location=London|date=5 January 2009}}</ref> named "Dr. Who", who travels with his granddaughter and niece and other companions in a time machine he has invented. The [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)#Other appearances|Cushing version]] of the character reappears in both comic strips and a short story, the latter attempting to reconcile the film continuity with that of the series.

In addition, several planned films were proposed, including a sequel, ''The Chase'', loosely based on the [[The Chase (Doctor Who)|original series story]], for the Cushing Doctor, plus [[List of unmade Doctor Who serials and films#Proposed films|many attempted television movie and big screen productions]] to revive the original ''Doctor Who'', after the original series was cancelled.

Paul McGann starred in [[Doctor Who (film)|the only television film]] as the eighth incarnation of the Doctor. After the film, he continued the role in audio books and was confirmed as the eighth incarnation through flashback footage and a mini episode in the 2005 revival, effectively linking the two series and the television movie.

In 2011, [[David Yates]] announced that he had started work with the BBC on a ''Doctor Who'' film, a project that would take three or more years to complete. Yates indicated that the film would take a different approach to ''Doctor Who'',<ref name="VarietyWhoFilm">{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118046098|title=Yates to direct bigscreen 'Doctor Who'|last=Dawtrey|first=Adam|date=14 November 2011|work=Variety|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> although the current ''Doctor Who'' showrunner [[Steven Moffat]] stated later that any such film would not be a reboot of the series and a film should be made by the BBC team and star the current TV Doctor.<ref name="DigitalSpyWhoFilm">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/s7/doctor-who/news/a354022/doctor-who-movie-will-not-be-a-reboot-says-steven-moffat.html|title='Doctor Who' Movie Will Not Be A Reboot Says Moffat|last=Sperling|first=Daniel|date=2 December 2011|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/film/883654-doctor-who-movie-will-star-matt-smith-if-it-gets-made-says-steven-moffat|title=Doctor Who movie will star Matt Smith if it gets made, says Steven Moffat|work=Metro|accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref>

===Spin-offs===
{{Main|Doctor Who spin-offs}}
''Doctor Who'' has appeared on stage numerous times. In the early 1970s, [[Trevor Martin]] played the role in ''[[Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday]]''. In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled ''[[Doctor Who&nbsp;– The Ultimate Adventure]]''. For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, [[David Banks (British actor)|David Banks]] (better known for playing [[Cyberman|Cybermen]]) played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while [[Terry Nation]] wrote ''[[The Curse of the Daleks]]'', a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor.

A pilot episode ("[[A Girl's Best Friend]]") for a potential spinoff series, ''[[K-9 and Company]]'', was aired in 1981 with [[Elisabeth Sladen]] reprising her role as companion [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and [[John Leeson]] as the voice of [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]], but was not picked up as a regular series.

Concept art for an animated ''Doctor Who'' series was produced by animation company [[Nelvana]] in the 1980s, but the series was not produced.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lofficier|first=Jean-Marc|authorlink=Jean-Marc Lofficier|title=The Nth Doctor|publisher=[[Virgin Publishing]]|location=London|year=1997|page=9|isbn=0-426-20499-9}}<br />{{cite video|people=Bailey, Shaun (Producer); Kalangis, Johnny (Director)|date=2004|title=The Planet of the Doctor, Part 6: Doctor Who & Culture II|url=http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/videos.html#|format=[[QuickTime]] or [[Windows Media]]|medium=Documentary|publisher=[[CBC Television]]|location=Toronto|accessdate=9 April 2009}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}<br />{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/tb_gallery.html|title=Planet of the Doctor|accessdate=9 April 2009|work=[[CBC Television]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080430203208/http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/tb_gallery.html|archivedate=30 April 2008}}</ref>

Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled ''[[Torchwood]]'' (an [[anagram]] of "Doctor Who"), set in modern-day [[Cardiff]] and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on [[BBC Three]] on 22 October 2006.<ref>{{cite book|title=Inside the Hub|last=Walker|first=Stephen James|authorlink=Stephen James Walker|year=2007|publisher=[[Telos Publishing]]|location=Tolworth, Surrey|isbn=978-1-84583-013-7|page=101}}</ref> [[John Barrowman]] reprised his role of [[Jack Harkness]] from the 2005 series of ''Doctor Who''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4349120.stm|title=Doctor Who spin-off made in Wales|publisher=BBC News|date=17 October 2005|accessdate=24 April 2006}}</ref> Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; [[Eve Myles]] as [[Gwen Cooper]], who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[The Unquiet Dead]]",<ref>{{cite web|date=24 February 2006|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2006/02/24/29846.shtml|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5QSmqr0PU|archivedate=20 July 2007|title=Team Torchwood|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 April 2006}}</ref> and [[Naoko Mori]] who reprised her role as [[Toshiko Sato]] first seen in "[[Aliens of London]]". A second series of ''Torchwood'' aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her ''Doctor Who'' role of [[Martha Jones]]. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called ''Children of Earth'' which was set largely in London. A fourth series, ''[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]'' jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting.

''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'', starring [[Elisabeth Sladen]] who reprised her role as investigative journalist [[Sarah Jane Smith]], was developed by [[CBBC]]; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Russell T Davies creates new series for CBBC, starring Doctor Who's Sarah Jane Smith|publisher=BBC|date=14 September 2006|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/09_september/14/sarah.shtml|accessdate=14 September 2006}}</ref> A second series followed in 2008, notable for (as noted above) featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by [[David Tennant]] as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress [[Katy Manning]] reprising her role as [[Jo Grant]]. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011&nbsp;– uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011.

An animated serial, ''[[The Infinite Quest]]'', aired alongside the 2007 series of ''Doctor Who'' as part of the children's television series ''[[Totally Doctor Who]]''. The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and [[Freema Agyeman]] but is not considered part of the 2007 series.<ref name="cartoon_bbc">{{cite news|title=Who's a Toon? |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/01/26/40315.shtml |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=26 January 2007 |work=BBC ''Doctor Who'' website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070202125822/http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/01/26/40315.shtml |archivedate=2 February 2007 }}</ref> A second animated serial, ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'', aired in six parts on the [[BBC Red Button]] service, and the official ''Doctor Who'' website in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8300002.stm|title=Wire star set for Dr Who cartoon|date=9 October 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref>

On 1 October 2015, it was announced that a spinoff series titled ''Class'' will be filmed in spring 2016 and broadcast later that year on [[BBC Three]] and will run for eight 45 minute episodes. It will be written by [[Patrick Ness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/953c5b1f-3cc8-4db9-8184-f1b6567260f1|title=BBC Latest News - Doctor Who - Doctor Who Spin Off: Class|author=The Doctor Who Team|work=Doctor Who}}</ref>

Numerous other spin-off series have been created not by the BBC but by the respective owners of the characters and concepts. Such spin-offs include the novel and audio drama series ''[[Faction Paradox]]'', ''[[Iris Wildthyme]]'' and ''[[Bernice Summerfield]]''; as well as the made-for-video series ''[[P.R.O.B.E.]]''; the Australian-produced television series ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'', which aired a 26-episode first season on [[Disney XD (UK & Ireland)|Disney XD]];<ref>{{cite news|date=25 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4939144.stm|title=Doctor Who dog K9 gets spin-off|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2006}}</ref> and the audio spin-off ''Counter-Measures''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/news/New-Doctor-Who-Spin-off-Counter-Measures|title=New Doctor Who Spin off&nbsp;...

===Charity episodes===
In 1983, coinciding with the series' 20th anniversary, a charity special titled ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' was produced in aid of Children in Need, featuring three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Five Doctors Serial 6K|url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_6k.htm|publisher=drwhoguide.com|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> This was a full-length, 90-minute film, the longest single episode of ''Doctor Who'' produced to date (the television movie ran slightly longer on broadcast where it included commercial breaks).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=6k|title=The Five Doctors|publisher=Outpost Gallifrey|author=Shaun Lyon|date=31 March 2007|accessdate=24 October 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080503123320/http://www.gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=6k|archivedate=3 May 2008|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/6k.html|title=The Five Doctors|publisher=A Brief History of Time Travel|last=Sullivan|first=Shannon|date=7 August 2007|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>

In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'' was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', the action taking place in the latter's [[Albert Square]] location and around [[Greenwich]]. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]] requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.

In 1999, another special, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', was made for [[Comic Relief]] and later released on VHS. An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Joanna Lumley]]. The script was written by [[Steven Moffat]], later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.<ref name=RTDgone/>

Since the return of ''Doctor Who'' in 2005, the franchise has produced two original "mini-episodes" to support Children in Need. The first, aired in November 2005, was an [[Doctor Who: Children in Need|untitled seven-minute scene]] which introduced [[David Tennant]] as the [[Tenth Doctor]]. It was followed in November 2007 by "[[Time Crash]]", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the [[Fifth Doctor]] (played once again by [[Peter Davison]]).

A set of two mini-episodes, titled [[Space / Time|"Space" and "Time"]] respectively, were produced to support [[Comic Relief]]. They were aired during the [[Comic Relief#2011 event|Comic Relief 2011 event]].<ref name="comicrelief2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a306899/moffat-reveals-who-comic-relief-plot.html|title=Doctor Who For Comic Relief&nbsp;– Exclusive|work=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]|date=2 March 2011|accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>

During 2011 [[Children in Need]], an exclusively-filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need. The 2012 edition of CiN featured the mini-episode ''The Great Detective''.

===Spoofs and cultural references===

Many games have been released that feature the Daleks, including [[Dalek#Computer games|Dalek computer games]].

===Audios===
{{See also|List of Doctor Who audio releases|List of Doctor Who audiobooks|List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish}}

The earliest Doctor Who-related audio release was a 21-minute narrated abridgement of the First Doctor television story ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]'' released in 1966.  Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981. In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, ''[[Slipback]]'', the first radio drama, was transmitted.  

Since 1999, [[Big Finish Productions]] has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD.  The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001.  Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012.  Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show.

In addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.

===Books===
{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}

''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day. From 1965 to 1991 the books published were primarily novelised adaptations of broadcast episodes; beginning in 1991 an extensive line of original fiction was launched, the [[Virgin New Adventures]] and [[Virgin Missing Adventures]]. Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]]. Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, and a dedicated ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979. This is published by Panini, as is the ''[[Doctor Who Adventures]]'' magazine for younger fans.

==Chronology and canonicity==

Since the creation of the ''Doctor Who'' character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about ''Doctor Who'', in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and even stage performances. In this respect it is noteworthy that the BBC takes no position on the [[Canon (fiction)|canonicity]] of any of such stories, and recent producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Russell T.|journal=Doctor Who Magazine|year=2005|issue=356|page={{page needed|date=March 2014}}}}</ref>
