Best recognized for his essays and unsigned &quot;Notes and Comment&quot; pieces, he gradually became the most important contributor to<space/><italics>The New Yorker</italics><space/>at a time when it was arguably the most important American literary magazine. From the beginning to the end of his career at<space/><italics>The New Yorker,</italics><space/>he frequently provided what the magazine calls &quot;Newsbreaks&quot; (short, witty comments on oddly worded printed items from many sources) under various categories such as &quot;Block That Metaphor&quot;. He also served as a columnist for<space/><italics><link><target>Harper's Magazine</target></link></italics><space/>from 1938 to 1943.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1949, White published<space/><italics>Here Is New York</italics>, a short book based upon a<space/><italics><link><target>Holiday (magazine)</target><part>Holiday</part></link></italics><space/>magazine article that he had been asked to write. The article reflects the writer's appreciation of a city that provides its residents with both &quot;the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy&quot;, and concludes with a dark note touching upon the forces that may destroy the city that the writer loves. This prescient &quot;love letter&quot; to the city was re-published in 1999 on the one hundredth anniversary of his birth, with an introduction by his stepson,<space/><link><target>Roger Angell</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1959, White edited and updated<space/><italics><link><target>The Elements of Style</target></link></italics>. This handbook of grammatical and stylistic guidance for writers of<space/><link><target>American English</target></link><space/>had been written and published in 1918 by<space/><link><target>William Strunk, Jr.</target></link>, one of White's professors at Cornell. White's rework of the book was extremely well received, and further editions of the work followed in 1972, 1979, and 1999; an illustrated edition followed in 2005. The illustrator,<space/><link><target>Maira Kalman</target></link>, is a contributor to<space/><italics>The New Yorker</italics>.
