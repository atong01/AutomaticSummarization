'''Elwyn Brooks "E. B." White''' (July 11, 1899 – October 1, 1985)<ref name="New York Times Obituary"/> was an American writer. He was a contributor to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine and a co-author of the English language [[style guide]] ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', which is commonly known as "Strunk & White". He also wrote books for children, including ''[[Stuart Little]]'' (1945), ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' (1952), and ''[[The Trumpet of the Swan]]'' (1970). ''Charlotte's Web'' was voted the top children's novel in a 2012 survey of ''School Library Journal'' readers, an accomplishment repeated in earlier surveys.<ref name=SLJ/>

==Life==

White was born in [[Mount Vernon, New York]], the youngest child of [[Samuel Tilly White]], the president of a piano firm, and Jessie Hart White, the daughter of Scottish-American painter [[William Hart (painter)|William Hart]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Root|first=Robert L.|title=E.

White graduated from [[Cornell University]] with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1921. He picked up the nickname "Andy" at Cornell University, where tradition confers that moniker on any male student surnamed White, after Cornell co-founder [[Andrew Dickson White]]. While at Cornell, he worked as editor of ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'' with classmate [[Allison Danzig]], who later became a sportswriter for ''[[The New York Times]]''. White was also a member of the [[Aleph Samach]]<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Elwyn Brooks|title=Letters of E. B.

White worked for the [[United Press]] (currently the [[United Press International]]) and the [[American Legion]] News Service in 1921 and 1922. Then he became a cub reporter for ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' in 1922 and 1923. Once, when White was stuck on writing a story, a Times editor said, "Just say the words.".<ref>{{cite web|title=http://joesutt.com/writing-process/week-20-writing-quotations|October 25, 2015}}</ref> He then worked for two years with the Frank Seaman advertising agency as a production assistant and copywriter<ref>{{cite web|title=E. B. White Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/We-Z/White-E-B.html|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref> before returning to New York City in 1924. Not long after ''The New Yorker'' was founded in 1925, White submitted manuscripts to it. [[Katharine Sergeant Angell White|Katharine Angell]], the literary editor, recommended to magazine editor and founder [[Harold Ross]] that White be taken on as staff. However, it took months to convince him to come to a meeting at the office and further weeks to convince him to agree to work on the premises. Eventually he agreed to work in the office on Thursdays.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thurber|first=James|authorlink=James Thurber|title=Credos and Curios|chapter=E. B. W.|page=124|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=1969|isbn=9780140030440}}</ref>

A few years later in 1929, White and Angell were married. They had a son, [[Joel White]], a naval architect and boat builder, who owned Brooklin Boat Yard in [[Brooklin, Maine]]. Katharine's son from her first marriage, [[Roger Angell]], has spent decades as a fiction editor for ''The New Yorker'' and is well known as the magazine's baseball writer.

[[James Thurber]] described author E.B White as being a quiet man, disliking publicity, who during his time at ''The New Yorker'' would slip out of his office via the fire escape to a nearby branch of [[Schrafft's (restaurant chain)|Schrafft's]] to avoid visitors whom he didn't know. {{Quotation|Most of us, out of a politeness made up of faint curiosity and profound resignation, go out to meet the smiling stranger with a gesture of surrender and a fixed grin, but White has always taken to the fire escape. He has avoided the Man in the Reception Room as he has avoided the interviewer, the photographer, the microphone, the rostrum, the literary tea, and the [[Stork Club]]. His life is his own. He is the only writer of prominence I know of who could walk through [[Algonquin Hotel|the Algonquin]] lobby or between the tables at Jack and Charlie's and be recognized only by his friends.|James Thurber|E. B. W.|"Credos and Curios"}}

White died on October 1, 1985, suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]], at his [[E. B. White House|farm home]] in North Brooklin, Maine.<ref name="New York Times Obituary">{{cite news|last=Mitgang|first=Herbert|title=E. B.

==Career==

He published his first article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine in 1925, then joined the staff in 1927 and continued to contribute for around six decades. Best recognized for his essays and unsigned "Notes and Comment" pieces, he gradually became the most important contributor to ''The New Yorker'' at a time when it was arguably the most important American literary magazine. From the beginning to the end of his career at ''The New Yorker,'' he frequently provided what the magazine calls "Newsbreaks" (short, witty comments on oddly worded printed items from many sources) under various categories such as "Block That Metaphor". He also served as a columnist for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' from 1938 to 1943.

In 1949, White published ''Here Is New York'', a short book based upon a ''[[Holiday (magazine)|Holiday]]'' magazine article that he had been asked to write. The article reflects the writer's appreciation of a city that provides its residents with both "the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy", and concludes with a dark note touching upon the forces that may destroy the city that the writer loves. This prescient "love letter" to the city was re-published in 1999 on the one hundredth anniversary of his birth, with an introduction by his stepson, [[Roger Angell]].

In 1959, White edited and updated ''[[The Elements of Style]]''. This handbook of grammatical and stylistic guidance for writers of [[American English]] had been written and published in 1918 by [[William Strunk, Jr.]], one of White's professors at Cornell. White's rework of the book was extremely well received, and further editions of the work followed in 1972, 1979, and 1999; an illustrated edition followed in 2005. The illustrator, [[Maira Kalman]], is a contributor to ''The New Yorker''. That same year, a New York composer named [[Nico Muhly]] premiered a short opera based on the book. The volume is a standard tool for students and writers and remains required reading in many composition classes. The complete history of ''The Elements of Style'' is detailed in Mark Garvey's ''Stylized: A Slightly Obsessive History of Strunk & White's The Elements of Style''.

In 1978, White won a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|special Pulitzer Prize]] citing "his letters, essays and the full body of his work".<ref name=pulitzer>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Special-Awards-and-Citations "Special Awards and Citations"]. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved December 2, 2013.</ref> Other awards he received included a [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1963 and memberships in a variety of literary societies throughout the United States.

The 1973 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Oscar-nominated]] Canadian animated [[short film|short]], ''[[The Family That Dwelt Apart]]'', is narrated by White and based on his short story of the same name.<ref name="Collection">{{cite web|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=11708|title=The Family That Dwelt Apart|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref>

==Children's books==
In the late 1930s, White turned his hand to [[Children's literature|children's fiction]] on behalf of a niece, Janice Hart White. His first children's book, ''[[Stuart Little]],'' was published in 1945, and ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' appeared in 1952. ''Stuart Little'' initially received a lukewarm welcome from the literary community. However, both books went on to receive high acclaim.

White received the [[Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal]] from the U.S. professional children's librarians in 1970, recognizing his "substantial and lasting contributions to children's literature". At the time it was awarded every five years.<ref name=wilder/> That year he was also the U.S. nominee and a highly commended runner-up for the biennial, international [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], as he was again in 1976.<ref name=weales/><ref name=ibby-nominee/> Also in 1970, White's third children's novel was published, ''[[The Trumpet of the Swan]]''. In 1973 it won the Sequoya Award from Oklahoma and the [[William Allen White Award]] from Kansas, both selected by students voting for their favorite book of the year.

In 2012, ''[[School Library Journal]]'' sponsored a survey of readers which identified ''Charlotte's Web'' as top children's novel ("fictional title for readers 9–12" years old). The librarian who conducted it observed that "it is impossible to conduct a poll of this sort and expect [the novel] to be anywhere but #1".<ref name=SLJ/><ref name=bird/>
