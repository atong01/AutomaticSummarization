An '''emoticon''' ({{IPAc-en|ɨ|ˈ|m|oʊ|t|ɨ|k|ɒ|n}}), etymologically a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[emotion]]'' and ''[[icon (computing)|icon]]'', is a [[metacommunication|metacommunicative]] pictorial representation of a [[facial expression]] that, in the absence of [[body language]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], serves to draw a receiver's [[interest (emotion)|attention]] to the tenor or temper of a sender's nominal non-verbal communication, changing and improving its interpretation. It expresses — usually by means of [[punctuation marks]] (though it can include numbers and letters) — a person's feelings or mood, though as emoticons have become more popular, some devices have provided stylized pictures that do not use punctuation.

In Western countries, emoticons are usually written at a right angle to the direction of the text. Users from [[Japan]] popularized a kind of emoticons called '''kaomoji''' ([[:ja:顔文字|顔文字]], often confused with [[emoji]] in the West) that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://staff.aist.go.jp/k.harigaya/doc/kao_his.html |title=The History of Smiley Marks |publisher=Staff.aist.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121203061906/http://staff.aist.go.jp:80/k.harigaya/doc/kao_his.html |archivedate=3 December 2012 }}</ref><ref name="whatjapanthinks2007">{{cite web|author=Emoticons Free said |url=http://whatjapanthinks.com/2007/09/19/turns-25-but-how-old-are-japanese-emoticons/ |title=The History of Smiley Marks (English) |publisher=Whatjapanthinks.com |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref>

As social media has become widespread, emoticons have played a significant role in communication through technology. They offer another range of "tone" and feeling through texting that portrays specific emotions through facial gestures while in the midst of text-based cyber communication.

==Origin of the term==
The word is a portmanteau word of the [[English language|English]] words "emote" and "icon". In [[web forum]]s, [[instant messaging|instant messengers]] and [[online game]]s, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images, which came to be called "emoticons" as well. Emoticons for a smiley face <code>:-)</code> and sad face <code>:-(</code> appear in the first documented use in digital form. Certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in a double-byte language, giving rise to especially complex forms, sometimes known by their romanized Japanese name of [[kaomoji]].

The use of emoticons can be traced back to the 19th century, and they were commonly used in casual and humorous writing. Digital forms of emoticons on the [[Internet]] were included in a proposal by [[Scott Fahlman]] of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], in a message on 19 September 1982.<ref name="smiley">[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/Orig-Smiley.htm See Fahlman's website for a reconstruction of the entire thread]</ref>{{sfn|Asteroff|1987}}

==History==

===Antecedents===

The ''National Telegraphic Review and Operators Guide'' in April 1857 documented the use of the number 73 in [[Morse code]] to express "love and kisses" (later reduced to the more formal "best regards"). ''Dodge's Manual'' in 1908 documented the reintroduction of "love and kisses" as the number 88. Gajadhar and Green comment that both [[Morse code abbreviations]] are more succinct than modern abbreviations such as [[LOL (Internet slang)|LOL]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Joan Gajadhar and John Green|title=The Importance of Nonverbal Elements in Online Chat|year=2005|journal=EDUCAUSE Quarterly| volume=28|issue=4| url=https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/eqm05411.pdf}}</ref>

A ''[[New York Times]]'' transcript from an [[Abraham Lincoln]] speech written in 1862 contains "(applause and laughter <code>;)</code>"; there is some debate as to whether it is a [[typo]], a legitimate punctuation construct, or an emoticon.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/hfo-emoticon/ | work=The New York Times | title=Is That an Emoticon in 1862? | date=2009-01-19}}</ref>

Four vertical typographical emoticons were published in 1881 by the U.S. satirical magazine ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', with the stated intention that the publication's letterpress department thus intended to "lay out ... all the cartoonists that ever walked."

In 1912, [[Ambrose Bierce]] proposed "an improvement in punctuation&nbsp;– the snigger point, or note of [[wikt:cachinnation|cachinnation]]: it is written thus&nbsp;‿ and presents a smiling mouth. It is to be appended, with the full stop, to every jocular or ironical sentence".<ref>{{cite book|author=Ambrose Bierce|chapter=For Brevity and Clarity|title=The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce, XI: Antepenultimata|year=1912|publisher=The Neale Publishing Company|pages=386–7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3nEcAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA387#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

In a 1936 [[The Harvard Lampoon|Harvard Lampoon]] article, Alan Gregg proposed (-) for smile, (--) for laugh (more teeth showing), (#) for frown, (*) for wink, and (#) for "intense interest, attention, and incredulity".<ref>The Harvard Lampoon, Vol. 112 No. 1, September 16, 1936, pp. 30-31</ref> Note that the symbols are correctly oriented and are not sideways.

Emoticons had already come into use in sci-fi [[fandom]] in the 1940s,<ref>Gregory Benford, ''A Scientist's Notebook: net@fandom.com'', The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Vol. 90, No. 6 (June 1996), p. 90</ref> although there seems to have been a lapse in cultural continuity between the communities.

The September 1962 issue of [[MAD Magazine]] published an article titled "Typewri-toons." The piece, featuring typewriter-generated artwork credited to "Royal Portable," was entirely made up of repurposed typography, including a capital letter P having a bigger bust than a capital I, a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies, an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from a snowfall, and a classroom of lowercase n's interrupted by a lowercase h "raising its hand."<ref>MAD Magazine #73, Sept. 1962, EC Publications, pgs. 36-37</ref>  Two additional "Typewri-toons" articles subsequently appeared in ''Mad'', in 1965 and 1987.

In 1963 the "[[smiley|smiley face]]", a yellow button with two black dots representing eyes and an upturned thick curve representing a mouth was created by freelance artist [[Harvey Ball]]. It was realized on order of a large insurance company as part of a campaign to bolster the morale of its employees and soon became a big hit. This smiley presumably inspired many later emoticons; the most basic graphic emoticon that depicts this is in fact a small yellow smiley face.

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview in April 1969, [[Alden Whitman]] asked writer [[Vladimir Nabokov]]: "How do you rank yourself among writers (living) and of the immediate past?" Nabokov answered: "I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile&nbsp;– some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question."<ref>{{cite book|author=Nabokov|title=Strong Opinions|isbn=0-679-72609-8|publisher=Vintage Books|date=March 1990|url=http://lib.ru/NABOKOW/Inter11.txt|accessdate=2009-03-24}}</ref>

On the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] system in the 1970s, emoticons and other decorative graphics were produced as [[ASCII art]], particularly with [[ASCII art#Overprinting .28surprint.29|overprinting]]: typing a character, backing up, then typing another character. For example, WOBTAX and VICTORY both produced convincing smiley faces. This developed into a sophisticated set, particularly in combination with superscript and subscript.<ref>[http://www.platohistory.org/blog/2012/09/plato-emoticons-revisited.html PLATO Emoticons, revisited], Brian Dear, ''[http://www.platohistory.org/ PLATO History: Remembering the future],'' September 19, 2012</ref>

===Creation of :-) and :-(===

[[Scott Fahlman]] was the first documented person to use the emoticons <code>:-)</code> and <code>:-(</code>, with a specific suggestion that they be used to express emotion.<ref>{{cite news| title = :D turns 25| agency = Associated Press| date = 2007-09-20| url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/18/emoticon.anniversary.ap/index.html| accessdate = 2007-09-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012051803/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/18/emoticon.anniversary.ap/index.html |archivedate = October 12, 2007}}</ref> The text of his original proposal, posted to the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] computer science general [[bulletin board system|board]] on 19 September 1982 (11:44<!-- local time? -->), was thought to have been lost, but was recovered 20 years later by Jeff Baird from old backup tapes.<ref name="smiley"/>

</pre>

Other notable computer scientists who participated in this thread include [[David Touretzky]], [[Guy L. Steele, Jr.|Guy Steele]], and [[Jaime Carbonell]].

Within a few months, it had spread to the [[ARPANET]]<ref>{{cite newsgroup| title = Notes&nbsp;– Communications Breakthrough,| author = James.Morris at CMU-10A| date = 1982-10-10| newsgroup = net.works|message-id=| url = http://groups.google.com/group/net.works/browse_thread/thread/773cc0618cfd7d83?hl=en&q=Scott+Fahlman#35a7598e05d9a09b| accessdate = 2008-12-18}}</ref> and [[Usenet]].<ref>{{cite newsgroup| title = How to keep from being misunderstood on the net| author = Curtis Jackson| date = 1982-12-03| newsgroup = net.news|message-id=| url = http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/browse_thread/thread/b72c333ced0d3adc/e008ed19e251f9ee?hl=en&#e008ed19e251f9ee| accessdate = 2008-12-17}}</ref> Many variations on the theme were immediately suggested by Scott and others.

==Western style==

Usually, emoticons in Western style have the eyes on the left, followed by nose and the mouth. The two character version <code>:)</code> which omits the nose is also very popular.

===Common Western examples===
{{Main|List of emoticons}}

The most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny [[ambigrams]]), with or without a hyphen (nose).
There are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. For example, <code>:(</code> equals sad and <code>:((</code> equals very sad or weeping. A  blush can be expressed as <code>:"></code>. Others include wink <code>;)</code>, a grin <code>:D</code>, smug <code>:-></code>, and tongue out <code>:P</code> for disgust or simply just to stick the tongue out for silliness, such as when [[blowing a raspberry]]. An often used combination is also <code><3</code> for a heart, and <code></3</code> for a broken heart. <code>:O</code> is also sometimes used to depict shock.

A broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; <code>XD</code> and the addition of further "D" letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e.g. <code>XDDDD</code>. There are hundreds of other variations including <code>>:D</code> for an evil grin or <code>>:(</code>  for anger, which can be, again, used in reverse, for an unhappy angry face, in the shape of <code>D:<</code>. <code>=K</code> for vampire teeth, <code>:s</code> for grimace, and <code>;P</code> can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a second meaning in the sentence preceding it.<ref>Dresner & Herring (2010).</ref>

As computers offer increasing built-in support for non-Western writing systems, it has become possible to use other glyphs to build emoticons. The 'shrug' emoticon, <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>, uses the glyph [[ツ]] from the Japanese [[katakana]] writing system.

===Variation===
{{Main|ASCII art}}

An equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as <code>=)</code>, without changing the meaning of the emoticon. In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an "o" as in <code>=O)</code> . In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/denoser/ |title=Denoser strips noses from text |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger, more traditional emoticon <code>:-)</code> or <code>:^)</code>. Similar-looking characters are commonly substituted for one another: for instance, <code>o</code>, <code>O</code>, and <code>0</code> can all be used interchangeably, sometimes for subtly different effect or, in some cases, one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another. It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other, similar brackets, such as <code>]</code> instead of <code>)</code>.

Some variants are also more common in certain countries due to [[keyboard layout]]s. For example, the smiley <code>=)</code> may occur in [[Scandinavia]], where the keys for <code>=</code> and <code>)</code> are placed right beside each other. However, the <code>:)</code> variant is without a doubt the dominant one in Scandinavia, making the <code>=)</code> version a rarity. [[Diacritic|Diacritical marks]] are sometimes used. The letters <code>Ö</code> and <code>Ü</code> can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of <code>:O</code> (meaning that one is surprised) and <code>:D</code> (meaning that one is very happy) respectively.

Some emoticons may be read right to left instead, and in fact can only be written using standard ASCII keyboard characters this way round; for example <code>D:</code> which refers to being shocked or anxious, opposite to the large grin of <code>:D</code>.

==Graphical emoticons==
In 1997 CEO of Smiley Company [[Nicolas Loufrani]] <ref name="Le Figaro">http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2010/01/05/04015-20100105ARTFIG00704-smiley-ou-l-histoire-d-une-opa-sur-un-sourire-.php</ref> recognized the growth in use of [[ASCII art|ASCII emoticons]] within mobile technology and he started experimenting with animated Smiley faces,<ref>http://www.licensing.biz/big-interviews/read/the-big-interview-nicolas-loufrani-ceo-smiley/042070</ref> with the intention of creating colourful icons that corresponded to the pre-existing ascii emoticons made of plain punctuation marks, to enhance them for a more interactive use in digital. From this Loufrani compiled an online Emoticon Dictionary <ref>https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XRbdAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT74&lpg=PT74&dq=nicolas+loufrani+emoticons&source=bl&ots=YjWhF0_56x&sig=t2wxDqsmOTIzwqa7Ny47xRG2U84&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dd2cVaXkL4PWU72buagL&ved=0CGAQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=nicolas%20loufrani%20emoticons&f=false</ref> that was sorted into separate categories - Classics, Moods expressions, Flags, Celebrations, Fun, Sports, Weather, Animals, Food, Nations, Occupations, Planets, Zodiac, Babies and these designs were first registered in 1997 at [[United States Copyright Office|The United States Copyright Office]] and then these icons were posted as [[Graphics Interchange Format|.gif]] files on the [[World Wide Web|Web]] in 1998, becoming the first ever graphical emoticons used in technology.<ref>http://www.interview.de/fashion/nicolas-loufrani-im-interview-mein-vater-hat-den-smiley-erfunden/</ref>

In 2000 the Emoticon Directory created by Loufrani was made available for users to download for cellular phones on the internet through smileydictionary.com which compiled over 1000 smiley graphic emoticons and their ascii versions. This same directory was then published in 2002 in a book by [[Marabout]] called Dico Smileys.<ref>http://www.amazon.ca/DICO-SMILEYS-VIRGA/dp/2501037537</ref>

In 2001 the Smiley company [[Smiley|Smiley Company]] started licensing the rights for Loufrani's graphic emoticons to be used for cellular phone emoticon downloads by a variety of different telecommunication companies including Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, SFR (vodaphone) and Sky Telemedia.

==Japanese style==
Users from [[Japan]] popularized a style of emoticons ([[:ja:顔文字|顔文字]], ''kaomoji'') that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name="whatjapanthinks2007"/> Similar looking emoticons were used by [[Byte Information Exchange]] (BIX) around the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg261.txt |title=Jargon file, version 2.6.1, February 12, 1991 |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref>

These emoticons are usually found in a format similar to <code>(*_*)</code>. The [[asterisk]]s indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an [[underscore]], the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face.

Different emotions such as <code>(")(-_-)(")</code>, are expressed by changing the character representing the eyes, for example "T" can be used to express crying or sadness <code>(T_T)</code>. <code>T_T</code> may also be used as meaning 'unimpressed'. The emphasis on the eyes is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes, e.g. <code>^^</code>. Looks of stress are represented by the likes of <code>(x_x)</code> while <code>(-_-;)</code> is a generic emoticon for nervousness, the semicolon indicating sweat that occurs during anxiety. Repeating the /// mark can indicate embarrassment by symbolizing blushing.<ref>{{cite web|title=KawaiiFace.net|url=http://kawaiiface.net|accessdate=21 March 2014|year=2014}}</ref> Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, "cuter" mouth or to represent a nose, e.g. <code>(^.^)</code>. Alternatively, the mouth/nose can be left out entirely, e.g. <code>(^^)</code>.

Parentheses also can often be replaced with [[Bracket#Curly brackets|braces]], e.g. <code>{^_^}</code>. Many times, the parentheses are left out completely, e.g. <code>^^</code>,<code> >.< </code>, <code>o_O</code>, <code>O.O</code>, <code>e_e</code> and/or <code>e.e</code>. A quotation mark ", apostrophe ', or semicolon ; can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a [[sweat drop]] is used in [[anime|popular and common Asian animation]].

Microsoft [[Input method editor|IME]] 2000 (Japanese) or later supports the use of both forms of emoticons by enabling Microsoft IME Spoken Language/Emotion Dictionary. In IME 2007, it was moved to Emoticons dictionary.

Further variations of emoticons may be produced by using [[combining character]]s, e.g.<code> ٩(͡๏̯͡๏)۶ </code> and <code> ᶘᵒᴥᵒᶅ</code>.

These emoticons can be used also with [ ] instead of ( ), or without the parentheses at all in some of the cases. There is also the <code>\(0O0)\</code>, indicating a hooligan or crazed behaviour, and the <code>(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧</code>.

===Western use of Japanese style===

English-language [[anime]] forums adopted those emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on western keyboards. Because of this, they are often called "anime style" emoticons in the English-speaking Internet. They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and other non-anime related forums. Emoticons such as <code><(&nbsp;^.^&nbsp;)></code>, <code><(^_^<)</code>, <code><(o_o<)</code>, <code><(&nbsp;-'.'-&nbsp;)></code>, <code><('.'-^)</code> or <code>(>';..;')></code> which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs < or >) also are often referred to as "{{not a typo|Kirbys}}" in reference to their likeness to [[Nintendo]]'s [[video game]] character, [[Kirby (Nintendo)|Kirby]].  The parentheses are sometimes dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an [[intensifier]], (e.g. <code>^_________^</code> for very happy) for the emoticon in question. This emoticon {{nowrap|<code>t(-_-t)</code>}} uses the eastern style, but incorporates a depiction of the western [[The finger|"middle-finger flick-off (commonly known as 'the bird')"]] using a "t" as the arm, hand, and finger. Also, one of the newer ones, <code>*,..,*</code>, or <code>`;..;´</code> as such for a "vampire" or other mythical beasts with fangs.

===Mixture of Western and Japanese style===
Exposure to both Western and Japanese style emoticons or kaomoji (often incorrectly{{cn|date=October 2015}} called ''[[emoji]]'') through blogs, instant messaging, and forums featuring a blend of Western and Japanese pop culture, has given rise to emoticons that have an upright viewing format. The parentheses are similarly dropped in the English language context and the emoticons only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as <code>-O-</code>, <code>-3-</code>, <code>-w-</code>, <code>'_'</code>, <code>;_;</code>, <code>T_T</code>, <code>:></code>, and <code>.V.</code> are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime or manga-styled [[sweat drop]], for example: <code>^_^'</code> or <code>!>_<!</code> as well as: <code><@>_____<@>;;</code>, <code>;O;</code> and <code>*u*</code>. The equal sign can also be used for closed, anime looking eyes, for example: <code>=0=</code>, <code>=3=</code>, <code>=w=</code>, <code>=A=</code> and <code>=7=</code>.

There are also more faces along those lines like<code> >o<; </code>using the ; as a sweat mark, and the o as a mouth, and the inequality signs as the eyes, it shows stress, or slight confusion. The number of emoticons that can be made is very large, and can express many shades of meaning.

In Brazil, sometimes combining character (accent) are added to emoticons to represent eyebrows, like: <code>ò_ó</code>, <code>ó_ò</code>, <code>õ_o</code>, <code>ù_u</code> or <code>o_Ô</code>. They can also replace (or add) <code>=</code> or <code>:</code> with<code> > </code>, for example<code> >D</code>,<code> >=D</code>,<code> >P</code>,<code> >:P</code>,<code> >3</code> or <code>>:3</code>.

===2channel style===

The Japanese language is usually encoded using double-[[byte]] character codes. As a result, there is a bigger variety of characters that can be used in emoticons, many of which cannot be reproduced in [[ASCII]]. Most kaomoji contain [[Cyrillic]] and other foreign letters to create even more complicated expressions analogous to [[ASCII art]]'s level of complexity. To type such emoticons, the input editor that is used to type Japanese on a user's system is equipped with a dictionary of emoticons, after which the user simply types the Japanese word (or something close to it) that represents the desired emoticon to convert the input into such complicated emoticons. Such expressions are known as [[Shift JIS art]]. Users of [[2channel]] in particular have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from various languages, such as [[Kannada]]: <code>ಠ_ಠ</code> (for a look of disapproval, disbelief, or confusion); these were quickly picked up by 4chan and spread to other Western sites soon after. Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like [[Mona (ASCII art)|Mona]].

==Korean style==

In [[South Korea]], emoticons use Korean [[Hangul]] letters, and the Western style is rarely used. The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences. Korean style contains Korean [[jamo]] (letters) instead of other characters. There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamo letters. Consonant jamos : ㅅ or ㅁ or ㅂ as the mouth/nose component and ㅇ,ㅎ,ㅍ for the eyes. For example: <code>ㅇㅅㅇ</code>, <code>ㅇㅂㅇ</code>, <code>ㅇㅁㅇ</code> and <code>-﻿ㅅ-</code>. Faces such as <code>'ㅅ'</code>, <code>"ㅅ"</code>, <code>'ㅂ'</code> and <code>'ㅇ'</code>, using quotation marks " and apostrophes ' are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as ㅜ,ㅠ depict a crying face. Example: <code>ㅜㅜ</code>, <code>ㅠㅠ</code> and <code>뉴뉴</code> (same function as T in western style). Sometimes ㅡ (not an em-dash "—" but a vowel jamo), a comma or an underscore is added, and the two character sets can be mixed together, as in <code>ㅜ.ㅜ</code>, <code>ㅠ.ㅜ</code>, <code>ㅠ.ㅡ</code>, <code>ㅜ_ㅠ</code>, <code>ㅡ^ㅜ</code> and <code>ㅜㅇㅡ</code>. Also, semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons; semicolons mean sweating (embarrassed). If they are used with ㅡ or - they depict a bad feeling. Examples: <code>-;/</code>, <code>--^</code>, <code>ㅡㅡ;;;</code>, <code>-_-;;</code> and <code>-_^</code>. However, <code>^^, ^오^</code> means smile (almost all people use this without distinction of sex or age). Others include: <code>~_~</code>, <code>--a</code>, <code>-6-</code>, <code>+0+</code>.

==Chinese ideographic style==

The character 槑 (U+69D1), which sounds like the word for "plum" (梅 (U+FA44)), is used to represent double of 呆 (dull), or further magnitude of dullness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/82855.htm |title=Baidu: 槑 |publisher=Baike.baidu.com |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> In Chinese, normally full characters (as opposed to the stylistic use of 槑) may be [[Reduplication#Chinese|duplicated]] to express emphasis.

This [[stick figure]] represents failure and despair.<ref name="boing-orz" /> It is also commonly used for representing a great admiration (sometimes with an overtone of sarcasm) for someone else's view or action.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

It was first used in late 2002 at the forum on Techside, Japanese personal website. At the "Techside FAQ Forum" (TECHSIDE教えて君BBS(教えてBBS) ), a poster asked about a cable cover, typing {{nowrap|"＿&#124;￣&#124;○"}} to show a cable and its cover. Others commented that it looked like a kneeling person, and the symbol became popular. These comments were soon deleted as they were considered off-topic. However, one of the first corresponding reactions can be found on the thread on {{iawm|http://210.136.179.189/cgi-bin/ch/log/log.html|"Techside Chitchat Forum" (Techside一言板。)}}, on December 23, 2002.{{Or|date=August 2009}} By 2005, Orz spawned a [[subculture]]: blogs have been devoted to the emoticon, and [[URL shortening]] services have been named after it. In Taiwan, Orz is associated with the phrase "nice guy"{{spaced ndash}}that is, the concept of males being rejected for a date by girls they are pursuing with a phrase like "You are a nice guy."<ref name="boing-orz" />

Orz should not be confused with {{nowrap|'''m(_&nbsp;_)m''',}} which means "Thank you" or an apology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Multimedia variations==

A portmanteau of ''emotion'' and ''[[sound]]'', an '''emotisound''' is a brief sound transmitted and played back during the viewing of a message, typically an IM message or e-mail message. The sound is intended to communicate an emotional [[subtext]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Many instant messaging clients automatically trigger sound effects in response to specific emoticons.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Some services, such as MuzIcons, combine emoticons and music player in an [[Adobe Flash]]-based widget.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzicons.com|title=Muzicons.com – music sharing widget|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref>

In 2004, The [[Trillian (software)|Trillian]] chat application introduced a feature called "emotiblips", which allows Trillian users to stream files to their instant message recipients "as the voice and video equivalent of an emoticon".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/faqs/ |title=The Creators of Trillian and Trillian Pro IM Clients |publisher=Cerulean Studios |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120428090118/http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/faqs/ |archivedate=28 April 2012 }}</ref>

In 2007, [[MTV]] and [[Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]] promoted the "emoticlip" as a form of [[viral marketing]] for the second season of the show ''The Hills''. The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show, uploaded to YouTube, which the advertisers hoped would be distributed between web users as a way of expressing feelings in a similar manner to emoticons. The emoticlip concept is credited to the Bradley & Montgomery advertising firm, which hopes they would be widely adopted as "greeting cards that just happen to be selling something".<ref>[http://www.adweek.com/aw/national/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003623867 AdWeek Article about Emoticlip] {{wayback|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/national/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003623867 |date=20120914013434 }}</ref>

In 2008, an emotion-sequence animation tool, called FunIcons was created. The [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based application allows users to create a short animation. Users can then email or save their own animations to use them on similar social utility applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalelite.us.com/Pages/DigitalElite/FunIcons.html |title=Animated Faces and Emoticons / Digital Elite Inc |publisher=Digitalelite.us.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130110111906/http://www.digitalelite.us.com:80/Pages/DigitalElite/FunIcons.html |archivedate=10 January 2013 }}</ref>

During the first half of the 2010s, there have been different forms of small audiovisual pieces to be sent through instant messaging systems to express one's emotion. These videos lack of a popular name yet and there are several ways to designate them: "emoticlips" (named above), "emotivideos" or more recently "emoticon videos". These are tiny little videos which can be easily transferred from one mobile phone to another or many other devices. The current video compression codecs (like [[H.264]]) allow these pieces of video to be light in terms of KB and very portable.

In 2000, [[Despair, Inc.]] obtained a U.S. [[trademark]] registration for the "frowny" emoticon <code>:-(</code> when used on "greeting cards, posters and art prints." In 2001, they issued a satirical press release, announcing that they would sue Internet users who typed the frowny; the joke backfired and the company received a storm of protest when its mock release was posted on technology news website [[Slashdot]].<ref>Schwartz, John. "[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/29/technology/29LOGO.html Compressed Data; Don't Mind That Lawsuit, It's Just a Joke]", ''New York Times''</ref>

A number of [[patent application]]s have been filed on inventions that assist in communicating with emoticons. A few of these have issued as US [[patent]]s. {{cite patent|US|6987991}}, for example, discloses a method developed in 2001 to send emoticons over a cell phone using a drop down menu. The stated advantage over the [[prior art]] was that the user saved on the number of keystrokes though this may not address the obviousness criteria.

In [[Finland]], the Supreme Administrative Court ruled in 2012 that the emoticon cannot be trademarked,<ref>{{cite web|author=STT |url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2012081315947358_uu.shtml |title=Hymiölle ei saa tavaramerkkiä &#124; Kotimaan uutiset |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date=2012-08-13 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> thus repealing a 2006 administrative decision trademarking the emoticons <code>:-)</code>, <code>=)</code>, <code>=(</code>, <code>:)</code> and <code>:(</code>.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Tavaramerkkilehti | journal = Tavaramerkkilehti | issue = 10 | pages = 27–28 | publisher = National Board of Patents and Registration of Finland | date = 2006-05-31 | url = http://tavaramerkki.prh.fi/lehti/tm/Tavaramerkkilehti10S_2006.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref> The emoticon <code>:-)</code> was also filed in 2006 and registered in 2008 as a European [[Community Trademark]] (CTM).

In 2008, Russian entrepreneur Oleg Teterin claimed to have been granted the trademark on the <code>;-)</code> emoticon. A license would not "cost that much{{spaced ndash}}tens of thousands of dollars" for companies, but would be free of charge for individuals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7778767.stm |title=Russian hopes to cash in on ;-) |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref>
