'''Dimmu Borgir''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɪ|m|uː|_|ˈ|b|ɔr|ɡ|ɪr}}) is a Norwegian [[symphonic black metal]] band from [[Oslo, Norway]], formed in 1993. The name is derived from [[Dimmuborgir]], a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means "dark cities" or "dark castles/fortresses" in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Old Norse]]. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist [[Silenoz]] and vocalist [[Shagrath]] are the only founding members remaining.<ref name="allmusic.com">Bradley Torreano: [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dimmu-borgir-p207278 Dimmu Borgir].

== Biography ==

=== ''For All Tid'' and ''Stormblåst'' period ===
Dimmu Borgir was founded in 1993 by [[Shagrath]], [[Silenoz]] and [[Tjodalv]]; the band released an EP in 1993 entitled ''[[Inn i evighetens mørke]]'' ("Into the Darkness of Eternity" in English). This short EP sold out within weeks, and the band followed up with the 1994 full-length album ''[[For All Tid]]'' ("''For All Time''" in English). This album featured vocal contributions by Vicotnik of [[Ved Buens Ende]] and [[Dødheimsgard]] and Aldrahn of [[Dødheimsgard]] and [[Zyklon-B (band)|Zyklon-B]]. The initial line-up consisted of Shagrath playing drums with Tjodalv on guitar and Silenoz contributing lead vocals. This line-up changed before the release of ''[[Stormblåst]]'' (translates to "''Stormblown''") on [[Cacophonous Records]] in 1996, an album considered by many to be their finest.<ref>{{cite web |author=Deneu, Max |title=''Stormblast'' review |url=http://exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid2=846&fid1=19736&csid1=78 |publisher=''[[Exclaim!]]'' |accessdate=2010-08-12}}</ref> It is also the last album which features all lyrics written and sung in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]].<ref>[http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1019306 Dimmu Borgir – For All Tid CD Album].

Retrieved on 2011-06-11.</ref>

=== ''Enthrone Darkness Triumphant'' period ===
After ''Stormblåst'', [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] [[Stian Aarstad]] left the band due to his obligation to serve in the Norwegian army, thus being unable to participate in the 1996 recording of ''[[Devil's Path (Dimmu Borgir EP)|Devil's Path]]''. That period was also marked by the departure of bassist Brynjard Tristan and the arrival of [[Stian Arnesen|Nagash]]. Stian Aarstad returned for the recording of 1997's ''[[Enthrone Darkness Triumphant]]''. He had trouble attending rehearsals and was unable to tour. He was then subsequently fired and replaced by [[Kimberly Goss]] for their 1997/1998 world tour. ''Enthrone Darkness Triumphant'' was a huge success for the band, and was their first release signed to [[Nuclear Blast]], a German [[record label]]. The album was recorded in the Abyss Studios, owned by [[Hypocrisy (band)|Hypocrisy]]'s frontman [[Peter Tägtgren]].<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Peter+T%C3%A4gtgren Peter Tägtgren – Bio, CDs and Vinyl at Discogs].

Retrieved on 2011-06-11.</ref> After the release of ''Enthrone Darkness Triumphant'', the band went on tour with [[In Flames]], [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]] and other bands who were prominent in the scene at the time.

=== ''Spiritual Black Dimensions'' and ''Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia'' period ===
After the tour for ''Enthrone Darkness Triumphant'', the band recruited new members [[Mustis]] on keyboards and [[Astennu (musician)|Astennu]] on lead guitar. Dimmu Borgir's following full-length albums ''[[Spiritual Black Dimensions]]'' in 1999 and 2001's ''[[Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia]]'', both met critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |author=Huey, Steve |title=''Spiritual Black Dimensions'' review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r399101|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=2010-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=O'Neill, Brian |title=''Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia'' review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r524537|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=2010-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Palmerston, Sean |title=''Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia'' review |url=http://exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid2=846&fid1=9126&csid1=16 |publisher=''[[Exclaim!]]'' |accessdate=2010-08-12}}</ref> However, another line-up change occurred between the two albums; Nagash quit and was replaced by new bassist/singer [[ICS Vortex]], and Tjodalv left due to his family commitments, and to form the subsequent band [[Susperia]],<ref>[http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Dimmu-Borgir-Biography/F7463D23088CA61748256CEA000DDA9C Dimmu Borgir Biography].

=== ''Death Cult Armageddon'' and ''Stormblåst MMV'' period ===
Despite the regular video play on [[MTV2]] and [[Fuse TV]] that their follow-up album would receive, the band stated that they were not "commercially-oriented," and instead, they 'simply wished to spread their message to more people'.<ref>[http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/interview.php?interview_id=2 Dimmu Borgir interview (09/2003)]. Metalstorm.net. Retrieved on 2011-06-11.</ref> In 2003, Dimmu Borgir recorded ''[[Death Cult Armageddon]]''. ''Death Cult Armageddon'' was recorded with the Prague Philarmonic Orchestra, conducted by Adam Klemens. All orchestrations were arranged by [[Gaute Storaas]] (who had previously worked with Dimmu Borgir on the album ''[[Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia]]'') In 2004, Dimmu Borgir performed on the mainstage at [[Ozzfest]].

In 2005, the band did a complete re-recording of the ''[[Stormblåst MMV|Stormblåst]]'' album, featuring [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]] of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] fame as the session drummer. The album also featured a DVD with a live performance from the 2004 [[Ozzfest]] tour.

===''In Sorte Diaboli'' period===
Dimmu Borgir's eighth studio album, ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'', was released on 24 April 2007.<ref>[http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7398161 Dimmu Borgir – In Sorte Diaboli CD Album]. Cduniverse.com (2007-04-24). Retrieved on 2011-06-11.</ref> A special edition version was released in a boxed case with a DVD, backward-printed lyrics, and a mirror. The album artwork was released on 14 February 2007 on a promotional webpage for the album. This album features once more the drumming of [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]] of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]. Blomberg left the band in mid-tour in 2007 because of a neck injury that resulted in limited movement of his right arm. With the release of this album, Dimmu Borgir became the first black metal band with a number one album on the charts in their native country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearblast.de/index.php?Action=showDynamicPage&artistname=DIMMU+BORGIR&id=11&ident=artistsfull#DIMMU%20BORGIR|title=Dimmu Borgir on nuclearblast.de}}</ref>

In 2009, members ICS Vortex and Mustis independently announced their departure from Dimmu Borgir. Mustis released a statement claiming his disfavor with the band, stating that he was not properly credited for his writing contributions to the band's music, mentioning possibly taking legal action.<ref name=blabbermouthsplit>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=126138|title=Dimmu Borgir Splits With Keyboardist Mustis, Bassist/Vocalist Vortex|date=30 August 2009|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref>

Dimmu Borgir soon after confirmed the pair's dismissal from the band, releasing a statement explaining why the two were fired.<ref name="blabbermouthstatement">{{cite web|url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=126340|title=Dimmu Borgir: 'We Have Put Up With Unprofessionalism And Bad Live Performances For Years'|date=2 September 2009|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> Shagrath, Silenoz and Galder wrote: "Funny then, how the new album is half-way finished written already by the rest of us without any of these guys' input, still having all those elements we're known for."<ref name=blabbermouthstatement/> The band's decision has received a very mixed response from fans.

===''Abrahadabra'' period===
{{Main|Abrahadabra (album)}}
Dimmu Borgir's ninth studio album, ''[[Abrahadabra (album)|Abrahadabra]]'', was released on 24 September 2010 in Germany, 27 September 2010 for the rest of Europe and October 12, 2010 in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=140958|title=DIMMU BORGIR: New Album Update}}</ref> Silenoz explained that the growing periods of time between albums was because the band had stopped writing music while touring, which was affecting the quality of the music. He described the new album as having an "eerie and haunting feel to it", adding that the material is "epic", "primal", atmospheric and ambient. A promotional image released with the statement showed Shagrath returning to the keyboards.<ref name=newalbum>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=134349|title=Dimmu Borgir Working On 'Grand, Huge, Epic And Primal' New Album|date=31 January 2010|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> The album features an ensemble orchestra, the ''[[Kringkastingsorkestret]]'' (the Norwegian Radio Orchestra), as well as the [[Schola Cantorum (Norwegian choir)|Schola Cantorum choir]], totaling more than 100 musicians and singers.

[[Gaute Storaas]], composer of the orchestral arrangements, released a statement on his role in working on the album. “Their music is epic, thematic and symphonic already from the creation; they are clearly having an orchestral approach to composing. My role in this is sometimes just to transcribe their themes, sometimes to take their ideas, tear them apart and build them back up in ways that are true to the band's intentions. The music must also be both interesting and playable for the musicians, and hopefully, meet the quality standards of the orchestral world.”

On 8 July the band confirmed that they had tapped Swedish multi-instrumentalist [[Snowy Shaw]] ([[Therion (band)|Therion]], [[Dream Evil]]) to replace bassist/clean vocalist ICS Vortex on their then-upcoming album, ''Abrahadabra'', and world tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=145008|title=It's Official: SNOWY SHAW Is The New Bassist/Clean Vocalist For DIMMU BORGIR}}</ref> On 25 August it was announced that Snowy Shaw had left Dimmu Borgir to rejoin Therion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=145074|title=SNOWY SHAW 'Quits' DIMMU BORGIR, Rejoins THERION}}</ref> On 17 September 2010 Dimmu Borgir released the song "Born Treacherous" from ''Abrahadabra'' on their official Myspace page.<ref>{{cite web |title=''New Dimmu Borgir Song Streaming''|url=http://www.metalcallout.com/metal-news/new-dimmu-borgir-song-streaming.html |publisher=''Metal CallOut'' |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> Then on 24 September the band announced they would stream ''Abrahadabra'' in its entirety until 7 p.m. EST that evening.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dimmu Borgir- Abrahadabra: Entire New Album Streaming|url=http://www.metalcallout.com/metal-news/dimmu-borgir-abrahadabra-entire-new-album-streaming.html|publisher=''Metal CallOut'' |accessdate=YEAR-MONTH-DAY}}</ref> The keyboards and bass are currently played by [[Geir Bratland|Gerlioz]] from [[Apoptygma Berzerk]] and Cyrus of [[Susperia]] respectively, and the clean vocals are sampled.

28 May 2011 saw Dimmu Borgir, for the very first time in the band's career, perform live with a full symphony orchestra and choir in a one-off show with the Norwegian Radio Orchestra and Schola Cantorum Choir (who collaborated on ''Abrahadabra'' the previous year) at the Oslo Spectrum entitled "Forces of the Northern Night". This was broadcast live on Norway's main national TV carrier NRK. The setlist for this show consisted of tracks from the band's recent transfiguration ''Abrahadabra'', leading tracks "Vredysbyrd" and "Progenies of the Great Apocalypse" from ''Death Cult Armageddon'', as well as newly updated versions of tracks from their standard back catalog; "The Serpentine Offering", "Kings of the Carnival Creation", and "Mourning Palace" which were re-orchestrated by Gaute Storaas. The band played a similar show the following year at the [[Wacken Open Air]] festival, having yet performed a second live show with a symphony orchestra and choir. This time, they were accompanied by the Czech National Orchestra with the same choir, being the second band in the festival's history to play with a live orchestra and choir (next to German [[power metal]] band [[Rage (German band)|Rage]]'s 2007 performance). The show was broadcast live on Germany's Kultur TV arts channel. Due to several setbacks with NRK, it is not yet known when a live album and DVD of both shows will be released for fans. Silenoz has mentioned in an interview with MetalHammer TV, that the band is going to release the "Forces of The Northern Night" concert on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTB1YXElyYM |title=Dimmu Borgir Interview (Bloodstock 2012) |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-09-06 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> Silenoz has also said in several recent interviews that both live sets have been fully mixed and will be accompanied by a feature-length documentary and bonus material when released.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===''Tenth album''===
The band announced in August 2013 that they are currently writing new material for a 2014 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/dimmu-borgir-working-on-material-for-2014-release |title=DIMMU BORGIR Working On Material For 2014 Release |publisher=Metal Injection |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> However, the release year has been delayed to 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=DIMMU BORGIR Guitarist SILENOZ Explains New Album Delay|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dimmu-borgir-guitarist-silenoz-explains-new-album-delay/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=1 June 2014}}</ref> Although the new album now appears to be likely released in 2016, marking the longest ever gap between each studio release.  The band posted a link of a brief sound clip of a new song where a vocal section could be heard on 30 October 2015 on their Official Facebook page, indicating that some progression has now been made for the next album.

==Influences and musical style==
Dimmu Borgir's older releases (since 1994 to 1999) are, according to ''Allmusic'' journalist Bradley Torreano, strongly influenced by [[Darkthrone]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name="allmusic.com"/> The band became more progressive and symphonic through the years; many black metal purists consider the band's second album, ''Stormblåst'', to be "the act's last true contribution to black metal".<ref name=musicmight>[http://www.musicmight.com/artist/norway/oslo/dimmu+borgir ''DIMMU BORGIR''].</ref> ''Enthrone Darkness Triumphant'', Dimmu Borgir's third album, "distinguished itself in two important areas, firstly forgoing their native language for English and secondly for its dramatic increase in synthesizer content".<ref name=musicmight/> Significant experimentation started c. 2000, during the era of ''[[Spiritual Black Dimensions]]'' (due to the addition of [[ICS Vortex|Vortex]]'s clean vocals, and the variety of musical ideas from then-new member [[Mustis]]), as well as ''[[Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia]]''<ref name="ReferenceA"/> due to addition of influences from composers such as [[Antonín Dvořák]], [[Enya]], [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Frédéric Chopin]].<ref>Serba, John.

Retrieved on 2011-06-11.</ref> As the music strongly differed from the older, rawer black metal style, Jon "Metalion" Kristiansen called ''Spiritual Black Dimensions'' "a fine case of melodic, over-produced symphonic metal. If you like this melodic style I can't really think of anyone doing it better [...]. No, I wouldn't call this black metal. Read the interview with [[Funeral Mist]] for the right definition of black metal."<ref name=slayer419>''The Great Rock & Roll Swindle!''.
