The main purpose of the bourgeois in relation to the worker is, of course, to have the commodity labour as cheaply as possible, which is only possible when the supply of this commodity is as large as possible in relation to the demand for it, i.e., when the overpopulation is the greatest. Overpopulation is therefore in the interest of the bourgeoisie, and it gives the workers good advice which it knows to be impossible to carry out. Since capital only increases when it employs workers, the increase of capital involves an increase of the proletariat, and, as we have seen, according to the nature of the relation of capital and labour, the increase of the proletariat must proceed relatively even faster. The... theory... which is also expressed as a law of nature, that population grows faster than the means of subsistence, is the more welcome to the bourgeois as it silences his conscience, makes hard-heartedness into a moral duty and the consequences of society into the consequences of nature, and finally gives him the opportunity to watch the destruction of the proletariat by starvation as calmly as other natural event without bestirring himself, and, on the other hand, to regard the misery of the proletariat as its own fault and to punish it.

Equally, the inputs of production are supplied through the market, as commodities. The prices of both inputs and outputs are mainly governed by the market laws of supply and demand (and ultimately by the<space/><link><target>law of value</target></link>). In short, a capitalist must use money to fuel both the means of production and labor in order to make commodities. These commodities are then sold to the market for a profit.

Enterprises are able to set their own output prices within the framework of the forces of supply and demand manifested through the market, and the development of production technology is guided by profitability criteria.</listitem><listitem>The overall aim of capitalist production, under competitive pressure, is (a) to maximise net profit income (or realise a net<space/><link><target>superprofit</target></link>) as much as possible, through cutting production costs, increasing<space/><link><target>sales</target></link>, and monopolisation of markets and supply, (b) capital accumulation, to acquire productive and non-productive assets, and (c) to<space/><link><target>privatisation</target><part>privatise</part></link><space/>both the supply of goods and services and their consumption.

However, wage labour takes many other forms, and explicit as opposed to implicit (i.e. conditioned by local labour and tax law) contracts are not uncommon.

Capital is viewed by Marx as expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value, extracted as profits and expressed as money. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset<space/><link><target>Value (economics)</target><part>value</part></link><space/>in search of additional value or<space/><link><target>surplus-value</target></link>. This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established. Capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in<space/><link><target>Confiscation</target><part>expropriation</part></link>, both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or &quot;trading up&quot; but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else, without compensation.<space/><link><target>David Harvey (geographer)</target><part>David Harvey</part></link><space/>calls this<space/><link><target>accumulation by dispossession</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade, and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital, because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. But capital accumulation may also confront resistance, when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a<space/><link><target>Strike action</target><part>strike</part></link><space/>by investors or workers, or<space/><link><target>consumer resistance</target></link>). What spurs accumulation is competition; in business, if you don't go forward, you go backward, and unless the law prevents it, the strong will exploit the weak. The basis of capital accumulation is essentially capitalising on the labour effort of others. When the &quot;economic cake&quot; expands, this may be obscured because all can gain from trade. But when the &quot;economic cake&quot; shrinks, then capital accumulation can only occur by taking income or assets from other people, other social classes, or other nations. The point is that to exist, capital must always grow, and to ensure that it will grow, people are prepared to do almost anything.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Concentration and centralisation</heading><paragraph>According to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and centralisation in the hands of the wealthy. Marx explains:</paragraph><paragraph>&quot;It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals.... Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many.... The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands,<space/><italics>caeteris paribus</italics>, on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages.... It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm'>''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 25</link></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>The rate of accumulation</heading><paragraph><template><target>Unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">October 2015</arg></template>In<space/><link><target>Marxian economics</target></link>, the<space/><italics>rate of accumulation</italics><space/>is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the<space/><link><target>stock and flow</target><part>stock</part></link><space/>of capital in an accounting period, (2) the proportion of realised<space/><link><target>surplus-value</target></link><space/>or profit-income which is reinvested, rather than consumed.

At expanded reproduction,<space/><italics>more</italics><space/>product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard (a<space/><link><target>surplus product</target></link>); the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production.</paragraph><paragraph>The bourgeois claim there is no<space/><link><target>economic law</target></link><space/>according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in Vol.2, simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realised by Dept. 1producers of means of productionexactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (pg 524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (pg. 514).</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Ernest Mandel</target></link><space/>introduced the additional concept of<space/><italics>contracted economic reproduction</italics>, i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or de<link><target>valorisation</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Balanced<space/><link><target>economic growth</target></link><space/>requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions.

The common view among economic historians is that the<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link><space/>ended with the advent of World War II.</part></link>War destruction can be illustrated by looking at<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link>. Industrial war damage was heaviest in Japan, where 1/4 of factory buildings and 1/3 of plant &amp; equipment were destroyed; 1/7 of electricpower-generating capacity was destroyed and 6/7 of oil refining capacity. The Japanese merchant fleet lost 80% of their ships. In Germany in 1944, when air attacks were heaviest, 6.5% of machine tools were damaged or destroyed, but around 90% were later repaired. About 10% of steel production capacity was lost. In Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes, ships, tanks, etc. were built and then lost or destroyed.</paragraph><paragraph>Germany's total war damage was estimated at about 17.5% of the pre-war total capital stock by value, i.e., about 1/6. In the<space/><link><target>Berlin</target></link><space/>area alone, there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities. In 1945, less than 10% of the railways were still operating. 2395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7500 bridges, 10,000 locomotives and more than 100,000 goods wagons were destroyed. Less than 40% of the remaining locomotives were operational.</paragraph><paragraph>However, by the first quarter of 1946 European rail traffic, which was given assistance and preferences (by western appointed military governors) for resources and material as an essential asset, regained its prewar operational level. At the end of the year, 90% of Germany's railway lines were operating again. In retrospect, the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing.</paragraph><paragraph>Initially, in May 1945, newly installed U.S. President<space/><link><target>Harry S. Truman</target></link>'s directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of Germany. In fact, the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level; the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of pre-war output. These plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted. In 1946, over 10% of Germany's physical capital stock (plant &amp; equipment) was also dismantled and confiscated, most of it going to the USSR. By 1947, industrial production in Germany was at 1/3 of the 1938 level, and industrial investment at about 1/2 the 1938 level.</paragraph><paragraph>The first big strike-wave in the Ruhr occurred in early 1947it was about food rations and housing, but soon there were demands for nationalisation. The U.S. appointed military Governor (Newman) however stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations. The clear message was: &quot;no work, no eat&quot;. As the military controls in Western Germany were nearly all relinquished and the Germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with Marshal Plan aid things rapidly improved. By 1951, German industrial production had overtaken the prewar level. The<space/><link><target>Marshall Aid</target></link><space/>funds were important, but, after the currency reform (which permitted German capitalists to revalue their assets) and the establishment of a new political system, much more important was the commitment of the USA to<space/><italics>rebuilding</italics><space/>German capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government, rather than keeping Germany in a weak position. Initially, average real wages remained low, lower even than in 1938, until the early 1950s, while profitability was unusually high. So the total investment fund, aided by credits, was also high, resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools.

It is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to state-interest and imperialism, and consequently, the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad. An example of this is colonists living in America who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries (e. g. Britain, Portugal, France).
