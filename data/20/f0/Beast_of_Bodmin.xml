The study found that there was &quot;no verifiable evidence&quot; of exotic felines loose in Britain, and that the mauled farm animals could have been attacked by common indigenous species.

The story hit the national press at about the same time of the official denial of alien big cat evidence on Bodmin Moor.</paragraph><paragraph>The skull was sent to the<space/><link><target>Natural History Museum, London</target><part>Natural History Museum</part></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>London</target></link><space/>for verification. They determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard, but also found that the cat had not died in Britain and that the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug. The back of the skull was cleanly cut off in a way that is commonly used to mount the head on a rug. There was an egg case inside the skull that had been laid by a tropical cockroach that could not possibly be found in Britain. There were also cut marks on the skull indicating the flesh had been scraped off with a knife, and the skull had begun to decompose only after a recent immersion in water.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/mammals/beast-of-bodmin-moor/bm_01.htm'>The Beast of Bodmin Moor</link>,<space/><link><target>Natural History Museum, London</target><part>Natural History Museum</part></link>,<space/><link><target>London</target></link>.</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Beast of Buchan</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>British big cats</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Cryptozoology</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/4-25-2006-94400.asp'>Cryptozoology and the Beast of Bodmin Moor</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/content/articles/2008/01/31/possible_big_cat_kill_feature.shtml'>Photographic evidence of possible big cat in Gloucestershire</link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Culture of Cornwall</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Beast Of Bodmin</target></template><link><target>Category:Bodmin</target></link><link><target>Category:Carnivorous cryptids</target></link><link><target>Category:Cornish folklore</target></link><link><target>Category:English legendary creatures</target></link><link><target>Category:Felis</target></link></paragraph></article>
