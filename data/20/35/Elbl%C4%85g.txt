'''Elbląg''' {{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Elbląg-2.ogg|'|e|l|b|l|o|N|k}} ({{lang-de|Elbing}}) is a [[city]] in northern [[Poland]] on the eastern edge of the [[Żuławy]] region with 124,257 inhabitants (December 31, 2011). It is the capital of [[Elbląg County]] and has been assigned (since 1999) to the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]]. Previously it was the capital of [[Elbląg Voivodeship]] (1975–1998) and a county seat within [[Gdańsk Voivodeship]] (1945–1975).

== Geographical location ==
Elbląg is located about {{convert|55|km|0|abbr=off}} south-east of [[Gdańsk]] and {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} south-west of [[Kaliningrad]].
The city is a [[port]] on the river [[Elbląg (river)|Elbląg]], which flows into the [[Vistula Lagoon]] about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north, thus giving the city access to the [[Baltic Sea]] via the Russian-controlled [[Strait of Baltiysk]]. The Old Town ({{lang-pl|Stare Miasto}}) is located on the river [[Elbląg (river)|Elbląg]] connecting Lake [[Drużno]] to the [[Vistula Lagoon]], about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} from the lagoon and {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} from Gdańsk.

== Modern city ==
[[File:Elbląg - Brama Targowa.jpg|thumb|Market Gate, Old City]]
The German Elbing was almost totally destroyed at the end of [[World War II]]. The city became the Polish Elbląg after the war, when the area was ceded to Poland under border changes promulgated at the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Parts of the inner city were gradually rebuilt, and around 2000 rebuilding was begun in a style emulating the previous architecture, in many cases over the same foundations and utilizing old bricks and portions of the same walls. The western bank part of the old city is now completely gone.

The modern city adjoins about half the length of the river between [[Lake Drużno]] and Elbląg Bay (''Zatoka Elbląska'', an arm of the [[Vistula Lagoon]]), and spreads out on both banks, though mainly on the eastern side. To the east is the Elbląg Upland (''Wysoczyzna Elbląska''), a dome pushed up by glacial compression, 390&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in diameter and {{convert|200|m|2|abbr=on}} high at its greatest elevation.<ref>[http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/ice/lec14/lec14.htm#n_poland REGIONAL GLACIATION OF SOUTHERN & EASTERN BALTIC], Emporia State University Lecture #14, by James S. Aber.</ref> It gives the appearance of ridges and parkland.

Views to the west show flat fields extending to the horizon; this part of the Vistula Delta (''Żuławy Wiślane'') is used mainly for agricultural purposes. To the south are the marshes and swamps of Drużno. The [[Elbląg River]] has been left in a more natural state through the city, but elsewhere it is a controlled channel with branches. One of them, the [[Jagielonski Channel]] (''Kanał Jagieloński''), leads to the [[Nogat]] River, along which navigation to Gdańsk is common. The [[Elbląg Canal]] (''Kanał Elbląski'') connecting Lake Drużno with [[Drwęca]] River and Lake [[Jeziorak]] is a popular tourist site.

Elbląg is not a deep-water port. The draft of vessels using its waterways must be no greater than {{convert|1.5|m|2|abbr=on}} by law. The turning area at Elbląg is {{convert|120|m|2|abbr=on}} diameter and a pilot is required for large vessels.<ref>[http://www.polfracht.pl/polfracht/psal/localinf/elb/portelb1.htm Port Elbląg], site maintained by Polfracht Shipping Agency Ltd.</ref> Deep water vessels cannot manoeuvre; in that sense, Elbląg has become a subsidiary [[port of Gdańsk]]. Traffic of smaller vessels at Elbląg is within the river and very marginal, while larger vessels cannot reach the open [[Baltic Sea]] because the channel, once built in [[East Prussia|East-Prussia]] to go through the peninsula, has belonged to [[Russia]] since 1945. The river has become almost stagnant and its banks are overgrown with waterlilies and tulies. The city features three quay complexes, movable cranes, and railways. One of its specialities is heavy machinery.

=== Etymology ===

''Elbląg'' is the [[Polish language|Polish]] [[Corruption (grammar)|derivative]] of the [[German language|German]] name ''Elbing'', which was assigned by the [[Teutonic Knights]] to the citadel and subsequent town placed by them in 1237 next to the river. The purpose of the citadel was to prevent the [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] settlement of Truso from being reoccupied, as the German crusaders were at war with the pagan Prussians. The citadel was named after the river, itself of uncertain etymology. One traditional etymology connects it to the name of the [[Helveconae]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] mentioned in [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources, but the etymology or language of the [[tribal name]] is not known.

The settlement was first mentioned as "Ilfing" in ''[[Wikisource:Bright's Anglo-Saxon Reader/The Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan|The Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan]]'', an [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] chronicle written in [[King Alfred]]'s reign using information from a Viking who had visited the area.

During [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], the [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] settlement of [[Truso]] was located on [[Drużno|Lake Drużno]], near the current site of Elbląg in historical [[Pogesania]]; the settlement burned down in the 10th century.<ref>According to the Elbląg museum</ref> Early in the 13th century the [[Teutonic Knights]] conquered the region, built a castle, and founded Elbing on the lake, with a population mostly from [[Lübeck]] (today the lake, now much smaller, no longer reaches the city). After the defeat of the Teutonic Knights and the destruction of the castle by the inhabitants, the city successively came under the sovereignty of the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom|Polish crown]] (1466), the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (1772), and [[Germany]] (1871). Elbing was heavily damaged in [[World War II]], and its German citizens [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|were expelled]] upon the war's end. The city became part of Poland in 1945 and was repopulated with Polish citizens.

The seaport of '''Truso''' was first mentioned ca. 890 by [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] sailor, travelling on the south coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] at the behest of King [[Alfred the Great]] of [[England]]. The exact location of Truso was not known for a long time, as the seashore has significantly changed, but most historians trace the settlement inside or near to modern Elbląg on Lake [[Drużno]]. Truso was located at territory already known to the [[Roman Empire]] and earlier.

It was an important seaport serving the [[Vistula River]] bay on the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] Baltic Sea [[trade route]]s which led from [[Birka]] in the north to the island of [[Gotland]] and to [[Visby]] in the Baltic Sea. From there, traders continued further south to [[Carnuntum]] along the [[Amber Road]]. The ancient Amber Road led further southwest and southeast to the [[Black Sea]] and eventually to [[Asia]]. The east-west trade route went from Truso, along the Baltic Sea to [[Jutland]], and from there inland by river to [[Hedeby]], a large trading center in Jutland. The main goods of Truso were [[amber]], furs, and slaves.

Archaeological finds in 1897 and diggings in the 1920s placed Truso at Gut Hansdorf. A large burial field was also found at Elbing. Recent Polish diggings have found burned beams and ashes and thousand-year-old artifacts in an area of about 20 [[hectares]]. Many of these artifacts are now displayed at the Elbing Museum.

=== Prussian Crusade ===
{{Main|Prussian Crusade}}
[[File:Elbląg AL01.jpg|thumb|right|Elbląg Old Town seen from north]]
Attempts to conquer Prussian land began in 997, when [[Bolesław I Chrobry]], at the urging of the Pope, sent a contingent of soldiers and a missionary ([[Adalbert of Prague]]) to the pagan Prussians, a non-Slavic people, on a crusade of conquest and conversion. The crusade encompassed much of the Baltic Sea coast, including [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] (present day Gdańsk), and other areas of the coast up to Sambia. Starting in 1209 additional crusades were called for by [[Konrad I of Masovia|Konrad of Masovia]], who mainly sought to conquer Prussian territory, rather than actually convert the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Prussians. Despite heroic efforts, Old Prussian sovereignty would eventually collapse after a succession of wars instigated by [[Pope Honorius III]] and his frequent calls for crusade.

Before the Prussians and their neighbors to the west, [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|the Pomeranians]], were finally brought to heel, Polish rulers and the Duchy of [[Masovia]], both by then [[Christianity|Christianised]] peoples, would be continually frustrated in their attempts at northern expansion. Aside from minor border raids, major campaigns against the Prussians would be launched in 1219, 1220, and 1222. After a particularly sound defeat by Prussian forces in 1223, Polish forces in [[Chełmno]], the seat of [[Christian of Oliva]] and the [[Masovia|Duchy of Masovia]], were forced onto the defensive.

In 1226 Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]] summoned the [[Teutonic Knights]] for assistance; by 1230 they had secured [[Chełmno]] (Culm) and begun claiming conquered territories for themselves under the authority of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], although these claims were rejected by the Poles, whose ambition had been to conquer Prussia all along. The Teutonic Order's strategy was to move down the Vistula and secure the delta, establishing a barrier between the Prussians and [[Gdańsk|Danzig]]. The victorious Teutonic Knights built a castle at Elbing, near, if not on top of, the destroyed Prussian town of Truso.

The [[Chronicon terrae Prussiae]]<ref>3.14</ref> describes the conflict in the vicinity of Lake Drusen (now Drużno) shortly before the founding of Elbing:

:″Omnia propugnacula, que habebant in illo loco, qui dicitur (list) ... circa stagnum Drusine ... occisis et captiis infidelibus, potenter expugnavit, et in cinerem redigendo terre alteri coequavit."

:"All the little redoubts that they had in that place, which are said to be (list) ... and around the Drusine marsh ... he (frater Hermannus magister) assaulted and levelled by rendering them into ash, after the infidels had been killed or captured."

Truso did not disappear suddenly to be replaced with the citadel and town of Elbing during the Prussian Crusade. It had already burned down in the tenth century, with the population dispersed in the area.

=== Foundation of Elbing ===
The [[Chronicon terrae Prussiae]]<ref>3.15</ref> describes the founding of Elbing under the leadership of [[Hermann Balk]]. After building two ships, the Pilgerim (Pilgrim) and the Vridelant (Friedland), with the assistance of [[Henry III, Margrave of Meissen]], the Teutonic Knights used them to clear the Vistula Lagoon (''Frisches Haff'') and the [[Vistula Spit]] of Prussians:
:... ''et recens mare purgatum fuit ab insultu infidelium'' ...
:... "and the Vistula Spit was purged of the insult of the infidels..."

Apparently the river was in [[Pomesania]], which the knights had just finished clearing, but the bay was in [[Pogesania]]. The first Elbing was placed in Pogesania:
:''Magister ... venit ad terram Pogesanie, ad insulam illam ... que est in media fluminis Elbingi, in illo loco, ubi Elbingus intrat recens mare et erexit ibi castrum, quod a nomine fluminis Elbingum appellavit, anno dominice incarnacionis MCCXXXVII. Aliqui referunt, quod idem castrum postea ab infidelibus fuerit expugnatum, et tunc ad eum locum, ubi nunc situm est, translatum, et circa ipsum civitas collocata.''<ref>Notes on the passage. [[Medieval Latin]] often used e for ae: Pogesanie for Pogesaniae, que for quae, etc. Recens mare is "the [[fresh water|fresh-water]] sea". [[Castrum]] is citadel, not yet of brick.</ref>

:"The master ... came to the region of Pogesania, to that island which is in the middle of the Elbing river, in that place where the Elbing enters the Vistula Lagoon, and built there a fort, which he called by the name of the Elbing River, in the year of the incarnation of the Lord, 1237. Others report that the same fort was attacked by the infidels and then was moved to the place where it is now situated, and the city gathered around it."

Both landings were amphibious operations conducted from the ships. The ''Chronicon'' relates that they were in use for many years and then were sunk in Lake Drusen. In 1238 the [[Dominican Order]] was invited to build a monastery on a grant of land. Pomesania was not secured, however, and from 1240-1242 the order began building a brick castle on the south side of the settlement, where archaeologists now believe Truso had been. It may be significant that Elbing's first industry was the same as Truso's had been: manufacture of amber and bone artifacts for export. In 1243 [[William of Modena]] created the Diocese of Pomesania and three others. They were at first only ideological constructs, but the tides of time turned them into reality in that same century.

The foundation of Elbing was perhaps not the end of the Old Prussian story in the region. In 1825 a manuscript listing a vocabulary of the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] [[Old Prussian|Old Prussian language]], named the Elbing-Prussian Dictionary ({{lang-de|Elbing-Preußisches Wörterbuch}}), or more commonly in English just Elbing Vocabulary, was found among some manuscripts from a merchant's house. It contained 802 words in a dialect now termed Pomesanian with their equivalents in an early form of German.

The origin of the vocabulary remains unknown. Its format is like that of modern travel dictionaries; i.e., it may have been used by German speakers to communicate with Old Prussians, but the specific circumstances are only speculative. The manuscript became the Codex Neumannianus. It disappeared after a British [[Strategic bombing|bombing raid]] destroyed the library at Elbing but before then facsimiles had been made. The date of the MSS was estimated at ca. 1400, but it was a copy. There is no evidence concerning the provenance of the original, except that it must have been in Pomesanian.

===Hanseatic Elbing===
[[File:Siegel Elbing 1350.jpg|thumb|right|Seal of the city of Elbing from 1350, ''Sigillum civitatis Elbingensis'']]
In 1246 the town was granted a constitution under [[Lübeck law]], used in maritime circumstances, instead of [[Magdeburg rights]] common in other cities in [[Central Europe]]. This decision of the Order was in keeping with its general strategy of espousing the [[Industry trade group|trade association]] that in 1358 would become the [[Hanseatic League]]. The Order seized on this association early and used it to establish bases throughout the Baltic. The Order's involvement in the League was somewhat contradictory. In whatever cities they founded the ultimate authority was the commander of the town, who kept office in the citadel, typically used as a prison. Lübeck law, on the other hand, provided for self-government of the town.

Membership in the Hanseatic League meant having important trading contacts with [[England]], [[Flanders]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]]. The city received numerous merchant privileges from the [[List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England|rulers of England]], Poland, Pomerania, and the Teutonic Order. For instance, the privilege of the Old Town ({{lang-de|Altstadt}}, {{lang-pl|Stare Miasto}}) was upgraded in 1343, while in 1393 it was granted an emporium privilege for grains, metals, and forest products.

Except for the citadel and churches, Elbing at the time was more of a small village by modern standards. Its area was {{convert|300|x|500|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}. It featured a wharf, a marketplace and five streets, as well as a number of churches. The castle was completed in 1251. In 1288 fire destroyed the entire settlement except for the churches, which were of brick. A new circuit wall was started immediately. From 1315 to 1340 Elbląg was rebuilt. A separate settlement called New Town ({{lang-de|Neustadt}}) was founded ca. 1337 and received [[Lübeck rights]] in 1347. In 1349 the [[Black Death]] struck the town, toward the end of the European plague. After the population recovered it continued building up the city and in 1364 a [[crane (machine)|crane]] was built for the port.

The German-language ''Elbinger Rechtsbuch'',<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?lr=&as_brr=0&q=%22Elbinger+Rechtsbuch%22&btnG=Search+Books |title="Elbinger Rechtsbuch" - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> written in Elbing, Prussia documented among other laws for the first time Polish common law. The German-language Polish laws are based on the [[Sachsenspiegel]]<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8NYNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA337&dq=elbing+vocabular#PPA337,M1 |title=Archiv für das Studium der neueren ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-09-21 |accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> and were written down to aid the judges. It is thus the oldest source for documented Polish [[common law]] and is in Polish referred to as the ''Księga Elbląska'' (Book of Elbląg<ref>Towarzystwo Naukowe Warszawskie: The Journal of Juristic Papyrology, 1946 [http://books.google.com/books?lr=&as_brr=0&q=%22Book+of+Elbing%22&btnG=Search+Books]</ref>). It was written down in the second half of the 13th century.

===Kingdom of Poland===
[[File:Elbląg, Wigilijna Street.jpg|thumb|right|Tenement houses in the old town]]
In 1440 several western and eastern Prussian towns formed the [[Prussian Confederation]], which led the revolt of Prussia against the rule of the Teutonic Knights in 1454. The burghers destroyed the Teutonic Order castle.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} For assistance against the Order, the Confederation asked for help from King [[Casimir IV of Poland]]; Casimir's subsequent claiming of Prussia led to the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]].

After the Section of Prussians and Polish victory over the Teutonic Order, the city became part of the [[autonomous area|autonomous province]] of [[Royal Prussia]] under the suzerainty of the Polish crown in the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)|Second Peace of Thorn]]. The city was known to the Polish crown by its Polish name '''Elbląg'''.
With the creation of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569, the city was brought under direct control of the Polish crown.

With the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]] the burghers became [[Protestantism|Lutherans]] and the first Lutheran [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] was established in Elbląg in 1535.

From 1579 Elbing/Elbląg had close trade relations with [[England]], to which the city accorded [[free trade]]. English, [[Scotland|Scottish]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] merchants settled in the city. They formed the [[Scottish Reformed Church of Elbląg]] and became Elbing citizens, aiding Lutheran [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The rivalry of nearby Danzig interrupted trading links several times. By 1618 Elbląg had left the Hanseatic League owing to its close business dealings with England.

Famous inhabitants of the city at that time included native sons [[Hans von Bodeck]] and [[Samuel Hartlib]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], Swedish Chancellor [[Axel Oxenstierna]] brought the [[Moravian Church|Moravian Brethren]] refugee [[John Amos]] [[Comenius]] to Elbląg for six years (1642–48). In 1642 [[Johann Stobäus]], who composed with [[Johann Eccard]], published the '' Preussische Fest-Lieder'', a number of evangelical Prussian songs. In 1646 the city recorder Daniel Barholz noted that the [[city council]] employed ''Bernsteindreher'', or ''Paternostermacher'', licensed and guilded amber craftsmen who worked on [[prayer beads]], [[rosary|rosaries]], and many other items made of amber. Members of the Barholz family became mayors and councillors.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the Vistula Lagoon was the main southern Baltic base of King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]], who was hailed as the protector of the Protestants. By 1660 the Vistula Lagoon had gone to Elector [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], but was returned in 1700.

The poet [[Christian Wernicke]] was born in 1661 in Elbing, while [[Gottfried Achenwall]] became famous for his teachings in [[natural law]] and [[International human rights law|human rights law]].
In 1700-1710 it was occupied by Swedish troops.
In 1709 it was besieged, taken by storm on February 2, 1710 by Russian troops with support of Prussian artillery. The city was handed over to [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish King]] Augustus II in 1712.

The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] cartographer [[Johann Friedrich Endersch]] completed a map of [[Warmia]] ({{lang-de|Karte des Ermlandes}}) in 1755 and also made a [[copper]] [[etching]] of the galley named "The City of Elbląg" ({{lang-de|Die Stadt Elbing}}) .

During the [[War of the Polish Succession]] in 1734, Elbing/Elbląg and Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]) were placed under [[military occupation]] by [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Saxony]].<ref>''{{de icon}} Book: Merian-Chronik, Cöln 1737/8: Elbingische Geschichte Zu gleicher Zeit Danzigs Belagerung 1734...

Nachricht, Wie viele Personen das 1734te Jahr durch in der Stadt Dantzig getauffet/verehelichet und begraben worden...''</ref> The town came again under occupation by Russia from 1758-1762 during the [[Seven Years' War]].

===Hohenzollern Prussia===
[[File:Wieża Katedry w Elblągu przed 1945.jpg|thumb|right|St. Nicholas Cathedral before 1945]]
During the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, resulting in the re-unification of Prussia,  the [[City-state|city state]] was annexed by King [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Elbing became part of the new Prussian Province of [[West Prussia]] in 1773. In the 1815 provincial reorganization following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Elbing and its [[Landkreis Elbing|hinterland]] were included within [[Regierungsbezirk Danzig]] in West Prussia.

Elbing [[industrialisation|industrialized]] under the sovereignty of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] kings in [[Berlin]]. In 1828 the first steamship was built by Ignatz Grunau. In 1837 [[Ferdinand Schichau]] started the [[F. Schichau]] company in Elbing as well as another shipyard in Danzig later on. Schichau constructed the ''Borussia'', the first [[Screw ship|screw-vessel]] in Germany. F. Schichau built [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] machinery, ships, [[steam engine]]s, and [[torpedo]]es. After the inauguration of the railway to [[Königsberg]] in 1853, Elbing's industry began to grow. Schichau worked together with his son-in-law Carl H. Zise, who continued the industrial complex after Schichau's death. Schichau erected large complexes for his many thousands of workers.

[[Georg Steenke]], an engineer from Königsberg, connected Elbing near the Baltic Sea with the southern part of Prussia by building the Oberländischer Kanal ([[Elbląg Canal]]).

Elbing became part of the Prussian-led [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the [[unification of Germany]]. As Elbing became an industrial city, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) frequently received the majority of votes; in the 1912 [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] elections the SPD received 51% of the vote. After [[World War I]], most of West Prussia became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Elbing was joined to German [[East Prussia]], and was separated from [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] by the [[Polish Corridor]].

[[Mormons]] started [[Photographic film|filming]] the church records of Elbing's citizens in ''Kirchenbücher''. Records dating from 1577 to 1890 are available.

===Third Reich===
During the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] era (1933–1945), three subcamps of the [[Stutthof concentration camp]] were located near the town: ''Elbing'', ''Elbing (Org. Todt)'', and ''Elbing (Schinau)''. These were closed and many of the German inhabitants of Elbing forced to flee as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] approached the city toward the end of [[World War II]] (see [[Evacuation of East Prussia]]). Laid under siege since January 23, 1945,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} about 65% of the city infrastructure was destroyed, including most of the historical city center. The town was captured by the Soviet Red Army during the night of February 9/10, 1945.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  During the first days of the fighting most of the population of approximately 100,000 persons fled, except of  about 20,000.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} After the end of war, in spring 1945, the region together with the town of Elbing became part of [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] as a result of the [[Potsdam Conference]].

Almost all Germans who remained or returned were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] by the Poles during the following months.

===History after 1945===
After the expulsion of most of the German population, the city was repopulated and given the Polish name ''Elbląg''. Of the new inhabitants, 98% were [[Poles]] expelled from [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union]], or Polish peasants from central Poland. Parts of the damaged historical city center were completely demolished, with the bricks being used to rebuild [[Warsaw]] and [[Gdańsk]]. The [[People's Republic of Poland|Communist authorities]] had originally planned that the Old Town, utterly destroyed during the fightings since January 23, 1945, would be built over with [[Tower block|blocks of flats]]; however, economic difficulties thwarted this effort. Two [[church (building)|churches]] were reconstructed and the remaining ruins of the old town were torn down in the 1960s.

Along with [[Tricity, Poland|Tricity]] and [[Szczecin]], Elbląg was the scene of rioting in the coastal cities in 1970 (see also [[Polish 1970 protests]]). Since 1990 the German minority population has had a modest resurgence, with the Elbinger Deutsche Minderheit Organization counting around 450 members in 2000.

[[File:Elbrewery Company.jpg|250px|thumb|Elbrewery in Elbląg, Poland.]]
Restoration of the Old Town began after 1989. Since the beginning of the restoration, an extensive archaeological programme has been carried out. Most of the city's heritage was destroyed during the construction of basements in the 19th century or during World War II, but the backyards and [[latrine]]s of the houses remained largely unchanged, and have provided information on the city's history. In some instances, private investors have incorporated parts of preserved stonework into new architecture. By 2006, approximately 75% of the Old Town had been reconstructed. The city museum presents many pieces of art and items of everyday use, including the only 15th century [[binoculars]] preserved in Europe.

Elbląng is home to the [[Elbrewery]], Poland's largest brewery, which belongs to the Żywiec Group.
