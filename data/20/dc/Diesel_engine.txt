The '''diesel engine''' (also known as a '''compression-ignition''' or 'CI' engine) is an [[internal combustion engine]] in which [[Combustion|ignition]] of the [[Diesel fuel|fuel]] that has been injected into the [[combustion chamber]] is initiated by the high temperature which a gas achieves when greatly compressed ([[adiabatic compression]]). This contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a [[petrol engine]] ([[gasoline]] engine) or [[gas engine]] (using a gaseous fuel as opposed to [[petrol]]), which use a [[spark plug]] to ignite an air-fuel mixture.

[[File:Dieselmotor vs.jpg|thumb|A Diesel engine built by [[MAN SE|MAN AG]] in 1906]]
The diesel engine has the highest [[thermal efficiency]] ([[engine efficiency]]) of any practical [[internal combustion|internal]] or [[external combustion]] engine due to its very high [[compression ratio]] and inherent [[lean mixture|lean]] burn which enables heat dissipation by the excess air. A small efficiency loss is also avoided compared to two-stroke non-direct-injection gasoline engines since unburnt fuel is not present at valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly from the intake/injection to the exhaust. Low-speed diesel engines (as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant) can have a thermal efficiency that exceeds 50%.<ref name="bmmWW ">[http://mandieselturbo.com/files/news/filesof16119/tech_paper_low_speed.pdf Low Speed Engines Tech Paper], MAN Diesel</ref><ref name="mhi">{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/technology/review/pdf/e451/e451021.pdf |title=Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Technical Review Vol.45 No.1 (2008) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5tDljlTm4 |archivedate = October 4, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Diesel engines are manufactured in [[two-stroke]] and [[four-stroke]] versions. They were originally used as a more efficient replacement for stationary [[steam engine]]s. Since the 1910s they have been used in [[submarine]]s and ships. Use in locomotives, trucks, [[heavy equipment]] and electricity generation plants followed later. In the 1930s, they slowly began to be used in a few [[automobile]]s. Since the 1970s, the use of diesel engines in larger on-road and [[off-road vehicle]]s in the USA increased. According to the British Society of Motor Manufacturing and Traders, the [[European Union|EU]] average for diesel cars account for 50% of the total sold, including 70% in France and 38% in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techincom.ru/news.htm?id=272 |title=Gazette. five years dizelizatsiyu |language=Russian |publisher=Techincom.ru |date=2007-03-26 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}</ref>

[[File:Hornsby Akroyd lamp oil engine no.10171 of 1905 at GDSF 08.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Hornsby-Akroyd oil engine]] working at the [[Great Dorset Steam Fair]]]]
In 1885, the [[UK|English]] inventor [[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] began investigating the possibility of using [[Kerosene|paraffin oil]] (very similar to modern-day [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]) for an engine, which unlike [[Gasoline|petrol]] would be difficult to vaporise in a carburettor as its [[Volatility (physics)|volatility]] is not sufficient to allow this.<ref name="aoi">{{cite web|title=The Akroyd Oil Engine|publisher=Ray Hooley's—Ruston-Hornsby—Engine Pages|url=http://www.oldengine.org/members/ruston/History6.htm|doi=|accessdate= 2007-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Diesel has come a long way but still doesn't get the tax breaks it deserves|publisher=[[The Scotsman]], Scotland on Sunday|date=2003-01-16|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/business.cfm?id=197272003|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref>

His [[hot bulb engine]]s, built from 1891 by [[Richard Hornsby & Sons|Richard Hornsby and Sons]], were the first internal combustion engine to use a pressurised [[fuel injection]] system.<ref name=rwallis>{{cite book | last = Ransome-Wallis | first = Patrick | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Railway Locomotives | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 2001 | location = | page = 28 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-486-41247-4}}</ref> The Hornsby-Akroyd engine used a comparatively low compression ratio, so that the temperature of the air compressed in the combustion chamber at the end of the compression stroke was not high enough to initiate combustion. Combustion instead took place in a separated combustion chamber, the "vaporizer" or "hot bulb" mounted on the cylinder head, into which fuel was sprayed. Self-ignition occurred from contact between the fuel-air mixture and the hot walls of the vaporizer.<ref name=mcneil>{{cite book | last = McNeil | first = Ian | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = An Encyclopaedia of the History of Technology | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 1990 | location = | pages = 310–311 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-01306-2}}</ref> As the engine's load increased, so did the temperature of the bulb, causing the ignition period to advance; to counteract pre-ignition, water was dripped into the air intake.<ref name=wrangham>{{cite book | last = Wrangham | first = D.A. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Theory & Practice of Heat Engines | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1956 | location = | page = 664 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>

The modern Diesel engine incorporates the features of direct (airless) injection and compression-ignition. Both ideas were patented by Akroyd Stuart and Charles Richard Binney in May 1890.<ref name="aoi"/> Another patent was taken out on 8 October 1890, detailing the working of a complete engine—essentially that of a diesel engine—where air and fuel are introduced separately. The difference between the Akroyd engine and the modern Diesel engine was the requirement to supply extra heat to the cylinder to start the engine from cold. By 1892, Akroyd Stuart had produced an updated version of the engine that no longer required the additional heat source, a year before Diesel's engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2007/09/who-invented-diesel-engine_07.html|title=Who invented Diesel Engine?|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>

[[File:Diesel's Engine.jpg|thumb|left|Diesel's original 1897 engine on display at the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany]]
In 1892, Akroyd Stuart patented a water-jacketed vaporiser to allow [[compression ratio]]s to be increased. In the same year, [[Barton Transport|Thomas Henry Barton]] at Hornsbys built a working high-compression version for experimental purposes, whereby the vaporiser was replaced with a [[cylinder head]], therefore not relying on air being preheated, but by combustion through higher [[compression ratio]]s. It ran for six hours—the first time automatic ignition was produced by compression alone.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}} This was five years before Rudolf Diesel built his well-known high-compression prototype engine in 1897.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WKuG-VIwID8C|title=Icons of Invention: The Makers of the Modern World from Gutenberg to Gates|author=|year=20|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=2013-02-07|isbn=9780313347436}}</ref>

[[Rudolf Diesel]] was, however, subsequently credited with the innovation, and he was able to improve the engine further, whereas Akroyd Stuart stopped development on his engine in 1893.

In 1892 Diesel received patents in Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States for "Method of and Apparatus for Converting Heat into Work".<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=oV5wAAAAEBAJ METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR CONVERTING HEAT INTO WORK], United States Patent No. 542,846, Filed Aug 26 1892, Issued July 16, 1895, Inventor Rudolf Diesel of Berlin Germany</ref> In 1893 he described a "slow-combustion engine" that first compressed air thereby raising its temperature above the igniting-point of the fuel, then gradually introducing fuel while letting the mixture expand "against resistance sufficiently to prevent an essential increase of temperature and pressure", then cutting off fuel and "expanding without transfer of heat".{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} In 1894 and 1895 he filed patents and addenda in various countries for his Diesel engine; the first patents were issued in Spain (No.&nbsp;16,654), France (No.&nbsp;243,531) and Belgium (No.&nbsp;113,139) in December 1894, and in Germany (No.&nbsp;86,633) in 1895 and the United States (No.&nbsp;608,845) in 1898.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=vQVgAAAAEBAJ Internal-Combustion Engine], U.

At [[Augsburg]], on August 10, 1893, Rudolf Diesel's prime model, a single {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} iron cylinder with a [[flywheel]] at its base, ran on its own power for the first time. Diesel spent two more years making improvements and in 1896 demonstrated another model with a theoretical efficiency of 75%, in contrast to the 10% efficiency of the [[steam engine]]. By 1898, Diesel had become a millionaire. His engines were used to power [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], electric and water plants, automobiles and trucks, and marine craft. They were soon to be used in mines, [[oil field]]s, factories, and transoceanic shipping.

{{See also|Diesel cycle|Reciprocating internal combustion engine}}

The diesel internal combustion engine differs from the gasoline powered Otto cycle by using highly compressed hot air to ignite the fuel rather than using a spark plug (''compression ignition'' rather than ''spark ignition'').

In the true diesel engine, only air is initially introduced into the combustion chamber. The air is then compressed with a compression ratio typically between 15:1 and 22:1 resulting in  {{convert|40|bar|MPa psi|adj=on}} pressure compared to {{convert|8|to|14|bar|MPa psi}} in the petrol engine. This high compression causes the temperature of the air to rise to {{convert|550|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. At about the top of the compression stroke, fuel is injected directly into the compressed air in the combustion chamber. This may be into a (typically [[toroid]]al) void in the top of the piston or a ''pre-chamber'' depending upon the design of the engine. The fuel injector ensures that the fuel is broken down into small droplets, and that the fuel is distributed evenly. The heat of the compressed air vaporizes fuel from the surface of the droplets. The vapour is then ignited by the heat from the compressed air in the combustion chamber, the droplets continue to vaporise from their surfaces and burn, getting smaller, until all the fuel in the droplets has been burnt. Combustion occurs at a substantially constant pressure during the initial part of the power stroke.  The start of vaporisation causes a delay before ignition and the characteristic diesel knocking sound as the vapour reaches ignition temperature and causes an abrupt increase in pressure above the piston (not shown on the P-V indicator diagram). When combustion is complete the combustion gases expand as the piston descends further; the high pressure in the cylinder drives the piston downward, supplying power to the crankshaft.<ref>[[Combined gas law]]</ref>

As well as the high level of compression allowing combustion to take place without a separate ignition system, a high [[compression ratio]] greatly increases the engine's efficiency. Increasing the compression ratio in a spark-ignition engine where fuel and air are mixed before entry to the cylinder is limited by the need to prevent damaging [[pre-ignition#Pre-ignition|pre-ignition]]<!--- detonation from occurring after ignition and is more a fuel quality or combustion chamber design issue --->. Since only air is compressed in a diesel engine, and fuel is not introduced into the cylinder until shortly before top dead centre ([[Top Dead Center|TDC]]), premature detonation is not a problem and compression ratios are much higher.

The p–V diagam is a simplified and idealised representation of the events involved in a Diesel engine cycle, arranged to illustrate the similarity with a [[Carnot cycle]].  Starting at 1, the piston is at bottom dead centre and both valves are closed at the start of the compression stroke; the cylinder contains air at atmospheric pressure.  Between 1 and 2 the air is compressed adiabatically—that is without heat transfer to or from the environment—by the rising piston.  (This is only approximately true since there will be some heat exchange with the cylinder walls.) During this compression, the volume is reduced, the pressure and temperature both rise.  At or slightly before 2 (TDC) fuel is injected and burns in the compressed hot air. Chemical energy is released and this constitutes an injection of thermal energy (heat) into the compressed gas.  Combustion and heating occur between 2 and 3.  In this interval the pressure remains constant since the piston descends, and the volume increases; the temperature rises as a consequence of the energy of combustion. At 3 fuel injection and combustion are complete, and the cylinder contains gas at a higher temperature than at 2.  Between 3 and 4 this hot gas expands, again approximately adiabatically. Work is done on the system to which the engine is connected.  During this expansion phase the volume of the gas rises, and its temperature and pressure both fall. At 4 the exhaust valve opens, and the pressure falls abruptly to atmospheric (approximately).  This is unresisted expansion and no useful work is done by it.  Ideally the adiabatic expansion should continue, extending the line 3–4 to the right until the pressure falls to that of the surrounding air, but the loss of efficiency caused by this unresisted expansion is justified by the practical difficulties involved in recovering it (the engine would have to be much larger).  After the opening of the exhaust valve, the exhaust stroke follows, but this (and the following induction stroke) are not shown on the diagram.  If shown, they would be represented by a low-pressure loop at the bottom of the diagram.  At 1 it is assumed that the exhaust and induction strokes have been completed, and the cylinder is again filled with air.  The piston-cylinder system absorbs energy between 1 and 2—this is the work needed to compress the air in the cylinder, and is provided by mechanical kinetic energy stored in the flywheel of the engine.  Work output is done by the piston-cylinder combination between 2 and 4. The difference between these two increments of work is the indicated work output per cycle, and is represented by the area enclosed by the p–V loop.  The adiabatic expansion is in a higher pressure range than that of the compression because the gas in the cylinder is hotter during expansion than during compression.  It is for this reason that the loop has a finite area, and the net output of work during a cycle is positive.

===Early fuel injection systems===
Diesel's original engine injected fuel with the assistance of compressed air, which atomized the fuel and forced it into the engine through a nozzle (a similar principle to an aerosol spray). The nozzle opening was closed by a pin valve lifted by the camshaft to initiate the fuel injection before top dead centre ([[Top Dead Center|TDC]]). This is called an '''air-blast injection'''. Driving the three stage compressor used some power but the efficiency and net power output was more than any other combustion engine at that time.

Diesel engines in service today raise the fuel to extreme pressures by mechanical pumps and deliver it to the combustion chamber by pressure-activated injectors without compressed air. With direct injected diesels, injectors spray fuel through 4 to 12 small orifices in its nozzle. The early air injection diesels always had a superior combustion without the sharp increase in pressure during combustion. Research is now being performed and patents are being taken out to again use some form of air injection to reduce the nitrogen oxides and pollution, reverting to Diesel's original implementation with its superior combustion and possibly quieter operation. In all major aspects, the modern diesel engine holds true to Rudolf Diesel's original design, that of igniting fuel by compression at an extremely high pressure within the cylinder. With much higher pressures and high technology injectors, present-day diesel engines use the so-called solid injection system applied by [[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] for his [[hot bulb engine]]. The [[indirect injection]] engine could be considered the latest development of these low speed ''hot bulb'' ignition engines.

===Fuel delivery===
Diesel engines are also produced with two significantly different injection locations. "Direct" and "Indirect". Indirect injected engines place the injector in a pre-combustion chamber in the head which due to thermal losses generally require a "glow plug" to start and very high compression ratio. Usually in the range of 21:1 to 23:1 ratio. Direct injected engines use a generally donut shaped combustion chamber void on the top of the piston. Thermal efficiency losses are significantly lower in DI engines which facilitates a much lower compression ratio generally between 14:1 and 20:1 but most DI engines are closer to 17:1. The direct injected process is significantly more internally violent and thus requires careful design, and more robust construction. The lower compression ratio also creates challenges for emissions due to partial burn. Turbocharging is particularly suited to DI engines since the low compression ratio facilitates meaningful forced induction, and the increase in airflow allows capturing additional fuel efficiency not only from more complete combustion, but also from lowering parasitic efficiency losses when properly operated, by widening both power and efficiency curves. The violent combustion process of direct injection also creates more noise, but modern designs using "split shot" injectors or similar multi shot processes have dramatically amended this issue by firing a small charge of fuel before the main delivery which pre-charges the combustion chamber for a less abrupt and in most cases slightly cleaner burn.

A vital component of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic [[governor (device)|governor]] which regulates the idling speed and maximum speed of the engine by controlling the rate of fuel delivery.  Unlike Otto-cycle engines, incoming air is not throttled and a diesel engine without a governor cannot have a stable idling speed and can easily overspeed, resulting in its destruction.  Mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the engine's [[gear train]].<ref name="buckman">[http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Ambac/AmbacMenu1.htm American Bosch Diesel Information Service Manual], fig.3–4, 3–5; [http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jag/vw/engine/fi/injpump.html Robert Bosch type VE Diesel injection pump]</ref>  These systems use a combination of springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed.<ref name=buckman/>  Modern electronically controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery by use of an electronic control module (ECM) or electronic control unit ([[electronic control unit|ECU]]).  The ECM/ECU receives an engine speed signal, as well as other operating parameters such as intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature, from a sensor and controls the amount of fuel and start of injection timing through [[actuator]]s to maximise power and efficiency and minimise emissions.  Controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is a key to minimizing emissions, and maximizing [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] (efficiency), of the engine.  The timing is measured in degrees of crank angle of the [[piston]] before top dead centre.  For example, if the ECM/ECU initiates fuel injection when the piston is 10° before [[Top Dead Centre|TDC]], the start of injection, or timing, is said to be 10° [[BTDC]].  Optimal timing will depend on the engine design as well as its speed and load, and is usually 4° BTDC in 1,350–6,000 HP, net, "medium speed" locomotive, marine and stationary diesel engines.

Advancing the start of injection (injecting before the piston reaches to its SOI-TDC) results in higher in-cylinder pressure and temperature, and higher efficiency, but also results in increased engine noise due to faster cylinder pressure rise and increased [[oxides of nitrogen]] (NO<sub>x</sub>) formation due to higher combustion temperatures.  Delaying start of injection causes incomplete combustion, reduced fuel efficiency and an increase in exhaust smoke, containing a considerable amount of particulate matter and unburned [[hydrocarbon]]s.

===Major advantages===
<!-- Editors take note!!!  This is just a summary section.  Expanded discussions of most of these items appear later in the article.  These descriptions should not be expanded without a compelling reason, probably discussed on the talk page first.  If there's an advantage not listed here that you think is important, consider whether it is really one of the few major ones that should be listed here, or whether it belongs in the full discussion of advantages later in the article. -->

Diesel engines have several advantages over other internal combustion engines:
* They burn less fuel than a petrol engine performing the same work, due to the engine's higher temperature of combustion and greater expansion ratio.<ref name="bmmWW"/> Gasoline engines are typically 30% efficient while diesel engines can convert over 45% of the fuel energy into mechanical energy<ref>[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/pdfs/basics/jtb_diesel_engine.pdf "Diesel Engine."] Freedom CAR & Vehicle Technologies Program. U.S. Department of Energy, Aug. 2003. Web.</ref> (see [[Carnot cycle]] for further explanation).
* They have no high voltage electrical ignition system, resulting in high reliability and easy adaptation to damp environments.  The absence of coils, spark plug wires, etc., also eliminates a source of [[Electromagnetic interference|radio frequency emissions]] which can interfere with navigation and communication equipment, which is especially important in marine and aircraft applications, and for preventing interference with [[radio telescope]]s.
* The longevity of a diesel engine is generally about twice that of a petrol engine<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedieselpage.com/mileage.htm |title=When used under identical operating conditions, a diesel engine will likely produce at least twice the engine life of a gas engine |publisher=Thedieselpage.com |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1I5QR5 |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>{{Better source|date=June 2013}} due to the increased strength of parts used. Diesel fuel has better lubrication properties than petrol as well. Indeed, in [[unit injector]]s, the fuel is employed for three distinct purposes: injector lubrication, injector cooling and injection for combustion.
[[File:Soybeanbus.jpg|right|thumb|Bus powered by '''biodiesel''']]
* [[Diesel fuel]] is distilled directly from petroleum.  Distillation yields some gasoline, but the yield would be inadequate without [[catalytic reforming]], which is a more costly process.
* Diesel fuel is considered safer than petrol in many applications. Although diesel fuel will burn in open air using a [[candle wick|wick]], it will not explode and does not release a large amount of flammable vapor.  The low [[vapor pressure]] of diesel is especially advantageous in marine applications, where the accumulation of explosive fuel-air mixtures is a particular hazard.  For the same reason, diesel engines are immune to [[vapor lock]].
* For any given partial load the [[fuel efficiency]] (mass burned per energy produced) of a diesel engine remains nearly constant, as opposed to petrol and turbine engines which use proportionally more fuel with partial power outputs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centralmainediesel.com/order/H11000E5.asp?page=H11000E5 |title=Triple-Fuel Honda Powered 12&nbsp;kW Generator |publisher=Centralmainediesel.com |date= |accessdate=May 11, 2009|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1Ibdf7 |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselserviceandsupply.com/Diesel_Fuel_Consumption.aspx |title=Approximate Diesel Generator Fuel Consumption Chart |publisher=Dieselserviceandsupply.com |date= |accessdate=May 11, 2009|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1IxL6E |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smokstak.com/forum/showthread.php?t=44995 |title=15.0 jc fuel consumption—Onan Generators |publisher=Smokstak.com |date= |accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>Ransome-Wallis, Patrick (2001).

<!-- Don't add to this list without reading the comment at the top of the list! -->
* They generate less waste heat in cooling and exhaust.<ref name=bmmWW/><!--more kwh/lbs fuel, less waste heat; ref = elementary algebra: t= e+w, w= t-e/wdl1961-->
* Diesel engines can accept super- or turbo-charging pressure without any natural limit, constrained only by the strength of engine components. This is unlike petrol engines, which inevitably suffer detonation at higher pressure.
* The carbon monoxide content of the exhaust is minimal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.abe.iastate.edu/human_house/aen206.asp |title=CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING: Operating Fossil Fuel Engines Inside Buildings  |publisher=.abe.iastate.edu |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2010|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907224357/http://www3.abe.iastate.edu/human_house/aen206.asp |archivedate = September 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
* [[Biodiesel]] is an easily synthesized, non-petroleum-based fuel (through [[transesterification]]) which can run directly in many diesel engines, while gasoline engines either need adaptation to run [[synthetic fuel]]s or else use them as an additive to gasoline (e.g., [[ethanol]] added to [[gasohol]]).

===Mechanical and electronic injection===
Many configurations of fuel injection have been used over the course of the 20th century.

Most present-day diesel engines use a mechanical single plunger high-pressure [[fuel pump]] driven by the engine crankshaft. For each engine cylinder, the corresponding plunger in the fuel pump measures out the correct amount of fuel and determines the timing of each injection. These engines use [[fuel injection|injector]]s that are very precise spring-loaded valves that open and close at a specific fuel pressure. Separate high-pressure fuel lines connect the fuel pump with each cylinder. Fuel volume for each single combustion is controlled by a slanted [[Groove (engineering)|groove]] in the plunger which rotates only a few degrees releasing the pressure and is controlled by a mechanical governor, consisting of weights rotating at engine speed constrained by springs and a lever.  The injectors are held open by the fuel pressure. On high-speed engines the plunger pumps are together in one unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstdiesel.com |title=Diesel injection pumps, Diesel injectors, Diesel fuel pumps, turbochargers, Diesel trucks all at First Diesel Injection LTD |publisher=Firstdiesel.com |date= | accessdate =May 11, 2009|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1K4pRJ |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> The length of fuel lines from the pump to each injector is normally the same for each cylinder in order to obtain the same pressure delay.

A cheaper configuration on high-speed engines with fewer than six cylinders is to use an axial-piston distributor pump, consisting of one rotating pump plunger delivering fuel to a valve and line for each cylinder (functionally analogous to points and distributor cap on an [[Otto engine]]).<ref name=buckman/>

Many modern systems have a single fuel pump which supplies fuel constantly at high pressure with a [[common rail]] (single fuel line common) to each injector. Each injector has a [[solenoid]] operated by an electronic control unit, resulting in more accurate control of injector opening times that depend on other control conditions, such as engine speed and loading, and providing better engine performance and fuel economy.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Both mechanical and electronic injection systems can be used in either [[Direct fuel injection|direct]] or [[indirect injection]] configurations.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Two-stroke engine|Two-stroke]] diesel engines with mechanical injection pumps can be inadvertently run in reverse, albeit in a very inefficient manner, possibly damaging the engine.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
Large ship [[Two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] diesels are designed to run in either direction, obviating the need for a gearbox.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Indirect injection===
[[File:Diesel Indirect Injection Toyota motor.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Arrow indicates opening from pre-chamber]]
{{Main|Indirect injection}}
An indirect injection diesel engine delivers fuel into a chamber off the [[combustion chamber]], called a pre combustion chamber or ante-chamber, where combustion begins and then spreads into the main combustion chamber, assisted by [[turbulence]] created in the chamber. This system allows for a smoother, quieter running engine, and because combustion is assisted by turbulence, [[injector]] pressures can be lower, about {{convert|100|bar|MPa psi|abbr=on}},  using a single orifice tapered jet injector. Mechanical injection systems allowed high-speed running suitable for road vehicles (typically up to speeds of around {{val|fmt=commas|4000|ul=rpm}}). The pre-chamber had the disadvantage of increasing heat loss to the engine's cooling system, and restricting the combustion burn, which reduced the efficiency by 5–10%.<ref>Ashley, Steven. "Diesel cars come clean". ''Mechanical Engineering Magazine'', August 1997. "As combustion proceeds from the swirl or prechamber, you get throttle losses and heat losses, which are the major reasons for the lower efficiency compared to DI,"</ref>  Indirect injection engines are cheaper to build and it is easier to produce smooth, quiet-running vehicles with a simple mechanical system. In road-going vehicles most prefer the greater efficiency and better controlled emission levels of direct injection.  Indirect injection diesels can still be found in the many ATV diesel applications.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Direct injection===
[[Direct fuel injection|Direct injection]] diesel engines have injectors mounted at the top of the combustion chamber.  The injectors are activated using one of two methods - hydraulic pressure from the fuel pump, or an electronic signal from an engine controller.

Hydraulic pressure activated injectors can produce harsh engine noise. Fuel consumption is about 15–20% lower than indirect injection diesels. The extra noise is generally not a problem for industrial uses of the engine, but for automotive usage, buyers have to decide whether or not the increased fuel efficiency would compensate for the extra noise.

Electronic control of the fuel injection transformed the direct injection engine by allowing much greater control over the combustion.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Diesel Fuel Injection—How-It-Works|journal=Diesel Power|date=June 2007|url=http://www.dieselpowermag.com/tech/general/0706dp_diesel_fuel_injection/viewall.html|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}</ref>

===Unit direct injection===
{{Main|Unit Injector}}
Unit direct injection also injects fuel directly into the cylinder of the engine. In this system the injector and the pump are combined into one unit positioned over each cylinder controlled by the camshaft. Each cylinder has its own unit eliminating the high-pressure fuel lines, achieving a more consistent injection. This type of injection system, also developed by Bosch, is used by [[Volkswagen]] AG in cars (where it is called a ''[[Pumpe-Düse]]-System''—literally ''pump-nozzle system'') and by Mercedes-Benz ("PLD") and most major diesel engine manufacturers in large commercial engines ([[MAN SE]], [[Caterpillar Inc.|CAT]], [[Cummins]], [[Detroit Diesel]], [[Electro-Motive Diesel]], [[Volvo]]). With recent advancements, the pump pressure has been raised to {{convert|2400|bar|MPa psi}},<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>

===Common rail direct injection===
{{Main|Common rail}}

In common rail systems, the separate pulsing high-pressure fuel line to each cylinder's injector is also eliminated. Instead, a high-pressure pump pressurizes fuel at up to {{convert|2500|bar|MPa psi|abbr=on}},<ref>[http://www.audi.co.uk/audi/uk/en2/about_audi_ag/news/AUDI_REVEALS_WORLD_S_MOST_POWERFUL_DIESEL_PASSENGER_CAR.html Audi press release] {{wayback|url=http://www.audi.co.uk/audi/uk/en2/about_audi_ag/news/AUDI_REVEALS_WORLD_S_MOST_POWERFUL_DIESEL_PASSENGER_CAR.html |date=20121105211235 }}</ref> in a "common rail". The common rail is a tube that supplies each computer-controlled injector containing a precision-machined nozzle and a plunger driven by a [[solenoid]] or [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] actuator.

===Cold weather===

====Starting====
In cold weather, high speed diesel engines can be difficult to start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, preventing ignition due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio. Pre-chambered engines make use of small electric heaters inside the pre-chambers called [[glowplug]]s, while direct-injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
 
Many engines use resistive heaters in the [[intake manifold]] to warm the inlet air for starting, or until the engine reaches [[operating temperature]]. [[Engine block heater]]s (electric resistive heaters in the engine block) connected to the utility grid are used in cold climates when an engine is turned off for extended periods (more than an hour), to reduce startup time and engine wear. Block heaters are also used for emergency power [[Standby generator|standby Diesel-powered generators]] which must rapidly pick up load on a power failure. In the past, a wider variety of cold-start methods were used. Some engines, such as [[Detroit Diesel]]<ref>The Free Library [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DETROIT+DIESEL+INTRODUCES+DDEC+ETHER+START-a016648399] "DETROIT DIESEL INTRODUCES DDEC ETHER START" March 13, 1995, accessed March 14, 2011.</ref> engines used{{When|date=September 2010}} a system to introduce small amounts of [[ether]] into the inlet manifold to start combustion. Others used a mixed system, with a resistive heater burning [[methanol]]. An impromptu method, particularly on out-of-tune engines, is to manually spray an aerosol can of ether-based engine starter fluid into the intake air stream (usually through the intake air filter assembly).

====Gelling====
Diesel fuel is also prone to ''waxing'' or ''gelling'' in cold weather; both are terms for the solidification of diesel oil into a partially crystalline state. The crystals build up in the fuel line (especially in fuel filters), eventually starving the engine of fuel and causing it to stop running. Low-output electric heaters in [[fuel tank]]s and around fuel lines are used to solve this problem. Also, most engines have a ''spill return'' system, by which any excess fuel from the injector pump and injectors is returned to the fuel tank. Once the engine has warmed, returning warm fuel prevents waxing in the tank.

Due to improvements in fuel technology with additives, waxing rarely occurs in all but the coldest weather when a mix of diesel and [[kerosene]] may be used to run a vehicle. Gas stations in regions with a cold climate are required to offer [[winter diesel fuel|winterized diesel]] in the cold seasons that allow operation below a specific [[cold filter plugging point|Cold Filter Plugging Point]]. In Europe these diesel characteristics are described in the [[EN 590]] standard.

===Supercharging and turbocharging===
Most diesels are now [[turbocharging|turbocharged]] and some are both turbo charged and [[supercharged]]. Because diesels do not have fuel in the cylinder before combustion is initiated, more than one bar (100 kPa) of air can be loaded in the cylinder without preignition. A turbocharged engine can produce significantly more power than a naturally aspirated engine of the same configuration, as having more air in the cylinders allows more fuel to be burned and thus more power to be produced. A supercharger is powered mechanically by the engine's [[crankshaft]], while a turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust, not requiring any mechanical power. Turbocharging can improve the fuel economy<ref>Heywood Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals Figure 15–40 shows better, and much bigger, efficiency of turbo engine versus NA version</ref> of diesel engines by recovering waste heat from the exhaust, increasing the excess air factor, and increasing the ratio of engine output to friction losses.

{{anchor|Scavenge blower}}A [[two-stroke engine]] does not have a discrete exhaust and intake stroke and thus is incapable of self-aspiration. Therefore, all two-stroke engines must be fitted with a [[scavenge blower|blower]] to charge the cylinders with air and assist in dispersing exhaust gases, a process referred to as [[scavenging (automotive)|scavenging]]. In some cases, the engine may also be fitted with a turbocharger, whose output is directed into the blower inlet.

A few designs employ a hybrid turbocharger (a turbo-compressor system) for scavenging and charging the cylinders, which device is mechanically driven at cranking and low speeds to act as a blower, but which acts as a true turbocharger at higher speeds and loads. A hybrid turbocharger can revert to compressor mode during commands for large increases in engine output power.

As turbocharged or supercharged engines produce more power for a given engine size as compared to naturally aspirated engines, attention must be paid to the mechanical design of components, lubrication, and cooling to handle the power. Pistons are usually cooled with lubrication oil sprayed on the bottom of the piston. Large engines may use water, sea water, or oil supplied through [[telescoping (mechanics)|telescoping]] pipes attached to the crosshead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.machineryspaces.com/various-piston-cooling-methods.html |title=Piston cooling methods&nbsp;– Advantage and disadvantages of water cooled and oil cooled pistons |publisher=Machinery spaces |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}</ref>

===Early engines===
Rudolf Diesel based his engine on Nikolaus Otto's 1876 engine, with the goal of improving its efficiency. Diesel's engine concepts were set forth in patents in 1892 and 1893.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica, Diesel Engine</ref> As such, diesel engines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries used the same basic layout and form as industrial steam engines, with long-bore cylinders, external valve gear, cross-head bearings and an open crankshaft connected to a large [[flywheel]].{{Dubious|date=May 2011}} Smaller engines would be built with vertical cylinders, while most medium- and large-sized industrial engines were built with horizontal cylinders, just as steam engines had been. Engines could be built with more than one cylinder in both cases. The largest early diesels resembled the triple-expansion steam [[reciprocating engine]], being tens of feet high with vertical cylinders arranged in-line. These early engines ran at very slow speeds—partly due to the limitations of their air-blast injector equipment and partly so they would be compatible with the majority of industrial equipment designed for steam engines; maximum speeds of 100–300&nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] were common. Engines were usually started by allowing compressed air into the cylinders to turn the engine, although smaller engines could be started by hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Marine/othmarin.htm |title=Marine & other Hot-Bulb Oil Engines |publisher=Oldengine.org |date= |accessdate=May 11, 2009|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1KOfcL |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

In 1897, when the first Diesel engine was completed [[Adolphus Busch]] traveled to Cologne and negotiated exclusive right to produce the Diesel engine in the USA and Canada.  In his examination of the engine, it was noted that the Diesel at that time operated at thermodynamic efficiencies of 32–35%, while a typical triple expansion steam engine would operate at about 18%.<ref name="Busch" />

In the early decades of the 20th century, when large diesel engines were first being used, the engines took a form similar to the compound steam engines common at the time, with the piston being connected to the connecting rod by a [[crosshead bearing]]. Following steam engine practice some manufacturers made double-acting
two-stroke and four-stroke diesel engines to increase power output, with combustion taking place on both sides of the piston, with two sets of valve gear and fuel injection. While it produced large amounts of power and was very efficient, the double-acting diesel engine's main problem was producing a good seal where the piston rod passed through the bottom of the lower combustion chamber to the crosshead bearing, and no more were built. By the 1930s turbochargers were fitted to some engines. Crosshead bearings are still used to reduce the wear on the cylinders in large long-stroke main marine engines.

===Modern high and medium-speed engines===
[[File:Yanmar 2GM20.JPG|thumb|A [[Yanmar 2GM20]] marine diesel engine, installed in a [[sailboat]]]]
As with petrol engines, there are two classes of diesel engines in current use: two-stroke and four-stroke. The four-stroke type is the "classic" version, tracing its lineage back to Rudolf Diesel's [[prototype]]. It is also the most commonly used form, being the preferred power source for many motor vehicles, especially buses and trucks. Much larger engines, such as used for [[Diesel locomotive|railroad locomotion]] and [[marine propulsion]], are often two-stroke units, offering a more favourable [[power-to-weight ratio]], as well as better fuel economy. The most powerful engines in the world are two-stroke diesels of mammoth dimensions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/03/the-largest-and-most-powerful-diesel.html|title=The Largest And Most Powerful Diesel Engine in The World|publisher=Amusing Planet|date=March 21, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6OQow7Bex|archivedate=March 29, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>

[[Two-stroke diesel engine]] operation is similar to that of petrol counterparts, except that fuel is not mixed with air before induction, and the crankcase does not take an active role in the cycle. The traditional two-stroke design relies upon a mechanically driven [[Roots blower|positive displacement blower]] to charge the cylinders with air before compression and ignition. The charging process also assists in expelling (scavenging) [[combustion]] gases remaining from the previous power stroke.

The [[archetype]] of the modern form of the two-stroke diesel is the (high-speed) [[Detroit Diesel Series 71]] engine, designed by [[Charles F. Kettering|Charles F. "Boss" Kettering]] and his colleagues at [[General Motors|General Motors Corporation]] in 1938, in which the blower pressurizes a chamber in the engine block that is often referred to as the "air box". The (very much larger medium-speed) [[Electro-Motive Diesel]] engine<ref>Incredible as it may seem, the archetype high-speed two-stroke diesel engine had, in 1938, a per-cylinder displacement of 71 cubic inches, yet by 1985, less than fifty years later, the medium-speed diesel engine had a per cylinder displacement which was ''ten times'' as large ... 710 cubic inches per cylinder.</ref> is used as the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]] in EMD [[diesel-electric locomotive]], marine and stationary applications, and was designed by the same team, and is built to the same principle. However, a significant improvement built into most later EMD engines is the mechanically assisted turbo-compressor, which provides charge air using mechanical assistance during starting (thereby obviating the necessity for [[Roots supercharger|Roots-blown]] scavenging), and provides charge air using an exhaust gas-driven turbine during normal operations—thereby providing true turbocharging and additionally increasing the engine's power output by at least fifty percent.{{efn|In the 16-cylinder variant of EMD's 645F series, a Roots-blown engine could produce a maximum of {{convert|2000|hp}}. A turbocharged engine could produce up to {{convert|3500|hp}}—a 75% increase—although the engine was not particularly reliable at this rating; however a 50% increase to {{convert|3,000|hp}} proved to be exceptionally reliable and most such examples are still operating today, some forty years after these were built.}}
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-182-9.jpg|thumb|Three English Electric 7SRL diesel-alternator sets being installed at the Saateni Power Station, [[Zanzibar]] 1955]]
In a two-stroke diesel engine, as the cylinder's [[piston]] approaches the bottom dead centre exhaust ports or valves are opened relieving most of the excess pressure after which a passage between the air box and the cylinder is opened, permitting air flow into the cylinder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ccsshb/12cyl/ |title=The Most Powerful Diesel Engine in the World |publisher=Bath.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=April 3, 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1LF86x |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> The air flow blows the remaining combustion gases from the cylinder—this is the scavenging process. As the piston passes through bottom centre and starts upward, the passage is closed and compression commences,<ref>Charge air induction is necessarily symmetrical about bottom dead center; in the Electro-Motive Diesel examples, this is 45 degrees before bottom dead center to 45 degrees after bottom dead center; the only remaining variables are the timing of the opening and closing of the four poppet valves in the head, and these are timed to maximize both scavenging and compression.</ref> culminating in fuel injection and ignition.<ref>Electro-Motive Diesel, a medium-speed engine, initiates injection at 4 degrees before top dead center; a high-speed engine may initiate injection at another point in the cycle.</ref> Refer to [[Two-stroke#Two-stroke diesel engine|two-stroke diesel engines]] for more detailed coverage of aspiration types and supercharging of two-stroke diesel engines.

Normally, the number of cylinders are used in multiples of two, although any number of cylinders can be used as long as the load on the crankshaft is counterbalanced to prevent excessive [[oscillation|vibration]]. The inline-six-cylinder design is the most prolific in light- to medium-duty engines, though small V8 and larger inline-four displacement engines are also common. Small-capacity engines (generally considered to be those below five litres in capacity) are generally four- or six-cylinder types, with the four-cylinder being the most common type found in automotive uses. Five-cylinder diesel engines have also been produced, being a compromise between the smooth running of the six-cylinder and the space-efficient dimensions of the four-cylinder. Diesel engines for smaller plant machinery, boats, tractors, generators and pumps may be four, three or two-cylinder types, with the single-cylinder diesel engine remaining for light stationary work. Direct reversible two-stroke marine diesels need at least three cylinders for reliable restarting forwards and reverse, while four-stroke diesels need at least six cylinders.

The desire to improve the diesel engine's [[power-to-weight]] ratio produced several novel cylinder arrangements to extract more power from a given capacity. The uniflow [[opposed-piston engine]] uses two pistons in one cylinder with the combustion cavity in the middle and gas in- and outlets at the ends. This makes a comparatively light, powerful, swiftly running and economic engine suitable for use in aviation. An example is the [[Junkers Jumo 204|Junkers Jumo 204/205]]. The [[Napier Deltic]] engine, with three cylinders arranged in a triangular formation, each containing two opposed pistons, the whole engine having three crankshafts, is one of the better known.

===Modern low-speed engines===
Low-speed diesel engines (as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant) often have a thermal efficiency which exceeds 50%.<ref name="bmmWW "/><ref name="mhi"/>

===Gas generator===
{{Main|Free-piston engine}}
Before 1950, [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] started experimenting with two-stroke engines with boost pressures as high as 6 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], in which all the output power was taken from an exhaust [[gas turbine]]. The two-stroke pistons directly drove air compressor pistons to make a positive displacement gas generator. Opposed pistons were connected by linkages instead of crankshafts. Several of these units could be connected to provide power gas to one large output turbine. The overall thermal efficiency was roughly twice that of a simple gas turbine.<ref>''Modern High-Speed Oil Engines, Volume II'' by C. W. Chapman, published by The Caxton Publishing Co. Ltd. Reprinted in July 1949</ref> This system was derived from [[Raúl Pateras Pescara]]'s work on free-piston engines in the 1930s.

==Advantages and disadvantages versus spark-ignition engines==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2011}}

===Fuel economy===
The [[MAN B&W Diesel|MAN]] S80ME-C7 low speed diesel engines use {{convert|155|g}} of fuel per [[kWh]] for an overall energy conversion efficiency of 54.4%, which is the highest conversion of fuel into power by any single-cycle [[internal combustion|internal]] or [[external combustion]] engine<ref name=bmmWW/> (The efficiency of a [[combined cycle]] [[gas turbine]] system can exceed 60%.<ref>{{cite web |title= MHI Achieves 1,600°C Turbine Inlet Temperature in Test Operation of World's Highest Thermal Efficiency "J-Series" Gas Turbine |publisher= [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] |date= May 26, 2011 |url= http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/news/story/1105261435.html}}</ref>) Diesel engines are more efficient than gasoline (petrol) engines of the same power rating, resulting in lower fuel consumption. A common margin is 40% more [[miles per gallon]] for an efficient [[turbodiesel]]. For example, the current model [[Škoda Octavia]], using [[Volkswagen Group]] engines, has a combined Euro rating of {{convert|6.2|L/100km|abbr=on}} for the {{convert|102|bhp|abbr=on|adj=on|lk=in}} petrol engine and {{convert|4.4|L/100km|abbr=on}} for the {{convert|105|bhp|adj=on|abbr=on}} diesel engine.

However, such a comparison does not take into account that diesel fuel is denser and contains about 15% more energy by volume. Although the [[Heat of combustion|calorific value]] of the fuel is slightly lower at 45.3&nbsp;MJ/kg ([[joule|megajoules]] per kilogram) than petrol at 45.8&nbsp;MJ/kg, liquid diesel fuel is significantly denser than liquid petrol. This is significant because volume of fuel, in addition to mass, is an important consideration in mobile applications.

Adjusting the numbers to account for the energy density of diesel fuel, the overall energy efficiency is still about 20% greater for the diesel version.

While a higher compression ratio is helpful in raising efficiency, diesel engines are much more efficient than gasoline (petrol) engines when at low power and at engine idle. Unlike the petrol engine, diesels lack a butterfly valve (throttle) in the inlet system, which closes at idle. This creates parasitic loss and destruction of availability of the incoming air, reducing the efficiency of petrol engines at idle. In many applications, such as marine, agriculture, and railways, diesels are left idling and unattended for many hours, sometimes even days. These advantages are especially attractive in locomotives (see [[dieselisation]]).

Even though diesel engines have a theoretical fuel efficiency of 75%,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} in practice it is lower. Engines in large diesel trucks, buses, and newer diesel cars can achieve peak efficiencies around 45%,<ref>{{cite web

For example, it might be 37% for an engine with a peak efficiency of 44%.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Torque===
Diesel engines produce more torque than petrol engines for a given displacement due to their higher compression ratio. Higher pressure in the cylinder and higher forces on the connecting rods and crankshaft require stronger, heavier components. Heavier rotating components prevent diesel engines from reving as high as petrol engines for a given displacement. Diesel engines generally have similar power and inferior power to weight to petrol engines. Petrol engines must be geared lower to get the same torque as a comparable diesel but since petrol engines rev higher both will have similar acceleration. An arbitrary amount of torque at the wheels can be gained by gearing any power source down sufficiently (including a hand crank). For example, a theoretical engine with a constant 200&nbsp;ft/lbs of torque and a 3000 rpm rev limit has just as much [[Power (physics)|power]] (a little over 114&nbsp;hp) as another theoretical engine with a constant maximum 100&nbsp;ft/lbs of torque and a 6000 rpm rev limit. A (lossless) 2 to 1 reduction gear on the second engine will output a constant maximum 200&nbsp;ft/lbs of torque at a maximum of 3000 rpm, with no change in power. Comparing engines based on (maximum) torque is just as useful as comparing them based on (maximum) rpm.

===Power===
In diesel engines, conditions in the engine differ from the spark-ignition engine, since power is directly controlled by the fuel supply, rather than by controlling the air supply.

The average diesel engine has a poorer power-to-weight ratio than the [[petrol engine]]. This is because the diesel must operate at lower engine speeds<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.perkins.com/cda/components/fullArticleNoNav?ids=284124&languageId=7
| title = Engine Genetics
| year = 2006
| publisher = Perkins Engines Company Limited}}</ref> and because it needs heavier, stronger parts to resist the operating pressure caused by the high compression ratio of the engine and the large amounts of torque generated to the crankshaft. In addition, diesels are often built with stronger parts to give them longer lives and better reliability, important considerations in industrial applications.

Diesel engines usually have longer stroke lengths chiefly to facilitate achieving the necessary compression ratios, but also to reduce the optimal operating speed (rpm). As a result, piston and connecting rods are heavier and more force must be transmitted through the connecting rods and crankshaft to change the momentum of the piston. This is another reason that a diesel engine must be stronger for the same power output as a petrol engine.

Yet it is this characteristic that has allowed some enthusiasts to acquire significant power increases with [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engines by making fairly simple and inexpensive modifications. A petrol engine of similar size cannot put out a comparable power increase without extensive alterations because the stock components cannot withstand the higher stresses placed upon them. Since a diesel engine is already built to withstand higher levels of stress, it makes an ideal candidate for [[Engine tuning|performance tuning]] at little expense. However, it should be said that any modification that raises the amount of fuel and air put through a diesel engine will increase its operating temperature, which will reduce its life and increase service requirements. These are issues with newer, lighter, ''high-performance'' diesel engines which are not "overbuilt" to the degree of older engines and they are being pushed to provide greater power in smaller engines.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Forced induction===
The addition of a [[turbocharger]] or [[supercharger]] to the engine does not assist in increasing [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], but will increase power output in the same sized engine, mitigating the fuel-air intake speed limit mentioned above for a given engine displacement. Boost pressures can be higher on diesels than on petrol engines, due to the latter's susceptibility to knock, and the higher [[compression ratio]] allows a diesel engine to be more efficient than a comparable spark ignition engine. Because the burned gases are expanded further in a diesel engine cylinder, the exhaust gas is cooler,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} meaning turbochargers require less cooling, and can be more reliable, than with spark-ignition engines.

Without the risk of knocking, boost pressure in a diesel engine can be much higher; it is possible to run as much boost as the engine will physically stand before breaking apart.

A combination of improved mechanical technology (such as multi-stage injectors which fire a short "pilot charge" of fuel into the cylinder to warm the combustion chamber before delivering the main fuel charge), higher injection pressures that have improved the atomisation of fuel into smaller droplets, and electronic control (which can adjust the timing and length of the injection process to optimise it for all speeds and temperatures) have mitigated most of these problems in the latest generation of common-rail designs, while greatly improving engine efficiency. Poor power and narrow torque bands have been addressed by superchargers, turbochargers, (especially [[variable geometry turbocharger]]s), [[intercooler]]s, and a large efficiency increase from about 35% for IDI{{Abbr}} to 45% for the latest engines in the last 15 years.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Emissions===
{{main|Diesel exhaust}}
Since the diesel engine uses less fuel than the petrol engine per unit distance, the diesel produces less [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) per unit distance. Recent advances in production and changes in the political climate have increased the availability and awareness of [[biodiesel]], an alternative to petroleum-derived diesel fuel with a much lower net-sum emission of CO<sub>2</sub>, due to the absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> by plants used to produce the fuel. Although concerns are now being raised as to the negative effect this is having on the world food supply, as the growing of crops specifically for [[biofuel]]s takes up land that could be used for food crops and uses water that could be used by both humans and animals. However, the use of waste vegetable oil, sawmill waste from managed forests in Finland, and advances in the production of vegetable oil from algae demonstrate great promise in providing feed stocks for sustainable biodiesel that are not in competition with food production.

When a diesel engine runs at low power, there is enough oxygen present to burn the fuel—diesel engines only make significant amounts of [[carbon monoxide]] when running under a load.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Diesel fuel is injected just before the power stroke. As a result, the fuel cannot burn completely unless it has a sufficient amount of oxygen. This can result in incomplete combustion and black smoke in the exhaust if more fuel is injected than there is air available for the combustion process. Modern engines with electronic fuel delivery can adjust the timing and amount of fuel delivery (by changing the duration of the injection pulse), and so operate with less waste of fuel. In a mechanical system, the injection timing and duration must be set to be efficient at the anticipated operating rpm and load, and so the settings are less than ideal when the engine is running at any other RPM than what it is timed for. The electronic injection can "sense" engine revs, load, even boost and temperature, and continuously alter the timing to match the given situation. In the petrol engine, air and fuel are mixed for the entire compression stroke, ensuring complete mixing even at higher engine speeds.

Diesel exhaust is well known for its characteristic smell; but this smell in recent years has become much less because the [[sulfur]] is now removed from the fuel in the [[oil refinery]].

Diesel [[Exhaust gas#Diesel engines|exhaust]] has been found to contain a [[Diesel Exhaust Toxic Air Contaminants|long list of toxic air contaminants]]. Among these pollutants, [[Diesel particulate matter|fine particle pollution]] is an important as a cause of [[Diesel exhaust#Health effects|diesel's harmful health effects]]. However, when diesel engines burn their fuel with high oxygen levels, this results in high combustion temperatures and higher efficiency, and these particles tend to burn off and reduce, but the amount of {{NOx}} pollution tends to increase.

{{NOx}} pollution can be reduced with [[diesel exhaust fluid]], which is injected into the exhaust stream, and catalytically destroys the {{NOx}} chemical species. [[Exhaust gas recirculation]] which works by recirculating a portion of an engine's exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders also has very positive effects on {{NOx}} emissions.

===Noise===
The distinctive noise of a diesel engine is variably called diesel clatter, diesel nailing, or diesel knock.<ref name="Comb in IC">{{Cite journal

A combination of improved mechanical technology such as multi-stage injectors which fire a short "pilot charge" of fuel into the cylinder to initiate combustion before delivering the main fuel charge, higher injection pressures that have improved the atomisation of fuel into smaller droplets, and electronic control (which can adjust the timing and length of the injection process to optimise it for all speeds and temperatures), have partially mitigated these problems in the latest generation of common-rail designs, while improving engine efficiency.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Reliability===
For most industrial or nautical applications, reliability is considered more important than light weight and high power.

The lack of an electrical [[ignition system]] greatly improves the reliability. The high durability of a diesel engine is also due to its overbuilt nature (see above), a benefit that is magnified by the lower rotating speeds in diesels. Diesel fuel is a better lubricant than petrol and thus, it is less harmful to the oil film on [[piston ring]]s and [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] bores; it is routine for diesel engines to cover {{convert|400000|km|abbr=on}} or more without a rebuild.

Due to the greater compression ratio and the increased weight of the stronger components, starting a diesel engine is harder than starting a gasoline engine of similar design and displacement. More [[torque]] from the starter motor is required to push the engine through the compression cycle when starting compared to a petrol engine. This can cause difficulty when starting in winter time if using conventional automotive batteries because of the lower current available.

Either an electrical [[Automobile self starter|starter]] or an [[air-start system]] is used to start the engine turning. On large engines, pre-[[lubrication]] and slow turning of an engine, as well as heating, are required to minimise the amount of engine damage during initial start-up and running. Some smaller military diesels can be started with an explosive cartridge, called a [[Coffman engine starter|Coffman starter]], which provides the extra power required to get the machine turning. In the past, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] and [[Deere & Company|John Deere]] used a small petrol ''pony'' engine in their tractors to start the primary diesel engine. The pony engine heated the diesel to aid in ignition and used a small clutch and transmission to spin up the diesel engine. Even more unusual was an [[International Harvester]] design in which the diesel engine had its own carburetor and ignition system, and started on petrol. Once warmed up, the operator moved two levers to switch the engine to diesel operation, and work could begin. These engines had very complex cylinder heads, with their own petrol combustion chambers, and were vulnerable to expensive damage if special care was not taken (especially in letting the engine cool before turning it off).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Cylinder cavitation and erosion damage===
One phenomenon that can affect water-cooled diesel engines is cylinder cavitation and erosion.  This is due to a phenomenon in high-compression engines where the ignition of the fuel in the cylinder causes a high-frequency vibration that causes bubbles to form in the coolant in contact with the cylinder.  When these tiny bubbles collapse, coolant impacts the cylinder wall, over time causing small holes to form in the cylinder wall.<ref>{{cite web
| title = Investigation Of Cavitation Erosion In Diesel Engine Coolant Systems At The U. S. Naval Engineering Experiment Station
| accessdate = July 28, 2015
| url = http://papers.sae.org/560240/
}}</ref> This damage is mitigated in some engines with coatings, or with a coolant additive specifically designed to prevent cavitation and erosion damage.  Engines damaged in this way will require the affected cylinder to be repaired (where possible) or will be rendered unusable.

===Quality and variety of fuels===
Petrol/gasoline engines are limited in the variety and quality of the fuels they can burn. Older petrol engines fitted with a [[carburetor]] required a volatile fuel that would vaporise easily to create the necessary [[air-fuel ratio]] for combustion. Because both air and fuel are admitted to the cylinder, if the [[compression ratio]] of the engine is too high or the fuel too volatile (with too low an [[octane]] rating), the fuel will ignite under compression, as in a diesel engine, before the piston reaches the top of its stroke. This pre-ignition causes a power loss and over time major damage to the piston and cylinder. The need for a fuel that is volatile enough to vaporise but not too volatile (to avoid pre-ignition) means that petrol engines will only run on a narrow range of fuels. There has been some success at dual-fuel engines that use petrol and [[ethanol]], petrol and [[propane]], and petrol and [[methane]].

In diesel engines, a mechanical injector system vaporizes the fuel directly into the combustion chamber or a pre-combustion chamber (as opposed to a [[Aspirator (pump)|Venturi jet]] in a carburetor, or a [[Fuel injection|fuel injector]] in a fuel injection system vaporising fuel into the intake manifold or intake runners as in a petrol engine). This ''forced vaporisation'' means that less-volatile fuels can be used. More crucially, because only air is inducted into the cylinder in a diesel engine, the compression ratio can be much higher as there is no risk of pre-ignition provided the injection process is accurately timed. This means that cylinder temperatures are much higher in a diesel engine than a petrol engine, allowing less volatile fuels to be used.

Diesel fuel is a form of light fuel oil, very similar to [[kerosene]] (paraffin), but diesel engines, especially older or simple designs that lack precision electronic injection systems, can run on a wide variety of other fuels. Some of the most common alternatives are Jet A-1 type [[jet fuel]] or [[vegetable oil]] from a very wide variety of plants. Some engines can be run on vegetable oil without modification, and most others require fairly basic alterations. [[Biodiesel]] is a pure diesel-like fuel refined from vegetable oil and can be used in nearly all diesel engines. Requirements for fuels to be used in diesel engines are the ability of the fuel to flow along the fuel lines, the ability of the fuel to lubricate the injector pump and injectors adequately, and its ignition qualities (ignition delay, [[cetane number]]). Inline mechanical injector pumps generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps. Also, indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on bio-fuels than direct injection engines. This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater 'swirl' effect, improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel, and because (in the case of vegetable oil-type fuels) [[lipid]] depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low (such as starting the engine from cold).

It is often reported that Diesel designed his engine to run on [[peanut oil]], but this is false. Patent number 608845 describes his engine as being designed to run on pulverulent solid fuel ([[coal dust]]). Diesel stated in his published papers, "at the Paris Exhibition in 1900 (''[[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]'') there was shown by the Otto Company a small diesel engine, which, at the request of the French Government ran on [[Arachis|Arachide]] (earth-nut or peanut) oil (see [[biodiesel]]), and worked so smoothly that only a few people were aware of it.  The engine was constructed for using [[mineral oil]], and was then worked on vegetable oil without any alterations being made.  The French Government at the time thought of testing the applicability to power production of the Arachide, or earth-nut, which grows in considerable quantities in their African colonies, and can easily be cultivated there." Diesel himself later conducted related tests and appeared supportive of the idea.<ref>The Biodiesel Handbook, Chapter 2—The History of Vegetable Oil Based Diesel Fuels, by Gerhard Knothe, ISBN 978-1-893997-79-0</ref>

Most large marine diesels run on heavy [[fuel oil]] (sometimes called "bunker oil"), which is a thick, viscous and almost flameproof fuel which is very safe to store and cheap to buy in bulk as it is a waste product from the petroleum refining industry. The fuel must not only be pre-heated, but must be kept heated during handling and storage in order to maintain its pumpability. This is usually accomplished by steam tracing on fuel lines and steam coils in fuel oil tanks. The fuel is then preheated to over 100C before entering the engine in order to attain the proper viscosity for atomisation.

==Fuel and fluid characteristics==
{{Main|Diesel fuel}}
Diesel engines can operate on a variety of different fuels, depending on configuration, though the eponymous [[diesel fuel]] derived from [[crude oil]] is most common. The engines can work with the full spectrum of crude oil distillates, from natural gas, alcohols, petrol, [[wood gas]] to the ''fuel oils'' from diesel oil to residual fuels. Many automotive diesel engines would run on 100% biodiesel without any modifications. This would be such a potential advantage since biodiesel can be made so much more cheaply than it takes to have traditional diesel fuel from a fuel station's pump.<ref name="DFE LNG">{{cite web| url=http://www.thedigitalship.com/powerpoints/SMM06/lng/Barend%20Thijssen,%20wartsila.pdf | title=Dual-fuel-electric LNG carriers|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1LOLWS |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The type of fuel used is selected to meet a combination of service requirements, and fuel costs. Good-quality diesel fuel can be synthesised from [[vegetable oil]] and alcohol. Diesel fuel can be made from coal or other carbon base using the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]]. [[Biodiesel]] is growing in popularity since it can frequently be used in unmodified engines, though production remains limited. Recently, biodiesel from coconut, which can produce a very promising coco methyl ester (CME), has characteristics which enhance lubricity and combustion giving a regular diesel engine without any modification more power, less particulate matter or black smoke, and smoother engine performance. The Philippines pioneers in the research on Coconut based CME with the help of German and American scientists. Petroleum-derived diesel is often called ''petrodiesel'' if there is need to distinguish the source of the fuel.

[[Vegetable oil used as fuel|Pure plant oils]] are increasingly being used as a fuel for cars, trucks and remote [[combined heat and power]] generation especially in Germany where hundreds of decentralised small- and medium-sized oil presses cold press oilseed, mainly [[rapeseed]], for fuel. There is a [[Deutsches Institut für Normung]] fuel standard for rapeseed oil fuel.

''Residual fuels'' are the "dregs" of the distillation process and are a thicker, heavier oil, or oil with higher [[viscosity]], which are so thick that they are not readily pumpable unless heated. Residual fuel oils are cheaper than clean, refined diesel oil, although they are dirtier. Their main considerations are for use in ships and very large generation sets, due to the cost of the large volume of fuel consumed, frequently amounting to many tonnes per hour. The poorly refined [[biofuel]]s [[straight vegetable oil]] (SVO) and [[waste vegetable oil]] (WVO) can fall into this category, but can be viable fuels on non-common rail or TDI PD diesels with the simple conversion of fuel heating to 80 to 100 degrees Celsius to reduce viscosity, and adequate filtration to OEM standards. Engines using these heavy oils have to start and shut down on standard diesel fuel, as these fuels will not flow through fuel lines at low temperatures. Moving beyond that, use of low-grade fuels can lead to serious maintenance problems because of their high sulphur and lower lubrication properties. Most diesel engines that power ships like supertankers are built so that the engine can safely use low-grade fuels due to their separate cylinder and crankcase lubrication.

Normal diesel fuel is more difficult to ignite and slower in developing fire than petrol because of its higher [[flash point]], but once burning, a diesel fire can be fierce.

Fuel contaminants such as dirt and water are often more problematic in diesel engines than in petrol engines. Water can cause serious damage, due to corrosion, to the injection pump and injectors; and dirt, even very fine particulate matter, can damage the injection pumps due to the close tolerances that the pumps are machined to. All diesel engines will have a fuel filter (usually much finer than a filter on a petrol engine), and a water trap. The water trap (which is sometimes part of the fuel filter) often has a float connected to a warning light, which warns when there is too much water in the trap, and must be drained before damage to the engine can result. The fuel filter must be replaced much more often on a diesel engine than on a petrol engine, changing the fuel filter every 2–4 oil changes is not uncommon for some vehicles.

==Safety==

===Fuel flammability===
Diesel fuel has low [[flammability]], leading to a low risk of fire caused by fuel in a vehicle equipped with a diesel engine.

In [[yacht]]s, diesel engines are often used because the petrol (gasoline) that fuels spark-ignition engines releases combustible vapors which can lead to an explosion if it accumulates in a confined space such as the bottom of a vessel. Ventilation systems are mandatory on petrol-powered vessels.<ref>[[Yacht Safety Bureau]] The Yacht Safety Bureau, Inc.in the State of New York</ref>

The [[United States Army]] and [[NATO]] use only diesel engines and turbines because of fire hazard. Although neither gasoline nor diesel is explosive in liquid form, both can create an explosive air/vapor mix under the right conditions. However, diesel fuel is less prone due to its lower [[vapor pressure]], which is an indication of evaporation rate. The Material Safety Data Sheet<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petrocard.com/Products/MSDS-ULS.pdf |title=Microsoft Word—MSDS Low Sulfur Diesel #2.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref> for ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel indicates a vapor explosion hazard for diesel indoors, outdoors, or in sewers.

US Army gasoline-engined tanks during [[World War II]] were nicknamed [[Ronson's Lighters|Ronsons]], because of their greater likelihood of catching fire when damaged by enemy fire. (Although tank fires were usually caused by detonation of the ammunition rather than fuel), while diesel tanks such as the Soviet [[T-34]] were less prone to catching fire.

===Maintenance hazards===
Fuel injection introduces potential hazards in engine maintenance due to the high fuel pressures used. Residual pressure can remain in the fuel lines long after an injection-equipped engine has been shut down. This residual pressure must be relieved, and if it is done so by external bleed-off, the fuel must be safely contained. If a high-pressure diesel fuel injector is removed from its seat and operated in open air, there is a risk to the operator of injury by [[Jet injector#Accidental jet injection|hypodermic jet-injection]], even with only {{convert|100|psi}} pressure.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Cancer===
[[Diesel exhaust]] has been classified as an [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|IARC Group 1 carcinogen]]. It causes [[lung cancer]] and is associated with an increased risk for [[bladder cancer]].<ref name=PRDEE>{{cite web|title=IARC: DIESEL ENGINE EXHAUST CARCINOGENIC|url=http://press.iarc.fr/pr213_E.pdf|publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)|accessdate=June 12, 2012|format=Press release|quote=June 12, 2012 – After a week-long meeting of international experts, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the World Health Organization (WHO), today classified diesel engine exhaust as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), based on sufficient evidence that exposure is associated with an increased risk for bladder cancer}}</ref>

==Applications==
The characteristics of diesel have different advantages for different applications.

===Passenger cars===
Diesel engines have long been popular in bigger cars and have been used in smaller cars such as [[supermini]]s like the [[Peugeot 205]], in Europe since the 1980s. Diesel engines tend to be more economical at regular driving speeds and are much better at city speeds. Their reliability and life-span tend to be better (as detailed). Some 40% or more of all cars sold in Europe are diesel-powered where they are considered a low CO<sub>2</sub> option. [[Mercedes-Benz]] in conjunction with [[Robert Bosch GmbH]] produced diesel-powered passenger cars starting in 1936 and very large numbers are used all over the world (often as "Grande Taxis" in the [[Third World]]). Diesel-powered passenger cars are very popular in [[India]] too, since the price of diesel fuel there is lower as compared to petrol. As a result, predominantly petrol-powered car manufacturers including the [[List of automobile manufacturers of Japan|Japanese car manufacturers]] produce and market diesel-powered cars in India. Diesel-powered cars also dominate the Indian taxi industry.

===Railroad rolling stock===
Diesel engines have eclipsed [[steam engine]]s as the prime mover on all non-electrified railroads in the industrialized world. The first [[diesel locomotive]]s appeared in the early 20th century, and [[diesel multiple units]] soon after.  While [[electric locomotive]]s have replaced the [[diesel locomotive]] for some passenger traffic in Europe and Asia, diesel is still today very popular for cargo-hauling [[freight train]]s and on tracks where electrification is not feasible.  Most modern diesel locomotives are actually [[diesel-electric locomotive]]s: the diesel engine is used to power an electric generator that in turn powers electric traction motors with no mechanical connection between diesel engine and traction.  After 2000, environmental requirements has caused higher development cost for engines, and it has become common for passenger [[multiple unit]]s to use engines and automatic mechanical gearboxes made for trucks. Up to four such combinations might be used to get enough power in a train.

===Other transport uses===
Larger transport applications ([[truck]]s, [[bus]]es, etc.) also benefit from the Diesel's reliability and high torque output. Diesel displaced paraffin (or [[tractor vaporising oil]], TVO) in most parts of the world by the end of the 1950s with the U.S. following some 20 years later.
* [[Aircraft Diesel engine|Aircraft]]
* [[Marine diesel engine#Reciprocating diesel engines|Marine]]
* [[Diesel motorcycle|Motorcycles]]

In merchant ships and boats, the same advantages apply with the relative safety of Diesel fuel an additional benefit. The German [[pocket battleship]]s were the largest Diesel warships, but the German torpedo-boats known as [[E-boat]]s (''Schnellboot'') of the Second World War were also Diesel craft. Conventional [[submarine]]s have used them since before World War I, relying on the almost total absence of carbon monoxide in the exhaust. American World War II Diesel-electric submarines operated on two-stroke cycle, as opposed to the four-stroke cycle that other navies used.

===Non-road diesel engines===
[[Non-road diesel engine]]s include mobile equipment and vehicles that are not used on the public roadways such as [[construction equipment]] and agricultural [[tractor]]s.

===Military fuel standardisation===
[[NATO]] has a single vehicle fuel policy and has selected diesel for this purpose. The use of a single fuel simplifies wartime logistics. NATO and the United States Marine Corps have even been developing a diesel military motorcycle based on a [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] off road motorcycle the KLR 650, with a purpose designed naturally aspirated direct injection diesel at [[Cranfield University]] in England, to be produced in the USA, because motorcycles were the last remaining gasoline-powered vehicle in their inventory. Before this, a few civilian [[motorcycle]]s had been built using adapted stationary diesel engines, but the weight and cost disadvantages generally outweighed the efficiency gains.

===Non-transport uses===

Diesel engines are also used to power [[Diesel generator|permanent]], portable, and backup [[Engine-generator|generators]], irrigation pumps,<ref>{{cite web

==Engine speeds==
Within the diesel engine industry, engines are often categorized by their rotational speeds into three unofficial groups:
* High-speed engines (> 1,000 rpm),
* Medium-speed engines (300–1,000 rpm), and
* Slow-speed engines (< 300 rpm).

High- and medium-speed engines are predominantly four-stroke engines; except for the [[Detroit Diesel]] two-stroke range. Medium-speed engines are physically larger than high-speed engines and can burn lower-grade (slower-burning) fuel than high-speed engines. Slow-speed engines are predominantly large two-stroke crosshead engines, hence very different from high- and medium-speed engines. Due to the lower rotational speed of slow- and medium-speed engines, there is more time for combustion during the power stroke of the cycle, allowing the use of slower-burning fuels than high-speed engines.

===High-speed engines===
High-speed (approximately 1,000&nbsp;rpm and greater) engines are used to power [[truck]]s (lorries), [[bus]]es, [[tractor]]s, [[automobile|cars]], [[yacht]]s, [[Gas compressor|compressors]], [[pump]]s and small [[electrical generator]]s.  As of 2008, most high-speed engines have [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Many modern engines, particularly in on-highway applications, have [[common rail]] [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]], which is cleaner burning.

===Medium-speed engines===
Medium-speed engines are used in large electrical generators, ship propulsion and mechanical drive applications such as large compressors or pumps.  Medium speed diesel engines operate on either diesel fuel or heavy fuel oil by direct injection in the same manner as low-speed engines.

Engines used in electrical generators run at approximately 300 to 1000&nbsp;rpm and are optimized to run at a set [[synchronous speed]] depending on the generation frequency (50 or 60&nbsp;[[hertz]]) and provide a rapid response to load changes. Typical synchronous speeds for modern medium-speed engines are 500/514&nbsp;rpm (50/60&nbsp;Hz), 600&nbsp;rpm (both 50 and 60&nbsp;Hz), 720/750&nbsp;rpm, and 900/1000&nbsp;rpm.

As of 2009, the largest medium-speed engines in current production have outputs up to approximately {{convert|20|MW|hp|abbr=on}} and are supplied by companies like [[MAN B&W]], [[Wärtsilä]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wartsila.com/ss/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheadername1=Content-Type&blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&blobheadername3=site&blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&blobheadervalue2=attachment%3B+filename%3DWartsila-O-E-W-64-TR.pdf&blobheadervalue3=Wartsila&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1278589866158&ssbinary=true |title=Wärtsilä 64 Technology Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}</ref> and [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] (who acquired Ulstein Bergen Diesel in 1999). Most medium-speed engines produced are four-stroke machines, however there are some two-stroke medium-speed engines such as by EMD ([[Electro-Motive Diesel]]), and the Fairbanks Morse OP ([[Opposed-piston engine]]) type.

Typical cylinder bore size for medium-speed engines ranges from 20&nbsp;cm to 50&nbsp;cm, and engine configurations typically are offered ranging from in-line 4-cylinder units to V-configuration 20-cylinder units.  Most larger medium-speed engines are started with compressed air direct on pistons, using an air distributor, as opposed to a pneumatic starting motor acting on the flywheel, which tends to be used for smaller engines. There is no definitive engine size cut-off point for this.

It should also be noted that most major manufacturers of medium-speed engines make [[natural gas]]-fueled versions of their diesel engines, which in fact operate on the [[Otto cycle]], and require spark ignition, typically provided with a spark plug.<ref name="DFE LNG" />  There are also dual (diesel/natural gas/coal gas) fuel versions of medium and low speed diesel engines using a lean fuel air mixture and a small injection of diesel fuel (so-called "pilot fuel") for ignition. In case of a gas supply failure or maximum power demand these engines will instantly switch back to full diesel fuel operation.<!--! read refs pls !!!! wdl1961--><ref name="DFE LNG" /><ref>{{Cite book| title=User's Guide to Natural Gas Technologies | author=Payne, F.

===Low-speed engines===
[[File:5S50MC.jpg|thumb|right|The MAN B&W 5S50MC 5-cylinder, 2-stroke, low-speed marine diesel engine. This particular engine is found aboard a 29,000 tonne chemical carrier.]]
Also known as ''slow-speed'', or traditionally ''oil engines'', the largest diesel engines are primarily used to power [[ship]]s, although there are a few land-based power generation units as well. These extremely large two-stroke engines have power outputs up to approximately {{convert|85|MW|hp|abbr=on}}, operate in the range from approximately 60 to 200&nbsp;rpm and are up to {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on|-1}} tall, and can weigh over {{convert|2000|ST|t}}. They typically use direct injection running on cheap low-grade heavy fuel, also known as [[Fuel oil#Bunker fuel|bunker C]] fuel, which requires heating in the ship for tanking and before injection due to the fuel's high [[viscosity]]. Often, the waste heat recovery steam boilers attached to the engine exhaust ducting generate the heat required for fuel heating. Provided the heavy fuel system is kept warm and circulating, engines can be started and stopped on heavy fuel.

Large and medium marine engines are started with compressed air directly applied to the pistons. Air is applied to cylinders to start the engine forwards or backwards because they are normally directly connected to the [[propeller]] without clutch or gearbox, and to provide reverse propulsion either the engine must be run backwards or the ship will use an adjustable propeller. At least three cylinders are required with [[two-stroke]] engines and at least six cylinders with [[four-stroke]] engines to provide [[torque]] every 120 degrees.

Companies such as [[MAN B&W Diesel]], (formerly [[Burmeister & Wain]]) and [[Wärtsilä]] (which acquired [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] Diesel) design such large low-speed engines. They are unusually narrow and tall due to the addition of a [[crosshead bearing]]. As of 2007, the [[Straight-14|14-cylinder]] [[Wärtsilä-Sulzer 14RTFLEX96-C]] turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine built by [[Wärtsilä]] licensee [[Doosan Group|Doosan]] in Korea is the most powerful diesel engine put into service, with a cylinder bore of {{convert|960|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} delivering {{convert|114800|hp|MW||abbr=on}}. It was put into service in September 2006, aboard the world's largest container ship ''[[Emma Maersk]]'' which belongs to the [[A.P. Moller-Maersk Group]]. Typical bore size for low-speed engines ranges from approximately {{convert|35|to|98|cm|in|abbr=on}}. As of 2008, all produced low-speed engines with [[crosshead bearing]]s are in-line configurations; no Vee versions have been produced.

==Current and future developments==
{{See also|Diesel car history}}

As of 2008, many [[common rail]] and unit injection systems already employ new injectors using stacked [[piezoelectric]] wafers in lieu of a solenoid, giving finer control of the injection event.<ref>{{cite web

[[Variable geometry turbocharger]]s have flexible vanes, which move and let more air into the engine depending on load. This technology increases both performance and fuel economy. Boost lag is reduced as turbo impeller inertia is compensated for.<ref>{{cite web|title=Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT)|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/environment/etv/vgt-eng.htm|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1PcLa3 |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Accelerometer pilot control (APC) uses an [[accelerometer]] to provide feedback on the engine's level of noise and vibration and thus instruct the ECU to inject the minimum amount of fuel that will produce quiet combustion and still provide the required power (especially while idling).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.analog.com/en/technical-library/faqs/design-center/faqs/CU_faq_MEMs/resources/fca.html |title=Accelerometer Design and Applications |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100107145120/http://www.analog.com:80/en/technical-library/faqs/design-center/faqs/CU_faq_MEMs/resources/fca.html |archivedate=7 January 2010 }}</ref>

The next generation of common rail diesels is expected to use variable injection geometry, which allows the amount of fuel injected to be varied over a wider range, and variable valve timing (see Mitsubishi's [[Mitsubishi 4N1 engine|4N13]] diesel engine) similar to that of [[petrol engine]]s. Particularly in the United States, coming tougher emissions regulations present a considerable challenge to diesel engine manufacturers. Ford's [[HyTrans Project]] has developed a system which starts the ignition in 400 ms, saving a significant amount of fuel on city routes, and there are other methods to achieve even more efficient combustion, such as [[HCCI|homogeneous charge compression ignition]], being studied.<ref>Craig Goodfellow; cited in {{cite video

Some recent diesel engine models utilize a [[Copper in heat exchangers|copper alloy heat exchanger]] technology ([[CuproBraze]]) to take advantage of benefits in terms of thermal performance, heat transfer efficiency, strength/durability, corrosion resistance, and reduced emissions from higher operating temperatures.

===Low heat rejection engines===
A special class of experimental prototype internal combustion piston engines has been developed over several decades with the goal of improving efficiency by reducing heat loss.<ref>http://topics.sae.org/adiabatic-engines/papers/</ref> These engines are variously called adiabatic engines; due to better approximation of adiabatic expansion; low heat rejection engines, or high temperature engines.<ref>http://papers.sae.org/930988/</ref> They are generally piston engines with combustion chamber parts lined with ceramic thermal barrier coatings.<ref>http://papers.sae.org/931021/</ref> Some make used of  pistons and other  parts made of titanium which has a low thermal conductivity<ref>http://papers.sae.org/930985/</ref> and density. Some designs are able to eliminate the use of a cooling system and associated parasitic losses altogether.<ref>http://papers.sae.org/930984/</ref> Developing lubricants able to withstand the higher temperatures involved has been a major barrier to commercialization.<ref>http://papers.sae.org/950979/</ref>
