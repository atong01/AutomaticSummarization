A small efficiency loss is also avoided compared to two-stroke non-direct-injection gasoline engines since unburnt fuel is not present at valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly from the intake/injection to the exhaust. Low-speed diesel engines (as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant) can have a thermal efficiency that exceeds 50%.<extension extension_name='ref' name="bmmWW "><link type='external' href='http://mandieselturbo.com/files/news/filesof16119/tech_paper_low_speed.pdf'>Low Speed Engines Tech Paper</link>, MAN Diesel</extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="mhi"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.mhi.co.jp/technology/review/pdf/e451/e451021.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="title">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Technical Review Vol.45 No.1 (2008)<space/></arg><arg name="format">PDF<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">October 3, 2010</arg><arg name="archiveurl"><space/>http://www.webcitation.org/5tDljlTm4<space/></arg><arg name="archivedate"><space/>October 4, 2010</arg><arg name="deadurl">no</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Diesel engines are manufactured in<space/><link><target>two-stroke</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>four-stroke</target></link><space/>versions.

At about the top of the compression stroke, fuel is injected directly into the compressed air in the combustion chamber. This may be into a (typically<space/><link><target>toroid</target><trail>al</trail></link>) void in the top of the piston or a<space/><italics>pre-chamber</italics><space/>depending upon the design of the engine. The fuel injector ensures that the fuel is broken down into small droplets, and that the fuel is distributed evenly. The heat of the compressed air vaporizes fuel from the surface of the droplets. The vapour is then ignited by the heat from the compressed air in the combustion chamber, the droplets continue to vaporise from their surfaces and burn, getting smaller, until all the fuel in the droplets has been burnt. Combustion occurs at a substantially constant pressure during the initial part of the power stroke. The start of vaporisation causes a delay before ignition and the characteristic diesel knocking sound as the vapour reaches ignition temperature and causes an abrupt increase in pressure above the piston (not shown on the P-V indicator diagram). When combustion is complete the combustion gases expand as the piston descends further; the high pressure in the cylinder drives the piston downward, supplying power to the crankshaft.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>Combined gas law</target></link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>As well as the high level of compression allowing combustion to take place without a separate ignition system, a high<space/><link><target>compression ratio</target></link><space/>greatly increases the engine's efficiency. Increasing the compression ratio in a spark-ignition engine where fuel and air are mixed before entry to the cylinder is limited by the need to prevent damaging<space/><link><target>pre-ignition#Pre-ignition</target><part>pre-ignition</part></link>. Since only air is compressed in a diesel engine, and fuel is not introduced into the cylinder until shortly before top dead centre (<link><target>Top Dead Center</target><part>TDC</part></link>), premature detonation is not a problem and compression ratios are much higher.</paragraph><paragraph>The pV diagam is a simplified and idealised representation of the events involved in a Diesel engine cycle, arranged to illustrate the similarity with a<space/><link><target>Carnot cycle</target></link>. Starting at 1, the piston is at bottom dead centre and both valves are closed at the start of the compression stroke; the cylinder contains air at atmospheric pressure. Between 1 and 2 the air is compressed adiabaticallythat is without heat transfer to or from the environmentby the rising piston. (This is only approximately true since there will be some heat exchange with the cylinder walls.) During this compression, the volume is reduced, the pressure and temperature both rise. At or slightly before 2 (TDC) fuel is injected and burns in the compressed hot air. Chemical energy is released and this constitutes an injection of thermal energy (heat) into the compressed gas. Combustion and heating occur between 2 and 3. In this interval the pressure remains constant since the piston descends, and the volume increases; the temperature rises as a consequence of the energy of combustion. At 3 fuel injection and combustion are complete, and the cylinder contains gas at a higher temperature than at 2. Between 3 and 4 this hot gas expands, again approximately adiabatically. Work is done on the system to which the engine is connected. During this expansion phase the volume of the gas rises, and its temperature and pressure both fall. At 4 the exhaust valve opens, and the pressure falls abruptly to atmospheric (approximately). This is unresisted expansion and no useful work is done by it. Ideally the adiabatic expansion should continue, extending the line 34 to the right until the pressure falls to that of the surrounding air, but the loss of efficiency caused by this unresisted expansion is justified by the practical difficulties involved in recovering it (the engine would have to be much larger). After the opening of the exhaust valve, the exhaust stroke follows, but this (and the following induction stroke) are not shown on the diagram. If shown, they would be represented by a low-pressure loop at the bottom of the diagram. At 1 it is assumed that the exhaust and induction strokes have been completed, and the cylinder is again filled with air. The piston-cylinder system absorbs energy between 1 and 2this is the work needed to compress the air in the cylinder, and is provided by mechanical kinetic energy stored in the flywheel of the engine. Work output is done by the piston-cylinder combination between 2 and 4. The difference between these two increments of work is the indicated work output per cycle, and is represented by the area enclosed by the pV loop. The adiabatic expansion is in a higher pressure range than that of the compression because the gas in the cylinder is hotter during expansion than during compression. It is for this reason that the loop has a finite area, and the net output of work during a cycle is positive.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Early fuel injection systems</heading><paragraph>Diesel's original engine injected fuel with the assistance of compressed air, which atomized the fuel and forced it into the engine through a nozzle (a similar principle to an aerosol spray). The nozzle opening was closed by a pin valve lifted by the camshaft to initiate the fuel injection before top dead centre (<link><target>Top Dead Center</target><part>TDC</part></link>). This is called an<space/><bold>air-blast injection</bold>. Driving the three stage compressor used some power but the efficiency and net power output was more than any other combustion engine at that time.</paragraph><paragraph>Diesel engines in service today raise the fuel to extreme pressures by mechanical pumps and deliver it to the combustion chamber by pressure-activated injectors without compressed air. With direct injected diesels, injectors spray fuel through 4 to 12 small orifices in its nozzle. The early air injection diesels always had a superior combustion without the sharp increase in pressure during combustion. Research is now being performed and patents are being taken out to again use some form of air injection to reduce the nitrogen oxides and pollution, reverting to Diesel's original implementation with its superior combustion and possibly quieter operation. In all major aspects, the modern diesel engine holds true to Rudolf Diesel's original design, that of igniting fuel by compression at an extremely high pressure within the cylinder. With much higher pressures and high technology injectors, present-day diesel engines use the so-called solid injection system applied by<space/><link><target>Herbert Akroyd Stuart</target></link><space/>for his<space/><link><target>hot bulb engine</target></link>. The<space/><link><target>indirect injection</target></link><space/>engine could be considered the latest development of these low speed<space/><italics>hot bulb</italics><space/>ignition engines.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Fuel delivery</heading><paragraph>Diesel engines are also produced with two significantly different injection locations. &quot;Direct&quot; and &quot;Indirect&quot;. Indirect injected engines place the injector in a pre-combustion chamber in the head which due to thermal losses generally require a &quot;glow plug&quot; to start and very high compression ratio. Usually in the range of 21:1 to 23:1 ratio. Direct injected engines use a generally donut shaped combustion chamber void on the top of the piston. Thermal efficiency losses are significantly lower in DI engines which facilitates a much lower compression ratio generally between 14:1 and 20:1 but most DI engines are closer to 17:1. The direct injected process is significantly more internally violent and thus requires careful design, and more robust construction. The lower compression ratio also creates challenges for emissions due to partial burn. Turbocharging is particularly suited to DI engines since the low compression ratio facilitates meaningful forced induction, and the increase in airflow allows capturing additional fuel efficiency not only from more complete combustion, but also from lowering parasitic efficiency losses when properly operated, by widening both power and efficiency curves. The violent combustion process of direct injection also creates more noise, but modern designs using &quot;split shot&quot; injectors or similar multi shot processes have dramatically amended this issue by firing a small charge of fuel before the main delivery which pre-charges the combustion chamber for a less abrupt and in most cases slightly cleaner burn.</paragraph><paragraph>A vital component of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic<space/><link><target>governor (device)</target><part>governor</part></link><space/>which regulates the idling speed and maximum speed of the engine by controlling the rate of fuel delivery.

Higher pressure in the cylinder and higher forces on the connecting rods and crankshaft require stronger, heavier components. Heavier rotating components prevent diesel engines from reving as high as petrol engines for a given displacement. Diesel engines generally have similar power and inferior power to weight to petrol engines. Petrol engines must be geared lower to get the same torque as a comparable diesel but since petrol engines rev higher both will have similar acceleration. An arbitrary amount of torque at the wheels can be gained by gearing any power source down sufficiently (including a hand crank). For example, a theoretical engine with a constant 200&amp;nbsp;ft/lbs of torque and a 3000 rpm rev limit has just as much<space/><link><target>Power (physics)</target><part>power</part></link><space/>(a little over 114&amp;nbsp;hp) as another theoretical engine with a constant maximum 100&amp;nbsp;ft/lbs of torque and a 6000 rpm rev limit.

As a result, piston and connecting rods are heavier and more force must be transmitted through the connecting rods and crankshaft to change the momentum of the piston.

Once warmed up, the operator moved two levers to switch the engine to diesel operation, and work could begin. These engines had very complex cylinder heads, with their own petrol combustion chambers, and were vulnerable to expensive damage if special care was not taken (especially in letting the engine cool before turning it off).<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2012</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Cylinder cavitation and erosion damage</heading><paragraph>One phenomenon that can affect water-cooled diesel engines is cylinder cavitation and erosion. This is due to a phenomenon in high-compression engines where the ignition of the fuel in the cylinder causes a high-frequency vibration that causes bubbles to form in the coolant in contact with the cylinder. When these tiny bubbles collapse, coolant impacts the cylinder wall, over time causing small holes to form in the cylinder wall.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title"><space/>Investigation Of Cavitation Erosion In Diesel Engine Coolant Systems At The U.

Engines damaged in this way will require the affected cylinder to be repaired (where possible) or will be rendered unusable.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Quality and variety of fuels</heading><paragraph>Petrol/gasoline engines are limited in the variety and quality of the fuels they can burn. Older petrol engines fitted with a<space/><link><target>carburetor</target></link><space/>required a volatile fuel that would vaporise easily to create the necessary<space/><link><target>air-fuel ratio</target></link><space/>for combustion. Because both air and fuel are admitted to the cylinder, if the<space/><link><target>compression ratio</target></link><space/>of the engine is too high or the fuel too volatile (with too low an<space/><link><target>octane</target></link><space/>rating), the fuel will ignite under compression, as in a diesel engine, before the piston reaches the top of its stroke. This pre-ignition causes a power loss and over time major damage to the piston and cylinder. The need for a fuel that is volatile enough to vaporise but not too volatile (to avoid pre-ignition) means that petrol engines will only run on a narrow range of fuels. There has been some success at dual-fuel engines that use petrol and<space/><link><target>ethanol</target></link>, petrol and<space/><link><target>propane</target></link>, and petrol and<space/><link><target>methane</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In diesel engines, a mechanical injector system vaporizes the fuel directly into the combustion chamber or a pre-combustion chamber (as opposed to a<space/><link><target>Aspirator (pump)</target><part>Venturi jet</part></link><space/>in a carburetor, or a<space/><link><target>Fuel injection</target><part>fuel injector</part></link><space/>in a fuel injection system vaporising fuel into the intake manifold or intake runners as in a petrol engine). This<space/><italics>forced vaporisation</italics><space/>means that less-volatile fuels can be used. More crucially, because only air is inducted into the cylinder in a diesel engine, the compression ratio can be much higher as there is no risk of pre-ignition provided the injection process is accurately timed. This means that cylinder temperatures are much higher in a diesel engine than a petrol engine, allowing less volatile fuels to be used.</paragraph><paragraph>Diesel fuel is a form of light fuel oil, very similar to<space/><link><target>kerosene</target></link><space/>(paraffin), but diesel engines, especially older or simple designs that lack precision electronic injection systems, can run on a wide variety of other fuels. Some of the most common alternatives are Jet A-1 type<space/><link><target>jet fuel</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>vegetable oil</target></link><space/>from a very wide variety of plants. Some engines can be run on vegetable oil without modification, and most others require fairly basic alterations.<space/><link><target>Biodiesel</target></link><space/>is a pure diesel-like fuel refined from vegetable oil and can be used in nearly all diesel engines. Requirements for fuels to be used in diesel engines are the ability of the fuel to flow along the fuel lines, the ability of the fuel to lubricate the injector pump and injectors adequately, and its ignition qualities (ignition delay,<space/><link><target>cetane number</target></link>). Inline mechanical injector pumps generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps. Also, indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on bio-fuels than direct injection engines. This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater 'swirl' effect, improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel, and because (in the case of vegetable oil-type fuels)<space/><link><target>lipid</target></link><space/>depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low (such as starting the engine from cold).</paragraph><paragraph>It is often reported that Diesel designed his engine to run on<space/><link><target>peanut oil</target></link>, but this is false.

Engines using these heavy oils have to start and shut down on standard diesel fuel, as these fuels will not flow through fuel lines at low temperatures. Moving beyond that, use of low-grade fuels can lead to serious maintenance problems because of their high sulphur and lower lubrication properties. Most diesel engines that power ships like supertankers are built so that the engine can safely use low-grade fuels due to their separate cylinder and crankcase lubrication.</paragraph><paragraph>Normal diesel fuel is more difficult to ignite and slower in developing fire than petrol because of its higher<space/><link><target>flash point</target></link>, but once burning, a diesel fire can be fierce.</paragraph><paragraph>Fuel contaminants such as dirt and water are often more problematic in diesel engines than in petrol engines. Water can cause serious damage, due to corrosion, to the injection pump and injectors; and dirt, even very fine particulate matter, can damage the injection pumps due to the close tolerances that the pumps are machined to. All diesel engines will have a fuel filter (usually much finer than a filter on a petrol engine), and a water trap. The water trap (which is sometimes part of the fuel filter) often has a float connected to a warning light, which warns when there is too much water in the trap, and must be drained before damage to the engine can result.

There is no definitive engine size cut-off point for this.</paragraph><paragraph>It should also be noted that most major manufacturers of medium-speed engines make<space/><link><target>natural gas</target></link>-fueled versions of their diesel engines, which in fact operate on the<space/><link><target>Otto cycle</target></link>, and require spark ignition, typically provided with a spark plug.<extension extension_name='ref' name="DFE LNG"></extension><space/>There are also dual (diesel/natural gas/coal gas) fuel versions of medium and low speed diesel engines using a lean fuel air mixture and a small injection of diesel fuel (so-called &quot;pilot fuel&quot;) for ignition. In case of a gas supply failure or maximum power demand these engines will instantly switch back to full diesel fuel operation.<extension extension_name='ref' name="DFE LNG"></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="title">User's Guide to Natural Gas Technologies<space/></arg><arg name="author">Payne, F.

They typically use direct injection running on cheap low-grade heavy fuel, also known as<space/><link><target>Fuel oil#Bunker fuel</target><part>bunker C</part></link><space/>fuel, which requires heating in the ship for tanking and before injection due to the fuel's high<space/><link><target>viscosity</target></link>. Often, the waste heat recovery steam boilers attached to the engine exhaust ducting generate the heat required for fuel heating. Provided the heavy fuel system is kept warm and circulating, engines can be started and stopped on heavy fuel.</paragraph><paragraph>Large and medium marine engines are started with compressed air directly applied to the pistons. Air is applied to cylinders to start the engine forwards or backwards because they are normally directly connected to the<space/><link><target>propeller</target></link><space/>without clutch or gearbox, and to provide reverse propulsion either the engine must be run backwards or the ship will use an adjustable propeller. At least three cylinders are required with<space/><link><target>two-stroke</target></link><space/>engines and at least six cylinders with<space/><link><target>four-stroke</target></link><space/>engines to provide<space/><link><target>torque</target></link><space/>every 120 degrees.</paragraph><paragraph>Companies such as<space/><link><target>MAN B&amp;W Diesel</target></link>, (formerly<space/><link><target>Burmeister &amp; Wain</target></link>) and<space/><link><target>Wrtsil</target></link><space/>(which acquired<space/><link><target>Sulzer (manufacturer)</target><part>Sulzer</part></link><space/>Diesel) design such large low-speed engines.
