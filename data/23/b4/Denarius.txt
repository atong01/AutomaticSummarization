In the [[Roman currency]] system, the '''denarius''' ({{IPAc-en|d|…™|Àà|n|…õ…ôr|…™|…ô|s}} {{Respell|di|NAIR|i-…ôs}}; plural: denarii {{IPAc-en|d|…™|Àà|n|…õ…ôr|…™|a…™}} {{Respell|di|NAIR|i-eye}}) was a small [[silver coin]] first minted about 211 BC during the [[Second Punic War]]. It became the most common [[coin]] produced for circulation but was slowly [[Debasement|debased]] in weight and silver content until its replacement by the double denarius, called the [[antoninianus]], early in the 3rd century AD. The word ''denarius'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''dƒìnƒ´'' "containing ten", as its value was 10 [[As (coin)|asses]], although in the middle of the 2nd century BC it was recalibrated so that it was now worth sixteen asses or four [[Sestertius|sestertii]]. It is the origin of several modern words such as the currency name [[dinar]]; it is also the origin for the common noun for money in Italian  ''denaro'', in Portuguese ''dinheiro'' and in Spanish ''dinero''. Its symbol is {{unicode|êÜñ}}.

==History==
A predecessor of the denarius was first struck in 267 BC, five years before the first [[Punic War]]<ref>A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities,  William Smith, D.C.l., LL, D., John Murray, London 1875 Pg 393, 394</ref> with an average weight of 6.81&nbsp;grams, or {{frac|1|48}} of a Roman pound. Contact with the Greeks prompted a need for silver coinage in addition to the bronze currency that the Romans were using during that time. The predecessor of the denarius was a Greek-styled silver coin, very similar to the didrachm and [[greek drachma|drachma]] struck in [[Metapontion]]{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} and other Greek cities in southern Italy. These coins were inscribed for Rome but closely resemble their Greek counterparts. They were most likely used for trade purposes and were seldom used in Rome.

The first distinctively Roman silver coin appeared around 226 BC.<ref>The Numismatic Circular, Volume 8-9, Spink & Son, 1899-1900 Piccadilly West, London</ref> Classic historians sometimes called these coins denarii in the past, but they are classified by modern numismatists  as [[quadrigatus|''quadrigati'']], which is derived from the quadriga, or four-horse chariot, on the reverse, and which with a two-horse chariot or biga was the prototype for the most common designs used on Roman silver coins for the next 150 years.<ref>Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome, Lesley Adkins and Roy A. Adkins. Oxford University Press, New York 1994.</ref><ref>As the Romans Did, Jo-Ann Shelton. Oxford University Press, New York 1998</ref><ref>Plutarch's Lives, Vol 2, John Langhorne, DD, William Langhorne, AM, London 1813</ref>

Rome overhauled its coinage around 211 BC and introduced the denarius alongside a short-lived denomination called the [[victoriatus]]. This denarius contained an average 4.5&nbsp;grams, or {{frac|1|72}} of a Roman pound of silver. It formed the backbone of Roman currency throughout the [[Roman Republic|Roman republic]].<ref>The New Deal in Old Rome, HJ Haskell, Alfred K Knoff New York 1939</ref>

The denarius began to undergo slow debasement toward the end of the republican period. Under the rule of [[Augustus]],  (63 BC-AD 14) its silver content fell to 3.9&nbsp;grams (a theoretical weight of {{frac|1|84}} of a Roman pound). It remained at nearly this weight until the time of [[Nero]] (AD 37-68), when it was reduced to {{frac|1|96}} of a pound, or 3.4&nbsp;grams. Debasement of the coin's silver content continued after Nero. Later Roman emperors reduced its content to 3&nbsp;grams around the late third century.<ref>Ancient coin collection 3Wayne G Sayles Pg 21-22</ref>

The value at its introduction was 10 [[as (coin)|asses]], giving the denarius its name, which translates as "containing ten". In about 141 BC, it was re-tariffed at 16 asses, to reflect the decrease in weight of the [[as (coin)|as]].  The denarius continued to be the main coin of the [[Roman Empire]] until it was replaced by the [[antoninianus]] in the middle of the third century. The last issuance of this coin occurred in bronze form by [[Aurelian]], between AD 270 and 275, and in the first years of the reign of [[Diocletian]].

==Comparisons and silver content==

It is difficult to give even rough comparative values for money from before the 20th century, as the range of products and services available for purchase was different. Classical historians often say that in the late [[Roman Republic]] and early [[Roman Empire]] (~27BC) the daily wage for an unskilled laborer and common soldier was 1 denarius (with no tax deductions) or about US$20 in bread.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210071801/http://dougsmith.ancients.info/worth.html Buying Power of Ancient Coins]</ref> During the republic (509‚Äì27 BC),{{when|date=September 2014}} legionary (professional soldier) pay was 112.5 denarii per year (0.3/day), later doubled by Julius Caesar to 225 denarii (0.6/day), with soldiers having to pay for their own food and arms.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Centurions received considerably higher pay; under Augustus, the lowest rank of centurion was paid 3,750 denarii and the highest rank, 15,000 denarii.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The silver content of the denarius under the Roman Empire (After Nero) was about 50 [[grain (measure)|grains]], 3.24 grams, or {{frac|1|10}} (0.105ozt) [[troy ounce]]. On June 6, 2011, this was about US$3.62 in value if the silver were 0.999 pure.

The fineness of the silver content varied with political and economic circumstances. From a purity of greater than 90% silver in the first century A.D., the denarius fell to under 60% purity by the end of the second century A.D., and plummeted to 5% purity by the end of the third century A.D.<ref>http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm</ref> By the reign of [[Gallienus]], the antoninianus was a copper coin with a thin silver wash.<ref>{{cite web|last=Katsari|first=Constantina|title=The Concept of Inflation in the Roman Empire|year=2002|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/wpa/wuwpeh/0204001.html|accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref>

By comparison, a laborer earning the [[minimum wage in the United States]] in January 2014 made US$58 for an 8-hour day, before taxes (utilizing the [[Mode (statistics)|mode value]] of $7.25 per hour, which was true then in 20 states) and a labourer earning the [[minimum wage in the United Kingdom]] in 2014 made GBP¬£52 for an 8-hour day, before taxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm |title=United States Department of Labor--Wage and Hour Division (WHD)|publisher=www.dol.gov| accessdate=10 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates |title=National Minimum Wage rates|publisher=www.gov.uk| accessdate=14 November 2014 }}</ref>

In the final years of the first century BC [[Tincomarus]] the ruler of part of Britain started issuing coins that appear to have been made from melted down Denarii.<ref name=jersey29>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |page=29 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref>

Even after the denarius was no longer regularly issued, it continued to be used as a unit of account, and the name was applied to later Roman coins in a way that is not understood. The [[Arab]]s who [[Muslim conquests|conquered large parts]] of the land that once belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire issued their own [[gold dinar]]. The lasting legacy of the denarius can be seen in the use of "d" as the abbreviation for the British [[penny]] prior to 1971.<ref>English Coinage 600‚Äì1900 by C.H.V. Sutherland 1973 ISBN 0-7134-0731-X p.10</ref> It survived in [[France]] as the name of a coin, the [[French denier|denier]]. The denarius also survives in the common Arabic name for a currency unit, the ''[[dinar]]'' used from pre-Islamic times, and still used in several modern Arabic-speaking nations. The major currency unit in former [[Principality of Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and former [[Yugoslavia]] was ''[[dinar]]'', and it is still used in present-day [[Serbia]]. The [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] currency ''[[Macedonian denar|denar]]'' is also derived from the Roman denarius. The [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''denaro'', the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''dinero'', the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''dinheiro'', and the [[Slovene language|Slovene]] word ''{{lang|sl|denar}}'', all meaning money, are also derived from Latin ''denarius''.

==Value==
[[File:Antonia1.jpg|thumb|[[Antonia (gens)|Quintus Antonius Balbus]] (c. 82-83 BC)]]
The gold ''[[aureus]]'' seems to have been a "currency of account," a denomination not commonly seen in daily transactions due to its high value. Numismatists think that the aureus was used to pay bonuses to the legions at the accession of new emperors. It was valued at 25 denarii.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

1 [[gold]] [[aureus]] = 2 gold [[quinarius|quinarii]] = 25 silver denarii = 50 [[silver]] [[quinarius|quinarii]] = 100 [[bronze]] [[sestertius|sestertii]] = 200 bronze [[dupondius|dupondii]] = 400 [[copper]] [[as (coin)|asses]] = 800 copper [[semis]]ses = 1600 copper [[quadrans|quadrantes]]

==Use in the Bible==
In the [[New Testament]], the gospels refer to the denarius as a day's wage for a common laborer ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 20:2,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+20%3A2&version=NIV |title=Matthew 20:2 NIV - He agreed to pay them a denarius for |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref> [[Gospel of John|John]]  12:5).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jn%2012:5;&version=31 |title=Jn 12:5; NIV - "Why wasn‚Äôt this perfume sold and |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref> In the [[Book of Revelation]], during the Third Seal: Black Horse, a [[Ancient Greek units of measurement#Volume|choinix]] (or quart) of wheat and three quarts of barley were each valued at one denarius.<ref>Revelation 6:6</ref> Bible scholar Robert H. Mounce says the price of the wheat and barley as described in the vision appears to be ten to twelve times their normal cost in ancient times (The New International Commentary on the New Testament, "The Book of Revelation," p.&nbsp;155). Revelation describes a condition where basic goods are sold at greatly inflated prices. Thus, the black horse rider depicts times of deep scarcity or famine but not of starvation. The English word "quart" translates choinix. Apparently, a choinix of wheat was the daily ration of one adult. Thus, in the conditions pictured by Revelation 6 the normal income for a working-class family would buy enough food for only one person. The less costly barley would feed three people for one day's wages.

==In popular culture==
The silver denarius is one of the two main units of currency in [[Rick Riordan|Rick Riordan's]] ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' series, along with the golden [[drachma]].
