'''AIX''' ('''Advanced Interactive eXecutive''', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|aɪ|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|}}<ref>[http://tehtable.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/unix-pronunciation Unix Pronunciation « Around Teh Table]</ref>) is a series of [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Unix]] [[operating system]]s developed and sold by [[IBM]] for several of its computer platforms.  Originally released for the [[IBM 6150 RT|IBM 6150]] [[RISC]] [[workstation]], AIX now supports or has supported a wide variety of hardware platforms, including the IBM [[RS/6000]] series and later [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER]] and [[PowerPC]]-based systems, [[IBM System i]], [[System/370]] mainframes, [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] [[personal computer]]s, and the [[Apple Network Server]].

AIX is based on [[UNIX System V]] with [[4.3BSD]]-compatible extensions.  It is one of five commercial operating systems that have versions certified to [[The Open Group]]'s UNIX 03 standard (the others being Mac [[OS X]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Inspur K-UX]] and [[HP-UX]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/|title=The Open Brand Register of Certified Products|accessdate=2014-05-29|publisher=[[The Open Group]]|date=2014-05-29}}</ref>

The AIX family of operating systems debuted in 1986, became the standard operating system for the [[RS/6000]] series on its launch in 1990, and is still actively developed by IBM.  It is currently supported on [[IBM Power Systems]] alongside [[IBM i]] and [[Linux]].

AIX was the first operating system to utilize [[journaling file system]]s, and IBM has continuously enhanced the software with features like processor, disk and network [[virtualization]], dynamic hardware resource allocation (including fractional processor units), and [[reliability engineering]] ported from its [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-unix40/#aixhistory|title=UNIX turns 40|accessdate=2011-02-09|publisher=IBM Corporation|date=2011-02-09}}</ref>

Unix started life at [[AT&T]]'s [[Bell Labs]] research center in the early 1970s, running on [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[minicomputer]]s. By 1976, the operating system was in use at various academic institutions, including [[Princeton University|Princeton]], where Tom Lyon and others ported it to the S/370, to run as a guest OS under [[VM (operating system)|VM/370]].<ref name="johnsonport">{{cite journal |title=Portability of C Programs and the UNIX System |first1=Stephen C. |last1=Johnson |authorlink1=Stephen C.

IBM's own involvement in Unix can be dated to 1979, when it assisted Bell Labs in doing its own Unix port to the 370 (to be used as a [[Software build|build host]] for the [[5ESS switch]]'s software), making modifications to the [[TSS/370]] [[hypervisor]].<ref name="att-s370-unix">{{cite journal |title=A UNIX System Implementation for System/370 |first1=W.

M. |last3=Milner |journal=AT&T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal |year=1984 |volume=63 |issue=8 |url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/otherports/ibm.pdf}}</ref>

It took until 1985 for IBM to offer its own Unix on the platform: IX/370, developed by [[Interactive Systems Corporation]] and designed to compete with Amdahl UTS.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Computerworld |date=February 18, 1985 |title=Users: new life for VM |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwX8vVdMAckC&pg=PA11 |first=John |last=Gallant}}</ref> The operating system offered special facilities for interoperating with [[PC/IX]], Interactive/IBM's version of Unix for [[IBM PC compatible]] hardware, with licenses costing $10,000 per sixteen concurrent users.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Computerworld |date=February 18, 1985 |title=Software steals 3090's thunder: VM gets XA version; Unix fully supported |pages=1, 8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwX8vVdMAckC&pg=PA8 |first=John |last=Gallant}}</ref>

AIX Version 1, introduced in 1986 for the [[IBM 6150 RT]] [[computer workstation|workstation]], was based on [[UNIX System V]] Releases 1 and 2.  In developing AIX, IBM and [[Interactive Systems Corporation]] (whom IBM contracted) also incorporated source code from 4.2 and 4.3 [[BSD]] UNIX.

Among other variants, IBM later produced AIX Version 3 (also known as '''AIX/6000'''), based on System V Release 3, for their [[IBM POWER Instruction Set Architecture|POWER]]-based [[RS/6000]] platform. Since 1990, AIX has served as the primary operating system for the RS/6000 series (later renamed ''[[IBM eServer]] pSeries'', then ''[[IBM System p]]'', and now ''[[IBM Power Systems]]''). AIX Version 4, introduced in 1994, added [[symmetric multiprocessing]] with the introduction of the first RS/6000 SMP servers and continued to evolve through the 1990s, culminating with AIX 4.3.3 in 1999. Version 4.1, in a slightly modified form, was also the standard operating system for the [[Apple Network Server]] systems sold by [[Apple Computer]] to complement the [[Macintosh]] line.

In the late 1990s, under [[Project Monterey]], IBM and the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] planned to integrate AIX and [[UnixWare]] into a single [[32-bit]]/[[64-bit computing|64-bit]] multiplatform UNIX with particular emphasis on running on [[Intel]] [[Itanium|IA-64]] (Itanium) architecture CPUs.  A [[beta test]] version of AIX 5L for IA-64 systems was released, but according to documents released in the ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' lawsuit, less than forty licenses for the finished Monterey Unix were ever sold before the project was terminated in 2002.<ref name="grok"/> In 2003, the [[SCO Group]] alleged that (among other infractions) IBM had misappropriated licensed [[source code]] from [[UNIX System V]] Release 4 for incorporation into AIX; SCO subsequently withdrew IBM's license to develop and distribute AIX.  IBM maintains that their license was irrevocable, and continued to sell and support the product until the litigation was adjudicated.

AIX was a component of the 2003 ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' lawsuit, in which the [[SCO Group]] filed a lawsuit against IBM, alleging IBM contributed SCO's [[intellectual property]] to the [[Linux kernel|Linux]] codebase.  The [[SCO Group]], who argued they were the rightful owners of the copyrights covering the [[Unix]] operating system, attempted to revoke IBM's license to sell or distribute the AIX operating system.  In March 2010, a jury returned a verdict finding that [[Novell]], not the SCO Group, owns the rights to Unix.<ref name="Jury verdict 2010">{{cite web | url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20100330152829622 | title=Novell Wins Again&nbsp;— Jury Rules Copyrights Didn't Go to SCO | accessdate=2010-03-30 | date=2010-03-30}}</ref>

AIX 6 was announced in May 2007, and it ran as an open beta from June 2007 until the general availability (GA) of AIX 6.1 on November 9, 2007.  Major new features in AIX 6.1 included full [[role-based access control]], [[workload partitions]] (which enable application mobility), enhanced security (Addition of AES encryption type for NFS v3 and v4), and [[Live Partition Mobility]] on the POWER6 hardware.

AIX 7 was announced in April 2010, and an open beta ran until general availability of AIX 7.1 in September 2010. Several new features, including better scalability, enhanced clustering and management capabilities were added. On October 5th, 2015 IBM announced AIX 7.2 release with an open beta program that is expected to run until the general availability on December 5th, 2015. Several new features to enhance reliability, security, and performance were added. One of the key new features is the Kernel Update capability which allows OS fixes to be applied to the live running kernel in a non-disruptive manner.

==Supported hardware platforms==

===IBM 6150 RT===
The original AIX (sometimes called '''AIX/RT''') was developed for the IBM 6150 RT workstation by IBM in conjunction with [[Interactive Systems Corporation]], who had previously ported [[UNIX System III]] to the [[IBM PC]] for IBM as [[PC/IX]].<ref name="CW86"/> According to its developers, the AIX source (for this initial version) consisted of one million lines of code.<ref>{{cite book|title=IBM joins 32-bit fray with RT line|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=33QfOHT69aMC&pg=PA8|date=January 27, 1986|publisher=Computerworld|page=8|issn=0010-4841}}</ref>  Installation media consisted of eight [[Floppy disk|1.2M floppy disk]]s.  The RT was based on the [[ROMP]] [[microprocessor]], the first commercial [[RISC]] chip. This was based on a design pioneered at IBM Research (the [[IBM 801]]) .

One of the novel aspects of the RT design was the use of a [[microkernel]], called Virtual Resource Manager (VRM).  The keyboard, mouse, display, disk drives and network were all controlled by a microkernel.  One could "hotkey" from one operating system to the next using the Alt-Tab key combination. Each OS in turn would get possession of the keyboard, mouse and display. Besides AIX v2, the [[PICK OS]] also utilized this microkernel.

Much of the AIX v2 kernel was written in the [[PL/I]] programming language, which proved troublesome during the migration to AIX v3.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  AIX v2 included full [[TCP/IP]] networking, as well as [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA]] and two networking file systems: [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], licensed from [[Sun Microsystems]], and [[Distributed Services]] (DS).  DS had the distinction of being built on top of SNA, and thereby being fully compatible with DS on the IBM midrange [[IBM System i|AS/400]] and mainframe systems.  For the graphical user interfaces, AIX v2 came with the X10R3 and later the X10R4 and X11 versions of the [[X Window System]] from MIT, together with the [[Xaw|Athena widget set]].  Compilers for [[Fortran]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] were available.  One of the more popular desktop applications was the [[PageMaker]] [[desktop publishing]] software.

===IBM PS/2 series===
[[File:aixps2.gif|thumb|alt=AIX PS/2 running on Virtual PC|AIX PS/2 running on Virtual PC]]

'''AIX PS/2''' (also known as '''AIX/386''') was developed by [[Locus Computing Corporation]] under contract to IBM.<ref name="CW86">{{cite book|author=Patricia Keefe|title=IBM, Locus to co-develop PS/2 AIX system|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fGXpro99fIsC&pg=PT7|publisher=Computerworld|page=8|date=July 6, 1986|issn=0010-4841}}</ref>  AIX PS/2, first released in 1989,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} ran on [[IBM PS/2]] [[personal computer]]s with [[Intel 386]] and compatible processors.

The product was announced in September 1988 with a baseline tag price of $595, although some utilities like [[uucp]] were included in a separate Extension package priced at $250. [[nroff]] and [[troff]] for AIX were also sold separately in a Text Formatting System package priced at $200. The [[TCP/IP]] stack for AIX PS/2 retailed for another $300. The [[X Window System|X Window]] package was priced at $195, while the C and FORTRAN compilers each had a price tag of $275. Locus also made available their [[DOS Merge]] virtual machine environment for AIX, which could run MS DOS 3.3 applications inside AIX; DOS Merge was sold separately for another $250.<ref>{{cite book|title=IBM Announces Broad Range of Unix-Related Tools, Products|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Bj8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8|date=November 16, 1987|publisher=InfoWorld|page=8|issn=0199-6649}}</ref> IBM also offered a $150 AIX PS/2 DOS Server Program, which provided [[file server]] and [[print server]] services for client computers running PC DOS 3.3.<ref name="Enterprise1988">{{cite book|title=AIX for PS/2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jBT4fczNvWwC&pg=PT54|date=February 22, 1988|publisher=Computerworld|page=55|issn=0010-4841}}</ref>

The last version of PS/2 AIX is 1.3. It was released in 1992 and announced to add support for non-IBM (non-microchannel) computers as well.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cate Corcoran|title=IBM announces increased support for Unix on PCs|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=klEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16|date=September 28, 1992|publisher=InfoWorld|pages=16|issn=0199-6649}}</ref>  Support for PS/2 AIX ended in March 1995.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20030428132638/os2ports.com/docs/aix/withdraw.html</ref>

===IBM mainframes===
In 1988, IBM announced '''AIX/370''', also developed by Locus Computing.  AIX/370 was IBM's third attempt to offer [[Unix-like]] functionality for their mainframe line, specifically the [[System/370]] (the prior versions were a [[TSS/360|TSS/370]] based Unix system developed jointly with AT&T c.1980,<ref name="att-s370-unix"/> and '''VM/IX''', a [[VM/370]] based system developed jointly with [[Interactive Systems Corporation]] c.1984).  AIX/370 was released in 1990 with functional equivalence to System V Release 2 and 4.3BSD as well as IBM enhancements.  With the introduction of the [[ESA/390]] architecture, AIX/370 was replaced by '''AIX/ESA''' in 1991, which was based on [[OSF/1]], and also ran on the [[System/390]] platform.  This development effort was made partly to allow IBM to compete with [[Amdahl Corporation|Amdahl]] [[UTS (Mainframe UNIX)|UTS]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  Unlike AIX/370, AIX/ESA ran both natively as the host operating system, and as a guest under [[VM (Operating system)|VM]].  AIX/ESA, while technically advanced, had little commercial success, partially because UNIX functionality was added as an option to the existing mainframe operating system, [[MVS]], which became [[MVS/ESA|MVS/ESA OpenEdition]] in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===POWER/PowerPC-based systems===
[[File:IBM RS6000 AIX Servers IBM.COM 1998 (1).jpeg|thumb|AIX [[RS/6000]] [[network server|servers]] running ''ibm.com'' in early 1998]]
[[File:IBM RS6000 AIX Servers IBM.COM 1998 (2).jpeg|thumb|AIX [[RS/6000]] [[network server|servers]] running ''ibm.com'' in early 1998]]

The release of AIX version 3 (sometimes called '''AIX/6000''') coincided with the announcement of the first [[POWER1]]-based IBM [[RS/6000]] models in 1990.

AIX v3 innovated in several ways on the software side. It was the first operating system to introduce the idea of a [[journaling file system]], [[IBM Journaled File System 2 (JFS2)|JFS]], which allowed for fast boot times by avoiding the need to ensure the consistency of the file systems on disks (see [[fsck]]) on every reboot. Another innovation was [[shared library|shared libraries]] which avoid the need for static linking from an application to the libraries it used. The resulting smaller binaries used less of the hardware RAM to run, and used less disk space to install. Besides improving performance, it was a boon to developers: executable binaries could be in the tens of [[kilobyte]]s instead of a megabyte for an executable statically linked to the [[C library]]. AIX v3 also scrapped the microkernel of AIX v2, a contentious move that resulted in v3 containing no PL/I code and being somewhat more "pure" than v2.

Other notable subsystems included:

* [[IRIS GL]], a 3D rendering library, the progenitor of [[OpenGL]]. IRIS GL was licensed by IBM from [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] in 1987, then still a small company which had sold only one thousand machines to date. SGI also provided the low-end graphics card for the RS/6000, capable of drawing 20,000 [[Gouraud shading|gouraud-shaded]] triangles per second. The high-end graphics card was designed by IBM, a follow-on to the mainframe-based [[IBM 5080]], capable of rendering 990,000 vectors per second.
* [[PHIGS]], another 3D rendering API, popular in automotive CAD/CAM circles, and at the core of [[CATIA]].
* Full implementation of version 11 of the [[X Window System]], together with [[Motif (software)|Motif]] as the recommended widget collection and window manager.
* Network file systems: [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] from [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]; AFS, the [[Andrew File System]]; and DFS, the [[DCE Distributed File System|Distributed File System]].
* NCS, the [[Network Computing System]], licensed from [[Apollo Computer]] (later acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]).
* [[Display PostScript|DPS]] on-screen display system. This was notable as a "plan B" in case the X11+Motif combination failed in the marketplace. However, it was highly proprietary, supported only by Sun, [[NeXT]], and IBM. This cemented its failure in the marketplace in the face of the [[Open system (computing)|open system]]s challenge of X11+Motif and its lack of 3D capability.

{{As of|2015}}, AIX runs on IBM [[IBM Power Systems|Power]], [[System p]], [[IBM System i|System i]], System p5, System i5, eServer p5, eServer pSeries and eServer i5 server product lines, as well as IBM [[BladeCenter]] blades<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> and IBM [[PureFlex]] compute nodes based on Power Architecture technology.

====POWER7 AIX features====
AIX 7 includes a new built-in clustering capability called Cluster Aware AIX. AIX is able to organize multiple LPARs through the multipath communications channel to neighboring CPUs, enabling very high-speed communication between processors. This enables multi-terabyte memory address range and page table access to support global petabyte shared memory space for AIX POWER7 clusters so that software developers can program a cluster as if it were a single system, without using message passing (i.e. semaphore-controlled Inter-process Communication). AIX administrators can use this new capability to cluster a pool of AIX nodes. By default, AIX V7.1 pins kernel memory and includes support to allow applications to pin their kernel stack. Pinning kernel memory and the kernel stack for applications with real-time requirements can provide performance improvements by ensuring that the kernel memory and kernel stack for an application is not paged out.

AIX POWER7 systems include the Active Memory Expansion feature, which increases system flexibility where system administrators can configure logical partitions (LPARs) to use less physical memory. For example, an LPAR running AIX appears to the OS applications to be configured with 80 GB of physical memory but the hardware actually only consumes 60 GB of physical memory. Active Memory Expansion is a [[virtual memory compression]] system which employs memory compression technology to transparently compress in-memory data, allowing more data to be placed into memory and thus expanding the memory capacity of POWER7 systems. Utilizing Active Memory Expansion can improve system utilization and increase a system’s throughput. AIX 7 automatically manages the size of memory pages used to automatically use 4&nbsp;KB, 64&nbsp;KB or a combination of those page sizes. This self-tuning feature results in optimized performance without administrative effort.

====Apple Network Servers====
The [[Apple Network Server]] systems were PowerPC-based systems designed by [[Apple Computer]] to have numerous high-end features that standard Apple hardware did not have, including swappable hard drives, redundant power supplies, and external monitoring capability. These systems were more or less based on the [[Power Macintosh]] hardware available at the time but were designed to use AIX (versions 4.1.4 or 4.1.5) as their native operating system in a specialized version specific to the ANS.

AIX was only compatible with the Network Servers and was not ported to standard Power Macintosh hardware. Not to be confused is [[A/UX]], Apple's earlier version of Unix for [[68k]]-based [[Macintosh]]es.

===IA-64 systems===
As part of [[Project Monterey]], IBM released a [[beta test]] version of AIX 5L for the IA-64 ([[Itanium]]) architecture in 2001, but this never became an official product due to lack of interest.<ref name="grok">{{cite web

The default shell was [[Bourne shell]] up to AIX version 3, but was changed to [[Korn shell]] (ksh88) in version 4 in view of [[XPG4]] and [[POSIX]] compliance.<ref name="CannonTrent1999">{{cite book|author1=Casey Cannon|author2=Scott Trent|author3=Carolyn Jones|title=Simply AIX 4.3|year=1999|publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|isbn=978-0-13-021344-0|page=21}}</ref>

===Graphical===
The [[Common Desktop Environment]] (CDE) is AIX's default [[graphical user interface]]. As part of Linux Affinity and the free AIX Toolboxes for Linux Applications (ATLA), open-source [[KDE Plasma Workspaces]] and [[GNOME]] desktop are also available.

=== System Management Interface Tool ===
[[File:Screenshot of IBM AIX SMIT Initial Menu.png|thumb|The initial menu, when running in text mode.]]
[[IBM AIX SMIT|SMIT]] is the System Management Interface Tool for AIX. It allows a user to navigate a menu hierarchy of commands, rather than using the command line. Invocation is typically achieved with the command <code>smit</code>. Experienced system administrators make use of the <code>F6</code> function key which generates the command line that SMIT will invoke to complete it.
SMIT also generates a log of commands that are performed in the <code>smit.script</code> file. The <code>smit.script</code> file automatically records the commands with the command flags and parameters used. The <code>smit.script</code> file can be used as an executable shell script to rerun system configuration tasks. SMIT also creates the <code>smit.log</code> file, which contains additional detailed information that can be used by programmers in extending the SMIT system.

<code>smit</code> and <code>smitty</code> refer to the same program, though <code>smitty</code> invokes the text-based version, while <code>smit</code> will invoke an X Window System based interface if possible; however, if <code>smit</code> determines that X Window System capabilities are not present, it will present the text-based version instead of failing.  Determination of X Window System capabilities is typically performed by checking for the existence of the <code>DISPLAY</code> variable.
