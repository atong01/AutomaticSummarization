'''Angola''' {{IPAc-en|æ|ŋ|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|l|ə}}, officially the '''Republic of Angola''' ({{lang-pt|República de Angola}} {{pt|ʁɛˈpublika dɨ ãŋɡɔla|pron}}; [[Kikongo]], [[Kimbundu]], [[Umbundu]]: ''Repubilika ya Ngola''), is a [[country]] in [[Southern Africa]]. It is the seventh-largest country in Africa, and is bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Zambia]] to the east, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to west. The [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] has borders with the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The capital and largest city is [[Luanda]].

Although its territory has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Era]], modern Angola originates in [[Portuguese colonization of Africa|Portuguese colonization]], which began with, and was for centuries limited to, coastal settlements and trading posts established from the 16th century onwards. In the 19th century, European settlers slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. As a [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony]], Angola did not encompass its present borders until the early 20th century, following resistance by groups such as the [[Cuamato]], the [[Kwanyama people|Kwanyama]] and the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]]. Independence was achieved in 1975 after a [[Angolan War of Independence|protracted liberation war]]. That same year, Angola descended into an intense [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] that lasted until 2002. It has since become a relatively stable [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential republic]].

Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves, and its economy is among the fastest growing in the world, especially since the end of the civil war. In spite of this, the standard of living remains low for the majority of the population, and [[life expectancy]] and [[infant mortality|infant mortality rates]] in Angola are among the worst in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Life expectancy at birth|year=2014|work=World Fact Book|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html}}</ref> Angola's economic growth is highly uneven, with the majority of the nation's [[wealth concentration|wealth concentrated]] in a disproportionately small sector of the population.

Angola is a member state of the United Nations, [[OPEC]], [[African Union]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], the [[Latin Union]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]]. A highly multiethnic country, Angola's 24.3 million people span various tribal groups, customs, and traditions. Angolan culture reflects centuries of Portuguese rule, namely in the predominance of the [[Portuguese language]] and [[Roman Catholicism]], combined with diverse indigenous influences.

==Etymology==
The name ''Angola'' comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] colonial name ''[[Angola (Portugal)|Reino de Angola]] (Kingdom of Angola)'', appearing as early as [[Dias de Novais]]'s 1571 charter.<ref>Heywood, Linda M. & Thornton, John K. (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=S42CypbRTlQC&pg=PA82 Central Africans, Atlantic Creoles, and the foundation of the Americas, 1585–1660]''. Cambridge University Press. p. 82. ISBN 0521770653</ref> The [[toponym]] was derived by the Portuguese from the title ''[[List of Ngolas of Ndongo|ngola]]'' held by the kings of [[Kingdom of Ndongo|Ndongo]]. Ndongo was a kingdom in the highlands, between the [[Kwanza River|Kwanza]] and [[Lukala River]]s, nominally tributary to the [[Kingdom of Kongo|king of Kongo]] but which was seeking greater independence during the 16th century.

==History==
{{Main|History of Angola}}

===Early migrations and political units===
[[File:KingdomNdongo1711.png|thumb|left|Territory comprising [[Kingdom of Ndongo]], present-day Angola]]

[[Khoi]] and [[San people|San]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s are the earliest known modern human inhabitants of the area. They were largely absorbed or replaced by [[Bantu peoples]] during the [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]], though small numbers remain in parts of southern Angola to the present day. The Bantu came from the north, probably from somewhere near the present-day Republic of [[Cameroon]].

During this time, the Bantu established a number of political units ("kingdoms", "empires") in most parts of what today is Angola. The best known of these is the [[Kingdom of the Kongo]] that had its centre in the northwest of contemporary Angola, but included important regions in the west of present-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic]] and [[Republic of Congo]] and in southern [[Gabon]]. It established trade routes with other trading cities and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and West Africa and even with the [[Great Zimbabwe]] [[Mutapa Empire]], but engaged in little or no transoceanic trade.<ref name="The Story of Africa">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page45.shtml |title=The Story of Africa |publisher=BBC |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> To its south lay the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]], from which the area of the later Portuguese colony was sometimes known as '''Dongo'''.{{sfnp|EB|1878}}

===Portuguese colonization===
{{Main|Colonial history of Angola|Portuguese Angola}}
[[File:Queen Nzinga 1657.png|thumb|left|[[Queen Nzinga]] in peace negotiations with the Portuguese governor in [[Luanda]], 1657.]]
[[File:Kongo audience.jpg|thumb|left||An image depicting Portuguese encounter with Kongo Royal family]]
The region now known as Angola was reached by the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Age of Discovery|explorer]] [[Diogo Cão]] in 1484.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} The year before, the Portuguese had established relations with the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], which stretched at the time from modern [[Gabon]] in the north to the [[Kwanza River]] in the south. The Portuguese established their principal early trading post at [[Soyo]], which now forms the northernmost city in Angola apart from the [[Cabinda enclave]]. [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded São Paulo de Loanda ([[Luanda]]) in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. [[Benguela]] was fortified in 1587 and elevated to a township in 1617.

The Portuguese established other several settlements, forts, and trading posts along the Angolan coast, principally trading in [[Slavery in Angola|Angolan slaves]] for [[Captaincies of Brazil|Brazilian]] [[plantation]]s. Local slave dealers provided a large number of slaves for the [[Portuguese Empire]],<ref name=Fleisch>{{cite encyclopedia | author = Axel Fleisch  |title = Angola: Slave Trade, Abolition of | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of African History 3-Volume Set|editor-last = Shillington | editor-first = Kevin | volume = 1 | pages = 131–133| publisher = Routledge | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-57958-245-1 }}</ref> usually sold in exchange for manufactured goods from Europe.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] continued until after [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]]'s [[independence of Brazil|independence]] in the 1820s.

Despite Portugal's nominal claims, as late as the 19th century, their control over the interior country of Angola was minimal,{{sfnp|EB|1878}} but the 16th century saw them gain control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars. Life for European colonists was difficult and progress slow. [[John Iliffe (historian)|Iliffe]] notes that "Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great [[famine]] occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys".<ref>John Iliffe (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&pg=&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Africans: the history of a continent'']. Cambridge University Press. p. 68. ISBN 0-521-68297-5</ref>

Amid the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], the Dutch occupied [[Luanda]] in 1641, using alliances with local peoples against Portuguese holdings elsewhere. A fleet under [[Salvador de Sá]] retook Luanda for Portugal in 1648; reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650. New treaties with [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] were signed in 1649; others with Njinga's Kingdom of [[Matamba]] and [[Ndongo]] followed in 1656. The conquest of [[Pungo Andongo]] in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Portugal also expanded inward from Benguela, but until the late 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} Portugal had neither the intention nor the means to carry out a large scale territorial occupation and colonization.

[[File:Embarque tropas para angola 1.jpg|thumb|Portuguese troops heading for Angola during [[German campaign in Angola|World War I]].]]
Development of the hinterland began after the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1885 fixed the colony's borders, and British and Portuguese investment fostered mining, railways, and agriculture based on various forced-labour and voluntary labour systems. Full Portuguese administrative control of the hinterland did not establish itself until the beginning of the 20th century. Portugal had a minimalist presence in Angola for nearly five hundred years, and early calls for independence provoked little reaction amongst the population whose had no social identity related to the territory as a whole.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} More overtly political and "nationalist" organisations first appeared in the 1950s and began to make demands for [[self-determination]], especially in international forums such as the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

The [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portuguese regime]], meanwhile, refused to accede to the demands for independence, provoking an armed conflict that started in 1961 when freedom fighters attacked both white and black civilians in cross-border operations in northeastern Angola. The war came to be known as the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]]. In this struggle, the principal protagonists included, the [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), founded in 1956, the [[National Front for the Liberation of Angola]] (FNLA), which appeared in 1961 and the [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), founded in 1966.

After many years of conflict that led to the weakening of all the insurgent parties, Angola gained its independence on 11 November 1975, after the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 coup d'état]] in Lisbon, Portugal, which overthrew the Portuguese regime headed by [[Marcelo Caetano]].

Portugal's [[Movimento das Forças Armadas|new revolutionary leaders]] began in 1974 a process of political change at home and accepted independence for its former colonies abroad. In Angola a fight for dominance broke out immediately between the three nationalist movements. The events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens, creating up to 300 000 destitute Portuguese [[refugee]]s—the ''[[White African#Portuguese in Africa|retornados]]''.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''Time'' (7 July 1975)</ref> The new Portuguese government tried to mediate an understanding between the three competing movements, and succeeded in getting them to agree, on paper, to form a common government. But in the end none of the African parties respected the commitments made, and military force resolved the issue.

===Independence and civil war===

{{Main|Angolan War of Independence|Angolan Civil War}}
{{Further|1980s in Angola|1990s in Angola}}
After it gained independence in November 1975, Angola experienced a devastating civil war which lasted several decades (with some interludes). It claimed millions of lives and produced many refugees; it came to an end only in 2002.<ref name="Norrie MacQueen">{{cite journal|jstor=723274|title=The Decolonization of Portuguese Africa: Metropolitan Revolution and the Dissolution of Empire by Norrie MacQueen – Mozambique since Independence: Confronting Leviathan by Margaret Hall & Tom Young|author=Stuart A.

Following [[Alvor Agreement|negotiations held in Portugal]], itself experiencing severe social and political turmoil and uncertainty due to the [[Carnation Revolution|April 1974 revolution]], Angola's three main guerrilla groups agreed to establish a transitional government in January 1975. Within two months, however, the FNLA, MPLA and UNITA had started fighting each other and the country began splitting into zones controlled by rival armed political groups. The [[MPLA]] gained control of the capital [[Luanda]] and much of the rest of the country. With the support of the United States, Zaïre and South Africa intervened militarily in favour of the FNLA and UNITA with the intention of taking Luanda before the declaration of independence.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4068.htm |title= Americas Third World War: How 6 million People Were killed in CIA secret wars against third world countries |publisher= Information Clearing House|location= Imperial Beach, California |date= 16 November 1981 |accessdate= 27 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100629015838/http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4068.htm | archivedate= 29 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c35COXObeo8 |title= CIA & Angolan Revolution 1975 Part 1 |publisher= YouTube |accessdate= 27 June 2010}}</ref> In response, Cuba intervened in favor of the MPLA (see: [[Cuba in Angola]]), which became a flash point for the [[Cold War]].

With Cuban support, the MPLA held Luanda and declared independence on 11 November 1975, with [[Agostinho Neto]] becoming the first president, though the civil war continued. At this time, most of the half-million Portuguese who lived in Angola – and who had accounted for the majority of the skilled work in the public administration, agriculture, industries and trade – fled the country, leaving its once prosperous and growing economy in a state of bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.economist.com/node/12079340?story_id=12079340 |title= The Economist: Flight from Angola | date=16 August 1975}}</ref>

{{Main|2000s in Angola}}

On 22 March 2002, [[Jonas Savimbi]], the leader of UNITA, was killed in combat with government troops. A cease-fire was reached by the two factions shortly afterwards.<ref name=CIA/> UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of major opposition party, although in the knowledge that in the present regime a legitimate democratic election was impossible. Although the political situation of the country began to stabilize, regular democratic processes were not established before the [[Elections in Angola]] in 2008 and 2012 and the adoption of a new [[Constitution of Angola]] in 2010, all of which strengthened the prevailing [[Dominant-party system]]. MPLA head officials continue e.g. to be given senior positions in top level companies or other fields, although a few outstanding UNITA figures are given some shares in the economic as well as in the military share.<ref>In 2006 a former UNITA general, Nduma, was appointed head of the general staff of the armed forces.</ref>

Among Angola's major problems are a serious humanitarian crisis (a result of the prolonged war), the abundance of [[minefield]]s, the continuation of the political, and to a much lesser degree, military activities in favour of the independence of the northern [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]], carried out in the context of the protracted [[Cabinda Conflict]] by the [[Frente para a Libertação do Enclave de Cabinda]], but most of all, the dilapidation of the country's rich mineral resources by the regime. While most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital, in the so-called "Musseques", the general situation for Angolans remains desperate.<ref>Lari (2004), Human Rights Watch (2005)</ref><ref>For an overall analysis see Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, Magnificant and Beggar Land: Angola since the Civil War, London: Hurst, 2015</ref>

[[File:Vladimir Putin with Jose Eduardo dos Santos-1.jpg|thumb|[[José Eduardo dos Santos]] meets with [[Vladimir Putin]]]]
Angola's motto is ''Virtus Unita Fortior'', a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "Virtue is stronger when united". The Angolan government is composed of three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Council of Ministers. The legislative branch contains a 220-seat [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature elected from both provincial and nationwide constituencies. For decades, political power has been concentrated in the Presidency.

The [[Constitution of Angola|Constitution of 2010]] establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court holds the powers of judicial review. Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by the president.

After the end of the Civil War the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international environment, to become more democratic and less authoritarian. Its reaction was to implement a number of changes without substantially changing its character.<ref>Didier Péclard (ed.) (2008) ''L'Angola dans la paix: Autoritarisme et reconversions'', special issue of ''Politique africains'' (Paris), p. 110.</ref>

Angola is classified as 'not free' by [[Freedom House]] in the [[Freedom in the World]] 2014 report.<ref name=freedomhouse>{{cite web|title=Angola|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/angola|work=Freedom in the World 2014|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref> The report noted that the [[Angolan legislative election, 2012|August 2012 parliamentary elections]], in which the ruling [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] won more than 70% of the vote, suffered from serious flaws, including outdated and inaccurate voter rolls.<ref name=freedomhouse/> Voter turnout dropped from 80% in 2008 to 60%.<ref name=freedomhouse/>

Angola scored poorly on the 2013 [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]]. It was ranked 39 out of 52 [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries, scoring particularly badly in the areas of Participation and Human Rights, Sustainable Economic Opportunity and Human Development. The Ibrahim Index uses a number of variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in Africa.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/iiag/ | title=Ibrahim Index of African Governance | publisher=Mo Ibrahim Foundation | accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref>

The [[Constitution of Angola|new constitution]], adopted in 2010, further sharpened the authoritarian character of the regime. In the future, there will be no presidential elections: the president and the vice-president of the political party which wins the parliamentary elections automatically become president and vice-president of Angola.<ref>In this manner, [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] is now finally in a legal situation. As he had gotten a plurality of votes in the 1992 presidential election, a second round—opposing him to [[Jonas Savimbi]]—was constitutionally necessary to make his election effective, but he did not hold this second round.</ref> Through a variety of mechanisms, the state president controls all the other organs of the state, so that separation of powers is not maintained. As a consequence, Angola no longer has a presidential system in the sense of the systems existing, e.g., in the [[Federal government of the United States|USA]] or in [[French government|France]]. In terms of the classifications used in constitutional law, its regime is considered one of several authoritarian regimes in Africa.<ref>Jorge Miranda (2010) "A Constituição de Angola de 2010", ''O Direito'' (Lisbon), vol. 142.</ref>

On 16 October 2014, Angola was elected for the second time as non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, with 190 favourable votes out of 193.

{{Main|Angolan Armed Forces}}
The Angolan Armed Forces (AAF) is headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defense. There are three divisions—the Army (Exército), Navy (Marinha de Guerra, MGA), and [[National Air Force of Angola|National Air Force]] (Força Aérea Nacional, FAN). Total manpower is about 110,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Its equipment includes Russian-manufactured fighters, bombers, and transport planes. There are also Brazilian-made EMB-312 Tucano for training role, Czech-made L-39 for training and bombing role, Czech Zlin for training role and a variety of western made aircraft such as C-212\Aviocar, Sud Aviation Alouette III, etc. A small number of AAF personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville).

===Police===
The National Police departments are Public Order, Criminal Investigation, Traffic and Transport, Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities, Taxation and Frontier Supervision, Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police. The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing, which will provide helicopter support for operations. The National Police are developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities. The force has an estimated 6,000 patrol officers, 2,500 taxation and frontier supervision officers, 182 criminal investigators and 100 financial crimes detectives and around 90 economic activity inspectors.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The National Police have implemented a modernization and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force. In addition to administrative reorganization, modernization projects include procurement of new vehicles, aircraft and equipment, construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories, restructured training programs and the replacement of [[AKM rifle]]s with 9&nbsp;mm [[Uzi]]s for officers in urban areas.

===Exclave of Cabinda===

[[File:Flag of Cabinda.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda|Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC)]]]]

With an area of approximately {{convert|7283|km2|sqmi}}, the Northern Angolan province of Cabinda is unusual in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip, some {{convert|60|km}} wide, of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] along the lower [[Congo river]]. Cabinda borders the [[Congo Republic]] to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south. The town of Cabinda is the chief population center.

According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighboring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil. The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, "the Kuwait of Africa". Cabinda's petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola's output.<ref>{{cite news|title=Angola profile|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13036732 | publisher=BBC News | date=22 December 2013}}</ref> Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese rule]] by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.

Ever since [[Portugal]] handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the [[Government of Angola]] (which has employed its military forces, the FAA—Forças Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists. The [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]]-[[Forças Armadas de Cabinda|Armed Forces of Cabinda]] (FLEC-FAC) announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of N'Zita Henriques Tiago. One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation, into smaller and smaller factions.

==Economy==

Angola has a rich subsoil heritage, from diamonds, oil, gold, copper, and a rich wildlife (dramatically impoverished during the civil war), forest, and fossils. Since independence, oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource. Smallholder and plantation agriculture have dramatically dropped because of the [[Angolan Civil War]], but have begun to recover after 2002. The transformation industry that had come into existence in the late colonial period collapsed at independence, because of the exodus of most of the ethnic Portuguese population, but has begun to reemerge (with updated technologies), partly because of the influx of new Portuguese entrepreneurs. Similar developments can be verified in the service sector.

Overall, Angola's economy has undergone a period of transformation in recent years, moving from the disarray caused by a quarter century of civil war to being the fastest growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world, with an average GDP growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007.<ref>[http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html Angola Financial Sector Profile: MFW4A – Making Finance Work for Africa].

Control of the [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] is consolidated in [[Sonangol Group]], a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. In December 2006, Angola was admitted as a member of [[OPEC]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Angola: Country Admitted As Opec Member |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200612140990.html |date=14 December 2006 |publisher=Angola Press Agency}}</ref> However, operations in [[List of diamond mines|diamond mines]] include partnerships between state-run [[Endiama]] and mining companies such as [[ALROSA]] which continue operations in Angola.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angolancentenary.com/press6.pdf |title=ACTUAL ARTICLE TITLE BELONGS HERE! |publisher=angolancentenary.com |accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref> The economy grew 18% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 17.6% in 2007.

Although the country's economy has developed significantly since achieving political stability in 2002, mainly thanks to the fast-rising earnings of the oil sector, Angola faces huge social and economic problems. These are in part a result of the almost continual state of conflict from 1961 onwards, although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence, during the long years of [[Angolan civil war|civil war]]. However, high poverty rates and blatant social inequality are chiefly the outcome of a combination of a persistent political authoritarianism, of "neo-patrimonial" practices at all levels of the political, administrative, military, and economic apparatuses, and of [[Corruption in Angola|a pervasive corruption]].<ref>Anti-corruption watchdog [[Transparency International]] rates Angola one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world.</ref><ref>Kerry A.

Before independence in 1975, [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of [[bananas]], coffee and [[sisal]], but [[Angolan Civil War|three decades of civil war]] (1975–2002) destroyed the fertile countryside, leaving it littered with landmines and driving millions into the cities. The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from South Africa and [[Portugal]], while more than 90 percent of farming is done at family and subsistence level. Thousands of Angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty.<ref>Louise Redvers, [http://ipsnews.net/africa/nota.asp?idnews=47123 POVERTY-ANGOLA: Inter Press Service News Agency – NGOs Sceptical of Govt's Rural Development Plans].

The enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem in the Angolan economy. This is best illustrated by the fact that about one third of the economic activities is concentrated in Luanda and the neighbouring Bengo province, while several areas of the interior are characterized by stagnation and even regression.<ref>Manuel Alves da Rocha (2010) [http://www.ceic-ucan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/desigualdades-e-assimetrias-regionais-em-angola.pdf ''Desigualdades e assimetrias regionais em Angola: Os factores da competitividade territorial''], Luanda: Centro de Estudos e Investigação Científica da Universidade Católica de Angola.</ref>

One of the economic consequences of the social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in Angolan private investments abroad. The small fringe of Angolan society where most of the accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets, for reasons of security and profit. For the time being, the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in Portugal where the [[Angolans in Portugal|Angolan presence]] (including that of the family of the state president) in banks as well as in the domains of energy, [[Telecommunications in Angola|telecommunications]], and mass media has become notable, as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of touristic enterprises.<ref>"A força do kwanza", ''Visão'' (Lisbon), 993, 15 May 2012, pp. 50–54</ref>

[[Sub-Saharan Africa]] nations are globally achieving impressive improvements in well-being, according to a report by [[Tony Blair]] Africa Governance Initiative and [[The Boston Consulting Group]].<ref>[http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/africa/news-entry/The-New-Prosperity-Strategies-for-Improving-Well-Being-in-Sub-Saharan-Afri/ The New Prosperity: Strategies for Improving Well-Being in Sub-Saharan Africa] Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative 1 May 2013</ref> Angola has upgraded critical infrastructure, an investment made possible by funds from the nation's development of oil resources. According to this report, just slightly more than ten years after the end of the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] Angola's standard of living has overall greatly improved. Life expectancy, which was just 46 years in 2002, reached 51 in 2011. Mortality rates for children fell from 25 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2010 and the number of students enrolled in primary school has tripled since 2001.<ref>[https://www.bcgperspectives.com/Images/BCG_The_New_Prosperity_tcm80-133457.pdf The New Prosperity: Strategies for Improving Well-Being in Sub-Saharan Africa] Report by The Boston Consulting Group and Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative, May 2013</ref> However, at the same time the social and economic inequality that has characterised the country since long has not diminished, but on the contrary deepened in all respects.

With a stock of assets corresponding to 70&nbsp;billion USD (6.8&nbsp;billion Kz), Angola is now the third largest financial market in sub-Saharan Africa, surpassed only by [[Nigeria]] and South Africa. According to the Angolan Minister of Economy, [[Abraão Gourgel]], the financial market of the country grew modestly from 2002 and now lies in third place at the level of sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>[http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/2014/07/23/angola-is-the-third-largest-sub-saharan-financial-market/ Angola is the third-largest sub-Saharan financial market], MacauHub, 23 July 2014</ref>

Angola's economy is expected to grow by 3.9 percent in 2014 said the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Angola}}

Transport in Angola consists of:
*Three separate [[Rail transport in Angola|railway systems]] totalling 2,761&nbsp;km (1,715&nbsp;mi)
*{{convert|76626|km|0|abbr=on}} of highway of which {{convert|19156|km|0|abbr=on}} is paved
*1,295 navigable inland waterways
*Eight major [[sea port]]s
*243 [[List of airports in Angola|airports]], of which 32 are paved.

Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. While a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Angola}}
[[File:CPLP map-pt.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Angola is a member of [[CPLP]] – Community of Portuguese-speaking nations]]

The languages in Angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], introduced during the Portuguese colonial era. The indigenous languages with the largest usage are [[Umbundu]], [[Kimbundu]], and [[Kikongo]], in that order. Portuguese is the official language of the country.

Mastery of the official language is probably more extended in Angola than it is elsewhere in Africa, and this certainly applies to its use in everyday life. Moreover, and above all, the proportion of native (or near native) speakers of the language of the former colonizer, turned official after independence, is no doubt considerably higher than in any other African country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are three intertwined historical reasons for this situation.
#In the Portuguese "bridgeheads" [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]], which existed on the coast of what today is Angola since the 15th and 16th century, respectively, Portuguese was spoken not only by the Portuguese and their ''mestiço'' descendents, but—especially in and around Luanda—by a significant number of Africans, although these always remained native speakers of their local African language.
#Since the Portuguese conquest of the present territory of Angola, and especially since its "effective occupation" in the mid-1920s, schooling in Portuguese was slowly developed by the colonial state as well as by Catholic and Protestant missions. The rhythm of this expansion was considerably accelerated during the late colonial period, 1961–1974, so that by the end of the colonial period children all over the territory (with relatively few exceptions) had at least some access to the Portuguese language.<ref>An illustration is Franz-Wilhelm Heimer, ''Educação e sociedade nas áreas rurais de Angola: Resultados de um inquérito’’, vol. 2, ''Análise do universo agrícola'' (survey report), Serviços de Planeamento e Integração Económica de Angola, Luanda, 1974</ref>
#In the same late colonial period, the legal discrimination of the black population was abolished, and the state apparatus in fields like health, education, social work, and rural development was enlarged. This entailed a significant increase in jobs for Africans, under the condition that they spoke Portuguese.

As a consequence of all this, the African "lower middle class" which at that stage formed in Luanda and other cities began to often prevent their children from learning the local African language, in order to guarantee that they learned Portuguese as their native language. At the same time, the white and "mestiço" population, where some knowledge of African languages could previously often been found, neglected this aspect more and more, to the point of frequently ignoring it totally.
After independence, these tendencies continued, and were even strengthened, under the rule of the MPLA which has its main social roots exactly in those social segments where the mastery of Portuguese as well as the proportion of native Portuguese speakers was highest. This became a political side issue, as FNLA and UNITA, given their regional constituencies, came out in favour of a greater attention to the African languages, and as the FNLA favoured French over Portuguese.

The dynamics of the language situation, as described above, were additionally fostered by the massive migrations triggered by the Civil War. [[Ovimbundu]], the most populous ethnic group and the most affected by the war, appeared in great numbers in urban areas outside their areas, especially in Luanda and surroundings. At the same time, a majority of the [[Bakongo]] who had fled to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in the early 1960s, or of their children and grandchildren, returned to Angola, but mostly did not settle in their original "habitat", but in the cities—and again above all in Luanda. As a consequence, more than half the population is now living in the cities which, from the linguistic point of view, have become highly heterogeneous. This means, of course, that Portuguese as the overall national language of communication is by now of paramount importance, and that the role of the African languages is steadily decreasing among the urban population—a trend which is beginning to spread into rural areas as well.

The exact numbers of those fluent in Portuguese or who speak Portuguese as a first language are unknown, although a census is expected to be carried out in July–August 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris21.org/node/1176|title=Angola: Population Census Dates Set|publisher=[[PARIS21]]|quote=Angola has set dates for their population census: from 16 July to 18 August 2013|date=19 April 2011|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>{{update after|2013|07|16|reason=According to the source, the census will have started as of 16 July 2013.}} Quite a number of voices demand the recognition of "Angolan Portuguese" as a specific variant, comparable to those spoken in Portugal or in Brazil. However, while there exists a certain number of idiomatic particularities in everyday Portuguese, as spoken by Angolans, it remains to be seen whether or not the Angolan government comes to the conclusion that these particularities constitute a configuration that justifies the claim to be a new language variant.

Foreign [[missionary|missionaries]] were very active prior to independence in 1975, although since the beginning of the anti-colonial fight in 1961 the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro-independence sentiments.

As a consequence, both countries share cultural aspects: language ([[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]) and main religion (Roman Catholic Christianity). The ''[[Substratum|substrate]]'' of Angolan culture is African, mostly [[Bantu people|Bantu]], while [[culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]] has been imported. The diverse ethnic communities  – the [[Ovimbundu]], [[Northern Mbundu people|Ambundu]], [[Bakongo]], [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]], [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] and other peoples – maintain to varying degrees their own cultural traits, traditions and languages, but in the cities, where slightly more than half of the population now lives, a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times – in [[Luanda]] since its foundation in the 16th century. In this urban culture, the Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant. An African influence is evident in music and dance, and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken, but is almost disappearing from the vocabulary. This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature, especially in the works of [[Pepetela]] and [[Ana Paula Ribeiro Tavares]].
