The '''Apache HTTP Server''', colloquially called '''Apache''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|æ|tʃ|iː}} {{Respell|ə|PA|chee}}), is the world's most used [[web server]] software. Originally based on the [[NCSA HTTPd]] server, development of Apache began in early 1995 after work on the NCSA code stalled. Apache played a key role in the initial growth of the [[World Wide Web]],<ref>[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html Netcraft Market Share] for Top Servers Across All Domains August 1995 - today (monthly updated)</ref> quickly overtaking NCSA HTTPd as the dominant [[HTTP]] server, and has remained most popular since April 1996. In 2009, it became the first web server software to serve more than 100 million [[website]]s.<ref name="100millionsites">{{Cite web|url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/02/18/february_2009_web_server_survey.html|title=February 2009 Web Server Survey|publisher=[[Netcraft]]|accessdate=2009-03-29|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090226092501/http://news.netcraft.com//archives//2009//02//18//february_2009_web_server_survey.html|archivedate= 26 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref>

Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the [[Apache Software Foundation]]. Most commonly used on a [[Unix-like]] system (usually [[Linux]]),<ref>[https://secure1.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.200907/apacheos.html OS/GNU+Linux Distributions using Apache<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the software is available for a wide variety of [[operating system]]s, besides [[Unix]] and GNU+Linux, including [[eComStation]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[NetWare]], [[OpenVMS]], [[OS/2]], and [[Transaction Processing Facility|TPF]]. Released under the [[Apache License]], Apache is [[free and open-source software]].

{{As of|2013|06}}, Apache was estimated to serve 54.2% of all active websites and 53.3% of the top servers across all domains.<ref name="netcraft">{{Cite web|title=June 2013 Web Server Survey|url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/06/06/june-2013-web-server-survey-3.html|publisher=[[Netcraft]]|accessdate=2013-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/web_server/all|title=Usage Statistics and Market Share of Web Servers for Websites, September 2015|work=w3techs.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntchosting.com/apache-web-server.html|title=Information about the Apache Web Server|work=ntchosting.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.knownhost.com/iis-vs-apache-why-apache-has-held-its-1-spot/|title=IIS vs. Apache: Why Apache Has Held its #1 Spot|work=knownhost.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.modulehosting.com/apache.html Apache Server Definition.

==Name==
According to the FAQ in the Apache project website, the name Apache was chosen out of respect to the Native American tribe [[Apache]] and their superior skills in warfare and strategy. The name was widely believed to be a pun on 'A Patchy Server' (since it was a set of [[Patch (computing)|software patches]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/FAQ#Why_the_name_.22Apache.22.3F|title = Why the name 'Apache'?|work = HTTPd Frequently Asked Questions }}</ref> Official documentation used to give this explanation of the name,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://web.archive.org/web/19970415054031/www.apache.org/info.html|title = Information on the Apache HTTP Server Project|date = 1997-04-15 }}</ref> but in a 2000 interview, [[Brian Behlendorf]], one of the creators of Apache, set the record straight:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux-mag.com/id/472/|title=Apache Power|work=Linux Magazine}}</ref>

{{Quote
|The name literally came out of the blue. I wish I could say that it was something fantastic, but it was out of the blue. I put it on a page and then a few months later when this project started, I pointed people to this page and said: "Hey, what do you think of that idea?" ... Someone said they liked the name and that it was a really good pun. And I was like, "A pun? What do you mean?" He said, "Well, we're building a server out of a bunch of software patches, right? So it's a patchy Web server." I went, "Oh, all right." ... When I thought of the name, no. It just sort of connotated: "Take no prisoners. Be kind of aggressive and kick some ass."
}}

When Apache is running, its process name is sometimes <tt>httpd</tt>, which is short for "HTTP [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]."

==Features==
Apache supports a variety of features, many implemented as [[Compiler|compiled]] [[Modular programming|modules]] which extend the core functionality. These can range from server-side programming language support to authentication schemes. Some common language interfaces support <!-- ATTENTION AUTO-EDITORS, THESE UNDERSCORES ARE INTENTIONAL -->[[mod perl|Perl]], [[mod python|Python]], [[Tcl]], and [[PHP]]. Popular authentication modules include mod_access, mod_auth, mod_digest, and mod_auth_digest, the successor to mod_digest. A sample of other features include [[Secure Sockets Layer]] and [[Transport Layer Security]] support ([[mod_ssl]]), a [[proxy server|proxy]] module ([[mod_proxy]]), a [[URL rewriting|URL rewriter]] (mod_rewrite), custom log files (mod_log_config), and filtering support (mod_include and mod_ext_filter).

Popular compression methods on Apache include the external extension module, mod_gzip<!-- redirects to here -->, implemented to help with reduction of the size (weight) of Web pages served over [[HTTP]]. [[ModSecurity]] is an open source intrusion detection and prevention engine for Web applications. Apache logs can be analyzed through a Web browser using free scripts, such as [[AWStats]]/[[W3Perl]] or [[Visitors (program)|Visitors]].

[[Virtual hosting]] allows one Apache installation to serve many different Web sites. For example, one machine with one Apache installation could simultaneously serve www.example.com, www.example.org, test47.test-server.example.edu, etc.

Apache features configurable error messages, [[Database management system|DBMS]]-based authentication databases, and [[content negotiation]]. It is also supported by several [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs).

It supports password authentication and [[digital certificate]] authentication. Because the source code is freely available, anyone can adapt the server for specific needs, and there is a large public library of Apache add-ons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/Apache_Web_server.html|title=What is Apache Web Server? Webopedia|work=webopedia.com}}</ref>

==Performance==
Instead of implementing a single architecture, Apache provides a variety of MultiProcessing Modules (MPMs), which allow Apache to run in a process-based, hybrid (process and thread) or event-hybrid mode, to better match the demands of each particular infrastructure. This implies that the choice of correct MPM and the correct configuration is important. Where compromises in performance need to be made, the design of Apache is to reduce latency and increase [[throughput]], relative to simply handling more requests, thus ensuring consistent and reliable processing of requests within reasonable time-frames.

For delivery of static pages, Apache 2.2 series was considered significantly slower than [[nginx]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbonvin.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/apache-vs-nginx-vs-varnish-vs-gwan/|title=Serving static files: a comparison between Apache, Nginx, Varnish and G-WAN|work=Spoot!}}</ref> To address this issue, the Apache version considered by the Apache Foundation as providing high-performance is the Event MPM, which mixes the use of several processes and several threads per process in an asynchronous event-based loop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/worker.html|title=worker - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.2|work=apache.org}}</ref> This architecture, and the way it was implemented in the Apache 2.4 series, provides for performance equivalent or slightly better than event-based web servers, as is claimed by the president of the Apache Foundation, [[Jim Jagielski]].<ref>[http://people.apache.org/~jim/presos/ACNA11/Apache_httpd_cloud.pdf Apache httpd 2.4]</ref> However, some independent benchmarks show that it still is half as fast as nginx.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zhuzhaoyuan.com/2012/02/apache-24-faster-than-nginx/|title=Joshua Zhu’s Blog|work=zhuzhaoyuan.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eschrade.com/page/performance-of-apache-2-4-with-the-event-mpm-compared-to-nginx/|title=Performance of Apache 2.4 with the event MPM compared to Nginx|work=eschrade.com}}</ref>

==Licensing==
The Apache HTTP Server [[codebase]] was relicensed to the [[Apache License|Apache 2.0 License]] (from the previous 1.1 license) in January 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html|title=Apache License, Version 2.0|publisher=The Apache Software Foundation|date=January 2004|accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref> and Apache HTTP Server 1.3.31 and 2.0.49 were the first [[Software release life cycle|releases]] using the new license.<ref>{{Cite newsgroup|url=|title=FYI: Apache HTTP Server 2.0.49 Released|last=Burton|first=Richard Antony|newsgroup=alt.apache.configuration|accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref>

The [[OpenBSD]] project did not like the change and continued the use of pre-2.0 Apache versions, effectively forking Apache 1.3.x for its purposes.<ref>{{Cite mailing list|url=http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=107714762916291|title=The new apache license|last=de Raadt|first=Theo|authorlink=Theo de Raadt|mailinglist=openbsd-misc|date=18 February 2004|accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html|title=Copyright Policy|publisher=OpenBSD|accessdate=2013-05-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ports.su/www/apache-httpd-openbsd |title=apache-httpd-openbsd-1.3.20140502p2 – OpenBSD improved and secured version of Apache 1.3 |website=OpenBSD ports |date=|accessdate=2014-12-28}}</ref> They initially replaced it with [[Nginx]], and soon after made their own replacement, OpenBSD Httpd, based on the relayd project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade52.html#nginx|title=OpenBSD Upgrade Guide: 5.1 to 5.2|work=openbsd.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140314080734|date=2014-03-14|title= Heads Up: Apache Removed from Base |website=[[OpenBSD Journal]]|editor=jj}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade56.html#ToPorts|title=OpenBSD Upgrade Guide: 5.5 to 5.6|work=openbsd.org}}</ref>
