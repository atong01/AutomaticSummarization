'''Ephesus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|f|ə|s|ə|s}};<ref name=Olausson2006 /> {{lang-el|Ἔφεσος}} ''Ephesos''; {{lang-tr|Efes}}; ultimately from [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''Apasa'') was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city<ref name=Gagarin2010 /><ref name=Ramirez-Faria2007 /> on the coast of [[Ionia]], three kilometres southwest of present-day [[Selçuk]] in [[İzmir Province]], [[Turkey]]. It was built in the 10th century BC on the site of the former [[Arzawa]]n capital<ref name=BritishMuseum /><ref name=SteadmanMcMahon2011 /> by [[Attica|Attic]] and [[Ionians|Ionian]] Greek colonists. During the [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] era it was one of the twelve cities of the [[Ionian League]]. The city flourished after it came under the control of the [[Roman Republic]] in 129 BC. According to estimates, Ephesus had a population of 33,600 to 56,000 people in the Roman period, making it the third largest city of Roman [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] after [[Sardis]] and [[Alexandria Troas]].<ref name=hans252to257 />

The city was famed for the [[Temple of Artemis]] (completed around 550&nbsp;BC), one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. In 268 AD, the Temple was destroyed or damaged in a raid by the [[Goths]].<ref>''268'': Herwig Wolfram, Thomas J.

The [[ruins]] of Ephesus are a favourite international and local tourist attraction, partly owing to their easy access from [[Adnan Menderes Airport]].

== History ==

=== Neolithic age ===
The area surrounding Ephesus was already inhabited during the [[Neolithic Age]] (about 6000&nbsp;BC), as was revealed by excavations at the nearby ''höyük'' (artificial mounds known as [[tell]]s) of [[Arvalya]] and [[Cukurici]].<ref>[VIII. Muze Kurtrma Kazilari Semineri ] ''Adil Evren – Cengiz Icten, pp 111–133'' 1997</ref><ref>[Arkeoloji ve Sanat Dergisi] – [[Çukuriçi Höyük]] sayi 92 ] ''Adil Evren'' 1998</ref>

=== Bronze Age ===

Excavations in recent years have unearthed settlements from the early [[Bronze Age]] at [[Ayasuluk Hill]]. According to [[Hittites|Hittite]] sources, the capital of the Kingdom of [[Arzawa]] (another independent state in Western and Southern Anatolia/Asia Minor<ref name="Akurgal">{{cite book| author = [[Ekrem Akurgal|Akurgal, Ekrem]]|title = The Hattian and Hittite Civilizations| page = 111| publisher = Publications of the Republic of Turkey; Ministry of Culture| year = 2001| isbn = 975-17-2756-1}}</ref>) was Apasa (or ''Abasa''). Some scholars suggest that this is the later Greek Ephesus.<ref name=BritishMuseum/><ref>{{cite book|last=Müller-Luckner|first=herausgegeben von Kurt Raaflaub unter Mitarbeit von Elisabeth|title=Anfänge politischen Denkens in der Antike : die nahöstlichen Kulturen und die Griechen|year=1993|publisher=Oldenbourg|location=München|isbn=9783486559934|page=117|url=http://books.google.gr/books?id=NySxd--wwYwC&pg=PA117&dq=apasa+possible+ephesus+habesos&hl=el&sa=X&ei=7CpbUpe_OIax4wS8xIHgBQ&ved=0CEUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=apasa%20possible%20ephesus%20habesos&f=false|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Waelkens|first=ed. by M.|title=Sagalassos|year=2000|publisher=Leuven Univ.

Özgünel">{{cite journal | author=Coskun Özgünel| title=Mykenische Keramik in Anatolien| journal=Asia Minor Studien| year=1996| volume=23}}</ref> This was the period of the [[Mycenaean Expansion]] when the ''[[Achaioi]]'' (as they were called by [[Homer]]) settled in [[Asia Minor]] during the 14th and 13th centuries BC. Scholars believe that Ephesus was founded on the settlement of [[Apasa]] (or ''Abasa''), a Bronze Age city noted in 14th century BC [[Hittite language|Hittite]] sources as being under the rule of the  [[Ahhiyawans]], most probably the name of the Achaeans used in Hittite sources.

===Period of Greek migrations===

[[File:Ac artemisephesus.jpg|thumb|Site of the [[Temple of Artemis]] in the town of [[Selçuk]], near Ephesus.]]

Ephesus was founded as an Attic-Ionian colony in the 10th century BC on the Ayasuluk Hill, three kilometers ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from the centre of ancient Ephesus (as attested by excavations at the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] castle during the 1990s). The mythical founder of the city was a prince of [[Athens]] named [[Androklos]], who had to leave his country after the death of his father, King Kadros. According to the legend, he founded Ephesus on the place where the oracle of [[Delphi]] became reality ("A fish and a boar will show you the way"). Androklos drove away most of the native [[Caria]]n and [[Leleges|Lelegian]] inhabitants of the city and united his people with the remainder. He was a successful warrior, and as a king he was able to join the twelve cities of [[Ionia]] together into the [[Ionian League]]. During his reign the city began to prosper. He died in a battle against the Carians when he came to the aid of [[Priene]], another city of the Ionian League.<ref name="Pausanias">{{cite book | title=Description of Greece,| last=Pausanias| year=1965| pages=7.2.8–9| publisher=Loeb Classical Library| location=New York}}</ref> Androklos and his dog are depicted on the Hadrian temple frieze, dating from the 2nd century. Later, Greek historians such as [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [[Strabo]] and [[Herodotos]] and the poet Kallinos reassigned the city's mythological foundation to Ephos, queen of the [[Amazons]].

The Greek goddess [[Artemis]] and the great Anatolian goddess [[Kybele]] were identified together as ''Artemis of Ephesus''. The many-breasted "Lady of Ephesus", identified with Artemis, was venerated in the [[Temple of Artemis]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]] and the largest building of the ancient world according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (4.31.8). Pausanias mentions that the temple was built by Ephesus, son of the river god [[Caystrus]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1133.html |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology |publisher=Ancientlibrary.com |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> before the arrival of the Ionians. Of this structure, scarcely a trace remains.

=== Archaic period ===
[[File:Ephesus street scene.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Street scene at the archeological excavations at Ephesus.]]
About 650&nbsp;BC, Ephesus was attacked by the [[Cimmerians]] who razed the city, including the temple of Artemis. After the Cimmerians had been driven away, the city was ruled by a series of tyrants. Following a revolt by the people, Ephesus was ruled by a council. The city prospered again under a new rule, producing a number of important historical figures such as the [[elegiac]] poet [[Callinus]] <ref name="Callinus">{{cite book | title=Greek Lyric Poetry| url=http://books.google.com/?id=cABi5Pt7FgQC&pg=PR7&dq=Ephesus++%22poetess%22| last=translation by M.L.

[[File:Ephesos 620-600 BC.jpg|right|thumb|[[Electrum]] coin from Ephesus, 620-600 BC. Obverse: Forepart of stag. Reverse: Square incuse punch.]]
About 560&nbsp;BC, Ephesus was conquered by the [[Lydians]] under king [[Croesus]], who, though a harsh ruler, treated the inhabitants with respect and even became the main contributor to the reconstruction of the temple of Artemis.<ref>{{cite book

Croesus made the populations of the different settlements around Ephesus regroup (''[[synoikismos]]'') in the vicinity of the Temple of Artemis, enlarging the city.

Later in the same century, the Lydians under Croesus invaded Persia. The Ionians refused a peace offer from [[Cyrus the Great]], siding with the Lydians instead. After the Persians defeated Croesus, the Ionians offered to make peace, but Cyrus insisted that they surrender and become part of the empire.<ref>Herodotus i. 141</ref> They were defeated by the Persian army commander [[Harpagos]] in 547&nbsp;BC. The Persians then incorporated the Greek cities of Asia Minor into the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Those cities were then ruled by [[satrap]]s.

Ephesus has intrigued archaeologists because for the Archaic Period there is no definite location for the settlement. There are numerous sites to suggest the movement of a settlement between the Bronze Age and the Roman period, but the silting up of the natural harbours as well as the movement of the Kayster River meant that the location never remained the same.

=== Classical period ===

Ephesus continued to prosper, but when taxes were raised under [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses II]] and [[Darius the Great of Persia|Darius]], the Ephesians participated in the [[Ionian Revolt]] against Persian rule in the [[Battle of Ephesus (498&nbsp;BC)]], an event which instigated the [[Greco-Persian wars]]. In 479&nbsp;BC, the Ionians, together with [[Athens]], were able to oust the Persians from the shores of Asia Minor. In 478&nbsp;BC, the Ionian cities with Athens entered into the [[Delian League]] against the Persians. Ephesus did not contribute ships but gave financial support.

During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Ephesus was first allied to Athens{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} but in a later phase, called the Decelean War, or the Ionian War, sided with Sparta, which also had received the support of the Persians. As a result, rule over the cities of Ionia was ceded again to Persia.

These wars did not greatly affect daily life in Ephesus. The Ephesians were surprisingly modern in their social relations:{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} they allowed strangers to integrate; education was valued; through the cult of Artemis, the city became a bastion of women's rights – Ephesus even had female artists. In later times, [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned having seen at Ephesus a representation of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] by Timarata, the daughter of a painter.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 356&nbsp;BC the temple of Artemis was burnt down, according to legend, by a lunatic called [[Herostratus]]. The inhabitants of Ephesus at once set about restoring the temple and even planned a larger and grander one than the original.

=== Hellenistic period ===

[[File:Karte Ephesos MKL1888.png|thumb|left|Historical map of Ephesus, from ''[[Meyers Konversationslexikon]]'', 1888]]

When [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Persian forces at the [[Battle of Granicus]] in 334&nbsp;BC, the Greek cities of Asia Minor were liberated. The pro-Persian tyrant Syrpax and his family were stoned to death, and Alexander was greeted warmly when he entered Ephesus in triumph. When Alexander saw that the temple of Artemis was not yet finished, he proposed to finance it and have his name inscribed on the front. But the inhabitants of Ephesus demurred, claiming that it was not fitting for one god to build a temple to another. After Alexander's death in 323&nbsp;BC, Ephesus in 290&nbsp;BC came under the rule of one of Alexander's generals, [[Lysimachus]].

As the river [[Cayster]] (Grk. name Κάϋστρος) silted up the harbor, the resulting marshes caused malaria and many deaths among the inhabitants. The people of Ephesus were forced to move to a new settlement two kilometres ({{convert|2|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) further on, when the king flooded the old city by blocking the sewers.<ref name="Strabo">{{cite book | title=Geography (volume 1–7)| last=Strabo| date=1923–1932| pages=14.1.21| publisher=Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press| location=Cambridge}}</ref> This settlement was officially called '''Arsinoea''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀρσινόεια}}<ref>Edwyn Robert Bevan, ''The House of Seleucus'', Vol. 1 (E. Arnold, 1902), p. 119.</ref> or Ἀρσινοΐα<ref>Wilhelm Pape, ''Wörterbuch der griechischen Eigennamen'', Vol. 3 (Braunschweig, 1870), p. 145.</ref>) after the king's second wife, [[Arsinoe II of Egypt]]. After [[Lysimachus]] had destroyed the nearby cities of [[Lebedos]] and [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] in 292&nbsp;BC, he relocated their inhabitants to the new city.

Ephesus revolted after the treacherous death of [[Agathocles (son of Lysimachus)|Agathocles]], giving the Hellenistic king of Syria and Mesopotamia [[Seleucus I Nicator]] an opportunity for removing and killing Lysimachus, his last rival, at the [[Battle of Corupedium]] in 281&nbsp;BC. After the death of Lysimachus the town again was named Ephesus.

Thus Ephesus became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. After the murder of king [[Antiochus II Theos]] and his Egyptian wife, pharaoh [[Ptolemy III]] invaded the Seleucid Empire and the Egyptian fleet swept the coast of Asia Minor. Ephesus came under Egyptian rule between 263 and 197&nbsp;BC.

When the Seleucid king [[Antiochus III the Great]] tried to regain the Greek cities of Asia Minor, he came into conflict with Rome. After a series of battles, he was defeated by [[Scipio Asiaticus]] at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] in 190&nbsp;BC. As a result, Ephesus came under the rule of the Attalid king of [[Pergamon]] [[Eumenes II]] (197–133&nbsp;BC). When his grandson [[Attalus III]] died without male children of his own, he left his kingdom to the [[Roman Republic]].

=== Roman period ===

Ephesus, a territory that was traditionally Greek to the core,<ref name=" Makowiecka, Elżbieta 1978 62 ">{{cite book|author= Makowiecka, Elżbieta |title= The origin and evolution of architectural form of Roman library |publisher= Wydaw-a UW |year= 1978 |page=62 |oclc= 5099783 |quote= It was erected in Ephesus, in Asia Minor, in territory that was traditionally Greek to the core. That is why Celsus’ library in Ephesus represents very important element in tracing the development of Roman libraries. }}</ref> became a subject of the [[Roman Republic]]. The city felt the Roman influence at once. Taxes rose considerably, and the treasures of the city were systematically plundered. In 88&nbsp;BC Ephesus welcomed [[Archelaus (general)|Archelaus]], a general of [[Mithradates VI of Pontus|Mithridates the Great]], king of [[Pontus]], when he conquered Asia (the Roman name for western Asia Minor). This led to the [[Asiatic Vespers]], the slaughter of 80,000 Roman citizens in Asia, or any person who spoke with a Latin accent. Many had lived in Ephesus. But when they saw how badly the people of [[Chios]] had been treated by Zenobius, a general of Mithridates, they refused entry to his army. Zenobius was invited into the city to visit [[Philopoemen]], the father of [[Monime]], the favorite wife of Mithridates, and the overseer of Ephesus. As the people expected nothing good of him, they threw him into prison and murdered him. Mithridates took revenge and inflicted terrible punishments. However, the Greek cities were given freedom and several substantial rights. Ephesus became, for a short time, self-governing. When Mithridates was defeated in the [[First Mithridatic War]] by the Roman consul [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], Ephesus came back under Roman rule in 86&nbsp;BC. Sulla imposed a huge indemnity, along with five years of back taxes, which left Asian cities heavily in debt for a long time to come.<ref name="Mithridatic War">{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_mithridatic_10.html|title=History of Rome: The Mithridatic Wars §§46–50|accessdate=2007-10-02|author=Appian of Alexandria (c.95&nbsp;AD-c.165&nbsp;AD)}}</ref>

When [[Augustus]] became emperor in 27&nbsp;BC, he made Ephesus the capital of [[Asia (Roman province)|proconsular Asia]] (which covered western Asia Minor) instead of Pergamum. Ephesus then entered an era of prosperity, becoming both the seat of the governor and a major center of commerce. According to Strabo, it was second in importance and size only to Rome.<ref>Strabo . Geography (volume 1–7) 14.1.24. Cambridge: Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press</ref>

Until recently the population of Ephesus in Roman times was estimated to number up to 225,000 people.<ref name=pric18 /><ref name=hans253 /> More recent scholarship regards these estimates as unrealistic. Such a large estimate would require population densities only possible in modern times, or extensive settlement outside the city walls. This would have been impossible at Ephesus because of the mountain ranges, coastline and quarries which surrounded the city.<ref name=hans258 />

[[File:Efes.ruins.jpg|thumb|left|Artist Simon Kozhin Ephesus. Ruins Temple of [[Hadrian]].]]

The wall of Lysimachus has been estimated to enclose an area of {{convert|415|ha}}. Not all of this area was inhabited due to public buildings and spaces in the centre and the steep slope of the Bülbül Dağı mountain, which was enclosed by the wall. [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]] uses an estimate of {{convert|345|ha}} for the inhabited land. Using an average population density of 400 to 500 per hectare, he calculates that Ephesus would have had a population between 138,000 and 172,500, with a preference for the higher figure.<ref name=conn /> J. W. Hanson estimates the inhabited space to be smaller at {{convert|224|ha}}. He argues that population densities of 150 or 250 people per hectare are more realistic, which gives a range of 33,600 to 56,000 inhabitants. Even with these much lower population estimates, Ephesus was one of the largest cities of Roman Asia Minor, ranking it as the largest city after [[Sardis]] and [[Alexandria Troas]].<ref name=hans252to257 />

The city was famed for the [[Temple of Artemis]] ([[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Turkey/_Periods/Greek/_Texts/LETGKB/Ephesus*.html |title=accessed September 14, 2007 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> the [[Library of Celsus]], and a theater which was capable of holding 25,000 spectators.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ring|first=Trudy|author2=Salkin, Robert|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=London|year=1995|page=217|chapter=Ephesus|isbn=978-1-884964-02-2}}</ref> This open-air theatre was used initially for drama, but during later Roman times gladiatorial combats were also held on its stage; the first archaeological evidence of a gladiator graveyard was found in May 2007.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kupper |first=Monika |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6614479.stm |title=Gladiators' graveyard discovered |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> Ephesus also had several major [[bath complexes]], built at various times while the city was under Roman rule. The city had one of the most advanced [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] systems in the ancient world, with multiple aqueducts of various sizes to supply different areas of the city, including four major aqueducts. They fed a number of water mills, one of which has been identified as a [[sawmill]] for [[marble]].

The city and temple were destroyed by the [[Goths]] in 263&nbsp;AD. This marked the decline of the city's splendour.

=== Byzantine era (395–1308) ===

The emperor [[Constantine I]] rebuilt much of the city and erected a new public bath. Ephesus remained the most important city of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in Asia after [[Constantinople]] in the 5th and 6th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Emperor [[Arcadius|Flavius Arcadius]] raised the level of the street between the theatre and the harbour. The basilica of St. John was built during the reign of emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century.

The city was partially destroyed by an earthquake in 614.

The importance of the city as a commercial centre declined as the harbour was slowly silted up by the river (today, Küçük Menderes) despite repeated dredging during the city's history.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tore |last=Kjeilen |url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/ephesus.htm |title=accessed September 24, 2007 |publisher=Lexicorient.com |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> (Today, the harbour is 5&nbsp;kilometres inland). The loss of its harbour caused Ephesus to lose its access to the [[Aegean Sea]], which was important for trade. People started leaving the lowland of the city for the surrounding hills. The ruins of the temples were used as building blocks for new homes. Marble sculptures were ground to powder to make lime for plaster.

Sackings by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Arabs]] first in the year 654–655 by [[caliph]] [[Muawiyah I]], and later in 700 and 716 hastened the decline further.

When the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] conquered Ephesus in 1090,<ref>Foss, Clive (1979) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=i6Q8AAAAIAAJ&dq=Ephesus+after+antiquity:+a+late+antique,+Byzantine,+and+Turkish+city Ephesus after antiquity: a late antique, Byzantine, and Turkish city]'', Cambridge University Press, p. 121.<br>Gökovalı, Şadan; Altan Erguvan (1982) ''Ephesus'', Ticaret Matbaacılık, p.7.</ref> it was a small village. The Byzantines resumed control in 1097 and changed the name of the town to Hagios Theologos. They kept control of the region until 1308. Crusaders passing through were surprised that there was only a small village, called Ayasalouk, where they had expected a bustling city with a large seaport. Even the temple of Artemis was completely forgotten by the local population. The Crusaders of the [[Second Crusade]] [[Battle of Ephesus (1147)|fought]] the Seljuks just outside the town in December 1147.

=== Turkish era ===
[[File:İsa Bey Camii.jpg|right|thumb|The [[İsa Bey Mosque]] constructed in 1374–75, is one of the oldest and most impressive works of architectural art remaining from the [[Anatolian beyliks]].]]

The town surrendered, on October 24, 1304, to Sasa Bey, a Turkish warlord of the [[Menteşe (beylik)|Menteşoğulları]] principality. Nevertheless, contrary to the terms of the surrender the Turks pillaged the church of Saint John and deported most of the local population to [[Thyrea, Greece]] when a revolt seemed probable. During these events many of the remaining inhabitants were massacred.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foss|first=Clive|title=Ephesus After Antiquity|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press,|page=144|url=http://books.google.gr/books?id=i6Q8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA144&dq=turks+magnesia+byzantium+massacre&hl=el&sa=X&ei=F0X5UsqdOaP_ywO_loAI&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=turks%20magnesia%20byzantium%20massacre&f=false}}</ref>

Shortly afterwards, Ephesus was ceded to the [[Aydinids|Aydinid]] principality that stationed a powerful navy in the harbour of [[Selçuk|Ayasuluğ]] (the present-day [[Selçuk]], next to Ephesus). Ayasoluk became an important harbour, from which the navy organised raids to the surrounding regions.

The town knew again a short period of prosperity during the 14th century under these new [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] rulers. They added important architectural works such as the [[İsa Bey Mosque]], caravansaries and [[Turkish bath]]houses (hamam).

Ephesians were incorporated as vassals into the [[Ottoman Empire]] for the first time in 1390. The Central Asian warlord [[Tamerlane]] defeated the Ottomans in Anatolia in 1402, and the Ottoman sultan [[Bayezid I]] died in captivity. The region was restored to the [[Anatolian beyliks]]. After a period of unrest, the region was again incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1425.

Ephesus was completely abandoned by the 15th century. Nearby Ayasuluğ was renamed Selçuk in 1914.

Ephesus was an important centre for [[Early Christianity]] from the AD 50s. From AD 52–54, the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] lived in Ephesus, working with the congregation and apparently organizing missionary activity into the hinterlands.<ref>"Paul, St." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005</ref> Initially, according to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], Paul attended the [[Jewish synagogue]] in Ephesus, but after three months he became frustrated with the stubbornness or hardness of heart of some of the Jews, and moved his base to the school of [[List of minor biblical figures, L–Z#Tyrannus|Tyrannus]] ({{Bibleref|Acts|19:9}}). The Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary reminds readers that the unbelief of "some" ({{lang-gr|τινες}}) implies that "others, probably a large number, believed" <ref>Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on Acts 19 http://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/19.htm accessed 5 october 2015</ref> and therefore there must have been a community of [[Jewish Christians]] in Ephesus. Paul introduced about twelve men to the '[[baptism with the Holy Spirit]]' who had previously only experienced the [[baptism]] of [[John the Baptist]] ({{Bibleref|Acts|19:1-7}}), and later became embroiled in a dispute with some artisans whose livelihood depended on selling statuettes of Artemis ({{lang-la|Diana}}) in the Temple of Artemis ({{Bibleref2|Acts|19:23-41|9|Acts 19:23–41}}). Between 53 and 57&nbsp;AD Paul wrote the letter [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] from Ephesus (possibly from the 'Paul tower' near the harbour, where he was imprisoned for a short time). Later, Paul wrote the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] while he was in prison in Rome (around 62&nbsp;AD).

Roman Asia was associated with [[John the Apostle|John]],<ref name="CC">[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]]. Caesar and Christ. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972</ref> one of the chief apostles, and the Gospel of John might have been written in Ephesus, ''c'' 90–100.<ref name="Harris Gospels">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. "The Gospels" p. 266-268</ref> Ephesus was one of the [[Seven churches of the Book of Revelation|seven cities]] addressed in the Book of Revelation ({{bibleref2|Revelation|2:1-7|KJV|Revelation 2:1–7}}), indicating that the church at Ephesus was strong.

Two decades later, the church at Ephesus was still important enough to be addressed by a letter written by Bishop [[Ignatius of Antioch]] to the Ephesians in the early 2nd century AD, that begins with, "Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church which is at Ephesus, in Asia, deservedly most happy, being blessed in the greatness and fullness of God the Father, and predestinated before the beginning of time, that it should be always for an enduring and unchangeable glory" (''Letter to the Ephesians''). The church at Ephesus had given their support for Ignatius, who was taken to Rome for execution.

A legend, which was first mentioned by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in the 4th century AD, purported that Mary may have spent the last years of her life in Ephesus. The Ephesians derived the argument from John's presence in the city, and Jesus’ instructions to John to take care of Mary after his death. Epiphanius, however, was keen to point out that, while the Bible says John was leaving for Asia, it does not say specifically that Mary went with him. He later stated that she was buried in Jerusalem.<ref>Vasiliki Limberis, 'The Council of Ephesos: The Demise of the See of Ephesos and the Rise of the Cult of the Theotokos' in Helmut Koester, Ephesos: Metropolis of Asia (2004), 327.</ref> Since the 19th century, The [[House of the Virgin Mary]], about {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Selçuk, has been considered to have been the last home of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] in the Roman Catholic tradition, based on the visions of Sister [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]]. It is a popular place of Catholic pilgrimage which has been visited by three recent popes.

The [[Church of Mary]] near the harbour of Ephesus was the setting for the [[First Council of Ephesus|Third Ecumenical Council]] in 431, which resulted in the condemnation of [[Nestorius]]. A [[Second Council of Ephesus]] was held in 449, but its controversial acts were never approved by the Catholics. It came to be called the Robber Council of Ephesus or Robber Synod of Latrocinium by its opponents.

Ephesus contains the largest collection of Roman ruins in the eastern Mediterranean. Only an estimated 15% has been excavated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The ruins that are visible give some idea of the city's original splendour, and the names associated with the ruins are evocative of its former life. The theatre dominates the view down Harbour Street, which leads to the silted-up harbour.

Designed with an exaggerated entrance — so as to enhance its perceived size, speculate many historians — the building faces east so that the reading rooms could make best use of the morning light.

A part of the site, '''[[Basilica of St. John]]''', was built in the 6th century AD, under emperor [[Justinian I]], over the supposed site of the apostle's tomb. It is now surrounded by Selçuk.

The '''[[Temple of Artemis]]''', one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], is represented only by one inconspicuous column, revealed during an archaeological excavation by the [[British Museum]] in the 1870s. Some fragments of the [[frieze]] (which are insufficient to suggest the form of the original) and other small finds were removed – some to London and some to the Archaeological Museum, Istanbul.

The '''Odeon''' was a small roofed theater<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.iexplore.com/planning/journalEntryActivity.asp?JournalID=7393&EntryID=13307&n=The+Theater+and+The+Odeum |title=accessed September 24, 2007 |publisher=Community.iexplore.com |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> constructed by Vedius Antonius and his wife around 150&nbsp;AD. It was a small salon for plays and concerts, seating about 1,500 people. There were 22 stairs in the theatre. The upper part of the theatre was decorated with red granite pillars in the Corinthian style. The entrances were at both sides of the stage and reached by a few steps.<ref name="Naci">Keskin, Naci.

The '''Temple of Hadrian''' dates from the 2nd century but underwent repairs in the 4th century and has been reerected from the surviving architectural fragments.

The '''[[Temple of the Sebastoi]]''' (sometimes called the '''Temple of [[Domitian]]'''), dedicated to the [[Flavian dynasty]], was one of the largest temples in the city. It was erected on a [[pseudodipteral]] plan with 8 × 13 columns. The temple and its statue are some of the few remains connected with [[Domitian]].<ref name="Revak"/>

At an estimated 24,000 [[seating capacity]], the 'Theatre' is believed to be the largest outdoor theatre in the ancient world.

The '''Tomb/Fountain of Pollio''' was erected in 97&nbsp;AD in honour of C. Sextilius Pollio, who constructed the Marnas aqueduct, by Offilius Proculus.

== Seven sleepers ==

Ephesus is believed to be the city of the [[Seven Sleepers]]. The story of the Seven Sleepers, who are considered saints by Catholics and [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] and whose story is also mentioned in the [[Qur'an]],<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Mahony|first=Anthony|editor=[[Craig Bartholomew|Bartholomew, Craig G]]|title=Explorations in a Christian Theology of Pilgrimage|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, England|isbn=0-7546-0856-5|pages=135–6|chapter=Louis Massignon, The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus}}</ref> tells that they were persecuted because of their belief in God and that they slept in a cave near Ephesus for centuries.

== Archaeology ==

The history of archaeological research in Ephesus stretches back to 1863, when British architect [[John Turtle Wood]], sponsored by the [[British Museum]], began to search for the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemision]]. In 1869 he discovered the pavement of the temple, but since further expected discoveries were not made the excavations stopped in 1874. In 1895 German archaeologist [[Otto Benndorf]], financed by a 10,000 guilder donation made by Austrian Karl Mautner Ritter von Markhof, resumed excavations. In 1898 Benndorf founded the [[Austrian Archaeological Institute]], which plays a leading role in Ephesus today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oeai.at/eng/ausland/geschichte.html|title=Ephesos – An Ancient Metropolis: Exploration and History|publisher=Austrian Archaeological Institute|date=October 2008|accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref>

Finds from the site are exhibited notably in the [[Ephesos Museum]] in Vienna, the [[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]] in Selçuk and in the British Museum.
