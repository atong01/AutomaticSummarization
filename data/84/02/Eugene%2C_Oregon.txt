'''Eugene''' ({{IPAc-en|juː|ˈ|dʒ|iː|n}} {{respell|ew|JEEN|'}}) is a city of the Pacific Northwest located in the [[United States|U.S.]] [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Oregon]]. It is the second largest city in the state (after [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]) and the [[county seat]] of [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane County]]. It is located at the south end of the [[Willamette Valley]], near the confluence of the [[McKenzie River (Oregon)|McKenzie]] and [[Willamette River|Willamette]] rivers, about {{convert|50|mi|km}} east of the [[Oregon Coast]].

According to the Census Bureau's [[American Community Survey]], Eugene's population grew by 1,391 people between 2013 and 2014, a 0.8 percent growth rate. The survey put Eugene's 2014 population estimate at 160,552.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://registerguard.com/rg/news/local/33520286-75/u.s.-census-bureau-eugene-population-passed-160000-last-year.csp|title=U.S. Census Bureau: Eugene population passed 160,000 last year|publisher=The Register Guard|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}</ref> As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

Eugene is home to the [[University of Oregon]]. The city is also noted for its natural beauty, recreational opportunities (especially [[Cycling|bicycling]], [[running]]/[[jogging]], [[rafting]], [[kayak]]ing), and focus on the arts. Eugene's slogan is "A Great City for the Arts and Outdoors". It is also referred to as the "Emerald City", and as "Track Town, USA".<ref>Caple, Jim (July 4, 2008).

==History==
[[File:Eugene Willamette Street.png|thumb|350px|Willamette Street c. 1920]]

Eugene is named after its founder, [[Eugene Skinner|Eugene Franklin Skinner]]. Until 1889, it was named '''Eugene City'''.<ref name="unique name">{{cite news|last=Terry|first=John|title=Founder's wife suggests unique name for city of Eugene|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=September 4, 2010|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/O/index.ssf/2010/09/founders_wife_suggests_unique.html|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref>   In 1846, Skinner erected the first cabin in the area.<ref>http://www.lanecountyhistoricalsociety.org/research-photocatalog.html</ref> It was used as a [[trading post]] and was registered as an official post office on January 8, 1850. At this time the settlement was known as Skinner's Mudhole. It was relocated in 1853 and named Eugene City,<ref name=britannica>{{cite web|title=Eugene|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195036/Eugene|work=[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref>  but was not formally incorporated as a city until 1862. Skinner later ran a ferry service across the Willamette River where the [[Ferry Street Bridge (Eugene, Oregon)|Ferry Street Bridge]] now stands.

The first major educational institution in the area was [[Columbia College (Oregon)|Columbia College]], founded a few years earlier than the [[University of Oregon]]. It fell victim to two major fires in four years, and after the second fire, the college decided not to rebuild again. The part of south Eugene known as College Hill was the former location of Columbia College. There is no college there today.

The town raised the initial funding to start a public university, which later became the University of Oregon, with the hope of turning the small town into a center of learning. In 1872, the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] passed a bill creating the University of Oregon as a state institution. Eugene bested the nearby town of [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] in the competition for the state university. In 1873, community member J.H.D. Henderson donated the hilltop land for the campus, overlooking the city.

The university first opened in 1876 with the regents electing the first faculty and naming John Wesley Johnson as president. The first students registered on October 16, 1876. The first building was completed in 1877; it was named Deady Hall in honor of the first Board of Regents President and community leader Judge [[Matthew Deady|Matthew P. Deady]]. The city's name was shortened from Eugene City to Eugene in 1889.<ref name="unique name"/>

Eugene grew rapidly throughout most of the twentieth century, with the exception being the early 1980s when a downturn in the timber industry caused high unemployment. By 1985, the industry had recovered and Eugene began to attract more high-tech industries.

===Geography===
[[File:Eugene skyline crop.jpg|thumb|upright|450px|alt=The flat-roofed buildings of downtown Eugene in front of Spencer Butte, a prominent forested hill|[[Spencer Butte]] can be seen from much of the city.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|43.74|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|43.72|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.02|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name ="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=December 21, 2012}}</ref> Eugene is located at an elevation of {{convert|426|ft|0}}.

To the north of downtown is [[Skinner Butte]]. Northeast of the city are the [[Coburg Hills]]. [[Spencer Butte]] is a prominent landmark south of the city. [[Mount Pisgah (Oregon)|Mount Pisgah]] is southeast of Eugene and includes [[Mount Pisgah Arboretum]] and [[Howard Buford Recreation Area]], a Lane County Park. Eugene is surrounded by foothills and forests to the south, east and west, while to the north the land levels out into the Willamette Valley and consists of mostly farmland.

The [[Willamette River|Willamette]] and [[McKenzie River (Oregon)|McKenzie]] rivers run through Eugene and neighboring city, [[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]]. Another important stream is [[Amazon Creek]], whose headwaters are near Spencer Butte. The creek discharges west of the city into [[Fern Ridge Reservoir]], maintained for winter flood control by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. Eugene Yacht Club hosts a sail school and sailing regattas at Fern Ridge during summer months.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://eugeneyachtclub.net/|title = Eugene Yacht Club at Fern Ridge Lake|date = 2014|accessdate = August 10, 2014|website = Eugene Yacht Club|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

Like the rest of the [[Willamette Valley]], Eugene lies in the [[Marine west coast|Marine West Coast]] climate zone, with [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] characteristics. Under the Köppen climate classification scheme, Eugene has a subtropical dry summer climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb''). Temperatures can vary from cool to warm, with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Spring and fall are also moist seasons, with light rain falling for long periods. Winter snowfall does occur, but it is sporadic and rarely accumulates in large amounts: the average seasonal amount is {{convert|5|in|cm|1}}, and the median is 0.<ref name = NOAA /> The record snowfall was {{convert|3|ft|cm}} deep due to a [[pineapple express]] in late January 1969. The record snowfall for March was {{convert|8|in|cm}} deep in 2012.<ref>name = 'A truly historic "spring" snowstorm for Eugene '</ref> 

The hottest months are July and August, with average highs of around {{convert|82|°F|0}}, with an average of 15 days per year above {{convert|90|°F|1}}. The coolest month is December, with the average daytime high in the mid-40s°F (7–8&nbsp;°C), and nights averaging just above freezing. There are 54 nights per year with a low below freezing, and about three days with highs not exceeding freezing.<ref name = NOAA /> The record high low was {{convert|73|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Eugene's average annual temperature is {{convert|52.1|°F|1}}, and annual precipitation at {{convert|50.9|in|mm|sigfig=3}}.<ref name = NOAA /> Eugene is slightly cooler on average than [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. Despite being located about {{convert|100|mi|sigfig=2}} south and having only a slightly higher elevation, Eugene has a more [[continental climate]], less subject to the maritime air that blows inland from the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River.

===Religion===
Religious institutions of higher learning in Eugene include [[Northwest Christian University]] and [[New Hope Christian College]]. Northwest Christian University (formerly Northwest Christian College), founded in 1895, has ties with the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]. New Hope Christian College (formerly Eugene Bible College) originated with the Bible Standard Conference in 1919, which joined with Open Bible Evangelistic Association to create [[Open Bible Standard Churches]] in 1932. [[Eugene Bible College]] was started from this movement by Fred Hornshuh in 1925.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Open Bible Churches|title=Discover Open Bible Churches|url=http://www.openbible.org/about_discover.aspx|accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

===Community===
Eugene is noted for its "community inventiveness." Many U.S. trends in community development originated here. The University of Oregon's participatory [[planning]] process, known as [[The Oregon Experiment]], was the result of student protests in the early 1970s. The book of the same name is a major document in modern enlightenment thinking in planning and architectural circles. The process, still used by the university in modified form, was created by [[Christopher Alexander]], whose works also directly inspired the creation of the [[Wiki]]. Some research for the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'', which inspired the [[Design Patterns]] movement and [[Extreme Programming]], was done by Alexander in Eugene. Not coincidentally, those engineering movements also had origins here. Decades after its publication, ''A Pattern Language'' is still one of the best-selling books on urban design.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=WWuTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA232 |title= Place and Plexus: Metropolitan Land Use and Transport |last= Levinson |first= David M. |first2= Kevin J. |last2= Krizek|publisher= [[Routledge]] |year= 2008 |page= 232 |accessdate= November 10, 2014}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Eugene was packed with cooperative and community projects. It still has small natural food stores in many neighborhoods, some of the oldest student cooperatives in the country, and alternative schools have been part of the school district since 1971. The old Grower's Market, downtown near the [[Amtrak]] depot, is the only food cooperative in the U.S. with no employees. It is possible to see Eugene's trend-setting non-profit tendencies in much newer projects, such as the Tango Center and the [[Center for Appropriate Transport]]. In 2006, an initiative began to create a tenant-run development process for downtown Eugene.

In the fall of 2003, neighbors noticed that "an unassuming two-acre remnant orchard tucked into the Friendly Area Neighborhood"<ref name=Saved>{{Cite news|first=Jessica|last=Hirst|title=Madison Meadow Saved|work=Eugene Weekly|date=December 18, 2008|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2008/12/18/news.html}}</ref> had been put up for sale by its owner, a resident of New York City.<ref name=RG07>{{Cite news|first=Edward|last=Russo|title= Clock ticking on Madison Meadow|work=The Register-Guard|date=April 5, 2007|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/registerguard/access/1250950201.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+5%2C+2007&author=Edward+Russo+The+Register-Guard&pub=The+Register+-+Guard&edition=&startpage=C.1&desc=Clock+ticking+on+Madison+Meadow|accessdate=August 1, 2009|page=C1}}</ref> Learning that a prospective buyer had plans to build several houses on the property, they formed a nonprofit organization called Madison Meadow<ref name=MM>{{cite web|url=http://www.madisonmeadow.org|title=Madison Meadow|publisher=Madison Meadow|date=April 17, 2008|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxexemptworld.com/organizations/eugene_or_97405.asp|title=Eugene OR 97405- Tax Exempt Organizations and 97405 Eugene Oregon Non Profit Organizations|publisher=Taxexemptworld.com|date=August 21, 2012|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref> in June 2004 in order to buy the property and "preserve it as undeveloped space in perpetuity."<ref name=MM/> In 2007 their effort was named Third Best Community Effort by the ''Eugene Weekly'',<ref>{{Cite news|title= BEST OF EUGENE 2007: Tightrope Walkers and Trapeze Artists|work=Eugene Weekly|date=October 25, 2007|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2007/10/25/coverstory1.html|accessdate=September 14, 2009}}</ref> and by the end of 2008 they had raised enough money to purchase the property.<ref name=Saved/>

The City of Eugene has an active Neighborhood Program. Several neighborhoods are known for their green activism. Friendly Neighborhood has a highly popular neighborhood garden established on the right of way of a street never built. There are a number of community gardens on public property. Amazon Neighborhood has a former church turned into a community center. Whiteaker hosts a housing co-op that dates from the early 1970s that has re-purposed both their parking lots into food production and play space. An unusual eco-village with natural building techniques and large shared garden can be found in Jefferson Westside neighborhood. A several block area in the River Road Neighborhood is known as a [[permaculture]] hotspot with an increasing number of suburban homes trading grass for garden, installing rain water catchment systems, food producing landscapes and solar retrofits. Several sites have planted gardens by removing driveways. A 65-tree [[hazelnut|filbert]] grove on public property is being restored by citizen volunteers in cooperation with the city of Eugene. There are deepening social and economic networks in the neighborhood.

The “Club Cigar,” as it was called in the late 19th century, was for many years a men-only salon. It survived both the [[Great Depression]] and [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], partly because Eugene was a dry town before the end of Prohibition.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.luckeysclub.com/history|title = Luckey's History|date = 2014|accessdate = August 10, 2014|website = Luckey’s Club Cigar Store|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

Eugene has a significant population of people in pursuit of alternative ideas, and a large original [[hippie]] population.<ref>{{Cite news|first = Philip|last = Ossie Bladine|title = Hippie Culture's Still Alive, Man|newspaper= Oregon Daily Emerald|date = April 20, 2006|url = http://dailyemerald.com/2006/04/20/hippie-cultures-still-alive-man/|accessdate = May 28, 2007}}</ref> Beginning in the 1960s, the [[counterculture|countercultural]] ideas and viewpoints espoused by [[Ken Kesey]] became established as the seminal elements of the vibrant social tapestry that continue to define Eugene.<ref name = "Pumper">{{cite web|first = Molly|last = Pumper|title = Remembering Ken Kesey – Eugene, Oregon, USA|publisher = BootsnAll|date = December 15, 2001|url = http://www.bootsnall.com/articles/01-12/remembering-ken-kesey-eugene-oregon-usa.html|accessdate = May 28, 2007}}</ref> The Merry Prankster, as Kesey was known, has arguably left the most indelible imprint of any [[cultural icon]] in his hometown.

In 2005, the city council unanimously approved a new slogan for the city, "World's Greatest City for the Arts & Outdoors." While Eugene has a vibrant arts community for a city its size, and is well situated near many outdoor opportunities, this slogan was frequently criticized by locals as embarrassing and ludicrous.<ref>{{Cite news|last= Dietz|first= Diane|work= [[The Register-Guard]]|date= December 21, 2006|title= Not the World's Greatest Slogan?

====Music====
{{Main|Music of Oregon#Eugene}}
Because of its status as a [[college town]], Eugene has been home to many music genres, musicians and bands, ranging from [[electronic dance music]] such as [[dubstep]] and [[drum and bass]] to [[garage rock]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Eugene also has a growing [[reggae]] and street-performing [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[jug band]] scene. Multi-genre act the [[Cherry Poppin' Daddies]] became a prominent figure in Eugene's music scene and became the [[house band]] at Eugene's W.O.W. Hall. In the late 1990s, their contributions to the [[swing revival]] movement propelled them to national stardom. Rock band [[Floater (band)|Floater]] originated in Eugene. Doom metal band [[Yob (band)|YOB]] is among the leaders of the Eugene heavy music scene.

Eugene is home to "[[Classical Gas]]" Composer and two-time Grammy award winner [[Mason Williams]] who spent his years as a youth living between his parents in [[Oakridge, Oregon]] and Oklahoma. Mason Williams puts on a yearly Christmas show at the Hult center for performing arts with a full orchestra produced by author, audio engineer and University of Oregon professor [[Don Latarski]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mason Williams biography|url=http://www.masonwilliams-online.com/mwguitarbio05.pdf|format=PDF|date=January 2005|publisher=MasonWilliams-online.com|pages=2, 11|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref>

====Film====
The Eugene area has been used as a filming location for several Hollywood films, most famously for 1978's ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', which was also filmed in nearby [[Cottage Grove, Oregon|Cottage Grove]]. [[John Belushi]] had the idea for the film ''[[The Blues Brothers]]'' during filming of ''Animal House'' when he happened to meet [[Curtis Salgado]] at what was then the Eugene Hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~pringle/bluesbros/article.html|title=The Original Blues Brother: Curtis Salgado|publisher=Csse.monash.edu.au|date=|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref>

''[[Getting Straight]]'', starring [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Candice Bergen]], was filmed at [[Lane Community College]] in 1969. As the campus was still under construction at the time, the "occupation scenes" were easier to shoot.<ref>{{cite web|title = Trivia for Getting Straight (1970)|publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]]|url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065775/trivia }}</ref>

The "Chicken Salad on Toast" scene in the 1970 [[Jack Nicholson]] movie ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' was filmed at the [[Denny's]] restaurant at the southern [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|I-5]] freeway interchange near [[Glenwood, Lane County, Oregon|Glenwood]]. Nicholson directed the 1971 film ''[[Drive, He Said]]'' in Eugene.

''[[How to Beat the High Co$t of Living]]'', starring [[Jane Curtin]], [[Jessica Lange]] and [[Susan St. James]], was filmed in Eugene in the fall of 1979. Locations visible in the film include [[Valley River Center]] (which is a driving force in the plot), Skinner Butte and [[Ya-Po-Ah Terrace]], the Willamette River and River Road Hardware.

Several [[Track and field athletics|track and field]] movies have used Eugene as a setting and/or a filming location. ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'', starring [[Mariel Hemingway]], was filmed in Eugene in 1982. The film centered on a group of women who are trying to qualify for the Olympic track and field team. Two track and field movies about the life of [[Steve Prefontaine]], ''[[Prefontaine (film)|Prefontaine]]'' and ''[[Without Limits]]'' were released within a year of each other in 1997–1998. [[Kenny Moore]], Eugene-trained Olympic runner and co-star in ''Prefontaine'', co-wrote the screenplay for ''Without Limits''. ''Prefontaine'' was filmed in Washington because the ''Without Limits'' production bought out [[Hayward Field]] for the summer to prevent its competition from shooting there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/running/history/pre-legends/|title=Steve Prefontaine and Running Legends|publisher=Eugene Cascades & Coast|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> Kenny Moore also wrote a biography of [[Bill Bowerman]], played in ''Without Limits'' by [[Donald Sutherland]] back in Eugene 20 years after he had appeared in ''Animal House''. Moore had also had a role in ''Personal Best''.

''[[Stealing Time]]'', a 2003 independent film, was partially filmed in Eugene. When the film premiered in June 2001 at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], it was titled ''Rennie's Landing'' after a popular bar near the University of Oregon campus. The title was changed for its DVD release. ''[[Zerophilia]]'' was filmed in Eugene in 2006.

For nearly 40 years, Eugene has been the "Track and Field Capital of the World." Oregon's most famous track icon is the late world-class distance runner Steve Prefontaine, who was killed in a car crash in 1975.

Eugene's jogging trails include [[Pre's Trail]] in Alton Baker Park, [[Rexius Trail]], the [[Adidas Oregon Trail]], and the [[Ridgeline Trail]]. Jogging was introduced to the U.S. through Eugene, brought from [[New Zealand]] by Bill Bowerman, who wrote the best-selling book "Jogging", and coached the champion University of Oregon track and cross country teams. During Bowerman's tenure, his "Men of Oregon" won 24 individual [[NCAA]] titles, including titles in 15 out of the 19 events contested. During Bowerman's 24 years at Oregon, his track teams finished in the top ten at the NCAA championships 16 times, including four team titles (1962, '64, '65, '70), and two second-place trophies. His teams also posted a dual meet record of 114–20.

Bowerman also invented the waffle sole for running shoes in Eugene, and with Oregon alumnus [[Phil Knight]] founded shoe giant Nike. Eugene's miles of running trails, through its unusually large park system, are the most extensive in the U.S. The city has dozens of running clubs. The climate is cool and temperate, good both for jogging and record-setting. Eugene is home to the University of Oregon's Hayward Field track, which hosts numerous collegiate and amateur track and field meets throughout the year, most notably the [[Prefontaine Classic]]. Hayward Field was host to the 2004 [[AAU Junior Olympic Games]], the 1989 [[World Masters Athletics Championships]], the track and field events of the 1998 [[World Masters Games]], the 2006 [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pacific-10]] track and field championships, the 1971, 1975, 1986, 1993, 1999, 2001, 2009, and 2011 [[USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships]] and the 1972, 1976, 1980, 2008, and 2012 [[United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|U.S. Olympic trials]], and is designated to host them again in 2016.

On April 16, 2015, it was announced by the [[IAAF]] that Eugene had been awarded the right to host the [[2021 World Championships in Athletics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/eugene-awarded-2021-iaaf-world-championships|title=Eugene awarded 2021 IAAF World Championships}}</ref>  The city had previously bid for the [[2019 World Championships in Athletics|2019 event]] but lost narrowly to [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].

Eugene is also home to the [[Eugene Emeralds]], a short-season Class A [[minor-league baseball|minor-league baseball team]]. The "Ems" play their home games in PK Park, also the home of the University of Oregon baseball team.

The [[Nationwide Tour]]'s golfing event [[Oregon Classic]] takes place at Shadow Hills Country Club, just north of Eugene. The event has been played every year since 1998, except in 2001 when it was slated to begin the day after the [[9/11]] terrorist attacks. The top 20 players from the Nationwide Tour are promoted to the PGA Tour for the following year.<ref>[http://www.oregonclassic.com/History.htm "The history of the Oregon Classic"]. Oregon Classic.

The city of Eugene maintains an [[urban forest]]. The University of Oregon campus is an [[arboretum]], with over 500 species of trees. The city operates and maintains scenic hiking trails that pass through and across the ridges of a cluster of hills in the southern portion of the city, on the fringe of residential neighborhoods. Some trails allow biking and others are for hikers and runners only.

The nearest ski resort, [[Willamette Pass ski area|Willamette Pass]], is one hour from Eugene by car. On the way, along [[Oregon Route 58]], are several reservoirs and lakes, the Oakridge [[mountain biking|mountain bike]] trails, [[hot spring]]s, and waterfalls within [[Willamette National Forest]].

==Government==
In 1944, Eugene adopted a [[Council-manager government|council-manager]] form of government, replacing the day-to-day management of city affairs by the part-time mayor and volunteer [[city council]] with a full-time professional [[city manager]]. The subsequent history of Eugene city government has largely been one of the dynamics—often contentious—between the city manager, the mayor and city council.

The current mayor of Eugene is [[Kitty Piercy]], who has been in office since 2005.

====Cycling====
Cycling is popular in Eugene and many people commute via bicycle.

Many people commute to work by bicycle every month of the year. Numerous bike shops provide the finest rain gear products, running lights and everything a biker needs to ride and stay comfortable in the damp, misty climate. Bike trails take commuting and recreational bikers along the Willamette River past a scenic rose garden, along Amazon Creek, through the downtown, and through the University of Oregon campus.

In 2009, the [[League of American Bicyclists]] cited Eugene as 1 of 10 "Gold-level" cities in the U.S. because of its "remarkable commitments to bicycling."<ref>{{cite web|title=Eugene one of top cities in nation for bicycling|url=http://www.kval.com/news/65085087.html|date=October 20, 2009|publisher=KVAL.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bikeleague.org/programs/bicyclefriendlyamerica/pdfs/bfc_master_list_web.pdf|title= Bicycle Friendly Community Master List: October 2009|date= October 20, 2009|format= PDF|publisher= League of American Bicyclists}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Eugene OR Receives Gold-Level from LAB|url=http://www.bikeleague.org/programs/bicyclefriendlyamerica/communities/bfc_eugene.php}}</ref> In 2010, ''[[Bicycling (magazine)|Bicycling]]'' magazine named Eugene the 5th most bike-friendly city in America.<ref name=bikes>{{cite web|title=Eugene Earns Top Five Ranking in List of Most Bike-Friendly Cities in America|url=https://www.eugene-or.gov/archives/61/BikeFriendly.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=City of Eugene|date=April 6, 2010|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref><ref name=bikes/><ref>{{cite web|title=Bicycling's top 50|url=http://www.bicycling.com/news/featured-stories/bicyclings-top-50|publisher=www.bicycling.com}}</ref> The U.S. Census Bureau's annual [[American Community Survey]] reported that Eugene had a bicycle commuting [[mode share]] of 7.3% in 2011, the fifth highest percentage nationwide among U.S. cities with 65,000 people or more, and 13 times higher than the national average of 0.56%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/blogs/by-the-numbers/bike-to-work-map-us-cities-census-data.html|title=New Data Shows Where Americans Bike to Work|author=Maciag, Mike|publisher=[[Governing (magazine)]]|date=October 16, 2012|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>

====Highways====
Highways traveling within and through Eugene include:
*[[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]]: Interstate 5 forms much of the eastern city limit, acting as an effective, though unofficial boundary between Eugene and Springfield.

To the south, I-5 leads to [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]], and the southwestern portion of the state. In full, Interstate 5 continues north to the Canadian Border at Blaine, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia and extends south to the Mexican border at Tijuana and San Diego.
*[[Oregon Route 126|Officer Chris Kilcullen Memorial Highway]]: Oregon Route 126 is routed along the Eugene-Springfield Highway, a limited-access freeway. The Eugene portion of this highway begins at an interchange with Interstate 5 and ends two miles (3&nbsp;km) west at a freeway terminus.

*[[Oregon Route 569|Randy Papé Beltline]]: Beltline is a limited-access freeway which runs along the northern and western edges of incorporated Eugene.

*[[Oregon Route 99]]: Oregon Route 99 forks off Interstate 5 south of Eugene, and forms a major surface artery in Eugene. It continues north into the Willamette valley, parallel to I-5. It is sometimes called the "scenic route" since it has a great view of the Coast Range and also stretches through many scenic farmlands of the Willamette Valley.

===Utilities===
Eugene is the home of Oregon's largest publicly owned [[electric utility|water and power utility]], the [[Eugene Water & Electric Board]] (EWEB). EWEB got its start in the first decade of the 20th century, after an epidemic of [[typhoid]] found in the groundwater supply.<ref>[http://www.eweb.org/history "History of EWEB"]. [[Eugene Water & Electric Board]]. Retrieved 2010-10-09.</ref> The City of Eugene condemned Eugene's private water utility and began treating river water (first the Willamette; later the McKenzie) for domestic use. EWEB got into the electric business when power was needed for the water pumps. Excess electricity generated by the EWEB's [[hydropower]] plants was used for street lighting.

Natural gas service is provided by [[NW Natural]].

Wastewater treatment services are provided by the Metropolitan Wastewater Management Commission, a partnership between the Cities of Eugene and Springfield and Lane County.
