Early airships were prone to disaster, but slowly the airship became more dependable, with a more rigid structure and stronger skin. Prior to the outbreak of war, Zeppelins, a larger and more streamlined form of airship designed by German Count<space/><link><target>Ferdinand Von Zeppelin</target></link>, were outfitted to carry bombs to attack targets at long range. These were the first long range, strategic bombers. Although the German air arm was strong, with a total of 123 airships by the end of the war, they were vulnerable to attack and engine failure, as well as navigational issues. German airships inflicted little damage on all 51 raids, with 557 Britons killed and 1,358 injured. The German Navy lost 53 of its 73 airships, and the Germany Army lost 26 of its 50 ships.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last1">Roadman</arg><arg name="first1">LTC Julian A.</arg><arg name="title">A Combat Nightmare in WWII</arg><arg name="date">2013</arg><arg name="publisher">Triumph Press</arg><arg name="isbn">9781484911846</arg><arg name="pages">11–12</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Caproni Ca.32(300hp-Ca.2) with Gianni Caproni on board.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part><link><target>Caproni Ca.3</target></link>, an Italian World War I heavy bomber, 1915.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The Caproni Ca 30 was built by<space/><link><target>Gianni Caproni</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Italy</target></link>.

With the advent of guided air-to-air missiles, bombers needed to avoid interception. High-speed and high-altitude flying became a means of evading detection and attack. Designs such as the<space/><link><target>English Electric Canberra</target></link><space/>could fly faster or higher than contemporary fighters. When surface-to-air missiles became capable of hitting high-flying bombers, bombers were flown at low altitudes to evade radar detection and interception.</paragraph><paragraph>Once &quot;stand off&quot; nuclear weapon designs were developed, bombers did not need to pass over the target to make an attack; they could fire and turn away to escape the blast.

Many attack aircraft, even ones that<space/><italics>look</italics><space/>like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Indeed, the design qualities that make an effective low-level attack aircraft make for a distinctly inferior air superiority fighter, and vice versa. Conversely, many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks,' despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations.</paragraph><paragraph>Plans in the U.S. and Russia for successors to the current strategic bomber force remain only paper projects, and political and funding pressures suggest that they are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. In the U.S., current plans call for the existing USAF bomber fleet to remain in service until the mid-to-late 2020s, with the first<space/><link><target>Long Range Strike Bomber</target><part>possible replacements</part></link><space/>becoming operational in 2018.<extension extension_name='ref' name="usaf new bomber requirements"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.janes.com/news/defence/air/jdw/jdw071018_1_n.shtml</arg><arg name="title">USAF may seek supersonic and unmanned capabilities for bomber</arg><arg name="accessdate">2007-11-25</arg></template></extension><space/>After this bomber the U.S. is also considering another<space/><link><target>2037 Bomber</target><part>bomber in 2037</part></link>. The 2018 bomber will be made in small quantities, as it will be a transition aircraft for this 2037 bomber.

Also, it has been chosen to be able to stand against rising superpowers and other countries with semi-advanced military capability.
