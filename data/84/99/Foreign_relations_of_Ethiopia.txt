{{Politics of Ethiopia}}
Many historians trace modern [[Ethiopia]]'s foreign policy to the reign of Emperor [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros II]], whose primary concerns were the security of Ethiopia's traditional borders, obtaining technology from Europe (or modernization), and to a lesser degree Ethiopian rights to the monastery of [[Dar-es-Sultan]] in the city of [[Jerusalem]].<ref>The political history of the Ethiopian community, and their struggle for ownership of this small monastery, is retold in Chris Proutky, ''Empress Taytu and Menelik II'' (Trenton: The Red Sea Press, 1986), pp. 247-256</ref> Tewodros' diplomatic efforts, however, ended disastrously with the [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia|British expedition of 1868]] which concluded with his death. Despite the efforts of his successor Emperor [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]] to establish a relationship with the United Kingdom, Ethiopia was ignored by the world powers until the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], and more important, the [[Mahdist War]], drew outside attention to her once more.<ref>Although Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia'', second edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2001), believes that the Suez Canal brought strategic value to the Red Sea region (p. 73), Sven Rubenson, ''The Survival of Ethiopian Independence'' (Hollywood: Tsehai,1991) argues that only with the Mahdi War did the United Kingdom  interest themselves once again in Ethiopia (pp. 283ff).</ref>

The same major interests that Tewodros had—the security of Ethiopia's traditional borders and modernization—were once again foremost, as demonstrated by the outcome of the [[First Italo–Ethiopian War]], Ethiopia's admission to the [[League of Nations]] (28 September 1923), and the 1935 [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. Following the decisive Ethiopian victory at [[battle of Adwa|Adwa]], [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]] rapidly negotiated a series of treaties fixing Ethiopia's boundaries—with French Somaliland in March 1897, British Somaliland a few months later in June 1897, with Italian Eritrea in 1900, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in 1902, British East Africa in 1907, and Italian Somaliland in 1908—which simplified this problem on one level. Although Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] agreed to [[Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement|an agreement]] with the British government to help him restore order to Ethiopia, which benefited him in crushing the [[Woyane|Woyane Rebellion]], he worked to its eventual termination.

Following [[World War II]], Ethiopia played an active role in regional and global politics. Ethiopia was a [[charter member]] of the [[United Nations]] and took part in UN operations in [[Korea]] in 1951 and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] in 1960. Former [[Emperor]] [[Haile Selassie I]] was also among the founders of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU), and served as one of a series of rotating OAU chairmen. Although nominally a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], after the 1974 revolution, Ethiopia also moved into a close relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies and supported their international policies and positions until a change of government in 1991.

Today, Ethiopia is a major economic partner of [[Djibouti]] and [[Sudan]], although border demarcation negotiations are still ongoing with the [[Omar Al-Bashir]] administration. Relations with [[Somalia]] have also gradually improved, particularly since the establishment of a new government in [[Mogadishu]]. Ethiopia's dealings with [[Eritrea]] are extremely tense due to an ongoing border dispute between the two countries.

The Ethiopian government's [[Ethiopia-United States relations|relations with the U.S.]] and the West in general have been centered on military and economic cooperation. In addition, Ethiopia maintains diplomatic links with [[China]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]] and [[India]], among other countries. [[Addis Ababa]] also serves as the headquarters of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] (UNECA) and the [[African Union]], as well as numerous other continental and international organizations.

{{main|Egypt–Ethiopia relations}}
As two of the oldest independent states in Africa, both countries have an ancient relationship in many forms. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] was under the administration of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] from ancient times until 1959. Ethiopian and Egyptian armies clashed in the early 19th century over control of territory in what is modern Sudan, and Ethiopia's access to the Red Sea. Both countries established formal diplomatic ties in 1927.<ref name="SIS">{{cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Templates/Articles/tmpArticles.aspx?CatID=1193|title=Egyptian-Ethiopian relations|publisher=State Information Service}}</ref> More recently, because both countries share a [[Special relationship (international relations)|special relationship]] over the Nile basin, both are members of the [[Nile Basin Initiative]].

* The boundary between these two countries is based on three treaties between Ethiopia and [[Ethiopia-Italy relations|Italy]], in [[Ethiopian-Italian Treaty (1900)|1900]], [[Ethiopian-Italian Treaty (1902)|1902]], and [[Ethiopian-Italian Treaty (1908)|1908]].

* From 1950 until 1993, Eritrea was federated as part of Ethiopia. During much of this period, a number of Eritreans [[Eritrean War of Independence|fought for independence from Ethiopia]]. The federation was ended with an April 1993 [[United Nations Observer Mission to Verify the Referendum in Eritrea|plebiscite]] which approved Eritrea's full independence.
* Disputes over Eritrea's border alignment led to the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] (1998–2000), which was resolved by an [[Algiers Agreement (2000)|independent boundary commission's]] [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] decision in 2002. However, demarcation has been delayed, despite intense international intervention, by Ethiopian insistence that the decision ignored "human geography," made technical errors in the delimitation, and determined that certain disputed areas, specifically [[Badme]], fall to Eritrea. Eritrea meanwhile insists on not deviating from the commission's decision.

==={{Flag|Kenya}}===
Relations between [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] date back to the 1954, when the Ethiopian authorities under [[Haile Selassie I]] established an Honorary Consulate General in the British [[Kenya Colony]]. In 1961, prior to Kenya's independence, Ethiopia appointed its first Ambassador to Kenya and six years later Kenya opened an Embassy in [[Addis Ababa]].<ref>[http://mfa.gov.et/Foreign_Policy_And_Relation/Bilateral.php "Ethiopia - Kenya relations"], Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (accessed 9 October 2009)</ref>

The border between the two countries is based on a treaty signed by Ethiopia and Kenya on June 9, 1970, which determines the present-day boundary, abrogating all previous boundary treaties. This border has been subjected to demarcation.<ref>[http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/limitsinseas/IBS152.pdf "Ethiopia – Kenya Boundary"], U.S. State Department International Boundary Study, No. 152 – October 15, 1975</ref>

{{main|Ethiopia–Somalia relations}}
Relations between the peoples of Somalia and Ethiopia stretch back to antiquity, to a common origin. The Ethiopian region is one of the proposed homelands of the [[Horn of Africa]]'s various [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] communities.<ref name="Levine">{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Donald N.|title=Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society|year=2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226475611|pages=27–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TtmFQejWaaYC}}</ref>

During the Middle Ages, [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi]] (Ahmad Gurey or Gragn) led a [[Ethiopian-Adal War|Conquest of Abyssinia]] (''Futuh al-Habash''), which brought three-quarters of the [[Christian]] [[Ethiopian Empire]] under the power of the [[Muslim]] [[Adal Sultanate]].<ref>Saheed A.

Laitin and Said S. Samatar, ''Somalia: Nation in Search of a State'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 1987).</ref>

In the 1960s and 1970s, a territorial dispute over the [[Ogaden]] region led to various armed confrontations between the Somalian and Ethiopian militaries. The tensions culminated in the [[Ogaden War]], which saw the Somali army capture most of the disputed territory by September 1977, before finally being expelled by a coalition of communist forces.

With changes in leadership in the early 1990s brought on by the start of the [[Somali Civil War]] and [[Ethiopian Civil War]], respectively, relations between the Somali and Ethiopian authorities entered a new phase of military cooperation against the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU) rebel group and its more radical successor [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]]. In October 2011, a [[Operation Linda Nchi|coordinated multinational operation]] began against Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia; the Ethiopian military eventually joined the [[Transitional Federal Government]]-led mission the following month.<ref name="Eatbsaois">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-25/ethiopia-agrees-to-back-somalia-army-operations-igad-says.html |title=Ethiopia Agrees to Back Somalia Military Operations, IGAD Says |work=Businessweek |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120819092537/http://www.businessweek.com:80/news/2011-11-25/ethiopia-agrees-to-back-somalia-army-operations-igad-says.html |archivedate=19 August 2012 }}</ref>

Ethiopia and Sudan first established formal relations in 1956.<ref>[http://mfa.gov.et/Foreign_Policy_And_Relation/Bilateral.php "Ethiopia - Sudan relations"], Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (Retrieved 9 October 2009)</ref> Relations between Ethiopia and Sudan were very good following the end of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]], due to the support that the Sudanese government had given to the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]]. However, relations were strained for a time following the 26 June 1995 assassination attempt against Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]] as he was leaving the OAU summit meeting in Addis Ababa. The subsequent investigation revealed that Sudan was involved in this act, forcing the Ethiopian government to take a series of steps against Sudan that September, which included closing the Sudanese consulate in [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]], reducing the number of Sudanese embassy staff, and terminating all [[Sudan Airways]] and [[Ethiopian Airlines]] flights between the two countries. However the start of the Eritrean-Ethiopian War led to Sudan and Ethiopia put this conflict between them and normalizing their relations by November 1999 when president [[Omar Hassan al-Bashir]] made a formal visit to Addis Ababa.<ref>David H.

Efforts to demarcate the porous boundary with Sudan were delayed by the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]]. In May 2008, residents along the western Ethiopian border reportedly discovered that the government had agreed to demarcate this boundary when Sudanese soldiers forced them out of their homes. It was reported that as many as 2,000 people were displaced in the [[Gambela Region]], and the Sudanese army reportedly set fire to two dozen Ethiopian farms and imprisoned 34 people in the [[Amhara Region]]. However, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi publicly denied that any Ethiopians had been displaced by this agreement.<ref>Alisha Ryu, [http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-06/2008-06-05-voa43.cfm?CFID=156867109&CFTOKEN=60445804&jsessionid=8830a70f00653c50c7a814604b23643f33fe "Border Demarcation with Sudan Causes Anger in Ethiopia"]{{dead link|date=April 2015}}, Voice of America website, 5 June 2008 (Retrieved 3 April 2009)</ref> Negotiations over this boundary continues, with the twelfth meeting of the Boundary Commission announced 28 December 2009 at [[Mek'ele]], with Ethiopian representatives from the [[Tigray Region|Tigray]], [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region|Benishangul-Gumuz]], Amhara and Gambela Regions, and from the Sudanese side representatives of the [[Upper Nile State|Upper Nile]], [[Blue Nile State|Blue Nile]], [[Sennar]] and [[Al Qadarif (state)|Al Qadarif]] Administrations.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.et/Press_Section/publication.php?Main_Page_Number=4838 "Ethio-Sudanese Border Commission Meeting To Open Monday (December 28, 2009)"], Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (Retrieved 28 December 2009) {{wayback|url=http://www.mfa.gov.et/Press_Section/publication.php?Main_Page_Number=4838 |date=20120220050517 }}</ref>

Despite these border tensions, Sudan remains a major economic partner of Ethiopia. According to the Ethiopian Petroleum Supplier Enterprise (EPSE), Ethiopia in April 2013 imported around $1.12 billion worth of oil from Sudan over the previous six months. In total, about 85% of Ethiopia's yearly oil consumption comes from Sudan via the Port of Djibouti. Ethiopia and Sudan are also in the process of linking their [[power grid]]s.<ref name=Tekle>{{cite news|last=Tekle|first=Tesfa-Alem|title=Sudan: Ethiopia Imports $U.S.1 Billion in Fuel From Sudan Via Djibouti|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201304011187.html|accessdate=16 April 2013|newspaper=Sudan Tribune|date=30 March 2013}}</ref>
