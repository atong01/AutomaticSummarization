The '''endoplasmic reticulum''' ('''ER''') is a type of [[organelle]] in the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic organisms]] that forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs or tube like structures  known as [[cisterna]]e. The [[endoplasm]] is the inner core of the [[cytoplasm]] and the membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer membrane of the [[nuclear envelope]]. Endoplasmic reticulum occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells, including the most primitive ''[[Giardia]]'',<ref>Soltys, B.J., Falah, M.S. and Gupta, R.S. (1996) Identification of endoplasmic reticulum in the primitive eukaryote Giardia lamblia using cryoelectron microscopy and antibody to Bip.  J. Cell Science 109: 1909-1917.</ref>  but is absent from [[red blood cell]]s and [[spermatozoa]]. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum, rough and smooth. The outer ([[cytosol]]ic) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with [[ribosome]]s that are the sites of [[protein synthesis]]. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as [[hepatocyte]]s. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in [[lipid]] metabolism, [[carbohydrate]] metabolism, and [[detoxification]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} of drugs. The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian [[liver]] and [[gonad]] cells. The lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 using [[electron microscopy]].

The general structure of the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes called [[cisterna]]e. These sac-like structures are held together by the [[cytoskeleton]]. The [[phospholipid membrane]] encloses a space, the cisternal space (or lumen), which is continuous with the [[perinuclear space]] but separate from the [[cytosol]]. The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and cell type and cell function.  The quantity of both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell.  Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes.  Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Rough endoplasmic reticulum===
[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px|An animation showing how a protein destined for the [[secretory pathway]] is synthesized into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (which appears at upper right in animation when approximately half of animation is done). The total animation time is about 2 minutes.]]
The surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (often abbreviated RER or Rough ER) (also called ''ergastoplasm'') is studded with protein-manufacturing [[ribosome]]s giving it a "rough" appearance (hence its name). The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the [[translocon]].<ref>{{cite journal | author= Görlich D, Prehn S, Hartmann E, Kalies KU, Rapoport TA. | title= A mammalian homolog of SEC61p and SECYp is associated with ribosomes and nascent polypeptides during translocation. | journal= Cell |date=Oct 1992| volume=71 | issue=3 | pages=489–503 | pmid=1423609 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90517-G}}</ref> However, the ribosomes bound to it at any one time are not a stable part of this organelle's structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex forms in the cytosol.  This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins translating the [[mRNA]] of a protein destined for the [[secretory pathway]].<ref name="lodish">{{cite book |last=Lodish |first=Harvey |year=2003 |title=Molecular Cell Biology |edition=5th |publisher=W.

Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER [[translocon]] where translation continues with the nascent protein forming into the RER lumen and/or membrane. The protein is processed in the ER lumen by an enzyme (a signal [[peptidase]]), which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are also known to stay associated with translocons.<ref name="Seiser2000">{{cite journal|last1=Seiser|first1=R.

The membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum forms large double membrane sheets that are located near, and continuous with, the outer layer of the [[nuclear envelope]].<ref name="ShibataVoeltz2006">{{cite journal|last1=Shibata|first1=Yoko|last2=Voeltz|first2=Gia K.|last3=Rapoport|first3=Tom A.|title=Rough Sheets and Smooth Tubules|journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]] |volume=126|issue=3|year=2006|pages=435–439|issn=00928674|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.019}}</ref> Although there is no continuous membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum and the [[Golgi apparatus]], membrane-bound vesicles shuttle proteins between these two compartments.<ref>Endoplasmic reticulum.

Retrieved September 13, 2006, from Answers.com Web site: http://www.answers.com/topic/endoplasmic-reticulum</ref> Vesicles are surrounded by coating proteins called COPI and COPII. [[COPII]] targets vesicles to the Golgi apparatus and [[COPI]] marks them to be brought back to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum works in concert with the [[Golgi complex]] to [[protein targeting|target new proteins]] to their proper destinations. A second method of transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum involves areas called [[membrane contact site]]s, where the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles are held closely together, allowing the transfer of lipids and other small molecules.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levine T |title=Short-range intracellular trafficking of small molecules across endoplasmic reticulum junctions |journal=Trends Cell Biol. |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=483–90 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15350976 |doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2004.07.017 |url= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Levine T, Loewen C |title=Inter-organelle membrane contact sites: through a glass, darkly |journal=Curr.

The rough endoplasmic reticulum is key in multiple functions:
*Manufacture of [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] enzymes with a [[mannose-6-phosphate]] marker added in the ''cis''-Golgi network{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
*Manufacture of [[Secretion|secreted]] proteins, either secreted constitutively with no tag or secreted in a regulatory manner involving [[clathrin]] and paired basic amino acids in the [[signal peptide]].
*[[Integral membrane proteins]] that stay embedded in the membrane as vesicles exit and bind to new membranes. [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab]] proteins are key in targeting the membrane; [[SNAP-25|SNAP]] and [[SNARE]] proteins are key in the fusion event.
*Initial [[glycosylation]] as assembly continues. This is N-linked (O-linking occurs in the Golgi).
**N-linked glycosylation: If the protein is properly folded, [[Oligosaccharyltransferase]] recognizes the AA sequence [[Asparagine|N]]X[[serine|S]] or [[Asparagine|N]]X[[threonine|T]] (with the S/T residue phosphorylated) and adds a 14-sugar backbone (2-''N''-acetylglucosamine, 9-branching [[mannose]], and 3-[[glucose]] at the end) to the side-chain [[nitrogen]] of Asn.

===Smooth endoplasmic reticulum===
The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (abbreviated SER) has functions in several metabolic processes. It synthesizes [[lipids]], [[phospholipids]], and [[steroids]]. Cells which secrete these products, such as those in the [[testes]], [[ovaries]], and [[sebaceous gland]]s have an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum.<ref>{{cite news |title=Functions of Smooth ER |publisher=University of Minnesota Duluth}}<!--|accessdate=16 December 2012--></ref> It also carries out the metabolism of carbohydrates, drug detoxification, attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins, and [[steroid metabolism]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Maxfield FR, Wüstner D|title=Intracellular cholesterol transport|journal=J.

Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in a variety of cell types (both animal and plant), and it serves different functions in each. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum also contains the enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphatase]], which converts [[glucose-6-phosphate]] to glucose, a step in [[gluconeogenesis]]. It is connected to the [[nuclear envelope]] and  consists of tubules that are located near the cell periphery. These tubes sometimes branch forming a network that is reticular in appearance.<ref name="ShibataVoeltz2006">{{cite journal|last1=Shibata|first1=Yoko|last2=Voeltz|first2=Gia K.|last3=Rapoport|first3=Tom A.|title=Rough Sheets and Smooth Tubules|journal=Cell|volume=126|issue=3|year=2006|pages=435–439|issn=00928674|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.019}}</ref> In some cells, there are dilated areas like the sacs of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The network of smooth endoplasmic reticulum allows for an increased surface area to be devoted to the action or storage of key enzymes and the products of these enzymes.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

====Sarcoplasmic reticulum====
[[File:Blausen 0801 SkeletalMuscle.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Skeletal muscle]] fiber, with sarcoplasmic reticulum colored in blue.]]

The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), from the Greek σάρξ ''sarx'' ("flesh"), is smooth ER found in [[myocytes]].  The only structural difference between this organelle and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the medley of proteins they have, both bound to their membranes and drifting within the confines of their lumens. This fundamental difference is indicative of their functions: The endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes molecules, while the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores calcium ions and pumps them out into the sarcoplasm when the muscle fiber is stimulated.<ref name="sarcoplasmic">{{cite journal|author=Toyoshima C, Nakasako M, Nomura H, Ogawa H|title=Crystal structure of the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum at 2.6 A resolution|journal=Nature|volume=405|issue=6787|pages=647–55|year=2000|pmid=10864315|doi=10.1038/35015017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Medical Cell Biology 3rd/ed|publisher=Academic Press|pages=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tRbCHk9easQC&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=smooth+er+stores+calcium+ions+muscle+cells&source=bl&ots=RtG7D-wi59&sig=5hxYMBaDdb-S4Ypd01Hcp-e8qqY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=odTNUNPFC-LX0QHRnoHQBg&ved=0CHIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=smooth%20er%20stores%20calcium%20ions%20muscle%20cells&f=false}}</ref> After their release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, calcium ions interact with contractile proteins that utilize ATP to shorten the muscle fiber. The sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a major role in [[excitation-contraction coupling]].<ref>{{cite book |title = Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology |first1 = Frederick |last1 = Martini |first2 = Judi |last2 = Nath |first3 = Edwin |last3 = Bartholomew |edition = 10th |isbn = 978-0321909077 |year = 2014}}</ref>

==Functions==
The endoplasmic reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called [[cisterna]]e and the transport of synthesized proteins in [[Golgi apparatus#Vesicular transport|vesicles]] to the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several endoplasmic reticulum [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperone]] proteins, including [[protein disulfide isomerase]] (PDI), ERp29, the [[Hsp70]] family member [[Binding immunoglobulin protein|BiP/Grp78]], [[calnexin]], [[calreticulin]], and the peptidylpropyl isomerase family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus.  Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection<ref>{{cite journal|last=Xu|first=C|title=Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress: Cell Life and Death Decisions|journal=J. Clin. Invest|year=2005|volume=115|pages=2656–2664|pmid=16200199|doi=10.1172/JCI26373|issue=10|pmc=1236697|display-authors=etal}}</ref> or the over-expression of proteins<ref name="pmid22510960">{{cite journal | author = Kober L, Zehe C, Bode J | title = Development of a novel ER stress based selection system for the isolation of highly productive clones | journal = Biotechnol.

This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia/ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Protein transport===
Secretory proteins, mostly [[glycoproteins]], are moved across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a [[signal peptide|signal sequence]]. The N-terminus (one end) of a [[polypeptide]] chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few [[amino acid]]s that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the [[Translocon]], a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s and moved along the [[cytoskeleton]] toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.<ref>Soltys,B.J. and Gupta, R.S. (1992) Interrelationships of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, intermediate filaments, and microtubules--a quadruple fluorescence labeling study.</ref>

The endoplasmic reticulum is also part of a protein sorting pathway. It is, in essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell. The majority of its resident proteins are retained within it through a retention [[Structural motif|motif]]. This motif is composed of four amino acids at the end of the protein sequence. The most common retention sequences are [[KDEL (amino acid sequence)|KDEL]] for lumen located proteins and [[KKXX (amino acid sequence)|KKXX]] for transmembrane protein.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Mariano Stornaiuolo, Lavinia V. Lotti, Nica Borgese, Maria-Rosaria Torrisi, Giovanna Mottola, Gianluca Martire, and Stefano Bonatti|date=March 2003| title=KDEL and KKXX Retrieval Signals Appended to the Same Reporter Protein Determine Different Trafficking between Endoplasmic Reticulum, Intermediate Compartment, and Golgi Complex| journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell| volume=14|issue=3| pages=889–902| doi=10.1091/mbc.E02-08-0468}}</ref> However, variations of KDEL and KKXX do occur, and other sequences can also give rise to endoplasmic reticulum retention. It is not known whether such variation can lead to sub-ER localizations. There are three KDEL ([[KDELR1|1]], [[KDELR2|2]] and [[KDELR3|3]]) receptors in mammalian cells, and they have a very high degree of sequence identity. The functional differences between these receptors remain to be established. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
