</arg></template>The<space/><bold>economy of Benin</bold><space/>remains underdeveloped and dependent on<space/><link><target>subsistence agriculture</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>cotton</target></link>.

A large injection of external investment from both private and public sources has alleviated the economic difficulties of the early 1990s caused by global recession and persistently low commodity prices (although the latter continues to affect the economy). The manufacturing sector is confined to some light industry, which is mainly involved in processing primary products and the cow production of consumer goods. A planned joint<space/><link><target>hydroelectric</target></link><space/>project with neighboring<space/><link><target>Togo</target></link><space/>is intended to reduce Benin's dependence on imported energy mostly from<space/><link><target>Ghana</target></link>, which currently accounts for a significant proportion of the country's imports. The service sector has grown quickly, stimulated by economic liberalization and fiscal reform, and the use of modern technology such as automobiles and computers has grown considerably as a result. Membership of the<space/><link><target>CFA Franc Zone</target></link><space/>offers reasonable currency stability as well as access to French economic support. Benin sells its products mainly to France and, in smaller quantities, to the Netherlands, Korea, Japan, and India. France is Benin's leading source for imports. Benin is also a member of the<space/><link><target>Economic Community of West African States</target></link><space/>(ECOWAS).</paragraph><paragraph>Despite its rapid growth, the economy of Benin still remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth in real output averaged a sound 5% since 1996, but a rapid population rise offset much of this growth on a per capita basis. Inflation has subsided over the past several years. Commercial and transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are vulnerable to developments in<space/><link><target>Nigeria</target></link>, particularly fuel shortages.</paragraph><paragraph>Although<space/><link><target>trade unions in Benin</target></link><space/>represent up to 75% of the formal workforce, the large informal economy has been noted by the<space/><link><target>International Trade Union Confederation</target></link><space/>(ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's wage equality, the use of<space/><link><target>child labor</target><part>child labour</part></link>, and the continuing issue of<space/><link><target>unfree labour</target><part>forced labour</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Serious violations of core labour standards in Benin, Burkina Faso and Mali

However, a series of reforms were undertaken in the 1990s, which resulted in the consolidation of the banking sector and in the privatization of all state banks.</paragraph><paragraph>A legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all countries of the Union) is in place and underwent significant reforms in 1999. There is no customer deposit insurance system.</paragraph><paragraph>Benin has a lively and diversified microfinance sector. Data from 2003 by the Central Bank stated a penetration rate of microfinance services of almost 60 percent. In 2006 the Ministry of Microfinance and Employment of Youth and Women counted 762 organizations with 1308 branches, including Cooperatives, NGOs, Savings/Credit Associations and government projects. Programmes for strengthening the sector are carried out on national and regional levels, such as the PRAFIDE (Programme Rgional dAppui la finance Dcentralise). The microfinance sector is also subject to supervision through the Central Bank as well as the responsible Ministry for Microfinance and Employment of Youth and Women.</paragraph><paragraph>Benin is member of the regional Bourse Regional des Valeur Mobilis (BRVM) located in Abidjan, Cte d'Ivoire. Stocks were issued by a number of companies in the region. Listed bonds were partly issued by companies and partly by governments of the West African Monetary and Economic Union (UEMOA).</paragraph><paragraph>The payment and settlement system and clearing mechanisms were reformed in 2004 through the BCEAO and offer RTGS and SWIFT access to banks, financial institutions, the stock exchange as well as the Central bank and special banks.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.mfw4a.org/benin/benin-financial-sector-profile.html'>MFW4A Benin: Financial Sector Profile</link></extension></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Banque Internationale du Bnin</target></link><space/>(BI.BE)</listitem><listitem><link><target>Bank of Africa</target></link><space/>Benin</listitem><listitem><link><target>Continental Bank</target></link><space/>Benin</listitem><listitem><link><target>Diamond Bank Benin</target></link><space/>(DBB)</listitem><listitem><link><target>Ecobank</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Financial Bank</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Finadev</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Caisse Nationale d'Epargne</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Credit du Bnin</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Equibail</target></link></listitem></list><paragraph>United Bank of AfricaAfrica Bank for the Industry and the tradeSahelo-Saharian Bank of the Industry and Trade Development</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Agriculture in Benin</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Fishing in Benin</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Mulindabigwi
