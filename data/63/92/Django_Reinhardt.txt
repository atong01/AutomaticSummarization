Reinhardt is regarded as one of the greatest guitar players of all time; he was the first important European jazz musician who made major contributions to the development of the guitar genre. After his fourth and fifth fingers were paralyzed when he suffered burns in a fire, Reinhardt used only the index and middle finger of his left hand on his solos. He created an entirely new style of jazz guitar technique (sometimes called 'hot' jazz guitar), which has since become a [[Gypsy jazz|living musical tradition]] within French [[Romani people|Gypsy]] culture. With violinist [[Stéphane Grappelli]], Reinhardt co-founded the [[Quintette du Hot Club de France]], described by critic Thom Jurek as "one of the most original bands in the history of recorded jazz".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|last=Jurek|first=Thom|title=The Hot Jazz: Le Hot Club De France, Vols. 1-4|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-hot-jazz-le-hot-club-de-france-vols-1-4-r531911/review |publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> Reinhardt's most popular compositions have become [[jazz standards]], including "[[Minor Swing (song)|Minor Swing]]", "Daphne", "Belleville", "Djangology", "Swing '42", and "[[Nuages (song)|Nuages]]".

His family made [[Caning (furniture)|cane furniture]] for a living, but its members included several keen amateur musicians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=14}}</ref>

Reinhardt was attracted to music at an early age, first playing the violin. At the age of 12, he received a [[Guitjo (six-string)|banjo-guitar]] as a gift. He quickly learned to play, mimicking the fingerings of musicians he watched. His first known recordings, made in 1928, were of him playing the banjo. By age 13, Reinhardt was able to make a living playing music. He received little formal education and acquired the rudiments of literacy only in adult life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=13}}</ref>

===The injury===
At age 18 in 1928 in [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis]], Reinhardt was injured in a fire which ravaged the caravan he shared with [[Florine "Bella" Mayer]], his first wife.<ref>{{cite book|first=Pierre|last=Marty|title= Django ressuscité : contribution à l'étude d'une auto-rééducation fonctionnelle en 1928 |publisher= Copédit |year=2005|isbn= 2906030910 }}</ref> They were very poor, and to supplement their income, Bella made imitation flowers out of [[celluloid]] and paper. Returning from a performance late one night, Reinhardt apparently knocked over a candle on his way to bed, igniting these highly flammable materials. While his family and neighbours were quick to pull him to safety, he received first- and second-degree burns over half his body. His right leg was paralysed, and the fourth and fifth fingers of his left hand were badly burned. Doctors believed that he would never play guitar again and intended to amputate one of his legs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=43–44}}</ref> Reinhardt refused to have the surgery and left the hospital after a short time; he was able to walk within a year with the aid of a cane.

His brother [[Joseph Reinhardt]], also an accomplished guitarist, bought Django a new guitar. With rehabilitation and practice, he relearned his craft in a completely new way, even as his fourth and fifth fingers remained partially paralysed. He played all his guitar solos with only two fingers, and used the two injured digits only for chord work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=31–35}}</ref>

In 1929, Reinhardt's estranged wife Florine gave birth to a son named Henri "Lousson" Reinhardt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotclub.co.uk/gypsyworld/index.php?title=Lousson_Reinhardt|title=Lousson Reinhardt|work=Gypsy Jazz Encyclopedia|accessdate=7 April 2010}}</ref>

===Discovery of jazz===
The years between 1929 and 1933 were formative musically for Reinhardt. One development was his abandonment of the guitjo in favour of the guitar. He first heard American jazz during this period, when acquaintance [[Émile Savitry]] played him a number of records from his collection: he was particularly impressed with [[Louis Armstrong]], whom he called "my brother".<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=50}}</ref> Shortly afterwards Reinhardt met [[Stéphane Grappelli]], a young violinist with very similar musical interests. In the absence of paid work in their radical new music, the two would [[jam session|jam]] together, along with a loose circle of other musicians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=26}}</ref> Finally, Reinhardt acquired his first [[Selmer guitar]] in the mid-1930s. He used the volume and expressiveness of the instrument as integral to his style.

===Formation of the quintet===
[[Image:Django&Grappelli (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Reinhardt and Grappelli]]
In 1934, [[Hot Club de France]] secretary Pierre Nourry invited Reinhardt and violinist [[Stéphane Grappelli]] to form the "[[Quintette du Hot Club de France]]," with Reinhardt's brother [[Joseph Reinhardt|Joseph]] and [[Roger Chaput]] on guitar, and [[Louis Vola]] on bass.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Dregni|title=Django Reinhardt and the Illustrated History of Gypsy Jazz|publisher=Speck Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1-933108-10-0|pages=45–59}}</ref> Occasionally Chaput was replaced by Reinhardt's best friend and fellow Gypsy, [[Pierre Ferret|Pierre "Baro" Ferret]]. Vocalist [[Freddy Taylor (musician)|Freddy Taylor]] participated in a few songs, such as "[[Georgia on My Mind]]" and "[[Nagasaki (song)|Nagasaki]]". [[Jean Sablon]] was the first singer to record with Reinhardt; the pair recording more than 30 songs from 1933. They also used their guitars for percussive sounds, as they had no true percussion section. The Quintette du Hot Club de France (in some of its versions at least) was one of the few well-known jazz ensembles composed only of stringed instruments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=64–66}}</ref>

In Paris on 14 March 1933, Reinhardt recorded two takes each of "Parce-que je vous aime" and "Si, j'aime Suzy", vocal numbers with lots of guitar fills and guitar support. He used three guitarists along with an [[accordion]] lead, violin, and bass. In August 1934, he made other recordings with more than one guitar (Joseph Reinhardt, Roger Chaput, and Django), including the first recording by the Quintette. In both years, it should be noted, the great majority of their recordings featured a wide variety of horns, often in multiples, piano, and other instruments.<ref name="djangomontreal">{{cite web|last=Rousseau|first=François|title=Welcome|url=http://www.djangomontreal.com/Django_Montreal/Welcome.html |publisher=Django Montreal|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> But, the all-string format is the one most often adopted by emulators of the Hot Club sound.

Decca Records in the U.S.A. released three records of Quintette songs with Reinhardt on guitar, and one other labeled "Stephane Grappelly & His Hot 4 with Django Reinhardt" in 1935.<ref>http://www.78discography.com/Dec23000.htm 11.21.2014</ref>

Reinhardt also played and recorded with many American jazz musicians, such as [[Adelaide Hall]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Benny Carter]], and [[Rex Stewart]] (who later stayed in Paris). He participated in a jam-session and radio performance with [[Louis Armstrong]]. Later in his career, Reinhardt played with [[Dizzy Gillespie]] in France. Reinhardt and the Hot Club of France used the [[Selmer Maccaferri]], the first commercially available guitars with a [[Cutaway (guitar)|cutaway]] and later with an aluminium-reinforced neck. In 1937, American jazz singer [[Adelaide Hall]] opened a nightclub, 'La Grosse Pomme,' in Montmartre with her husband Bert Hicks. She sang there nightly and hired the [[Quintette du Hot Club de France]] as one of the house bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://midniteinparis.tumblr.com/post/9935090286/performer-adelaide-hall-and-her-husband-manager |title=Midnight in Paris, Performer Adelaide Hall and her husband/manager |publisher=Midniteinparis.tumblr.com |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.paulvernonchester.com/DjangoHaunts.htm] {{wayback|url=http://www.paulvernonchester.com/DjangoHaunts.htm |date=20141021122637 }}</ref> Also in the neighbourhood was the artistic salon [[R-26 (salon)|R-26]], at which Reinhardt and Grappelli performed regularly as they developed their unique musical style.<ref>Tranchant, Jean: ''La Grande Roue;'' Éditions de la Table Ronde, Paris, 1969.</ref>

===World War II===
When [[World War II]] broke out, the original quintet was on tour in the United Kingdom. Reinhardt returned to Paris at once,<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=98–99}}</ref> leaving his wife in the UK. Grappelli remained in the United Kingdom for the duration of the war. Reinhardt reformed the quintet, with [[Hubert Rostaing]] on [[clarinet]] replacing Grappelli's violin.<ref name="sharp"/>

In 1943, Reinhardt married Sophie "Naguine" Ziegler in [[Salbris]]. They had a son, [[Babik Reinhardt]], who later became a respected guitarist in his own right.<ref name="sharp">{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=Fred|title=Babik Reinhardt|url=http://www.hotclub.co.uk/html/babik.html |publisher=The Django Reinhardt Swing Page|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>

Reinhardt survived the war unscathed, unlike many Gypsies who were interned and killed in the [[Porajmos]], the [[Nazi]] regime's systematic murder of several hundred thousand European Gypsies. Aware of the risk, he made several unsuccessful attempts to escape from occupied France with his family. He survived in part due to protection of surreptitiously jazz-loving Germans, such as Luftwaffe officer Dietrich Schulz-Köhn, nicknamed "Doktor Jazz".<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|last=Kington|first=Miles|title=Playing a Dangerous Game: Django, Jazz and the Nazis|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/djangoreinhardt.shtml |publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>

The Nazis officially disapproved of jazz.<ref name="holocaust">{{cite web|last=Fackler|first=Guido|title=Jazz Under the Nazis|url=http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/politics-and-propaganda/third-reich/jazz-under-the-nazis/ |publisher=Music and the Holocaust|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> Reinhardt tried to develop other musical directions. He tried to write a Mass for the Gypsies and a Symphony (he worked with an assistant to notate what he was improvising). His modernist piece, ''Rhythm Futur,'' was intended to be acceptable. <!--Reinhardt's post-war poverty, fishing, painting, and wandering, ref Dregni-->

===United States tour===
[[File:Django Reinhardt and Duke Ellington (Gottlieb).jpg|thumb|Reinhardt and Duke Ellington at the Aquarium in New York, c. November 1946]]
After the war, Reinhardt rejoined Grappelli in the UK. In the autumn of 1946, he made his first tour in the United States, debuting at [[Cleveland Music Hall]]<ref>[http://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/525 "Django Reinhardt at the Music Hall"], Cleveland Historical Society, Retrieved 7 August 2013.</ref> as a special guest soloist with [[Duke Ellington]] and His Orchestra. He played with many notable musicians and composers such as [[Maury Deutsch]]. At the end of the tour, Reinhardt played two nights at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City; he received a great ovation and took six curtain calls on the first night. Despite Reinhardt's great pride in touring with Ellington (one of his two letters to Grappelli relates his excitement), he was not fully integrated into the band. He played a few tunes at the end of the show, backed by Ellington, with no special arrangements written for him. After the tour, Reinhardt secured an engagement at Café Society Uptown, where he played four solos a day, backed by the resident band. These performances drew large audiences.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=138–139}}</ref>

Reinhardt was reportedly given an untuned guitar to play, which took him five minutes to tune{{when|date=January 2015}}{{where|date=January 2015}}. Having failed to take along a Selmer Modèle Jazz, which he had made famous, he had to play on a borrowed electric guitar. He was unable to express the delicacy of his style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=138}}</ref>

He had been promised some jobs in California but these failed to develop. Tired of waiting, Reinhardt returned to France in February 1947.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=141}}</ref>

===After the quintet===
After his return, Reinhardt became re-immersed in Gypsy life, finding it difficult to adjust to the postwar world. He sometimes showed up for scheduled concerts without a guitar or amplifier, or wandered off to the park or beach. On a few occasions he refused to get out of bed. Reinhardt developed a reputation among his band, fans, and managers as being extremely unreliable. He skipped sold-out concerts to "walk to the beach" or "smell the dew".<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=145–160}}</ref> During this period he continued to attend the [[R-26 (salon)|R-26]] artistic salon in Montmartre, improvising with his devoted collaborator, Stéphane Grappelli.<ref>Tranchant, Jean: pg. 116, ''La Grande Roue;'' Éditions de la Table Ronde, Paris, 1969.</ref><ref>De Visscher, Éric. R. vingt-six. ''Django Reinhardt - Swing De Paris.'' Musée de la musique (Cité de la musique), Paris. 6 October 2012.</ref>

In Rome in 1949, Reinhardt recruited three Italian jazz players (on bass, piano, and snare drum) and recorded his final (double) album, ''Djangology''. He was united with Grappelli, and used his acoustic Selmer-Maccaferri. The recording was discovered in the late 1950s, when it was issued for the first time.<ref name="chester">{{cite web|last=Chester|first=Paul Vernon|title=Django in Rome: The 1949-50 Sessions|url=http://www.paulvernonchester.com/DjangoInRome.htm |publisher=Manouche Maestro|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>

===Final years===
[[Image:Django Reinhardt Plaque Samois.JPG|right|thumb|Plaque commemorating Reinhardt at [[Samois-sur-Seine]]]]
In 1951, Reinhardt retired to [[Samois-sur-Seine]], near [[Fontainebleau]], where he lived until his death. He continued to play in Paris jazz clubs and began playing electric guitar. (He often used a Selmer fitted with an electric pickup, despite his initial hesitation about the instrument.) His final recordings made with his "Nouvelle Quintette" in the last few months of his life show him moving in a new musical direction; he had assimilated the vocabulary of [[bebop]] and fused it with his own melodic style.<ref>{{cite book|first=Benjamin|last=Givan|title=The Music of Django Reinhardt|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-472-03408-6|pages=158–94}}</ref>

While walking from the [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne|Avon]] railway station after playing in a Paris club, he collapsed outside his house from a [[brain hemorrhage]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=160}}</ref>
It was a Saturday and it took a full day for a doctor to arrive.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=161}}</ref> Reinhardt was declared [[dead on arrival]] at the hospital in Fontainebleau at the age of 43.

==Family==
Reinhardt's second son, [[Babik Reinhardt|Babik]], became a guitarist in the contemporary jazz style. His first son, Lousson, was more of a traditionalist. He followed the Romani lifestyle and rarely performed in public.
After Django died, his brother Joseph at first swore to abandon music, but he was persuaded to perform and record again. Joseph's son Markus Reinhardt is a violinist in the Romani style.

A third generation of direct descendants has developed as musicians: David Reinhardt, Reinhardt's grandson (by his son Babik), leads his own trio.  Dallas Baumgartner, a grandson by Lousson, is a guitarist who travels with the Romani and keeps a low public profile.

Django had a cousin, Schnuckenack Reinhardt,<ref>[[:de:Schnuckenack Reinhardt|Schnuckenack Reinhardt (German language)]]</ref> who was a violinist. Schnuckenack lived in Germany, and the two never met. Many of his descendants, such as his grandson Lulo Reinhardt, are also involved in gypsy music.

==Legacy==
{{Main|Gypsy jazz}}
For about a decade after Reinhardt's death, interest in his musical style was minimal. In the fifties, [[bebop]] superseded [[swing music|swing]] in jazz, [[rock and roll]] took off, and electric instruments became dominant in popular music. Reinhardt's friends and sidemen, such as [[Pierre Ferret]] and his brothers, continued to perform their own version of gypsy swing.

Since the mid-sixties, there has been a revival of interest in Reinhardt's music. Acoustic music was revived with the [[folk music|folk]] movement. Several of Reinhardt's near-contemporaries, such as Paul "Tchan Tchou" Vidal, recorded for the first time in the sixties and seventies.

In 1973 Stéphane Grappelli formed a successful Quintette-style band with British guitarists [[Diz Disley]] and [[Denny Wright]]. Grappelli formed many other musical partnerships, including [[John Etheridge]], [[Nigel Kennedy]] and [[David Grisman]], and became very popular. He influenced other musicians, such as Dutch violinist [[Tim Kliphuis]].

New generations began to emerge, for instance, [[Jimmy Rosenberg|Jimmy]] and [[Stochelo Rosenberg]], [[Paulus Schäfer]] and their relatives from the [[Netherlands]]. Another musical clan is the Reinhardt brothers and cousins from [[Germany]], distant relatives of Reinhardt's.

[[Boulou Ferré]], son of "Matelot" Ferret, was a child prodigy who entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 13, and studied under [[Olivier Messiaen]]. He continues to perform with his brother Elios; they can mix bebop and classical music with gypsy swing. [[Biréli Lagrène]] and [[Angelo Debarre]] were other prodigies.

Most of the above-mentioned are Roma who learned music by the 'gypsy method', involving intense practice, direct imitation of older musicians (often family members) and playing by ear, with little formal musical study. Since the late 1970s, workshops, books and videos have become available, allowing musicians worldwide to master the style.

An early non-Roma gypsy-style guitarist was [[René Didi Duprat]] (b. 1926). Contemporary guitarists include [[John Jorgenson]], [[Jon Larsen]] (and his [[Hot Club de Norvège]], established 1979); [[Joscho Stephan]], [[Andreas Öberg]], [[Frank Vignola]], [[George Cole (musician)|George Cole]], [[Stephane Wrembel]] and [[Reynold Philipsek]]. Their music is sometimes jokingly referred to as "Gadjo jazz" (''Gadjo'' is the Romani term for a non-Romani.) {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Young players such as [[Adrien Moignard]] and [[Gwenole Cahue]] represent the rising generation. The popularity of gypsy jazz has generated as increasing number of festivals, such as the [[Samois-sur-Seine]] festival (started about 1980), the various [[DjangoFest]]s held in the USA, and [http://djangoinjune.com Django in June], an annual camp for Gypsy jazz musicians and aficionados.

==Influence==
Many guitar players, and musicians, have expressed admiration for Django Reinhardt, or have cited him as a major influence. [[Jeff Beck]] has described Reinhardt as "By far the most astonishing guitar player ever..." and "...quite superhuman..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.djangobooks.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=2725&start=0 |title=• View topic - Jeff Beck on Django |publisher=Djangobooks.com |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>

[[Grateful Dead]]'s [[Jerry Garcia]] and Black Sabbath's [[Tony Iommi]], both of whom lost fingers in accidents, were inspired by Reinhardt's example of becoming an accomplished guitar player/musician, despite his injuries. Jerry Garcia was quoted in June 1985 in ''Frets Magazine'': 
<blockquote>"His technique is awesome! Even today, nobody has really come to the state that he was playing at. As good as players are, they haven’t gotten to where he is. There’s a lot of guys that play fast and a lot of guys that play clean, and the guitar has come a long way as far as speed and clarity go, but nobody plays with the whole fullness of expression that Django has. I mean, the combination of incredible speed – all the speed you could possibly want – but also the thing of every note have a specific personality. You don’t hear it. I really haven’t heard it anywhere but with Django".</blockquote>
* Members of [[Paul McCartney]]'s band [[Wings (band)|Wings]], both [[Denny Laine]] and [[Jimmy McCulloch]] have mentioned him as an inspiration.
*"Django," an instrumental guitar piece by renowned blues-rock guitarist [[Joe Bonamassa]], is in his honour. The piece was influenced by the violin introduction of "Vous et Moi" (Blues et Mineur, 1942, Brussels), in which Reinhardt played the violin. ''Vous et Moi (You and Me'') became the title of Bonamassa's sixth album, where the track first appeared in 2006. Slightly longer live versions appear on ''LIVE...From Nowhere in Particular'' (2009), and in DVD from his 4 May concert at [[Royal Albert Hall]]. 
*"Django," composed by [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]], has become a jazz standard performed by musicians such as Miles Davis. The [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] titled one of their albums ''[[Django (Modern Jazz Quartet album)|Django]]'' in his honour. 
*The [[Allman Brothers Band]] song "[[Jessica (Allman Brothers Band song)|Jessica]]" was written by [[Dickey Betts]] in tribute to Reinhardt. 
*[[Camel (band)|Camel]]'s [[Andrew Latimer]] has talked of being influenced by Reinhardt.<ref>[http://www.hit-channel.com/interviewandy-latimer-camel/55489]</ref>

*Cuban composer and guitarist [[Leo Brouwer]] composed ''Variations on a Theme of Django Reinhardt'' for solo guitar (1984). It is based on ''Nuages'', by Reinhardt.
*In 2005, Django Reinhardt was ranked as 66th in the list of ''The Greatest Belgian'' (''[[De Grootste Belg]]'') in [[Flanders]], and 76th in the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] version of the same competition ''[[Le plus grand Belge]]''.
