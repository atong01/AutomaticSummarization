'''Asociación Alumni''', usually just '''Alumni''', is a [[rugby union]] club located in [[Tortuguitas]], [[Greater Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. The senior squad currently competes at [[Torneo de la URBA|Grupo I]], the first division of [[Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires]] league system.

The club has ties with former [[association football]] club [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]] because both were established by [[Buenos Aires English High School]] students.

==History==
===Background===
{{Main|Alumni Athletic Club}}
The first club with the name "Alumni" played [[association football]], having been found in 1898 by students of [[Buenos Aires English High School]] (BAEHS) along with director [[Alexander Watson Hutton]]. Originally under the name "English High School A.C.", the team would be later obliged by the [[Argentine Football Association|Association]] to change its name, therefore "Alumni" was chosen, following a proposal by Carlos Bowers, a former student of the school.

Alumni was the most successful team during the first years of Argentine football, winning 10 of 14 [[Argentine Primera División|league championships]] contested. Alumni is still considered the first great football team in the country.<ref name=clarin>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/04/24/d-549894.htm "En el nombre del fútbol", ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' newspaper, 2003-04-24]</ref> Alumni was reorganised in 1908, "in order to encourage people to practise all kind of sports, specially football". This was the last try to develop itself as a sports club rather than just a football team, such as Lomas, Belgrano and [[Quilmes Atlético Club|Quilmes]] had successfully done in the past, but the efforts were not enough. Alumni played its last game in [[1911 in Argentine football|1911]] and was definitely dissolved on April 24, 1913.

===Rebirth through rugby===
In 1951 a group of BAEHS students asked school's alumni for permission to re-establish the name "Alumni" for a rugby union team. This request was immediately approved in a meeting presided by Carlos Bowers, who had proposed the name "Alumni" to the original football team 50 years before.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20121108143046/http://www.asociacionalumni.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6&Itemid=71 "Los comienzos de Alumni" - club's official website] (Archive, 8 Nov 2012)</ref>

The team achieved good results and in 1960 the club presented a team that won the third division of the [[Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires league]], reaching the second division. Since then, Alumni has played at the highest level of Argentinian rugby and its rivalry with [[Belgrano Athletic Club]] is one of the fiercest [[Local derby|local derbies]] in [[Buenos Aires]]. Alumni would later climb up to first division winning 5 titles: 4 consecutive between 1989 and 1992, and the other in 2001.

In 2002, Alumni won its first [[Nacional de Clubes]] title, defeating [[Jockey Club de Rosario]] 23-21 in the final.
