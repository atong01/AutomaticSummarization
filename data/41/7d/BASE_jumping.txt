'''BASE jumping''', also sometimes written as '''B.A.S.E. jumping''', is [[parachuting]] or [[wingsuit flying]] from a fixed structure or cliff. "BASE" is an [[acronym]] that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: [[building]], [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], [[Span (architecture)|span]], and Earth ([[cliff]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basenumbers.org/ |title=BASENumbers.org |publisher=BASENumbers.org |accessdate=2014-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sangiro |url=http://www.basejumper.com |title=BASE Jumping Resource and Community |publisher=Basejumper.com |accessdate=2014-02-03}}</ref> Due to the lower altitudes of the jumps, BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous than [[skydiving]] from a plane. In the U.S., BASE jumping is currently regarded by many as a fringe [[extreme sport]] or [[stunt]].<ref name=ch-trib-thrill>{{cite news |last=Dizikes |first=Cynthia |title=BASE jumpers fall for thrill-seeking lifestyle |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-04-22/news/ct-met-basejumping-20110421_1_base-jumpers-thrill-arrest |accessdate=15 March 2012 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=April 22, 2011}}</ref> In some jurisdictions or locations, BASE jumping is prohibited or illegal; in some places, however, it is permitted. BASE jumping became known to the wider public by depictions of BASE jumping in a number of action movies.

==History==
The acronym "B.A.S.E." (now more commonly "BASE") was coined by filmmaker [[Carl Boenish]], his wife Jean Boenish, Phil Smith, and Phil Mayfield.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rosenblatt|first=Roger|title=The Whole World Is Jumpable|journal=Time|date=July 1999|volume=154|issue=3|page=94|issn=0040781X}}</ref>  Carl Boenish was the catalyst behind modern BASE jumping, and in 1978, he filmed the first BASE jumps to be made using ram-air parachutes and the [[Tracking (freeflying)|freefall tracking technique]] (from [[El Capitan]], in [[Yosemite National Park]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCallum|first=Jack|title=Who Needs An Airplane?|date=August 26, 1985|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|volume=63|issue=9}}</ref> While BASE jumps had been made prior to that time, the El Capitan activity was the effective birth of what is now called BASE jumping.

BASE numbers are awarded to those who have made at least one jump from each of the four categories (buildings, antennas, spans and earth). When Phil Smith and Phil Mayfield jumped together from a Houston skyscraper on 18 January 1981, they became the first to attain the exclusive BASE numbers (BASE #1 and #2, respectively), having already jumped from an antenna, [[span (architecture)|spans]], and earthen objects. Jean and Carl Boenish qualified for BASE numbers 3 and 4 soon after. A separate "award" was soon enacted for Night BASE jumping when Mayfield completed each category at night, becoming Night BASE #1, with Smith qualifying a few weeks later.

[[Faust Vrancic]] is widely believed to have performed a parachute jumping experiment for real<ref>

However, these and other sporadic incidents were one-time experiments, not the systematic pursuit of a new form of parachuting. After 1978, the filmed jumps from El Capitan were repeated, not as a publicity exercise or as a movie stunt, but as a true recreational activity. It was this that popularised BASE jumping more widely among parachutists.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Carl Boenish continued to publish films and informational magazines on BASE jumping until his death in 1984 after a BASE-jump off of the [[Troll Wall]]. By this time, the concept had spread among skydivers worldwide, with hundreds of participants making fixed-object jumps.

During the early eighties, nearly all BASE jumps were made using standard skydiving equipment, including two parachutes (main and reserve), and deployment components. Later on, specialized equipment and techniques were developed specifically for the unique needs of BASE jumping.

Upon completing a jump from all of the four object categories, a jumper may choose to apply for a "BASE number", which are awarded sequentially.<ref name="numbers">{{cite web|url=http://www.basenumbers.org/ |title=Base Numbers |publisher=Base Numbers |accessdate=2010-05-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100511195457/http://www.basenumbers.org/| archivedate= 11 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> BASE #1 was awarded to Phil Smith of Houston, Texas in 1981. The 1000th application for a BASE number was filed in March 2005 and BASE #1000 was awarded to Matt "Harley" Moilanen of Grand Rapids, Michigan. {{As of|2014|12}}, over 1,850 BASE numbers have been issued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basenumbers.org/ui.asp |title=BASENumbers.org |publisher=BASENumbers.org |accessdate=2014-12-18}}</ref>

BASE jumping is often featured in action movies. The 2002 [[Vin Diesel]] film ''[[xXx (film)|xXx]]'' includes a scene where Diesel's character catapults himself off the [[Foresthill Bridge]] in an open-topped car, landing safely as the car crashes on the ground. In the movie ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life]]'', includes the scene in which the main characters jump with [[wing suit]]s from the IFC Tower in [[Hong Kong]] and fly over the Bank of China, finally opening their parachutes to land on a moving freighter. The stunt was done live, with no special effects, by base jumpers Martin Rosén and Per Eriksson, members of the Swedish "Team Bautasten". The scene was filmed by air-to-air camera man Mikael Nordqvist from the same team. Since the 1976 [[Mount Asgard]] jump featured in the pre-credits sequence to ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', James Bond movies have featured several BASE jumps, including one from the [[Eiffel Tower]] in 1985's ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] in 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', and in ''[[Die Another Day]]'', 2002, [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[James Bond]] jumps from a melting iceberg. Of the James Bond jumps only the Mt Asgard and Eiffel Tower jumps were filmed live; the rest were special effects. And in 2005's "[[Batman Begins]]", Bruce Wayne uses BASE jumping as inspiration for his memory cloth cape. A series of BASE jumps are featured in the video for a remix of [[M83 (band)|M83]]'s "Lower Your Eyelids to Die With the Sun".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jmLb2pZzUc |title=Video for "Lower Your Eyelids to Die With the Sun" by M83 (KTWC's Electropic Remix) |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref>

''[[Guinness World Records]]'' first listed a BASE jumping record with [[Carl Boenish]]'s 1984 leap from Trollveggen ([[Troll Wall]]) in Norway. It was described as the highest BASE jump.<ref name="record">Here meaning "greatest vertical descent," not "highest starting elevation."</ref> (The jump was made two days before Boenish's death at the same site.) This record category is still in the ''Guinness'' book and is currently held by Australians [[Glenn Singleman]] and Heather Swan with a jump from [[Meru Peak]] in northern India at a starting elevation of {{convert|6604|m|ft}}.<ref name="Meru">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/leap-from-the-top-of-the-world/2006/06/08/1149359863372.html |title=Leap from the top of the world - World |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2006-06-08 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>  On July 8, 2006 Captain Daniel G. Schilling set the Guinness World Record for the most BASE jumps in a twenty-four hour period. Schilling jumped off the [[Perrine Bridge]] in Twin Falls, Idaho a record 201 times.

BASE competitions have been held since the early 1980s, with accurate landings or free fall aerobatics used as the judging criteria. Recent years have seen a formal competition held at the {{convert|452|m|ft}} high [[Petronas Towers]] in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, judged on landing accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Comparison with skydiving==
[[File:03WAVRE006b.jpg|thumb|right|BASE jumping from antenna tower]]
[[File:BASE Jumping from Sapphire Tower in Istanbul.jpg|thumb|BASE Jumping from [[Istanbul Sapphire|Sapphire Tower]], [[Istanbul]].]]

BASE jumping grew out of skydiving. BASE jumps are generally made from much lower altitudes than skydives, and a BASE jump takes place close to the object serving as the jump platform. Because BASE jumps generally entail slower airspeeds than typical skydives (due to the limited altitude), a BASE jumper does not always reach [[terminal velocity]]. Because higher airspeeds enable jumpers more aerodynamic control of their bodies, as well as more positive and quick parachute openings, the longer the delay, the better. BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous than similar sports such as [[skydiving]] from aircraft.<ref name="ch-trib-thrill"/>

Skydivers use the air flow to stabilize their position, allowing the parachute to deploy cleanly. BASE jumpers, falling at lower speeds, have less aerodynamic control, and may tumble. The [[aircraft attitude|attitude]] of the body at the moment of jumping determines the stability of flight in the first few seconds, before sufficient airspeed has built up to enable aerodynamic stability. On low BASE jumps, parachute deployment takes place during this early phase of flight, so if a poor "launch" leads into a tumble, the jumper may not be able to correct this before the opening. If the parachute is deployed while the jumper is tumbling, there is a high risk of entanglement or malfunction. The jumper may also not be facing the right direction. Such an off-heading opening is not as problematic in skydiving, but an off-heading opening that results in object strike has caused many serious injuries and deaths in BASE jumping.

At an altitude of {{convert|600|m}}, having been in free-fall for at least {{convert|300|m}}, the jumper is falling at approximately {{convert|55|m/s|mph}}, and is approximately 10.9 seconds from the ground. Most BASE jumps are made from less than {{convert|600|m}}. For example, a BASE jump from a {{convert|150|m}} object is about 5.6 seconds from the ground if the jumper remains in free fall. On a BASE jump, the parachute must open at about half the airspeed of a similar skydive, and more quickly (in a shorter distance fallen). Standard skydiving parachute systems are not designed for this situation, so BASE jumpers often use specially designed harnesses and parachute containers, with extra large pilot chutes, and many jump with only one parachute, since there would be little time to utilize a reserve parachute. If modified, by removing the bag and slider, stowing the lines in a tail pocket, and fitting a large pilot chute, standard skydiving gear can be used for lower BASE jumps, but is then prone to kinds of malfunction that are rare in normal skydiving (such as "line-overs" and broken lines).

Another risk is that most BASE jumping venues have very small areas in which to land. A beginner skydiver, after parachute deployment, may have a three minute or more parachute ride to the ground. A BASE jump from {{convert|150|m}} will have a parachute ride of only 10 to 15 seconds.

One way to make a parachute open very quickly is to use a [[static line]] or direct bag. These devices form an attachment between the parachute and the jump platform, which stretches out the parachute and suspension lines as the jumper falls, before separating and allowing the parachute to inflate. This method enables the very lowest jumps — below {{convert|60|m}} — to be made, although most BASE jumpers are more motivated to make higher jumps involving free fall. This method is similar to the [[paratrooper]]'s deployment system, also called a PCA (Pilot Chute Assist).

==Legal issues==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
{{Globalize|section|date=June 2015}}
The legal issues concern permissions to use the object from which the jump is initiated and the area used for landing.

Surreptitious BASE jumps are often made from tall buildings and antenna towers. Many such BASE jumps must be covert because the owners of these objects are generally reluctant to allow their object to be used as a platform. While BASE jumping itself is generally not illegal, making events such as the "Go Fast Games" at the [[Royal Gorge Bridge]] possible, the covert nature of accessing objects usually necessitates trespassing on an object. Jumpers who are caught can expect to be charged with trespassing, as well as having charges like breaking and entering, reckless endangerment, vandalism, or other such charges pressed against them. Other people accompanying the jumper, such as ground crew, may also face charges. In some jurisdictions it may be permissible to use land until specifically told not to. [[Perrine Bridge]] in [[Twin Falls, Idaho]], is an example of a man-made structure in the United States where BASE jumping is allowed year-round without a permit.

[[File:BASE jumping - Perrine Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|A BASE jumper leaving the [[Perrine Bridge]] in [[Idaho]]]]
Once a year, on the third Saturday in October ("[[Bridge Day]]"), permission to BASE jump has explicitly been granted at the [[New River Gorge Bridge]] in [[Fayetteville, West Virginia]]. The New River Gorge Bridge deck is 876 feet (297 m) above the river. This annual event attracts about 450 BASE jumpers and nearly 200,000 spectators.<ref name=bridge-day>{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgeday.info |title=Bridge Day 2013 - BASE Jumping Registration and Event Information |publisher=Bridgeday.info |accessdate=2014-02-04}}</ref> 1,100 jumps may occur during the six hours that it is legal provided good conditions.  For many skydivers who would like to try BASE jumping, this bridge will be the only fixed object from which they ever jump. On 21 October 2006, veteran BASE jumper [[Brian Lee Schubert]] of [[Alta Loma, Rancho Cucamonga, California|Alta Loma, California]] died while jumping from the New River Gorge Bridge during Bridge Day activities because his parachute opened late; he plummeted to his death in the waters below. Jumps continued after the recovery of his body.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-10-21-wv-jump_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=BASE jumper dies at bridge event in West Virginia | date=22 October 2006 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> He and his friend [[Michael Pelkey]] were the first to make a BASE jump from [[El Capitan]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1966.

The [[National Park Service]] (NPS) has the authority to ban specific activities in [[US National Parks]] and has done so for BASE jumping. The authority comes from 36 CFR 2.17(3), which prohibits, "Delivering or retrieving a person or object by parachute, helicopter, or other airborne means, except in emergencies involving public safety or serious property loss, or pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit." Under that Regulation, BASE is not banned, but is allowable if a permit is issued by the Superintendent, which means that a mechanism to allow BASE in National Parks was always in place. The 2001 National Park Service Management Policies state that BASE "is not an appropriate public use activity within national park areas ..." (2001 Management Policy 8.2.2.7.)  However, Policy 8.2.2.7 in the 2006 volume of National Park Service Management Policies, which superseded the 2001 edition, states "Parachuting (or BASE jumping), whether from an aircraft, structure, or natural feature, is generally prohibited by 36 CFR 2.17(a)(3). However, if determined through a park planning process to be an appropriate activity, it may be allowed pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit."

During the early days of BASE jumping, the NPS issued permits that authorized jumps from [[El Capitan]]. This program ran for three months in 1980 and then collapsed amid allegations of abuse by unauthorized jumpers. The NPS has since vigorously enforced the ban, charging jumpers with "aerial delivery into a National Park".  Although one jumper drowned in the [[Merced River]] while being chased by Park Rangers intent on arresting him, illegal jumps continue in Yosemite at a rate estimated at a few hundred per year, often at night or dawn. El Capitan, [[Half Dome]] and [[Glacier Point]] have been used as jump sites.

Other US public land, including land controlled by the [[Bureau of Land Management]], does not ban air delivery,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}  and there are numerous jumpable objects on BLM land.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The legal position is different at other sites and in other countries. For example, in Norway's [[Lysefjord]] (from the mountain [[Kjerag]]), BASE jumpers are made welcome. Many sites in the European Alps, near [[Chamonix]] and on the [[Eiger]], are also open to jumpers. Some other Norwegian places, like the [[Troll Wall]], are banned because of dangerous rescue missions in the past. In Austria, jumping from mountain cliffs is generally allowed, whereas the use of bridges (such as the [[Europabruecke]] near [[Innsbruck]], [[Tirol (state)|Tirol]]) or dams is generally prohibited. Australia has some of the toughest stances on BASE jumping:{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} it specifically bans BASE jumping from certain objects, such as the [[Sydney Harbor Bridge]].
