This definition no more involves any reference to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies during a lapse of time. It is from this definition that I deduce the principles of logic by mathematical reasoning, and by mathematical reasoning that, I aver, will support criticism of [[Weierstrass]]ian severity, and that is perfectly evident.

Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his &quot;Illustrations of the Logic of Science&quot; series of articles. In the second one,<space/><xhtml:span id="defs"></xhtml:span>&quot;<link><target>s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear</target><part>How to Make Our Ideas Clear</part></link>&quot;, Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used, even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.</listitem><listitem>Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea &quot;distinct&quot;, that is, clarified by analysis of just what makes it applicable.

After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which<space/><italics>would</italics><space/>be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opiniona dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Induction">&quot;That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead&quot;, in Peirce (1878 April), &quot;The Probability of Induction&quot;, p.<space/><link type='external' href='https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up'>718</link><space/>(via<space/><italics>Internet Archive</italics><space/>) in<space/><italics>Popular Science Monthly</italics>, v. 12, pp. 70518.

His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth.

Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief.

Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the &quot;facile and natural&quot;, as by<space/><link><target>Galileo</target></link>'s natural light of reason and as distinct from &quot;logical simplicity&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>See also Nubiola, Jaime (2004), &quot;<link type='external' href='http://www.unav.es/users/LumeNaturale.html'>Il Lume Naturale: Abduction and God</link>&quot;,<space/><italics>Semiotiche</italics><space/>I/2, 91102.</extension><space/>Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference.

Crude or Gradual in procedure. Crude Induction, founded on experience in one mass (CP 2.759), presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience (CP 2.756). Gradual Induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test, and is Qualitative or Quantitative. Qualitative Gradual Induction depends on estimating the relative evident weights of the various qualities of the subject class under investigation (CP 2.759; see also CP 7.11420). Quantitative Gradual Induction depends on how often, in a fair sample of instances of<space/><italics>S</italics>,<space/><italics>S</italics><space/>is found actually accompanied by<space/><italics>P</italics><space/>that was predicted for<space/><italics>S</italics><space/>(CP 2.758).
