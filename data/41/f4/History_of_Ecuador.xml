It remained a part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1720, when it joined the newly created<space/><link><target>Viceroyalty of New Granada</target></link>; within the viceroyalty, however, Ecuador was awarded its own audiencia in 1563, allowing it to deal directly with Madrid on certain matters. The<space/><link><target>Royal Audience of Quito</target><part>Quito Audiencia</part></link>, which was both a court of justice and an advisory body to the viceroy, consisted of a president and several judges (oidores).</paragraph><paragraph>The most common form in which the Spanish occupied the land was the<space/><link><target>encomienda</target></link>. By the early 17th century, there were some 500 encomiendas in Ecuador. Although many consisted of quite sizable haciendas, they were generally much smaller than the estates commonly found elsewhere in South America. A multitude of reforms and regulations did not prevent the encomienda from becoming a system of virtual slavery of the Native Ecuadorians, estimated at about one-half the total Ecuadorian population, who lived on them. In 1589 the president of the audiencia recognized that many Spaniards were accepting grants only to sell them and undertake urban occupations, and he stopped distributing new lands to Spaniards; however, the institution of the encomienda persisted until nearly the end of the colonial period.</paragraph><paragraph>The coastal lowlands north of Manta were conquered, not by the Spanish, but by blacks from the Guinean coast who, as slaves, were shipwrecked en route from Panama to Peru in 1570. The blacks killed or enslaved the native males and married the females, and within a generation they constituted a population of<space/><link><target>zambo</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>that resisted Spanish authority until the end of the century and afterwards managed to retain a great deal of political and cultural independence.</paragraph><paragraph>The coastal economy revolved around shipping and trade. Guayaquil, despite being destroyed on several occasions by fire and incessantly plagued by either yellow fever or malaria, was a center of vigorous trade among the colonies, a trade that was technically illegal under the mercantilist philosophy of the contemporary Spanish rulers. Guayaquil also became the largest shipbuilding center on the west coast of South America before the end of the colonial period.</paragraph><paragraph>The Ecuadorian economy, like that in the mother country, suffered a severe depression throughout most of the 18th century. Textile production dropped an estimated 50 to 75 percent between 1700 and 1800. Ecuador's cities gradually fell into ruins, and by 1790 the elite was reduced to poverty, selling haciendas and jewelry in order to subsist. The Native Ecuadorian population, in contrast, probably experienced an overall improvement in its situation, as the closing of the obrajes commonly led Native Ecuadorians to work under less arduous conditions on either haciendas or traditional communal lands. Ecuador's economic woes were, no doubt, compounded by the expulsion of the<space/><link><target>Jesuits</target></link><space/>in 1767 by<space/><link><target>King Charles III of Spain</target></link>. Missions in the Oriente were abandoned, and many of the best schools and the most efficient haciendas and obrajes lost the key that made them outstanding institutions in colonial Ecuador.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Jesuits of Quito during the Colonial era</heading><paragraph>Father<space/><link><target>Rafael Ferrer (Jesuit)</target><part>Rafael Ferrer</part></link><space/>was the first Jesuita de Quito (Jesuit of Quito) to explore and found missions in the upper Amazon regions of<space/><link><target>South America</target></link><space/>from 1602 to 1610, which at that period belonged to the<space/><link><target>Audiencia of Quito</target></link>, that was a part of the<space/><link><target>Viceroyalty of Peru</target></link><space/>until the Audiencia of Quito was transferred to the newly created<space/><link><target>Viceroyalty of New Granada</target></link><space/>in 1717.

The expedition disembarked from the Napo river February 16, 1639, and arrived in what is today Par Brazil, on the banks of the Amazon river on December 12, 1639. In 1641, Father Cristobal de Acua published in Madrid a memoire of his expedition to the Amazon river. The title of the memoire is called Nuevo Descubrimiento del gran rio de las Amazonas, and it was used by academics as a fundamental reference pertaining to the Amazon region.</paragraph><paragraph>Between 1637 and 1652, there were 14 missions established along the<space/><link><target>Maraon river</target></link><space/>and its southern tributaries the Huallaga and the Ucayali rivers.

Because of the constant plague of epidemics (smallpox and measles) and warfare with other tribes and the Bandeirantes, the total number of Jesuit Missions were reduced to 40 by 1744.

A group of Quito's leading citizens followed suit, and on August 10, 1809, they seized power in the name of Ferdinand from the local representatives, whom they accused of preparing to recognize Joseph Bonaparte. Thus, this early revolt against colonial rule (one of the first in Spanish America) was, paradoxically, an expression of loyalty to the Spanish king.</paragraph><paragraph>It quickly became apparent that Quito's Criollo rebels lacked the anticipated popular support for their cause. As loyalist troops approached Quito, they peacefully turned power back to the crown authorities. Despite assurances against reprisals, the returning Spanish authorities proved to be merciless with the rebels and, in the process of ferreting out participants in the Quito revolt, jailed and abused many innocent citizens. Their actions, in turn, bred popular resentment among Quiteos, who, after several days of street fighting in August 1810, won an agreement to be governed by a junta composed with a majority of Criollos, although with the Peninsular president of the<space/><link><target>Royal Audience of Quito</target></link><space/>acting as its head.</paragraph><paragraph>In spite of strong opposition from the Quito Audiencia, the Junta called for a congress in December 1811 and declared the entire area of the audiencia to be independent of any government currently in Spain.

Shortly thereafter, the Junta elected to launch a military offensive against loyalist regions to the south in Peru, but the poorly trained and badly equipped troops were no match for those of the Viceroy of Peru, which finally crushed the Quiteo rebellion in December 1812.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Gran Colombia</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Gran Colombia</arg></template><link><target>Image:AJSucre.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>General Antonio Jos de Sucre, Commander In Chief, ''Divisin del Sur''</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The second chapter in Ecuador's struggle for emancipation from Spanish colonial rule began in Guayaquil, where independence was proclaimed in October 1820 by a local patriotic junta under the leadership of the poet<space/><link><target>Jos Joaqun de Olmedo</target></link>.

After a campaign that included the near destruction of Guayaquil, the forces of Gran Colombia, under the leadership of Sucre and Venezuelan General<space/><link><target>Juan Jos Flores</target></link>, proved victorious. The Treaty of 1829 fixed the border on the line that had divided the Quito audiencia and the<space/><link><target>Viceroyalty of Peru</target></link><space/>before independence.</paragraph><paragraph>The population of Ecuador was divided during these years among three segments: those favoring the status quo, those supporting union with Peru, and those advocating independence for the former audiencia. The latter group was to prevail following Venezuela's withdrawal from Gran Colombia at the very moment that an 1830 constitutional congress had been called in an ultimately futile effort to stem the growing separatist tendencies throughout country. In May of that year, a group of Quito notables met to dissolve the union with Gran Colombia, and in August, a constituent assembly drew up a constitution for the State of Ecuador, so named for its geographic proximity to the equator, and placed General Flores in charge of political and military affairs. He remained the dominant political figure during Ecuador's first 15 years of independence.</paragraph><heading level='2'>The Republic of Ecuador</heading><heading level='3'>The early republic</heading><paragraph><template><target>further2</target><arg>[[History of Ecuador (1830â€“1860)]]</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Ecuador1830.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>250px</part><part>Ecuador in 1830</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Before the year 1830 drew to a close, both<space/><link><target>Antonio Jos de Sucre</target><part>Marshal Sucre</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Simn Bolvar</target></link><space/>would be dead, the former murdered (on orders from a jealous General Flores, according to some historians) and the latter from<space/><link><target>tuberculosis</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Juan Jos Flores</target></link>, known as the founder of the republic, was of the foreign military variety.

Military expenditures, from the independence wars and from an unsuccessful campaign to wrest<space/><link><target>Valle del Cauca Department</target><part>Cauca Province</part></link><space/>from Colombia in 1832, kept the state treasury empty while other matters were left unattended.</paragraph><paragraph>Discontent had become nationwide by 1845, when an insurrection in Guayaquil forced Flores from the country.

The marcistas fought among themselves almost ceaselessly and also had to struggle against Flores's repeated attempts from exile to overthrow the government. The most significant figure of the era, however, was General<space/><link><target>Jos Mara Urbina</target></link>, who first came to power in 1851 through a coup d'tat, remained in the presidency until 1856, and then continued to dominate the political scene until 1860.

This action was outrageous enough to unite some previously disparate elements. Garca Moreno, putting aside both his project to place Ecuador under a French protectorate and his differences with General Flores, got together with the former dictator to put down the various local rebellions and force out the Peruvians. The final push of this effort was the defeat of Franco's Peruvian-backed forces at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Guayaquil</target></link>, which led to the overturning of the Treaty of Mapasingue.

Production of cacao, the most important export product in the late 19th century, grew from 6.5 million kilograms (14 million pounds) to 18 million kilograms (40 million pounds) during the same period. The agricultural export interests, centered in the coastal region near Guayaquil, became closely associated with the Liberals, whose political power also grew steadily during the interval. After the death of Garca Moreno, it took the Liberals twenty years to consolidate their strength sufficiently to assume control of the government in Quito.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Ecuador1893.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>250px</part><part>Ecuador in 1893</part></link></paragraph><heading level='4'>The liberal era (1895-1925)</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Eloy Alfaro.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Eloy Alfaro</part></link><template><target>further2</target><arg>[[History of Ecuador (1895â€“1925)]]</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The new era brought in liberalism.<space/><link><target>Eloy Alfaro</target></link>, under whose direction the government headed out to aid those in the rural sectors of the coast, is credited for finishing the construction of the railroad connecting Guayaquil and Quito, the separation of church and state, establishment of many public schools, implementing civil rights (such as freedom of speech), and the legalization of civil marriages and divorce.</paragraph><paragraph>Alfaro was also confronted by a dissident tendency inside his own party, directed by its General<space/><link><target>Leonidas Plaza</target></link><space/>and constituted by the upper middle class of Guayaquil.

Arroyo partisans were promptly jailed or sent into exile, while Velasco verbally baited the business community and the rest of the political right.

After dismissing the assembly, Velasco held elections for a new assembly, which in 1946 drafted a far more conservative constitution that met with the president's approval. For this brief period, Conservatives replaced the left as Velasco's base of support.</paragraph><paragraph>Rather than attending to the nation's economic problems, however, Velasco aggravated them by financing the dubious schemes of his associates. Inflation continued unabated, as did its negative impact on the national standard of living, and by 1947 foreign exchange reserves had fallen to dangerously low levels.

No doubt Galo Plaza's most important contribution to Ecuadorian political culture was his commitment to the principles and practices of democracy. As president he managed to foment the agricultural exports of Ecuador during his government, creating economic stability.

There were impressive indicators of economic growth between 1972 and 1979: The government budget expanded some 540 percent, whereas exports as well as per capita income increased a full 500 percent.

Massive foreign borrowing, initiated during the years of the second military regime and continued under Rolds, resulted in a foreign debt that by 1983 was nearly US$7 billion. The nation's petroleum reserves declined sharply during the early 1980s because of exploration failures and rapidly increasing domestic consumption. The economic crisis was aggravated in 1982 and 1983 by drastic climatic changes, bringing severe drought as well as flooding, precipitated by the appearance of the unusually warm ocean current known as &quot;El Nio&quot;. Analysts estimated damage to the nation's infrastructure at US$640 million, with balance-of-payments losses of some US$300 million. The real gross domestic product fell to 2% in 1982 and to -3.3% in 1983. The rate of inflation in 1983, 52.5%, was the highest ever recorded in the nation's history.</paragraph><paragraph>Outside observers noted that, however unpopular, Hurtado deserved credit for keeping Ecuador in good standing with the international financial community and for consolidating Ecuador's democratic political system under extremely difficult conditions.
