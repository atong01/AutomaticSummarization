'''Biotite''' is a common [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicate]] [[mineral]] within the [[mica]] group, with the approximate [[chemical formula]] {{chem|K(Mg,Fe)|3|AlSi|3|O|10|(F,OH)|2}}. More generally, it refers to the dark mica series, primarily a [[solid solution|solid-solution]] series between the [[iron]]-endmember [[annite]],  and the [[magnesium]]-endmember [[phlogopite]]; more [[Aluminium|aluminous]] end-members include [[siderophyllite]]. Biotite was named by [[Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann|J.F.L. Hausmann]] in 1847 in honor of the French [[physicist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]], who, in 1816, researched the [[Optical mineralogy|optical properties]] of [[mica]], discovering many properties.<ref>{{cite book| author = Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann| title = Handbuch der Mineralogie| url = http://books.google.com/?id=gqgTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA674| year = 1828| publisher = Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht| isbn = | page = 674 }} "Zur Bezeichnung des sogenannten einachsigen Glimmers ist hier der Name Biotit gewählt worden, um daran zu erinnern, daß Biot es war, der zuerst auf die optische Verschiedenheit der Glimmerarten aufmerksam machte."  (For the designation of so-called uniaxial mica, the name "biotite" has been chosen in order to recall that it was Biot who first called attention to the optical differences between types of mica.)</ref>

Biotite is a [[Silicate_minerals#Phyllosilicates|sheet silicate]]. [[Iron]], [[magnesium]], [[aluminium]], [[silicon]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]] form sheets that are weakly bound together by [[potassium]] [[ion]]s. It is sometimes called "iron mica" because it is more iron-rich than phlogopite. It is also sometimes called "black mica" as opposed to "white mica" ([[muscovite]]) – both form in some [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], and in some instances side-by-side.

==Properties==
Like other [[mica]] minerals, biotite has a highly perfect [[basal cleavage]], and consists of flexible sheets, or [[Lamellae (materials)|lamellae]], which easily flake off.  It has a [[monoclinic crystal system]], with [[tabular]] to [[Prism (geometry)|prismatic]] crystals with an obvious [[pinacoid]] [[termination]].  It has four prism faces and two pinacoid faces to form a [[pseudohexagonal]] crystal.  Although not easily seen because of the cleavage and sheets, fracture is uneven. It appears greenish to brown or black, and even yellow when [[weathering|weathered]]. It can be transparent to opaque, has a vitreous to pearly [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]], and a grey-white [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]]. When biotite is found in large chunks, they are called “books” because it resembles a book with pages of many sheets.

Biotite [[Solvation|dissolves]] in both [[acid]] and [[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]] [[aqueous solution]]s, with the highest [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] rates at low [[pH]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Malmström|first1=Maria|last2=Banwart|first2=Steven|title=Biotite dissolution at 25°C: The pH dependence of dissolution rate and stoichiometry|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|date=July 1997|volume=61|issue=14|pages=2779–2799|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00093-8}}</ref> However, biotite dissolution is highly [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] with crystal edge surfaces ([[Miller index|''h k''0]]) reacting 45 to 132 times faster than basal surfaces ([[Miller index|001]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hodson|first1=Mark E.|title=Does reactive surface area depend on grain size?

Under [[Polarized light microscopy|cross-polarized light]] biotite can generally be identified by the gnarled [[Bird's eye maple (mineral property)|bird's eye extinction]].

==Occurrence==
Biotite is found in a wide variety of [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks]]. For instance, biotite occurs in the [[lava]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and in the Monzoni intrusive complex of the western [[Dolomites]]. It is an essential [[phenocryst]] in some varieties of [[lamprophyre]]. Biotite is occasionally found in large cleavable crystals, especially in [[pegmatite]] veins, as in [[New England]], [[Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]]. Other notable occurrences include [[Bancroft, Ontario|Bancroft]] and [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]]. It is an essential constituent of many metamorphic [[schist]]s, and it forms in suitable compositions over a wide range of [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. It has been estimated that biotite comprises up to 7% of the exposed continental crust.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nesbitt|first1=H.W|last2=Young|first2=G.M|title=Prediction of some weathering trends of plutonic and volcanic rocks based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|date=July 1984|volume=48|issue=7|pages=1523–1534|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(84)90408-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016703784904083}}</ref>

The largest documented single crystals of biotite were approximately {{convert|7|m2|abbr=on}} sheets found in [[Iveland]], Norway.<ref>{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = P. C. Rickwood}}</ref>

==Uses==
[[Image:MeroxeneSomma.png|thumb|left|biotite: Topotype deposit]]
Biotite is used extensively to constrain ages of rocks, by either [[potassium-argon dating]] or [[argon-argon dating]]. Because [[argon]] escapes readily from the biotite crystal structure at high temperatures, these methods may provide only minimum ages for many rocks. Biotite is also useful in assessing temperature histories of metamorphic rocks, because the partitioning of [[iron]] and [[magnesium]] between biotite and [[garnet]] is sensitive to temperature.
