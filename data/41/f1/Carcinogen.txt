A '''carcinogen''' is any substance, [[radionuclide]], or [[radiation]] that is an agent directly involved in causing [[cancer]]. This may be due to the ability to damage the [[genome]] or to the disruption of cellular [[metabolic]] processes. Several radioactive substances are considered carcinogens, but their carcinogenic activity is attributed to the radiation, for example [[gamma ray]]s and [[alpha particle]]s, which they emit. Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled [[asbestos]], certain [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], and [[tobacco]] smoke.  Although the public generally associates carcinogenicity with synthetic chemicals, it is equally likely to arise in both natural and synthetic substances.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0027-5107(99)00194-3 | title = Paracelsus to parascience: The environmental cancer distraction | year = 2000 | last1 = Ames | first1 = Bruce N | last2 = Gold | first2 = Lois Swirsky | journal = Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis | volume = 447 | pages = 3}}</ref> Carcinogens are not necessarily immediately [[Toxicity|toxic]], thus their effect can be insidious.

[[Cancer]] is any disease in which normal cells are damaged and do not undergo [[programmed cell death]] as fast as they divide via [[mitosis]]. Carcinogens may increase the risk of cancer by altering cellular metabolism or damaging [[DNA]] directly in [[cell (biology)|cells]], which interferes with [[biology|biological]] processes, and induces the uncontrolled, malignant division, ultimately leading to the formation of tumors. Usually, severe DNA damage leads to [[apoptosis]], but if the programmed cell death pathway is damaged, then the cell cannot prevent itself from becoming a cancer cell.

There are many natural carcinogens. [[Aflatoxin]] B<sub>1</sub>, which is produced by the [[fungus]] ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' growing on stored [[cereal|grains]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] and [[peanut butter]], is an example of a potent, naturally occurring [[microbe|microbial]] carcinogen. Certain viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] and [[human papilloma virus]] have been found to cause cancer in humans. The first one shown to cause cancer in animals is [[Rous sarcoma virus]], discovered in 1910 by [[Peyton Rous]].  Other [[infection|infectious]] organisms which cause cancer in humans include some [[bacteria]] (e.g. ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' <ref name="pmid16367902">{{cite journal | author = Hatakeyama M, Higashi H | title = Helicobacter pylori CagA: a new paradigm for bacterial carcinogenesis | journal = Cancer Science | volume = 96 | issue = 12 | pages = 835–843 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16367902 | doi = 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00130.x }}</ref><ref name="pmid24011243">{{cite journal | author = González CA, Sala N, Rokkas T | title = Gastric cancer: epidemiologic aspects | journal = Helicobacter | volume = 18 | issue = Supplement 1 | pages = 34–38 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24011243 | doi = 10.1111/hel.12082 }}</ref>) and [[helminth]]s (e.g. ''[[Opisthorchis viverrini]]'' <ref name="pmid17622191 ">{{cite journal | author = Sripa B, Kaewkes S, Sithithaworn P, Mairiang E, Laha T, Smout M, Pairojkul C, Bhudhisawasdi V, Tesana S, Thinkamrop B, Bethony JM, Loukas A, Brindley PJ | title = Liver fluke induces cholangiocarcinoma | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 1148–1155 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17622191 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0040201 | pmc=1913093}}</ref> and ''[[Clonorchis sinensis]]'' <ref>{{cite journal | author = Rustagi T, Dasanu CA | title = Risk Factors for Gallbladder Cancer and Cholangiocarcinoma: Similarities, Differences and Updates | journal = Journal of Gastrointestinal Cancer | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–147 | year = 2012 | pmid = 21597894 | doi = 10.1007/s12029-011-9284-y }}</ref>).

[[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]], [[benzene]], [[kepone]], [[1,2-Dibromoethane|EDB]], and [[asbestos]] have all been classified as carcinogenic.<ref name="roc" /> As far back as the 1930s, [[Industry|industrial]] smoke and [[tobacco]] smoke were identified as sources of dozens of carcinogens, including [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], tobacco-specific [[nitrosamine]]s such as [[N-Nitrosonornicotine|nitrosonornicotine]], and reactive [[aldehyde]]s such as [[formaldehyde]]—which is also a hazard in [[embalming]] and making [[plastic]]s. [[Vinyl chloride]], from which [[PVC]] is manufactured, is a carcinogen and thus a hazard in PVC production.

[[Co-carcinogen]]s are chemicals that do not necessarily cause cancer on their own, but promote the activity of other carcinogens in causing cancer.

After the carcinogen enters the body, the body makes an attempt to eliminate it through a process called [[biotransformation]]. The purpose of these reactions is to make the carcinogen more [[water-soluble]] so that it can be removed from the body. However, in some cases, these reactions can also convert a less toxic carcinogen into a more toxic carcinogen.

DNA is [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]], therefore soluble carbon electrophiles are carcinogenic, because DNA [[nucleophilic attack|attacks]] them. For example, some [[alkene]]s are [[Toxication|toxicated]] by human enzymes to produce an [[Electrophile|electrophilic]] epoxide. DNA attacks the epoxide, and is bound permanently to it. This is the mechanism behind the carcinogenicity of [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]] in tobacco smoke, other aromatics, aflatoxin and mustard gas.

== Radiation ==
{{Main|radiation-induced cancer}}
[[CERCLA]] identifies all [[radionuclide]]s as carcinogens, although the nature of the emitted [[Radioactive decay|radiation]] ([[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]], [[gamma ray|gamma]], or [[Neutron radiation|neutron]] and the radioactive strength), its consequent capacity to cause [[ionization]] in tissues, and the magnitude of radiation exposure, determine the potential hazard. Carcinogenicity of radiation depends of the type of radiation, type of exposure, and penetration. For example, [[alpha particle|alpha radiation]] has low penetration and is not a hazard outside the body, but emitters are carcinogenic when inhaled or ingested.  For example, [[Thorotrast]], a (incidentally radioactive) [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] previously used as a [[Radiocontrast|contrast]] medium in [[x-ray]] diagnostics, is a potent human carcinogen known because of its retention within various [[organ (biology)|organs]] and persistent emission of alpha particles.  Low level ionizing radiation may induce irreparable DNA damage (leading to replicational and transcriptional errors needed for neoplasia or may trigger viral interactions) leading to pre-mature aging and [[cancer]].<ref>Acharya, PVN; The Effect of Ionizing Radiation on the Formation of Age-Correlated Oligo Deoxyribo Nucleo Phospheryl Peptides in Mammalian Cells; 10th International Congress of Gerontology, Jerusalem.

Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic. Low-energy waves on the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] including [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared radiation]] and [[visible light]] are thought not to be, because they have insufficient energy to break chemical bonds. Evidence for carcinogenic effects of non-ionizing radiation is generally [[Electromagnetic radiation and health|inconclusive]], though there are some documented cases of radar technicians with prolonged high exposure experiencing significantly higher cancer incidence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Richter E, Berman T, Ben-Michael E, Laster R, Westin JB | title = Cancer in radar technicians exposed to radiofrequency/microwave radiation: Sentinel episodes | journal = International journal of occupational and environmental health | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–193 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10926722 | doi=10.1179/oeh.2000.6.3.187}}</ref> 

Higher-energy radiation, including [[ultraviolet radiation]] (present in [[sunlight]]), x-rays, and [[gamma radiation]], generally ''is'' carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses.   For most people, ultraviolet radiations from sunlight is the commonest cause of skin cancer.  In Australia, where people with pale skin are often exposed to strong sunlight, [[melanoma]] is the most common cancer diagnosed in people aged 15–44 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org.au/cancersmartlifestyle/SunSmart/Skincancerfactsandfigures.htm| title=Skin Cancer Facts and Figures|accessdate= 2010-07-02}}</ref><ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13922-skintone-gene-could-predict-cancer-risk.html Skin-tone gene could predict cancer risk]</ref>

Substances or [[Food irradiation|foods]] irradiated with electrons or electromagnetic radiation (such as microwave, X-ray or gamma) are not carcinogenic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In contrast, non-electromagnetic [[neutron radiation]] produced inside nuclear reactors can produce secondary radiation through [[nuclear transmutation]].

== Mechanisms of carcinogenicity ==
Carcinogens can be classified as genotoxic or nongenotoxic. [[Genotoxin]]s cause irreversible genetic damage or mutations by binding to [[DNA]]. Genotoxins include chemical agents like [[N-nitroso-N-methylurea]] (NMU) or non-chemical agents such as [[ultraviolet light]] and [[ionizing radiation]]. Certain viruses can also act as carcinogens by interacting with DNA.

Nongenotoxins do not directly affect DNA but act in other ways to promote growth. These include hormones and some organic compounds.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=The Gale Encyclopedia of Cancer: A guide to Cancer and its Treatments, Second Edition. Page no. 137 }}</ref>

=== International Agency for Research on Cancer ===
The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) is an intergovernmental agency established in 1965, which forms part of the [[World Health Organization]] of the [[United Nations]]. It is based in [[Lyon]], [[France]]. Since 1971 it has published a series of ''Monographs on the Evaluation                          of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ |title=IARC Monographs |publisher=Monographs.iarc.fr |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22}}</ref> that have been highly influential in the classification of possible carcinogens.
* [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1]]: the agent (mixture) is definitely carcinogenic to humans. The exposure circumstance entails exposures that are carcinogenic to humans.
* [[List of IARC Group 2A carcinogens|Group 2A]]: the agent (mixture) is probably carcinogenic to humans. The exposure circumstance entails exposures that are probably carcinogenic to humans.
* [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]]: the agent (mixture) is possibly carcinogenic to humans. The exposure circumstance entails exposures that are possibly carcinogenic to humans.
* [[List of IARC Group 3 carcinogens|Group 3]]: the agent (mixture or exposure circumstance) is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.
* [[List of IARC Group 4 carcinogens|Group 4]]: the agent (mixture) is probably not carcinogenic to humans.

=== Globally Harmonized System ===
The [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) is a [[United Nations]] initiative to attempt to harmonize the different systems of assessing chemical risk which currently exist (as of March 2009) around the world. It classifies carcinogens into two categories, of which the first may be divided again into subcategories if so desired by the competent regulatory authority:
* Category 1: known or presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans
** Category 1A: the assessment is based primarily on human evidence
** Category 1B: the assessment is based primarily on animal evidence
* Category 2: suspected human carcinogens

=== U.S. National Toxicology Program ===
The [[National Toxicology Program]] of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] is mandated to produce a biennial ''Report on Carcinogens''.<ref>Section 301(b)(4) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Section 262, Pub.&nbsp;L. 95–622.</ref> As of June 2011, the latest edition was the 12th report (2011).<ref name="roc">[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/index.cfm?objectid=32BA9724-F1F6-975E-7FCE50709CB4C932 ''Report on Carcinogens, Eleventh Edition'']; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Toxicology Program (2011).</ref> It classifies carcinogens into two groups:
* Known to be a human carcinogen
* Reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen

=== American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists ===
The [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH) is a private organization best known for its publication of [[threshold limit value]]s (TLVs) for occupational exposure and monographs on workplace chemical hazards. It assesses carcinogenicity as part of wider assessment of the occupational hazards of chemicals.
* Group A1: Confirmed human carcinogen
* Group A2: Suspected human carcinogen
* Group A3: Confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans
* Group A4: Not classifiable as a human carcinogen
* Group A5: Not suspected as a human carcinogen

=== European Union ===
The European Union classification of carcinogens is contained in the [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] and the [[Dangerous Preparations Directive]]. It consists of three categories:
* Category 1: Substances known to be carcinogenic to humans.
* Category 2: Substances which should be regarded as if they are carcinogenic to humans.
* Category 3: Substances which cause concern for humans, owing to possible carcinogenic effects but in respect of which the available information is not adequate for making a satisfactory assessment.
This assessment scheme is being phased out in favor of the GHS scheme (see above), to which it is very close in category definitions.

=== Safe Work Australia ===
Under a previous name, the NOHSC, in 1999 [[Safe Work Australia]] published the Approved Criteria for Classifying Hazardous Substances [NOHSC:1008(1999)].<ref name="Safe Work Australia3">[http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/AboutSafeWorkAustralia/WhatWeDo/Publications/Documents/504/Approved_Criteria_classifying_Hazardous_Substances_NOHSC1008_1999_2nd_Edition.pdf Safe Work Australia], NOHSC. (1999). Approved criteria for classifying hazardous substances [NOHSC:1008(1999)] §&nbsp;4.76. Accessed 21/05/2011</ref>
Section 4.76 of this document outlines the criteria for classifying carcinogens as approved by the Australian government. This classification consists of three categories:
* Category 1: Substances known to be carcinogenic to humans.
* Category 2: Substances that should be regarded as if they were carcinogenic to humans.
* Category 3: Substances that have possible carcinogenic effects in humans but about which there is insufficient information to make an assessment.

==Procarcinogen== <!--Procarcinogen redirects here-->
A procarcinogen is a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] to a carcinogen. One example is [[nitrite]]s when taken in by the diet. They are not carcinogenic themselves, but turn into [[nitrosamine]]s in the body, which are carcinogenic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lactospore.com/glossary.htm |title=Web definitions for Procarcinogen |publisher=Lactospore.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22}}</ref>

[[Lung cancer]] is the most common cancer in the world, both in terms of cases (1.6 million cases; 12.7% of total cancer cases) and deaths (1.4 million deaths; 18.2% of total cancer deaths).<ref name=Ferlay>{{cite journal | author = Ferlay J, Shin HR, Bray F, Forman D, Mathers C, Parkin DM | year = 2010 | title = Estimates of worldwide burden of cancer in 2008: GLOBOCAN 2008 | url = | journal = Int J Cancer | volume = 127 | issue = 12| pages = 2893–917 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.25516 | pmid = 21351269 }}</ref>  Lung cancer is largely caused by tobacco smoke.  Risk estimates for lung cancer in the United States indicate that tobacco smoke is responsible for 90% of lung cancers.  Other factors are implicated in lung cancer, and these factors can interact synergistically with smoking, so that total attributable risk adds up to more than 100%.  These factors include occupational exposure to carcinogens (about 9-15%), radon (10%) and outdoor air pollution (1-2%).<ref>Alberg AJ, Ford JG, Samet JM (2007). Epidemiology of lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition).  American College of Chest Physicians. ''Chest'' 132(3 Suppl):29S-55S.  {{DOI|10.1378/chest.07-1347}} PMID 17873159</ref>  Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of more than 5,300 identified chemicals.  The most important carcinogens in tobacco smoke have been determined by a “Margin of Exposure” approach.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cunningham FH, Fiebelkorn S, Johnson M, Meredith C | year = 2011 | title = A novel application of the Margin of Exposure approach: segregation of tobacco smoke toxicants | url = | journal = Food Chem Toxicol | volume = 49 | issue = 11| pages = 2921–33 | doi = 10.1016/j.fct.2011.07.019 | pmid = 21802474 }}</ref>  Using this approach, the most important tumorigenic compounds in tobacco smoke were, in order of importance, acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide and isoprene.  Most of these compounds cause DNA damage by forming DNA adducts or by inducing other alterations in DNA.<ref name=Bernstein2013 />  DNA damages are subject to error-prone DNA repair or can cause replication errors.  Such errors in repair or replication can result in mutations in tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes leading to cancer.

===Breast cancer===
[[Breast cancer]] is the second most common cancer [(1.4 million cases, 10.9%), but ranks 5th as cause of death (458,000, 6.1%)].<ref name=Ferlay />  Increased risk of breast cancer is associated with persistently elevated blood levels of estrogen.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yager JD, Davidson NE | year = 2006 | title = Estrogen carcinogenesis in breast cancer | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 354 | issue = 3| pages = 270–82 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra050776 | pmid = 16421368 }}</ref>  Estrogen appears to contribute to breast carcinogenesis by three processes; (1) the metabolism of estrogen to genotoxic, mutagenic carcinogens, (2) the stimulation of tissue growth, and (3) the repression of phase II detoxification enzymes that metabolize ROS leading to increased oxidative DNA damage.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ansell PJ, Espinosa-Nicholas C, Curran EM, Judy BM, Philips BJ, Hannink M, Lubahn DB | year = 2004 | title = In vitro and in vivo regulation of antioxidant response element-dependent gene expression by estrogens | url = | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 145 | issue = 1| pages = 311–317 | doi = 10.1210/en.2003-0817 | pmid = 14551226 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Belous AR, Hachey DL, Dawling S, Roodi N, Parl FF | year = 2007 | title = Cytochrome P450 1B1-mediated estrogen metabolism results in estrogen-deoxyribonucleoside adduct formation | url = | journal = Cancer Res | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 812–817 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2133 | pmid = 17234793 }}</ref><ref>Bolton JL, Thatcher GR. (2008). Potential mechanisms of estrogen quinone carcinogenesis. ''Chem Res Toxicol'' 21(1):93-101. Review. {{DOI|10.1021/tx700191p}} PMID 18052105</ref>  The major estrogen in humans, estradiol, can be metabolized to quinone derivatives that form adducts with DNA.<ref name=Yue>{{cite journal | author = Yue W, Santen RJ, Wang JP, Li Y, Verderame MF, Bocchinfuso WP, Korach KS, Devanesan P, Todorovic R, Rogan EG, Cavalieri EL | year = 2003 | title = Genotoxic metabolites of estradiol in breast: potential mechanism of estradiol induced carcinogenesis | url = | journal = J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol | volume = 86 | issue = 3-5| pages = 477–486 | pmid = 14623547 | doi=10.1016/s0960-0760(03)00377-7}}</ref>  These derivatives can cause dupurination, the removal of bases from the phosphodiester backbone of DNA, followed by inaccurate repair or replication of the apurinic site leading to mutation and eventually cancer.  This genotoxic mechanism may interact in synergy with estrogen receptor-mediated, persistent cell proliferation to ultimately cause breast cancer.<ref name=Yue /> Genetic background, dietary practices and environmental factors also likely contribute to the incidence of DNA damage and breast cancer risk.

===Colon cancer=== 

[[Colorectal cancer]] is the third most common cancer [1.2 million cases (9.4%), 608,000 deaths (8.0%)].<ref name=Ferlay /> Tobacco smoke may be responsible for up to 20% of colorectal cancers in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Giovannucci E, Martínez ME | title = Tobacco, colorectal cancer, and adenomas: A review of the evidence | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 88 | issue = 23 | pages = 1717–1730 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8944002 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/88.23.1717 }}</ref>  In addition, substantial evidence implicates bile acids as an important factor in colon cancer.  Twelve studies (summarized in Bernstein et al.<ref name=Bernstein2009>Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Payne CM, Dvorak K. (2009). Bile acids as endogenous etiologic agents in gastrointestinal cancer. World J Gastroenterol 15(27):3329-3340. {{DOI|10.3748/wjg.15.3329}} PMID 19610133</ref>) indicate that the bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA) and/or lithocholic acid (LCA) induce production of DNA damaging reactive oxygen species and/or reactive nitrogen species in human or animal colon cells.  Furthermore, 14 studies showed that DCA and LCA induce DNA damage in colon cells.  Also 27 studies reported that bile acids cause programmed cell death (apoptosis).  Increased apoptosis can result in selective survival of cells that are resistant to induction of apoptosis.<ref name=Bernstein2009 />  Colon cells with reduced ability to undergo apoptosis in response to DNA damage would tend to accumulate mutations, and such cells may give rise to colon cancer.<ref name=Bernstein2009 />  Epidemiologic studies have found that fecal bile acid concentrations are increased in populations with a high incidence of colon cancer.  Dietary increases in total fat or saturated fat result in elevated DCA and LCA in feces and elevated exposure of the colon epithelium to these bile acids.  When the bile acid DCA was added to the standard diet of wild-type mice invasive colon cancer was induced in 56% of the mice after 8 to 10 months.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bernstein C, Holubec H, Bhattacharyya AK, Nguyen H, Payne CM, Zaitlin B, Bernstein H | title = Carcinogenicity of deoxycholate, a secondary bile acid | journal = Archives of Toxicology | volume = 85 | issue = 8 | pages = 863–871 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21267546 | pmc = 3149672 | doi = 10.1007/s00204-011-0648-7 }}</ref>  Overall, the available evidence indicates that DCA and LCA are centrally important DNA-damaging carcinogens in colon cancer.

===Stomach cancer===
[[Stomach cancer]] is the fourth most common cancer [990,000 cases (7.8%), 738,000 deaths (9.7%)].<ref name=Ferlay />  ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection is the main causative factor in stomach cancer.  Chronic gastritis (inflammation) caused by ''H. pylori'' is often long-standing if not treated.  Infection of gastric epithelial cells with ''H. pylori'' results in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ding SZ, Minohara Y, Fan XJ, Wang J, Reyes VE, Patel J, Dirden-Kramer B, Boldogh I, Ernst PB, Crowe SE | year = 2007 | title = ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection induces oxidative stress and programmed cell death in human gastric epithelial cells | url = | journal = Infect Immun | volume = 75 | issue = 8| pages = 4030–4039 | pmid = 17562777 | doi=10.1128/IAI.00172-07}}</ref><ref>Handa O, Naito Y, Yoshikawa T. (2011). Redox biology and gastric carcinogenesis: the role of ''Helicobacter pylori''.  Redox Rep 16(1):1-7. doi:10.1179/174329211X12968219310756. Review. PMID 21605492</ref>  ROS cause oxidative DNA damage including the major base alteration 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG).  8-OHdG resulting from ROS is increased in chronic gastritis.  The altered DNA base can cause errors during DNA replication that have mutagenic and carcinogenic potential.  Thus ''H. pylori''-induced ROS appear to be the major carcinogens in stomach cancer because they cause oxidative DNA damage leading to carcinogenic mutations.  Diet is thought to be a contributing factor in stomach cancer - in Japan where very salty pickled foods are popular, incidence of stomach cancer is high.  Preserved meat such as bacon, sausages and ham increases the risk, while a diet high in fresh fruit and vegetables may reduce the risk. The risk also increases with age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/stomach-cancer/about/stomach-cancer-risks-and-causes |title=Stomach cancer risks and causes |work=Cancer Research UK }}</ref>
