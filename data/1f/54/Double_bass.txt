The '''double bass''' is the largest and lowest-pitched [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]] in the modern [[orchestra|symphony orchestra]]. It is a [[transposing instrument]] and is typically notated one [[octave]] higher than sounding to avoid excessive ledger lines. The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths (like a [[viol]]), rather than fifths, with strings [[standard tuning|usually tuned]] to [[scientific pitch|E1, A1, D2 and G2]]. The instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the [[viol]] or the [[violin family]].

The double bass is a standard member of the orchestra's [[string section]],<ref name="guide">[http://www.mti.dmu.ac.uk/~ahugill/manual ''The Orchestra: A User's Manual''], Andrew Hugill with the Philharmonia Orchestra</ref> as well as the [[concert band]], and is featured in [[Double bass concerto|concertos]], solo and [[chamber music]]<ref name="chamber">[http://www.earlybass.com/chamber.htm ''Chamber Music in the Vienna Double Bass Archive''], ([[Alfred Planyavsky]]</ref>  in [[European classical music|Western classical music]]. The bass is used in a range of other genres, such as [[jazz]], 1950s-style [[blues]] and [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]]/[[psychobilly]], traditional [[country music]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[Tango music|tango]] and many types of [[folk music]].

The double bass is played either with a bow (arco) or by plucking the strings ([[pizzicato]]). In orchestral repertoire and tango music, both arco and pizzicato are employed. In jazz, blues, and rockabilly, pizzicato is the norm. While classical music uses just the natural sound produced acoustically by the instrument, in jazz, blues, and related genres, the bass is typically amplified with a [[bass amplifier]].

==Description==
The double bass stands around 180&nbsp;cm (six feet) from scroll to endpin.<ref name="size">[http://www.gollihurmusic.com/faq/2-SIZES_DOUBLE_BASS_SIZING_FAQ.html ''Double Bass Sizing FAQ''], Bob Gollihur</ref> However, other sizes are available, such as a 1/2 or 3/4, which serve to accommodate a player's height and hand size. These sizes do not reflect the size relative to a full size, or 4/4 bass; a 1/2 bass is not half the size of a bass but is only slightly smaller.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amromusic.com/bass-sizes|website=Amro Music}}</ref> It is typically constructed from several types of wood, including maple for the back, spruce for the top, and ebony for the fingerboard. It is uncertain whether the instrument is a descendant of the [[viola da gamba]] or of the violin, but it is traditionally aligned with the violin family. While the double bass is nearly identical in construction to other violin family instruments, it also embodies features found in the older [[viol]] family.

==Playing style==
Like other violin and viol-family string instruments, the double bass is played either with a [[String instrument#Bowing|bow (arco)]] or by plucking the strings ([[pizzicato]]). In orchestral repertoire and tango music, both arco and pizzicato are employed. In jazz, blues, and rockabilly, pizzicato is the norm, except for some solos and also occasional written parts in [[Jazz#1980s–2000s|modern jazz]] that call for bowing.

The double bass player stands, or sits on a high stool, and leans the instrument against their body, turned slightly inward to put the strings comfortably in reach. This stance is a key reason for the bass's sloped shoulders, which mark it apart from the other members of the violin family—the narrower shoulders facilitate playing the strings in their higher registers.<ref name="size" />

==History==
[[Image:Violone PeterLely1649DutEng.png|thumb|right|240px|Some early basses were conversions of existing violones. This 1640 painting shows a violone being played.]]

The double bass is generally regarded as a modern descendant of the string family of instruments that originated in Europe in the 15th century, and as such has been described as a ''bass Violin.''<ref name="mania">[http://www.contrabass.com/pages/stringbass.html ''The Double Bass''], Jacob Head</ref>  Before the 20th century many double basses had only three strings, in contrast to the five to six strings typical of instruments in the viol family or the four strings of instruments in the violin family. The double bass's proportions are dissimilar to those of the violin and cello; for example, it is deeper (the distance from top to back is proportionally much greater than the violin). In addition, while the violin has bulging shoulders, most double basses have shoulders carved with a more acute slope, like members of the viol family. Many very old double basses have had their shoulders cut or sloped to aid playing with modern techniques. Before these modifications, the design of their shoulders was closer to instruments of the violin family.

The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths (like a viol), rather than [[Perfect fifth|fifths]] (see [[#Tuning|Tuning]] below). The issue of the instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, and the supposition that the double bass is a direct descendant of the [[viol]] family is one that has not been entirely resolved.

In his ''A New History of the Double Bass'', Paul Brun asserts, with many references, that the double bass has origins as the true bass of the [[violin family]]. He states that, while the exterior of the double bass may resemble the viola da gamba, the internal construction of the double bass is nearly identical to instruments in the [[violin family]], and very different from the internal structure of viols.<ref name="new_history">{{cite web|url=http://paulbrun.com |title='&#39;A New History of the Double Bass'&#39; |publisher=Paulbrun.com |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>

Double bass professor [[Larry Hurst]] argues that the "modern double bass is not a true member of either the violin or viol families." He says that "most likely its first general shape was that of a violone, the largest member of the viol family. Some of the earliest basses extant are violones, (including C-shaped sound holes) that have been fitted with modern trappings."<ref name="oocities.org">http://www.oocities.org/vienna/1187/Music/basshist.html</ref> Some existing instruments, such as those by [[Gasparo da Salò]], were converted from 16th-century six-string contrabass [[violone|violoni]].<ref>Planyavsky 1998</ref>

==Terminology==

A person who plays this instrument is called a "bassist", "double bassist", "double bass player", "contrabassist", "contrabass player" or "bass player". The names '''contrabass''' and  '''double bass''' refer to the instrument's range and use in the contra octave below the cello, also called the 16' octave relative to the church organ.<ref name="briefhistoryofthedoublebass">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/1187/Music/basshist.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091027140138/http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/1187/Music/basshist.html |archivedate=27 October 2009 |title=A Brief History of the Double Bass, Lawrence Hurst, Professor of Double Bass, School of Music, Indiana University |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref> The terms for the instrument among classical performers are '''contrabass''' (which comes from the instrument's Italian name, contrabbasso), '''string bass''' (to distinguish it from a brass bass instrument in a concert band), or simply '''bass'''.

In [[jazz]] and other genres outside of classical music, this instrument is commonly called the '''upright bass''' or '''acoustic bass''' to distinguish it from the electric [[bass guitar]]. In [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music]], the instrument is also referred to as a "bass fiddle" or "bass violin" (or more rarely as "doghouse bass" or "bull fiddle"). It is sometimes confusingly called the '''[[violone]]''', '''[[bass violin]]''' or '''[[bass viol]]'''. Other colourful nicknames are found in other languages; in Hungarian, for instance, the double bass is sometimes called ''nagy bőgő'', which roughly translates as "big crier," referring to its large voice.

==Design==
[[Image:busettosolano.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of a Busetto-shaped double bass: Copy of a Matthias Klotz (1700) by Rumano Solano]]
[[Image:Bassdiagram.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Principal parts of the double bass]]

In general, there are two major approaches to the design outline shape of the double bass: the ''violin form'' (shown in the labelled picture to the right); and the ''viol da gamba'' form (shown in the header picture). A third less common design, called the ''busetto'' shape, can also be found, as can the even more rare ''guitar'' or ''pear'' shape. The back of the instrument can vary from being a round, carved back similar to that of the violin, to a flat and angled back similar to the viol family.

The double bass features many parts that are similar to members of the violin family, including a bridge, [[f-hole]]s, a [[tailpiece]], a [[scroll (music)|scroll]], and a [[sound post]]. Unlike the rest of the violin family, the double bass still reflects influence, and can be considered partly derived, from the [[viol]] family of instruments, in particular the [[violone]], the bass member of the viol family.

The double bass also differs from members of the violin family in that the shoulders are typically sloped, the back is often angled (both to allow easier access to the instrument, particularly in the upper range). [[machine head|Machine tuners]] are always fitted, in contrast to the rest of the violin family, where traditional wooden friction pegs are still the primary means of tuning. Lack of standardization in design means that one double bass can sound and look very different from another.

===Construction===
The double bass is closest in construction to violins, but has some notable similarities to the violone (literally "large viol"), the largest and lowest member of the viol family. Unlike the violone, however, the fingerboard of the double bass is [[fret|unfretted]], and the double bass has fewer strings (the violone, like most viols, generally had six strings, although some specimens had five or four).

An important distinction between the double bass and other members of the violin family is the construction of the [[pegbox]]. While the violin, [[viola]], and cello all use friction [[tuning peg|pegs]] for fine tuning adjustments, the double bass has metal [[machine head]]s. The key on the tuning machine turns a metal ''worm'', which drives a [[worm gear]] that winds a string. While this development makes fine tuners unnecessary, a very small number of bassists use them nevertheless. At the base of the double bass is a metal rod with a spiked or rubberized end called the endpin, which rests on the floor. This [[endpin]] is generally thicker and more robust than that of a cello, because of the greater mass of the instrument.

The materials most often used in double bass construction are maple (back, neck, ribs), spruce (top), and ebony (fingerboard, tailpiece). Exceptions to this include less-expensive basses that have [[laminate]]d ([[plywood]]) tops, backs, and ribs, and some newer mid-range basses made of [[willow]]. These basses are resistant to changes in heat and humidity, which can cause cracks in spruce tops. Plywood laminate basses, which are used in music schools, [[youth orchestra]]s, and in popular and folk music settings, are very resistant to humidity and heat, as well to the physical abuse they are apt to encounter in a school environment (or, for blues and folk musicians, to the hazards of touring and performing in bars).

The [[soundpost]] and [[bass bar]] are components of the internal construction. All the parts of a double bass are glued together, except the soundpost, bridge, and tailpiece, which are held in place by string tension (although the soundpost usually remains in place when the instrument's strings are loosened or removed). The metal tuning machines are attached to the sides of the pegbox with metal screws. While tuning mechanisms generally differ from the higher-pitched orchestral stringed instruments, some basses have non-functional, ornamental [[tuning peg]]s projecting from the side of the pegbox, in imitation of the tuning pegs on a cello or violin.

Famous double bass makers come from around the world and often represent varied national characteristics. The most highly sought (and expensive) instruments come from Italy and include basses made by Giovanni Paolo Maggini, Gaspar da Salo, the Testore family (Carlo Antonio, Carlo Giuseppe, Gennaro, Giovanni, Paulo Antonio), Celestino Puolotti, and Matteo Gofriller. French and English basses from famous makers are also sought out by players.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Strings===
[[Image:Bridgedetail.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Detail of the bridge and strings]]
[[Image:Double bass gut strings.jpg|thumb|upright|Gut strings]]
The history of the double bass is tightly coupled to the development of string technology, as it was the advent<ref name="briefhistoryofthedoublebass"/> of [[Strings (music)#Winding|overwound]] gut strings, which first rendered the instrument more generally practicable, as (over{{nbhyph}}) wound strings attain low notes within a smaller overall string diameter than non-wound strings.<ref>[http://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/jw/strings.html#music Strings, standing waves and harmonics], Prof. Joe Wolfe, University of New South Wales</ref> Professor Larry Hurst argues that had "it not been for the appearance of the overwound gut string in the 1650s, the double bass would surely have become extinct."<ref name="oocities.org"/> because thicknesses needed for regular gut strings made the lower-pitched strings almost unplayable.

Prior to the mid-20th century,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} double bass strings were usually made of [[Catgut|gut]], but, since that time, steel has largely replaced it, because steel strings hold their pitch better and yield more volume when played with the bow.<ref name="bow_wood">[http://doublebassworkshop.com/double-bass-strings-articles-44 Article on bass strings by the Double Bass Workshop] {{wayback|url=http://doublebassworkshop.com/double-bass-strings-articles-44 |date=20120325185214 }}</ref> Gut strings are also more vulnerable to changes of humidity and temperature, and break more easily than steel strings.

Gut strings are nowadays mostly used by bassists who perform in [[Baroque music|baroque]] ensembles, [[rockabilly]] bands, traditional [[blues]] bands, and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands. In some cases, the low E and A are wound in silver, to give them added mass. Gut strings provide the dark, "thumpy" sound heard on 1940s and 1950s recordings. The late Jeff Sarli, a blues upright bassist, said that, "Starting in the 1950s, they began to reset the necks on basses for steel strings."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffsarli.com/js/default.asp |title=Jeff Sarli |publisher=Jeff Sarli |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref> Rockabilly and bluegrass bassists also prefer gut because it is much easier to perform the "[[Slapping (music)|slapping]]" upright bass style (in which the strings are percussively slapped and clicked against the fingerboard) with gut strings than with steel strings. (For more information on slapping, see the sections below on [[#Modern playing styles|Modern playing styles]], [[#Double bass in bluegrass music|Double bass in bluegrass music]], [[#Double bass in jazz|Double bass in jazz]], and [[#Double bass in popular music|Double bass in popular music]]).

The change from gut to steel has also affected the instrument's playing technique over the last hundred years. Steel strings can be set up closer to the fingerboard and, additionally, strings can be played in higher positions on the lower strings and still produce clear tone. The classic 19th century [[Franz Simandl]] method does not use the low E string in higher positions because older gut strings, set up high over the fingerboard, could not produce clear tone in these higher positions. However, with modern steel strings, bassists can play with clear tone in higher positions on the low E and A strings, particularly when they use modern lighter-gauge, lower-tension steel strings.

===Bows===
The double bass [[bow (music)|bow]] comes in two distinct forms (shown below). The "French" or "overhand" bow is similar in shape and implementation to the bow used on the other members of the orchestral string instrument family, while the "German" or "Butler" bow is typically broader and shorter, and is held in a "hand shake" (or maybe "hacksaw") position.
[[Image:French and german bows.jpg|thumb|French and German bows compared]]
These two bows provide different ways of moving the arm and distributing force on the strings. Proponents of the French bow argue that it is more maneuverable, due to the angle at which the player holds the bow. Advocates of the German bow claim that it allows the player to apply more arm weight on the strings. The differences between the two, however, are minute for a proficient player, and modern players in major orchestras use both bows.

====German bow====
[[Image:German bow2.jpg|left|thumb|German-style bow]]
The German bow (sometimes called the Butler bow) is the older of the two designs. The design of the bow and the manner of holding it descend from the older viol instrument family. With older viols, before [[Bow (music)|frogs]] had screw threads to tighten the bow, players held the bow with two fingers between the stick and the hair to maintain tension of the hair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicolog.com/violadagamba.asp |title=Viola da Gamba |publisher=musicolog.com |date= |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> Proponents of the use of German bow claim that the German bow is easier to use for heavy strokes that require a lot of power.

Compared to the French bow, the German bow has a taller frog, and the player holds it with the palm angled upwards, as with the upright members of the [[viol]] family. When held in the traditionally correct manner, the thumb applies the necessary power to generate the desired sound. The index finger meets the bow at the point where the frog meets the stick. The index finger also applies an upward torque to the frog when tilting the bow. The little finger (or "pinky") supports the frog from underneath, while the ring finger and middle finger rest in the space between the hair and the shaft.

====French bow====

[[Image:French bow2.jpg|right|thumb|French-style bow]]
The French bow was not widely popular until its adoption by 19th-century virtuoso [[Giovanni Bottesini]]. This style is more similar to the traditional bows of the smaller string family instruments. It is held as if the hand is resting by the side of the performer with the palm facing toward the bass. The thumb rests on the shaft of the bow, next to the frog while the other fingers drape on the other side of the bow. Various styles dictate the curve of the fingers and thumb, as do the style of piece; a more pronounced curve and lighter hold on the bow is used for virtuoso or more delicate pieces, while a flatter curve and sturdier grip on the bow sacrifices some power for easier control in strokes such as detaché, spiccato, and staccato.
[[Image:AGK bass bow grip.jpg|thumb|A bassist holding a French bow; note how the thumb rests on the shaft of the bow next to the frog.]]

====Bow construction and materials====
Double bass bows vary in length, ranging from 60&nbsp;cm (24") to 75&nbsp;cm (30"). [[Brazilwood|Pernambuco]], also known as Brazilwood, is regarded as an excellent quality stick material, but due to its scarcity and expense, other materials are increasingly being used. Less expensive student bows may be constructed of solid [[Glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]], or of less valuable varieties of brazilwood. [[Snakewood]]{{disambiguation needed|date=July 2012}} and [[Graphite-reinforced plastic|carbon fiber]] are also used in bows of a variety of different qualities. The frog of the double bass bow is usually made out of [[ebony]], although snakewood and [[Bovinae|buffalo]] horn are used by some [[:wiktionary:luthier|luthiers]]. Bows have a leather wrapping on the wooden part of the bow near the frog. Along with the leather wrapping, there is also a wire wrapping, made of [[gold]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} or [[silver]] in quality bows. The hair is usually [[horsehair]]. Part of the regular maintenance of a bow is having the bow "rehaired" with fresh horsehair and having the leather and wire wrapping replaced.

The double bass bow is strung with either white or black horsehair, or a combination of the two (known as "salt and pepper"), as opposed to the customary white horsehair used on the bows of other string instruments. Some bassists argue that the slightly rougher black hair "grabs" the heavier, lower strings better.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} As well, some bassists and luthiers believe that it is easier to produce a smoother sound with the white variety. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Red hair (chestnut) is also used by some bassists.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Some of the lowest-quality student bows are made with synthetic hair.

====Rosin====
String players apply [[rosin]] to the bow hair so it "grips" the string and makes it vibrate. Double bass rosin is generally softer and stickier than violin rosin to allow the hair to grab the thicker strings better, but players use a wide variety of rosins that vary from quite hard (like violin rosin) to quite soft, depending on the weather, the humidity, and the preference of the player. The amount used generally depends on the type of music being performed as well as the personal preferences of the player. Bassists may apply more rosin in works for large orchestra (e.g., Brahms symphonies) than for delicate chamber works.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Some brands of rosin, such as Pop's double bass rosin, are softer and more prone to melting in hot weather. Other brands, such as Carlsson or Nyman Harts double bass rosin, are harder and less prone to melting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Pitch==
[[Image:Bass clef.svg|upright|thumb|The bass (or F) clef is used for most orchestral double bass music.]]
The lowest note of a double bass is an E1 (on standard four-string basses) at approximately 41&nbsp;Hz or a C1 (≈33&nbsp;Hz), or sometimes B0 (≈31&nbsp;Hz), when five strings are used. This is within about an octave above the [[hearing range|lowest frequency]] that the average human ear can perceive as a distinctive pitch. The top of the instrument's fingerboard range is typically near D5, two octaves and a fifth above the open pitch of the G string (G2), as shown in the range illustration found at the head of this article. Playing beyond the end of the fingerboard can be accomplished by pulling the string slightly to the side.

Many double bass symphony parts and virtuoso concertos employ [[Harmonic#Harmonics on stringed instruments|harmonics]] (also called [[flageolet tone]]s). Both natural [[harmonics]] and [[artificial harmonic]]s, where the thumb stops the note and the octave or other harmonic is activated by lightly touching the string at the relative node point, extend the instrument's range considerably.

Orchestral parts rarely demand the double bass exceed a two-octave and a minor third range, from E1 to G3<!--The article previously said a 2 octave range, i.e., from E1 to E3...I disagree...F3s, F#3s, and even the harmonic G3 appear regularly in orchestral parts...what is unusual is to see notes above the G3, like G#3, A3, and so on--> (an exception to this rule is Orff's ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'', which calls for three octaves and a perfect fourth). However, there is no hard limit to the upper range a [[virtuoso]] solo player can achieve using natural and artificial harmonics. The high harmonic in the range illustration found at the head of this article may be taken as representative rather than normative.

Five-string instruments have an additional string, typically tuned to a low B below the E string. On rare occasions a higher string is added instead, tuned to the C above the G string. Four-string instruments may feature the [[Double bass#Tuning|C extension]] extending the range of the E string downwards to C (sometimes B).

Traditionally, the double bass is a [[transposing instrument]]. Since much of the double bass's range lies below the standard [[bass clef]], it is notated an octave higher than it sounds. This transposition applies even when reading the [[tenor clef|tenor]] and [[treble clef]], which avoids excessive ledger lines when notating the instrument's upper range.

Other notation traditions exist. Italian solo music is typically written at the sounding pitch, and the "old" German method sounded an octave below where notation except in the treble clef, where the music was written at pitch.

==Tuning==

===Regular tuning===
The double bass is generally tuned in [[Perfect fourth|fourths]], in contrast to other members of the [[Violin family|orchestral string family]], which are tuned in [[Perfect fifth|fifths]]. The standard tuning (low to high) is E–A–D–G, starting from E below second low C ([[concert pitch]]). This is the same as the standard tuning of a bass guitar and is one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of [[guitar|standard guitar tuning]]. Prior to the 19th-century, many double basses had only three strings; "Giovanni Bottesini (1821–1889) favored the three-stringed instrument popular in Italy at the time",<ref name="oocities.org"/> because "the three-stringed instrument [was viewed as] being more sonorous."<ref>"Double bass." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 1911 Edition [en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclopædia_Britannica/Double_bass]</ref> Many [[cobla]] bands in [[Catalonia]] still have players using traditional three-string double basses tuned A–D–G.<ref>[http://www.coblabaixllobregat.com/Contrabaix.htm Three-string double bass in the cobla band] Website of Cobla Baix Llobregat</ref> 
<!-- Check out the photo of Bottesini below...he clearly has only 3 strings! -->

Throughout [[Classical music|classical]] repertoire, there are notes that fall below the range of a standard double bass. Notes below low E appear regularly in the double bass parts found in later arrangements and interpretations of [[Baroque music]]. These parts are transpositions of parts written for other bass instruments{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} used before the modern double bass became common and may actually lower the part an octave{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. In the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] era, the double bass typically doubled the cello part an octave below, occasionally requiring descent to C below the E of the four-string double bass. In the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era and the 20th century, composers such as [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]] also requested notes below the low E.

There are several methods for making these notes available to the player. Players with standard double basses (E–A–D–G) may play the notes below "E" an octave higher or if this sounds awkward, the entire passage may be transposed up an octave. The player may tune the low E string down to the lowest note required in the piece: D or C. Four string basses may be fitted with a "low-C extension" (see below). Or the player may employ a five-string instrument, with the additional lower string tuned to C, or (more commonly in modern times) B, three [[octave]]s and a [[semitone]] below [[middle C]]. Several major European orchestras use basses with a fifth string.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billbentgen.com/bass/5_string-basses.htm |title=Bill Bentgen – 5 String Basses |publisher=Billbentgen.com |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>

===C extension===
[[Image:Double bass C extension.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A low-C extension with wooden mechanical "fingers" that stop the string at C{{music|♯}}, D, E{{music|b}}, or E.]]
In Britain, the United States and Canada, most professional orchestral players use four-string double basses with a ''C extension''. This is an extra section of fingerboard mounted on the head of the bass. It extends the fingerboard under the lowest string and gives an additional four semitones of downward range. The lowest string is typically tuned down to C, an octave below the lowest note on the cello. More rarely this string may be tuned to a low B, as a few works in the orchestral repertoire call for a low ''B'', such as [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]]'s ''The Pines of Rome''. In rare cases, some players have a low B extension, which has B as its lowest note. There are several varieties of extensions:

In the simplest mechanical extensions, there are no mechanical aids attached to the fingerboard extension except a locking nut for the "E" note. To play the extension notes, the player reaches back over the pegs to press the string to the fingerboard. The advantage of this "fingered" extension is that the player can adjust the intonation of all of the [[stopped note]]s on the extension, and there are no mechanical noises from metal keys and levers. The disadvantage of the "fingered" extension is that it can be hard to perform rapid alternations between low notes on the extension and notes on the regular fingerboard, such as a bassline that quickly alternates between "G" and the low "D".

The simplest type of mechanical aid is the use of wooden "fingers" that can be closed to press the string down and fret the C{{music|♯}}, D, E{{music|b}}, or E notes. This system is particularly useful for basslines that have a repeating [[pedal point]] such as a low D, because once the note is locked in place with the mechanical "finger," the lowest string sounds a different note when played open (e.g., a low D).

The most complicated mechanical aid for use with extensions is the mechanical lever system nicknamed the ''machine''. This lever system, which superficially resembles the keying mechanism of reed instruments such as the bassoon, mounts levers beside the regular fingerboard (near the nut, on the "E" string side), which remotely activate metal "fingers" on the extension fingerboard. The most expensive metal lever systems also give the player the ability to "lock" down notes on the extension fingerboard, as with the wooden "finger" system. One criticism of these devices is that they may lead to unwanted metallic clicking noises.

Once a mechanical "finger" of the wooden "finger" extension or the metal "finger" machine extension is locked down or depressed, it is not easy to make microtonal pitch adjustments, as is possible with a hand-fingered extension.

===Other tuning variations===
A small number of bass players tune their strings in [[Fifths tuning|fifths]], like a cello but an octave lower (C–G–D–A low to high). This tuning was used by the jazz player [[Red Mitchell]] and is increasingly used by classical players, notably the Canadian bassist [[Joel Quarrington]]. In classical solo playing the double bass is usually tuned a whole tone higher (F{{music|#}}–B–E–A). This higher tuning is called ''solo tuning'', whereas the regular tuning is known as "orchestral tuning." Solo tuning strings are generally thinner than regular strings. String tension differs so much between solo and orchestral tuning that a different set of strings is often employed that has a lighter gauge. Strings are always labelled for either solo or orchestral tuning, and published solo music is arranged for either solo or orchestral tuning. Some popular solos and concerti, such as the ''[[Koussevitsky]] Concerto'' are available in both solo and orchestral tuning arrangements.

Many contemporary composers specify highly specialized scordatura. [[Luciano Berio|Berio]], for example, asks the player to tune his strings E–G{{music|♯}}–D–G in ''Sequenza XIVb'' and [[Giacinto Scelsi|Scelsi]] asks for both F–A–D–E and F–A–F–E in ''Nuits''.

A variant and much less-commonly used form of solo tuning used in some Eastern European countries is (A–D–G–C), which uses three of the strings from orchestral tuning (A–D–G) and then adds a high "C" string. Some bassists with five-string basses use a high "C" string as the fifth string, instead of a low "B" string. Adding the high "C" string facilitates the performance of solo repertoire with a high tessitura (range). Another option is to utilize both a low C (or B) extension and a high C string.

When choosing a bass with a fifth string, the player may decide between adding a higher or lower-tuned string. Six-stringed instruments are generally regarded as impractical. To accommodate the additional string, the fingerboard is usually slightly wider, and the top slightly thicker to handle the increased tension. Some five-stringed instruments are converted four-string instruments. Because these do not have wider fingerboards, some players find them more difficult to finger and bow. Converted four-string basses usually require either a new, thicker top, or lighter strings to compensate for the increased tension.

The Berlioz/Strauss [[Treatise on Instrumentation]] states that, "A good orchestra should have several four-string double-basses, some of them tuned in fifths and thirds." The book then shows a tuning of E, G, D, A from bottom to top string. "Together with the other double-basses tuned in fourths, a combination of open strings would be available, which would greatly increase the sonority of the orchestra."

==Playing and performance considerations==

===Body and hand position===
[[File:Renaudgarciafons.JPG|thumb|right|200px|French double-bass player and composer Renaud Garcia-Fons pictured during a performance.]]
Double bassists either stand or sit to play the instrument. The instrument height is set by adjusting the endpin such that the player can reach the desired playing zones of the strings with bow or plucking hand. Bassists who stand and bow sometimes set the endpin by aligning the first finger in either first or half position with eye level, although there is little standardization in this regard. Players who sit generally use a stool about the height of the player's pants inseam length.

Traditionally, double bassists stood to play solo and sat to play in the orchestra or opera pit. Now, it is unusual for a player to be equally proficient in both positions, so some soloists sit (as with [[Joel Quarrington]], Jeff Bradetich, Thierry Barbé, and others) and some orchestral bassists stand.

When playing in the instrument's upper range (above the G below middle C), the player shifts the hand from behind the neck and flattens it out, using the side of the thumb to press down the string. This technique—also used on the cello—is called ''[[thumb position]]''. While playing in thumb position, few players use the fourth (little) finger, as it is usually too weak to produce reliable tone (this is also true for cellists), although some extreme chords or extended techniques, especially in contemporary music, may require its use.

===Physical considerations===
[[File:Lucky Dados en Madgarden Festival 2015 - 22.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|Double bass player of rockabilly band Lucky Dados. Rockabilly style can be very physically demanding for double bass players.]]
Performing on bass can be physically demanding, because the strings are large and thick. Also, the space between notes on the fingerboard is large, due to scale length and string spacing, so players must shift positions frequently. As with all non-fretted [[string instrument]]s, performers must learn to place their fingers precisely to produce the correct pitch. For bassists with shorter arms or smaller hands, the large spaces between pitches may present a significant challenge, especially in the lowest range, where the spaces between notes are largest. However, the increased use of playing techniques such as thumb position and modifications to the bass, such as the use of lighter-gauge strings at lower tension, have eased the difficulty of playing the instrument.

Bass parts have relatively fewer fast passages, double stops, or large jumps in range. These parts are usually given to the cello section, since the cello is a smaller instrument on which these techniques are more easily performed.

Until the 1990s, child-sized double basses were not widely available, and the large size of the bass prevented children from playing the instrument until they grew to a height and hand size that let them to play a 3/4-size model (the most common size). Starting in the 1990s, smaller half, quarter, eighth, and even sixteenth-sized instruments became more widely available, so children could start younger.

===Volume===
Despite the size of the instrument, it is not as loud as many other instruments, due to its low range. In a large orchestra, usually between four and eight bassists play in unison. In the largest orchestras, bass sections may have as many as ten or twelve players, but modern budget constraints make bass sections this large unusual.

When writing solo passages for the bass in orchestral or chamber music, composers typically ensure the [[orchestration]] is light so it doesn't obscure the bass. While amplification is rarely used in classical music, in some cases where a bass soloist performs a concerto with a full orchestra, subtle amplification called [[acoustic enhancement]] may be used. The use of microphones and amplifiers in a classical setting has led to debate within the classical community, as "...purists maintain that the natural acoustic sound of [Classical] voices [or] instruments in a given hall should not be altered."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harada-sound.com/sound/handbook/intro2.html |title=Sound Systems- Why?! |publisher=Harada-sound.com |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>
[[Image:Jimbo Wallace.JPG|thumb|Psychobilly bassist [[Jimbo Wallace]] onstage with [[Reverend Horton Heat]]; note his large [[bass stack]] consisting of a 1x15" cabinet, a 4x10" cabinet, and an amplifier "head".]]
In many non-orchestral settings, such as jazz and blues, players use amplification via a [[bass instrument amplification|specialized amplifier]] and loudspeakers. A piezoelectric pickup connects to the amplifier with a 1/4" patch cable. Bluegrass and jazz players typically use less amplification than blues, [[psychobilly]], or [[jam band]] players. In the latter cases, high overall volume from other amplifiers and instruments may cause [[audio feedback|acoustic feedback]], a problem exacerbated by the bass's large surface area and interior volume. The feedback problem has led to technological fixes like electronic feedback eliminator devices (essentially an automated [[notch filter]] that identifies and reduces frequencies where feedback occurs) and instruments like the [[electric upright bass]], which has playing characteristics like the double bass but usually little or no soundbox, which makes feedback less likely.

In rockabilly and psychobilly, percussively slapping the strings against the fingerboard is an important part of the bass playing style. Since piezoelectric pickups are not good at reproducing the sounds of strings being slapped against the fingerboard, bassists in these genres often use both piezoelectric pickups (for the low bass tone) and a miniature [[condenser mic]] (to pick up the percussive slapping sounds). These two signals are blended together using a simple [[audio mixer|mixer]] before the signal is sent to the bass amp.

===Transportation===
The double bass's large size and relative fragility make it cumbersome to handle and transport. Most bassists use soft cases, referred to as [[gig bag]]s, to protect the instrument during transport. Basic, unpadded [[gig bag]]s used by students cost under 100 USD, while thickly padded gig bags for professional players typically cost as much as 500 USD. Some more feature-filled examples with backpack straps retail for over 1000 USD. Some bassists carry their bow in a hard bow case. Players also may use a small cart or [[gig bag]] and end pin-attached wheels to move the bass.

Hard flight cases have cushioned interiors and tough exteriors of [[carbon fiber]], [[graphite]], [[fiberglass]], or [[Kevlar]]. The cost of good hard cases—USD&nbsp;3000 to USD&nbsp;4000<ref>http://www.davidgage.com/store/index.php?cPath=23</ref>— and the high airline fees for shipping them tends to limit their use to touring professionals.

===Accessories===
[[File:Page 451 (A Dictionary of Music and Musicians-Volume 2).jpg|thumb|right|150px|A wooden mute attached to the bass bridge to make the tone darker]]
Double bass players use various accessories to help them to perform and rehearse. Two types of mutes used in orchestral music: a wooden mute that slides onto the bridge and a rubber mute that attaches to the bridge. The player uses the mute when the Italian instruction ''con sordino'' appears in the bass part, and removes it in response to ''senza sordino''. With the mute on, the tone of the bass is quieter, darker, and more somber. Bowed bass parts with a mute can have a nasal tone. Players use a third type of mute, a heavy rubber practice mute, to practice quietly without disturbing others.

A quiver is an accessory, often made of leather, that attaches to the bridge and tailpiece with ties or straps and holds the bow while a player plays pizzicato parts.

A [[wolf tone]] eliminator is a rubber tube cut down the side, and a cylindrical metal sleeve with a slot on the side and a screw and a nut that fastens the device to the string. The device attaches to the string between the bridge and tailpiece. Different placements of the cylinder along the string influence or eliminate the frequency at which the wolf tone occurs. It is essentially an [[attenuation|attenuator]] that slightly shifts the natural frequency of the string (and/or instrument body) cutting down on the reverberation.<ref>http://www.allthingsstrings.com/Instruments/CARE-MAINTENANCE/How-to-Tame-Annoying-Howling-Wolf-Tones</ref> The wolf tone occurs because the strings below the bridge sometimes resonate at pitches close to notes on the playing part of the string. When the intended note makes the below-the-bridge string vibrate sympathetically, a dissonant "wolf note" or "wolf tone" can occur. In some cases, the wolf tone is strong enough to cause an audible "beating" sound. The wolf tone often occurs with the note G# on the bass.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=H. |last1=Dünnwald |title=Versuche zur Entstehung des Wolfs bei Violininstrumenten |journal=Acustica |volume=41 |issue=4 |year=1979 |pages=238–45 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&issn=1610-1928&volume=41&issue=4&spage=238&epage=245}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.1913343 |title=The wolf in the cello |year=1973 |last1=Firth |first1=Ian M. |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=457}}</ref>

In orchestra, instruments tune to an A played by the oboist. Due to the multiple octaves between the oboist's tuning A and the open A string on the bass (for example, in an orchestra that tunes to 440&nbsp;Hz, the oboist plays an A at 440&nbsp;Hz and the open A of the bass is 55&nbsp;Hz) it is can be difficult to tune the bass by ear during the short period that the oboist plays the tuning note. Violinists, on the other hand, tune their A string to the same frequency as the oboist's tuning note. To ensure the bass is in tune, some bassists use an [[electronic tuner]] that indicates pitch on a small display. Bassists who play in styles that use a [[bass amp]], such as blues, rockabilly, or jazz, may use a [[stompbox]]-format electronic tuner, which mutes the bass pickup during tuning.

==Classical repertoire==

===Solo works for double bass===

====1700s====
The double bass as a solo instrument enjoyed a period of popularity during the 18th century and many of the most popular composers from that era wrote pieces for the double bass. The double bass, then often referred to as the [[Violone]] used different tunings from region to region. The "Viennese tuning" (A<sup>1</sup>–D–F{{music|sharp}}–A) was popular, and in some cases a fifth string or even sixth string was added (F<sup>1</sup>–A<sup>1</sup>–D–F{{music|sharp}}–A).<ref>David Chapman. "Historical and Practical Considerations for the Tuning of Double Bass Instruments in Fourths" – p.228–229, ''The Galpin Society Journal'', Vol. 56, (Jun., 2003), pp. 224–233.</ref> The popularity of the instrument is documented in [[Leopold Mozart]]'s second edition of his Violinschule, where he writes "One can bring forth difficult passages easier with the five-string violone, and I heard unusually beautiful performances of concertos, trios, solos, etc."
[[File:Domenico Dragonetti.JPG|thumb|The Italian bass virtuoso [[Domenico Dragonetti]] helped to encourage composers to give more difficult parts for his instrument.]]
The earliest known concerto for double bass was written by [[Joseph Haydn]] ca.1763, and is presumed lost in a fire at the Eisenstadt library. The earliest known existing concertos are by [[Karl Ditters von Dittersdorf]], who composed two concertos for the double bass and a [[Sinfonia concertante|Sinfonia Concertante]] for viola and double bass. Other composers that have written concertos from this period include [[Johann Baptist Wanhal]], [[Franz Anton Hoffmeister]] (3 concertos), [[Leopold Kozeluch]], Anton Zimmermann, [[Antonio Capuzzi]], [[Wenzel Pichl]] (2 concertos), and [[Johannes Matthias Sperger]] (18 concertos). While many of these names were leading figures to the music public of their time, they are generally unknown by contemporary audiences. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s concert aria, ''[[Per Questa Bella Mano]]'', K.612 for bass, double bass [[obbligato]], and orchestra contains impressive writing for solo double bass of that period. It remains popular among both singers and double bassists today.

The double bass eventually evolved to fit the needs of orchestras that required lower notes and a louder sound. The leading double bassists from the mid-to-late 18th century, such as Josef Kämpfer, Friedrich Pischelberger, and Johannes Mathias Sperger employed the "Viennese" tuning. Bassist Johann Hindle (1792–1862), who composed a concerto for the double bass, pioneered tuning the bass in fourths, which marked a turning point for the double bass and its role in solo works.

Bassist [[Domenico Dragonetti]] was a prominent musical figure and an acquaintance of Haydn and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. His playing was known all the way from his homeland Italy to the Tsardom of Russia and he found a prominent place performing in concerts with the [[Philharmonic Society of London]]. Beethoven's friendship with Dragonetti may have inspired him to write difficult, separate parts for the double bass in his symphonies, such as the impressive passages in the third movement of the Fifth Symphony, the second movement of the Seventh Symphony, and last movement of the Ninth Symphony. These parts do not double the cello part.

Dragonetti wrote ten concertos for the double bass and many solo works for bass and piano. During [[Rossini]]'s stay in London in the summer of 1824, he composed his Duetto for cello and double bass for Dragonetti and the cellist David Salomons. Dragonetti frequently played on a three string double bass tuned G-D-A from top to bottom. The use of only the top three strings was popular for bass soloists and Principal bassists in orchestras in the 19th century, because it reduced the pressure on the wooden top of the bass, which was thought to create a more resonant sound. As well, the low "E" strings used during the 19th century were thick cords made of gut, which were difficult to tune and play.

====1800s====
[[File:BottesiniTestore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The virtuoso nineteenth-century bassist and composer Giovanni Bottesini with his 1716 Carlo Antonio Testore bass.]]
In the 19th century, the opera conductor, composer, and bassist [[Giovanni Bottesini]] was considered the "[[Paganini]] of the double bass" of his time. His compositions were written in the popular Italian opera style of the 19th century, which exploit the double bass in a way that was not seen beforehand. They require virtuosic runs and great leaps to the highest registers of the instrument, even into the realm of harmonics. Many early 20th century bassists considered these compositions unplayable, but are now they frequently performed. During the same time, a prominent school of bass players in the [[Czech lands|Czech region]] arose, which included [[Franz Simandl]], Theodore Albin Findeisen, Josef Hrabe, [[Ludwig Manoly]], and [[Adolf Mišek]]. Simandl and Hrabe were also pedagogues whose method books and studies remain in use.

====1900s–present====
The leading figure of the double bass in the early 20th century was [[Serge Koussevitzky]], best known as conductor of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], who popularized the double bass in modern times as a solo instrument. Because of improvements to the double bass with steel strings and better set-ups, the bass is now played at a more advanced level than ever before and more and more composers have written works for the double bass. In the mid-century and in the following decades, many new concerti were written for the double bass, including [[Nikos Skalkottas]]'s Concerto (1942), [[Eduard Tubin]]'s Concerto (1948), [[Lars-Erik Larsson]]'s Concertino (1957), [[Gunther Schuller]]'s Concerto (1962), [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s Concerto (1966) and [[Frank Proto]]'s Concerto No. 1 (1968).
The ''Solo For Contrabass'' is one of the parts of [[John Cage]]'s ''Concert For Piano And Orchestra'' and can be played as a solo, or with any of the other parts both orchestral and/or piano.  Similarly, his solo contrabass parts for the orchestral work ''Atlas Eclipticalis'' can also be performed as solos.  Cage's indeterminate works such as ''Variations I'', ''Variations II'', ''Fontana Mix'', ''Cartridge Music'' et al. can be arranged for a solo contrabassist.  His work ''26.1.1499 For A String Player'' is often realized by a solo contrabass player, although it can also be played by a violinist, violist, or cellist.

From the 1960s through the end of the century [[Gary Karr]] was the leading proponent of the double bass as a solo instrument and was active in commissioning or having hundreds of new works and concerti written especially for him. Karr was given Koussevitzky's famous solo double bass by Olga Koussevitsky and played it in concerts around the world for 40 years before, in turn, giving the instrument to the [[International Society of Bassists]] for talented soloists to use in concert. Another important performer in this period, [[Bertram Turetzky]], commissioned and premiered more than 300 double bass works.

[[Image:Sergei Koussevitsky.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Serge Koussevitzky]] popularized the double bass in modern times as a solo instrument]]

In the 1970s, 1980 and 1990s, new concerti included [[Nino Rota]]'s ''Divertimento for Double Bass and Orchestra'' (1973), [[Alan Ridout]]'s concerto for double bass and strings (1974), [[Jean Françaix]]'s Concerto (1975), [[Frank Proto]]'s Concerto No. 2, [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]]'s ''Angel Of Dusk'' (1980), [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]'s Concerto (1983), [[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Christopher Rouse]]'s Concerto (1985), [[Henry Brant]]'s Ghost Nets (1988) and [[Frank Proto]]'s "Carmen Fantasy for Double Bass and Orchestra" (1991) and "Four Scenes after Picasso" Concerto No.3 (1997). Peter Maxwell Davies' lyrical Strathclyde Concerto no. 7, for double bass and orchestra, dates from 1992.

In the first decade of the 21st century, new concerti include [[Frank Proto]]'s "Nine Variants on Paganini" (2002), [[Kalevi Aho]]'s Concerto (2005), [[John Harbison]]'s ''Concerto for Bass Viol'' (2006), [[André Previn]]'s Double Concerto for violin, double bass, and orchestra (2007) and [[John Woolrich]]'s ''To the Silver Bow'', for double bass, viola and strings (2014).

[[Reinhold Glière]] wrote an Intermezzo and Tarantella for double bass and piano, Op. 9, No. 1 and No. 2 and a Praeludium and Scherzo for double bass and piano, Op. 32 No.1 and No.2. [[Paul Hindemith]] wrote a rhythmically challenging Double Bass Sonata in 1949. [[Frank Proto]] wrote his Sonata "1963" for Double Bass and Piano. In the Soviet Union, [[Mieczysław Weinberg]] wrote his Sonata No. 1 for double bass solo in 1971. [[Giacinto Scelsi]] wrote two double bass pieces called ''Nuits'' in 1972, and then in 1976, he wrote ''Maknongan'', a piece for any low-voiced instrument, such as double bass, contrabassoon, or tuba. [[Vincent Persichetti]] wrote solo works—which he called "Parables"—for many instruments. He wrote Parable XVII for Double Bass, Op. 131 in 1974. [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] penned a Sonata for double bass and piano in 1975.

In 1977 Dutch-Hungarian composer [[Geza Frid]] wrote a set of variations on The Elephant from [[Saint-Saëns]]' [[Le Carnaval des Animaux]] for [[scordatura]] Double Bass and string orchestra. In 1987 [[Lowell Liebermann]] wrote his Sonata for Contrabass and Piano Op.24. Fernando Grillo wrote the "Suite No.1" for double bass (1983/2005). [[Jacob Druckman]] wrote a piece for solo double bass entitled ''Valentine''. US double bass soloist and composer [[Bertram Turetzky]] (born 1933) has performed and recorded more than 300 pieces written by and for him. He writes chamber music, baroque music, classical, jazz, renaissance music, improvisational music and world music

US minimalist composer [[Philip Glass]] wrote a prelude focused on the lower register that he scored for timpani and double bass. Italian composer [[Sylvano Bussotti]], whose composing career spans from the 1930s to the first decade of the 21st century, wrote a solo work for bass in 1983 entitled ''Naked Angel Face per contrabbasso''. Fellow Italian composer [[Franco Donatoni]] wrote a piece called ''Lem for contrabbasso'' in the same year. In 1989, French composer [[Pascal Dusapin]] (born 1955) wrote a solo piece called ''In et Out'' for double bass. In 1996, the Sorbonne-trained Lebanese composer [[Karim Haddad]] composed ''Ce qui dort dans l'ombre sacrée'' ("He who sleeps in the sacred shadows") for Radio France's Presence Festival. [[Renaud Garcia-Fons]] (born 1962) is a French double bass player and composer, notable for drawing on jazz, folk, and Asian music for recordings of his pieces like ''Oriental Bass'' (1997).

Two significant recent works written for solo bass include, [[Mario Davidovsky]]'s Synchronisms No.11 for double bass and electronic sounds and [[Elliott Carter]]'s Figment III, for solo double bass. The German composer [[Gerhard Stäbler]] wrote ''Co-wie Kobalt'' (1989–90), "...a music for double bass solo and grand orchestra." [[Charles Wuorinen]] added several important works to the repertoire, ''Spinoff'' trio for double bass, violin and conga drums, and ''Trio for Bass Instruments'' double bass, tuba and bass trombone, and in 2007 ''Synaxis'' for double bass, horn, oboe and clarinet with timpani and strings. The suite "Seven Screen Shots" for double bass and piano (2005) by Ukrainian composer [[Alexander Shchetynsky]] has a solo bass part that includes many unconventional methods of playing.

===Chamber music with double bass===
Since there is no established instrumental ensemble that includes the double bass, its use in chamber music has not been as exhaustive as the literature for ensembles such as the string quartet or piano trio. Despite this, there is a substantial number of [http://www.paulnemeth.com/basschamber.htm chamber works] that incorporate the double bass in both small and large ensembles.

There is a small body of works written for [[piano quintet]] with the instrumentation of piano, violin, viola, cello, and double bass. The most famous is [[Franz Schubert]]'s Piano Quintet in A major, known as "The [[Trout Quintet]]" for its set of variations in the fourth movement of Schubert's ''[[Die Forelle]]''. Other works for this instrumentation written from roughly the same period include those by [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]], [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]], [[Louise Farrenc]], [[Ferdinand Ries]], [[Franz Limmer]], [[Johann Baptist Cramer]], and [[Hermann Goetz]]. Later composers who wrote chamber works for this quintet include [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Colin Matthews]], [[Jon Deak]], [[Frank Proto]], and [[John Woolrich]]. Slightly larger sextets written for piano, string quartet, and double bass have been written by [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Richard Wernick]], and [[Charles Ives]].

In the genre of string quintets, there are a few works for string quartet with double bass. [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s String Quintet in G major, Op.77 and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s Serenade in G major, K.525 ("[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]") are the most popular pieces in this repertoire, along with works by [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Luigi Boccherini]] (3 quintets), [[Harold Shapero]], and [[Paul Hindemith]].

Slightly smaller string works with the double bass include six string sonatas by [[Gioachino Rossini]], for two violins, cello, and double bass written at the age of twelve over the course of three days in 1804. These remain his most famous instrumental works and have also been adapted for wind quartet. [[Franz Anton Hoffmeister]] wrote four String Quartets for Solo Double Bass, Violin, Viola, and Cello in D Major. [[Frank Proto]] has written a Trio for Violin, Viola and Double Bass (1974), 2 Duos for Violin and Double Bass (1967 and 2005), and ''The Games of October'' for Oboe/English Horn and Double Bass (1991).

Larger works that incorporate the double bass include [[Beethoven]]'s Septet in E-flat major, Op.20, one of his most famous pieces during his lifetime, which consists of clarinet, horn, bassoon, violin, viola, cello, and bass. When the clarinetist [[Ferdinand Troyer]] commissioned a work from [[Franz Schubert]] for similar forces, he added one more violin for his Octet in F major, D.803. [[Paul Hindemith]] used the same instrumentation as Schubert for his own Octet. In the realm of even larger works, Mozart included the double bass in addition to 12 wind instruments for his "[[Gran Partita]]" Serenade, K.361 and [[Bohuslav Martinů|Martinů]] used the double bass in his [[nonet (music)|nonet]] for wind quintet, violin, viola, cello and double bass.

Other examples of chamber works that use the double bass in mixed ensembles include [[Serge Prokofiev]]'s Quintet in G minor, Op.39 for oboe, clarinet, violin, viola, and double bass; [[Erwin Schulhoff]]'s Concertino for flute/piccolo, viola, and double bass; [[Frank Proto]]'s ''Afro-American Fragments'' for bass clarinet, cello, double bass and narrator and Sextet for clarinet and strings; [[Fred Lerdahl]]'s Waltzes for violin, viola, cello, and double bass; [[Mohammed Fairouz]]'s Litany for double bass and wind quartet; [[Mario Davidovsky]]'s Festino for guitar, viola, cello, and double bass; and [[Iannis Xenakis]]'s Morsima-Amorsima for piano, violin, cello, and double bass. There are also new music ensembles that utilize the double bass such as Time for Three and [[PROJECT Trio]].

===Orchestral passages and solos===
[[File:BeethovenSymphonyNo5Mvt3Opening.png|thumb|300px|The opening of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, third movement is often used as an orchestral excerpt during bass [[audition]]s.]]
In the baroque and classical periods, composers typically had the double bass double the cello part in orchestral passages. A notable exception is Haydn, who composed solo passages for the double bass in his Symphonies No.6 ''Le Matin'', No.7 ''Le midi'', No.8 ''Le Soir'', No. 31 ''Horn Signal'', and No. 45 ''Farewell''—but who otherwise grouped bass and cello parts together. Beethoven paved the way for separate double bass parts, which became more common in the romantic era. The [[scherzo]] and [[Trio (music)|trio]] from [[Beethoven's Fifth Symphony]] are famous orchestral excerpts, as is the recitative at the beginning of the fourth movement of [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]]. In many nineteenth century symphonies and concertos, the typical impact of separate bass and cello parts was that bass parts became simpler and cello parts got the melodic lines and rapid passage work.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}<!--Take for example the Sibelius Karelia Suite...much of the first movement, the double basses play a low Eb [[pedal point]]-->

A double bass section of a modern [[orchestra]] typically uses eight double bassists in, usually in [[unison]]. Smaller orchestras may have four double basses, and in exceptional cases, bass sections may have as many as ten members. If some double bassists have low C extensions, and some have regular (low E) basses, those with the low C extensions may play some passages an octave below the regular double basses. Also, some composers write divided (divisi) parts for the basses, where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to "outside" (nearer the audience) and "inside" players. Composers writing divisi parts for bass often write [[perfect interval]]s, such as octaves and fifths, but in some cases use thirds and sixths.

The basses play the theme from the fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

Where a composition calls for a solo bass part, the principal bass invariably plays that part. The section leader (or principal) also determines the bowings, often based on bowings set out by the concertmaster. In some cases, the principal bass may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing bass. The principal bass also leads entrances for the bass section, typically by lifting the bow or plucking hand before the entrance, to ensure the section plays together. Major professional orchestras typically have an assistant principal bass player, who plays solos and leads the bass section if the principal is absent.

While orchestral bass solos are somewhat rare, there are some notable examples. [[Johannes Brahms]], whose father was a double bass player, wrote many difficult and prominent parts for the double bass in his symphonies. [[Richard Strauss]] assigned the double bass daring parts, and his symphonic poems and operas stretch the instrument to its limits. "The Elephant" from [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]' ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' is a satirical portrait of the double bass, and American virtuoso [[Gary Karr]] made his televised debut playing "The Swan" (originally written for the cello) with the [[New York Philharmonic]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The third movement of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)|first symphony]] features a solo for the double bass that quotes the children's song ''Frere Jacques'', transposed into a minor key. [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Lieutenant Kijé (Prokofiev)|Lieutenant Kijé]] Suite'' features a difficult and very high double bass solo in the "Romance" movement. [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra]]'' contains a prominent passage for the double bass section.

===Double bass ensembles===
Ensembles made up entirely of double basses, though relatively rare, also exist, and several composers have written or arranged for such ensembles. Compositions for four double basses exist by [[Gunther Schuller]], [[Jacob Druckman]], [[James Tenney]], [[Claus Kühnl]], [[Robert Ceely]], [http://www.janalm.se/ Jan Alm], [[Bernhard Alt]], Norman Ludwin, [[Frank Proto]], [[Joseph Lauber]], [[Erich Hartmann]], [[Colin Brumby]], [[Miloslav Gajdos]] and [[Theodore Albin Findeisen]].

==Use in jazz==
{{See also|List of jazz bassists}}

Beginning around 1890, the early New Orleans [[jazz]] ensemble (which played a mixture of marches, [[ragtime]], and [[Dixieland]]) was initially a marching band with a [[tuba]] or [[sousaphone]] (or occasionally [[bass saxophone]]) supplying the bass line. As the music moved into bars and brothels, the upright bass gradually replaced these wind instruments around the 1920s.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2240678|title = Double bass|date = |accessdate = 2015-09-17|website = Grove Music Online|publisher = Oxford Music Online|last = Siemers|first = Bryan}}</ref> Many early bassists doubled on both the ''brass bass ([[tuba]])'' and ''string bass'', as the instruments were then often referred to. Bassists played "walking" bass lines—scale-based lines that outlined the harmony.

Because an unamplified upright bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band, many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the ''slap style'', slapping and pulling the strings to produce a rhythmic "slap" sound against the fingerboard. The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings, and made the bass more easily heard on early sound recordings, as the recording equipment of that time did not favor low frequencies.<ref name="fotos">{{cite web|url=http://www.peterunbehauen.de/jazz/jazzfotos.html |title=Historic Jazz Fotos |publisher=Peterunbehauen.de |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref> For more about the slap style, see ''Modern playing styles'', below.
[[File:Minugs 1976.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jazz]] bassist [[Charles Mingus]] was also an influential bandleader and composer whose musical interests spanned from bebop to free jazz.]]

Jazz bass players are expected to improvise an accompaniment line or solo for a given chord progression. They are also expected to know the rhythmic patterns that are appropriate for different styles (e.g., Afro-Cuban). Bassists playing in a big band must also be able to read written-out bass lines, as some arrangements have written bass parts.

Many upright bass players have contributed to the evolution of jazz. Examples include swing era players such as [[Jimmy Blanton]], who played with [[Duke Ellington]], and [[Oscar Pettiford]], who pioneered the instrument's use in [[bebop]]. [[Paul Chambers]] (who worked with [[Miles Davis]] on the famous ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' album) achieved renown for being one of the first jazz bassists to play bebop solos with the bow. [[Terry Plumeri]] furthered the development of arco (bowed) solos, achieving horn-like technical freedom and a clear, vocal bowed tone, while [[Charlie Haden]], best known for his work with [[Ornette Coleman]], defined the role of the bass in [[Free Jazz]].

A number of other bassists, such as [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]], [[Slam Stewart]] and [[Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen]], were central to the history of jazz. Stewart, who was popular with the beboppers, played his solos with a bow combined with octave humming.  Notably, [[Charles Mingus]] was a highly regarded composer as well as a bassist noted for his technical virtuosity and powerful sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/archive/April99/archive-mingus.html |title=Charles Mingus  -A musician beyond category|first=Nat|last= Hentoff|publisher=Gadfly Online|date= April 1999 |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref> [[Scott LaFaro]] influenced a generation of musicians by liberating the bass from contrapuntal "walking" behind soloists instead favoring interactive, conversational melodies.<ref>Scott Yanow, AllMusic Guide, {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p95770|pure_url=yes}} retrieved 3 November 2009.</ref>

Since the commercial availability of [[bass amplifier]]s in the 1950s, jazz bassists have used amplification to augment the natural volume of the instrument.

While the electric bass guitar was used intermittently in jazz as early as 1951, beginning in the 1970s bassist [[Bob Cranshaw]], playing with saxophonist [[Sonny Rollins]], and fusion pioneers [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Stanley Clarke]] began to commonly substitute the bass guitar for the upright bass. Apart from the jazz styles of jazz fusion and Latin-influenced jazz however, the upright bass is still the dominant bass instrument in jazz. The sound and tone of the plucked upright bass is distinct from that of the fretted bass guitar. The upright bass produces a different sound than the bass guitar, because its strings are not stopped by metal [[fret]]s, instead having a continuous tonal range on the uninterrupted fingerboard. As well, bass guitars usually have a solid wood body, which means that their sound is produced by electronic amplification of the vibration of the strings, instead of the upright bass's acoustic reverberation.

Demonstrative examples of the single sound of a double bass and its technical use in jazz can be heard on the solo recordings ''[[Emerald Tears]]'' (1978) by [[Dave Holland]] or ''[[Emergence (Miroslav Vitous album)|Emergence]]'' (1986) by [[Miroslav Vitous]]. Holland also recorded an album with the representative title ''[[Music from Two Basses]]'' (1971) on which he plays with [[Barre Phillips]] while he sometimes switches to cello as well.

==Use in bluegrass and country==<!-- This section is linked from [[Bluegrass music]] and [[Jim & Jesse]]-->
{{See also|List of double bassists in popular music}}
The string bass is the most commonly used bass instrument in [[bluegrass music]] and is almost always plucked, though some modern bluegrass bassists have also used a bow. The bluegrass bassist is part of the rhythm section, and is responsible for keeping a steady beat, whether fast, slow, in 4/4 time, 2/4 or 3/4 time. The Engelhardt-Link (formerly [[Kay Musical Instrument Company|Kay]]) brands of plywood laminate basses have long been popular choices for bluegrass bassists. Most bluegrass bassists use the 3/4 size bass, but the full-size and 5/8 size basses are also used.
[[Image:Fiddle bass.jpg|thumb|left|250pix|Upright bass used by a bluegrass group; the cable for a piezoelectric pickup can be seen extending from the bridge.]]

Early pre-bluegrass traditional music was often accompanied by the cello. The cellist Natalie Haas points out that in the US, you can find "...old photographs, and even old recordings, of American string bands with cello." However, "The cello dropped out of sight in folk music, and became associated with the orchestra."<ref>[http://www.allthingsstrings.com/article/default.aspx?articleid=21495 Looming Large: What's a cello got to do with a famous fiddler's tale? By Natalie Haas] {{wayback|url=http://www.allthingsstrings.com/article/default.aspx?articleid=21495 |date=20110103024640 }}</ref> The cello did not reappear in bluegrass until the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century. Some contemporary bluegrass bands favor the electric bass, because it is easier to transport than the large and somewhat fragile upright bass. However, the bass guitar has a different musical sound. Many musicians feel the slower attack and percussive, woody tone of the upright bass gives it a more "earthy" or "natural" sound than an electric bass, particularly when gut strings are used.

Common rhythms in bluegrass bass playing involve (with some exceptions) plucking on beats 1 and 3 in 4/4 time; beats 1 and 2 in 2/4 time, and on the downbeat in 3/4 time (waltz time). Bluegrass bass lines are usually simple, typically staying on the root and fifth of each chord throughout most of a song. There are two main exceptions to this rule. Bluegrass bassists often do a diatonic ''walkup'' or ''[[walkdown]],'' in which they play every beat of a bar for one or two bars, typically when there is a chord change. In addition, if a bass player is given a solo, they may play a [[walking bass]] line with a note on every beat or play a pentatonic scale-influenced bassline.

[[Image:Riders Bass.jpg|thumb|right|Country music bassist "Too Slim" ([[Fred LaBour]] of [[Riders in the Sky (band)|Riders in the Sky]]) performing in Ponca City, Oklahoma in 2008.]]
An early bluegrass bassist to rise to prominence was Howard Watts (also known as Cedric Rainwater), who played with [[Bill Monroe]]'s Blue Grass Boys beginning in 1944.<ref name="watts">[http://doodah.net/bgb/HowardCedricRainwaterWatts.html ''Howard "Cedric Rainwater" Watts''], Stewart Evans</ref> The classical bassist [[Edgar Meyer]] has frequently branched out into [[Progressive bluegrass|newgrass]], old-time, jazz, and other genres.
"My all-time favorite is [[Todd Phillips (musician)|Todd Phillips]]," proclaimed Union Station bassist Barry Bales in April 2005. "He brought a completely different way of thinking about and playing bluegrass."{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

An upright bass was the standard bass instrument in traditional [[country western music]]. While the upright bass is still occasionally used in [[country music]], the electric bass has largely replaced its bigger cousin in country music, especially in the more pop-infused country styles of the 1990s and 2000s, such as [[new country]].

===Slap-style bass===
Slap-style bass is sometimes used in bluegrass bass playing. When bluegrass bass players slap the string by pulling it until it hits the fingerboard or hit the strings against the fingerboard, it adds the high-pitched percussive "clack" or "slap" sound to the low-pitched bass notes, sounding much like the clacks of a tap dancer. Slapping is a subject of minor controversy in the bluegrass scene. Even slapping experts such as [[Mike Bub]] say, "Don't slap on every gig," or in songs where it is not appropriate. As well, bluegrass bassists who play slap-style on live shows often slap less on records. Bub and his mentor [[Jerry McCoury]] rarely do slap bass on recordings. While bassists such as [[Jack Cook]] slap bass on the occasional faster "Clinch Mountain Boys song," bassists such as [[Gene Libbea]], [[Missy Raines]], [[Jenny Keel]], and [[Barry Bales]] [rarely] slap bass.<ref>[http://www.ibluegrass.com/vi_posting3.CFM?p__i=1004&p__r=&p__a=bass The Low End, February-02-2001 ©2001 iBluegrass.com. By Kip Martin]</ref>

Bluegrass bassist Mark Schatz, who teaches slap bass in his ''Intermediate Bluegrass Bass'' DVD acknowledges that slap bass "...has not been stylistically very predominant in the music I have recorded." He notes that "Even in traditional bluegrass slap bass only appears sporadically and most of what I've done has been on the more contemporary side of that (Tony Rice, Tim O'Brien)." Schatz states that he would be "...&nbsp;more likely to use it [slap] in a live situation than on a recording—for a solo or to punctuate a particular place in a song or tune where I wouldn't be obliterating someone's solo."<ref>http://www.rockabillybass.com/markschatz.htm</ref> Another bluegrass method, ''Learn to Play Bluegrass Bass'', by [[Earl Gately]], also teaches bluegrass slap bass technique.

In 1952, the upright bass was the standard bass instrument in [[rock and roll]] music, [[Marshall Lytle]] of [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] being but one example.
In the 1940s, a new style of dance music called [[rhythm and blues]] developed, incorporating elements of the earlier styles of blues and swing. [[Louis Jordan]], the first innovator of this style, featured an upright bass in his group, the [[Tympany Five]].<ref name="Bartley">[http://library.missouristate.edu/archives/exhibits/bartley/index.htm ''Dallas Bartley – Small town Boy: Playing in the bands''], Special Collections and Archives Department, Missouri State University</ref>

The upright bass remained an integral part of pop lineups throughout the 1950s, as the new genre of [[rock and roll]] was built largely upon the model of rhythm and blues, with strong elements also derived from jazz, country, and bluegrass. However, upright bass players using their instruments in these contexts faced inherent problems. They were forced to compete with louder horn instruments (and later amplified electric guitars), making bass parts difficult to hear. The upright bass is difficult to amplify in loud concert venue settings, because it can be prone to [[Audio feedback|feedback]] ''howls''. As well, the upright bass is large and awkward to transport, which also created transportation problems for touring bands.

In some groups, the slap bass was utilized as band percussion in lieu of a drummer; such was the case with Bill Haley & His Saddlemen (the forerunner group to the Comets), which did not use drummers on recordings and live performances until late 1952; prior to this the slap bass was relied on for percussion, including on recordings such as Haley's versions of "[[Rock the Joint]]" and "[[Rocket 88]]".<ref>BBC Radio 2, ''Just Keep on Rockin' '', broadcast 17 April 2004. On this radio documentary, host [[Suzi Quatro]] expresses disbelief that no drums were played on the recording of ''Rock the Joint''.</ref>

In 1951, [[Leo Fender]] independently released his [[Precision Bass]], the first commercially successful [[electric bass]] guitar.<ref name="p-bass">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2004/1/2004_1_12.shtml ''The Electric Guitar: How We Got From Andrés Segovia To Kurt Cobain''], Monica M. Smith</ref> The electric bass was easily amplified with its built-in pickups, easily portable (less than a foot longer than an electric guitar), and easier to play in tune, thanks to the metal frets. In the 1960s and 1970s bands were playing at louder volumes and performing in larger venues. The electric bass was able to provide the huge, highly amplified stadium-filling bass tone that the pop and rock music of this era demanded, and the upright bass receded from the limelight of the popular music scene.
[[File:JimCreeggan1.JPG|thumb|200px| right|Jim Creeggan from the Barenaked Ladies, pictured at a 2009 show.]]
The upright bass began making a modest comeback in popular music in the mid-1980s, in part due to a renewed interest in earlier forms of rock and country music. In the 1990s, improvements in pickups and amplifier designs for electro-acoustic horizontal and upright basses made it easier for bassists to get a good, clear amplified tone from an acoustic instrument. Some popular bands decided to anchor their sound with an upright bass instead of an electric bass, such as the Barenaked Ladies. A trend for "unplugged" performances further helped to enhance the public's interest in the upright bass and acoustic bass guitars.

[[Jim Creeggan]] of [[Barenaked Ladies]] primarily plays upright bass, although he has increasingly played bass guitar throughout the band's career. [[Athol Guy]] of the Australian folk/pop group [[The Seekers]] plays an upright bass. [[Shannon Birchall]], of the Australian folk-rock group [[The John Butler Trio]],<ref>"In Australia, the John Butler Trio has established itself as one of the most successful independent acts in recent history. Their U.S. debut, ''Sunrise Over Sea'', features gritty and soulful vocals, elements of hip-hop and Appalachian folk." [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4814948 The John Butler Trio's Fresh Blends]</ref> makes extensive use of upright basses, performing extended live solos in songs such as Betterman. On the 2008 album [[In Ear Park]] by the indie/pop band [[Department of Eagles]], a bowed upright bass is featured quite prominently on the songs "Teenagers" and "In Ear Park". Norwegian ompa-rock band [[Kaizers Orchestra]] use the upright bass exclusively both live and on their recordings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaizers.no |title='&#39;Kaizers Orchestra official web page'&#39; |publisher=Kaizers.no |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>

[[Hank Williams III]]'s bass players (Jason Brown, [[Joe Buck (musician)|Joe Buck]] and Zach Shedd, most notably) have used upright basses for recording as well as during the country and Hellbilly sets of Hank III's live performances before switching to electric bass for the [[Assjack]] set.

The late 1970s rockabilly-punk genre of [[psychobilly]] continued and expanded upon the rockabilly tradition of slap bass. Bassists such as [[Kim Nekroman]] and [[Geoff Kresge]] have developed the ability to play rapid slap bass that in effect turns the bass into a percussion instrument.

==Modern playing styles==
In popular music genres, the instrument is usually played with [[bass instrument amplifier|amplification]] and almost exclusively played with the fingers, ''[[pizzicato]]'' style. The pizzicato style varies between different players and genres. Some players perform with the sides of one, two, or three fingers, especially for walking basslines and slow tempo ballads, because this is purported to create a stronger and more solid tone. Some players use the more nimble tips of the fingers to play fast-moving solo passages or to pluck lightly for quiet tunes.The use of amplification allows the player to have more control over the tone of the instrument, because amplifiers have equalization controls that allow the bassist to accentuate certain frequencies (often the bass frequencies) while de-accentuating some frequencies (often the high frequencies, so that there is less finger noise).

An unamplified acoustic bass's tone is limited by the frequency responsiveness of the instrument's hollow body, which means that the very low pitches may not be as loud as the higher pitches. With an amplifier and equalization devices, a bass player can boost the low frequencies, which changes the frequency response. In addition, the use of an amplifier can increase the sustain of the instrument, which is particularly useful for accompaniment during ballads and for melodic solos with held notes.

In traditional jazz, [[Swing (genre)|swing]], [[polka]], rockabilly, and psychobilly music, it is sometimes played in the ''[[Slapping (music)|slap style]]''. This is a vigorous version of pizzicato where the strings are "slapped" against the fingerboard between the main notes of the bass line, producing a [[snare drum]]-like percussive sound. The main notes are either played normally or by pulling the string away from the fingerboard and releasing it so that it bounces off the fingerboard, producing a distinctive percussive attack in addition to the expected pitch. Notable slap style bass players, whose use of the technique was often highly syncopated and virtuosic, sometimes interpolated two, three, four, or more slaps in between notes of the bass line.<!-- Regarding the interpolation of 3 or 4 slaps in between the notes of a bassline...it doesn't seem doable at all when you try it...I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen the youtube videos of the psychobilly bassist from the Necromantix clearly interpolating 3 or 4 slaps in between notes of his bassline! I think he may have downtuned the low E so that it is easier to get it to rebound...I found an old bluegrass method book that says detuning the E is a trick used by some old time bluegrass players to make triple and quadruple slapping easier :)  -->

"Slap style" may have influenced electric bass guitar players {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} who, from the mid-sixties (particularly Larry Graham of Sly and the Family Stone), developed a technique called ''[[Slap-back|slap and pop]]'' that used the thumb of the plucking hand to hit the string, making a slapping sound but still letting the note ring, and the index or middle finger of the plucking hand to pull the string back so it hits the fretboard, achieving the pop sound described above.

===Contemporary (1900s)===

====Classical====
[[File:Gary karr.jpg|thumb|right|Double bass soloist Gary Karr]]
Some of the most influential contemporary classical double bass players are known as much for their contributions to pedagogy as for their performing skills, such as US bassist [[Oscar G. Zimmerman]] (1910–1987), known for his teaching at the [[Eastman School of Music]] and, for 44 summers at the [[Interlochen]] National Music Camp in [[Michigan]] and French bassist [[François Rabbath]] (b. 1931) who developed a new bass method that divided the entire fingerboard into six positions. Bassists noted for their virtuoso solo skills include American pedagogue and performer [[Gary Karr]] (b. 1941), Finnish composer [[Teppo Hauta-Aho]] (b. 1941), Italian composer Fernando Grillo, and US player-composer [[Edgar Meyer]]. For a longer list, see the ''[[List of contemporary classical double bass players]]''.

====Jazz====
{{See also|List of jazz bassists}}
Notable jazz bassists from the 1940s to the 1950s included bassist [[Jimmy Blanton]] (1918–1942) whose short tenure in the [[Duke Ellington]] Swing band (cut short by his death from [[tuberculosis]]) introduced new melodic and harmonic solo ideas for the instrument; bassist [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]] (1926–2002), known for backing Beboppers [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Art Tatum]] and [[Charlie Parker]], and forming the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]]; [[hard bop]] bassist [[Ron Carter]] (born 1937), who has appeared on 3,500 albums make him one of the most-recorded bassists in jazz history, including LPs by [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Wes Montgomery]] and many [[Blue Note Records]] artists; and [[Paul Chambers]] (1935–1969), a member of the [[Miles Davis Quintet]] (including the landmark modal jazz recording ''[[Kind of Blue]]'') and many other 1950s and 1960s rhythm sections, was known for his virtuosic [[improvisation]]s.

The experimental post 1960s era, and free jazz and jazz-rock fusion, produced several influential bassists. [[Charles Mingus]] (1922–1979), who was also a composer and [[bandleader]], produced music that fused [[hard bop]] with black [[gospel music]], [[free jazz]], and classical music. [[Free jazz]] and post-bop bassist [[Charlie Haden]] (1937–2014) is best known for his long association with saxophonist [[Ornette Coleman]], and for his role in the 1970s-era [[Liberation Music Orchestra]], an experimental group. [[Eddie Gómez (musician)|Eddie Gómez]] and [[George Mraz]], who played with [[Bill Evans]] and [[Oscar Peterson]], respectively, and are both acknowledged to have furthered expectations of pizzicato fluency and melodic phrasing. [[Jazz fusion|Fusion]] virtuoso [[Stanley Clarke]] (born 1951) is notable for his dexterity on both the upright bass and the electric bass. [[Terry Plumeri]] is noted for his horn-like arco fluency and vocal-sounding tone.

In the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, one of the new "young lions" was [[Christian McBride]] (born 1972), who has performed with a range of veterans ranging from [[McCoy Tyner]] to fusion gurus [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Chick Corea]], and who has released albums such as 2003's ''[[Vertical Vision]]''. Another young bassist of note is [[Esperanza Spalding]] (born 1984) who, at 27 years of age, had already won a [[Grammy]] for Best New Artist. For a longer list, see the [[List of jazz bassists]], which includes both double bass and electric bass players.

====Other popular genres====
[[Image:Scottowen-London2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Scott Owen]], double bass player for Australian rock band [[The Living End]].]]
In addition to being a noted classical player, [[Edgar Meyer]] is well known in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[Progressive bluegrass|newgrass]] circles. [[Todd Phillips]] is another prominent bluegrass player. Well-known [[rockabilly]] bassists include [[Bill Black]], [[Marshall Lytle]] (with [[Bill Haley & His Comets]]) and [[Lee Rocker]] (with 1980s-era rockabilly revivalists the [[Stray Cats]]).

Notable rockabilly revivalists and [[psychobilly]] performers from the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century include [[Scott Owen]] (from the Australian band [[The Living End]]), [[Jimbo Wallace]] (from the US band [[Reverend Horton Heat]]), [[Kim Nekroman]] ([[Nekromantix]]), [[Patricia Day]] ([[HorrorPops]]), [[Geoff Kresge]] ([[Tiger Army]], ex-[[AFI (band)|AFI]]). [[Willie Dixon]] (1915–1992) was one of the most notable figures in the history of [[rhythm and blues]]. In addition to being an upright bassist, he wrote dozens of R&B hits and worked as a producer. He also plays bass on numerous [[Chuck Berry]]'s rock and roll hits. Many other [[rockabilly]] bands like El Rio Trio (from the Netherlands) also use this instrument in their work. See also the [[List of double bassists in popular music]].

==Pedagogy and training==
The pedagogy and training for the double bass varies widely by genre and country. Classical double bass has a history of pedagogy dating back several centuries, including teaching manuals, studies, and progressive exercises that help students to develop the endurance and accuracy of the left hand, and control for the bowing hand. Classical training methods vary by country: many of the major European countries are associated with specific methods (e.g., the [[Edouard Nanny]] method in France or the [[Franz Simandl]] method in Germany). In classical training, the majority of the instruction for the right hand focuses on the production of bowing tone; little time is spent studying the varieties of pizzicato tone.

In contrast, in genres that mainly or exclusively use pizzicato (plucking), such as jazz and blues, a great deal of time and effort is focused on learning the varieties of different pizzicato styles used for music of different styles of tempi. For example, in jazz, aspiring bassists have to learn how to perform a wide range of pizzicato tones, including using the sides of the fingers to create a full, deep sound for ballads, using the tips of the fingers for fast walking basslines or solos, and performing a variety of percussive ''ghost notes'' by raking muted or partially muted strings.

===Formal training===

Of all of the genres, classical and jazz have the most established and comprehensive systems of instruction and training. In the classical milieu, children can begin taking private lessons on the instrument and performing in children's or youth orchestras. Teens who aspire to becoming professional classical bassists can continue their studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges, conservatories, and universities. Colleges offer certificates and diplomas in bass performance.

[[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur orchestral experience for double bass players. Universities offer a range of double bass programs, including bachelor's degrees, Master of Music degrees, and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees. As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and orchestral, opera, or chamber music training festivals, which give students the opportunity to play a wide range of music.

Bachelor's degrees in bass performance (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include individual bass lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Usually, bass performance students perform several recitals of solo double bass music, such as concertos, sonatas, and Baroque suites.

Master of music degrees ([[M.mus.]]) in double bass performance consist of private lessons, ensemble experience, coaching in playing orchestral double bass parts, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two solo recitals. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an [[M.Mus.]] or M.M.) is often a required credential for people who wish to become a professor of double bass at a university or conservatory.

Doctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in double bass performance provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination-recital, are required. Students perform a number of recitals (around six), including a lecture-recital with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework, and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D.M.A program.

Throughout the early history of jazz, double bass players either learned the instrument informally, or from getting classical training early on, as in the case of Ron Carter and Charles Mingus. In the 1980s and 1990s, colleges and universities began to introduce diplomas and degrees in jazz performance. Students in jazz diploma or Bachelor of Music programs take individual bass lessons, get experience in small jazz combos with coaching from an experienced player, and play in jazz big bands. As with classical training programs, jazz programs also include classroom courses in music history and music theory. In a jazz program, these courses focus on the different eras of jazz history. such as Swing, Bebop, and fusion. The theory courses focus on the musical skills used in jazz improvisation and in jazz comping (accompanying) and the composition of jazz tunes. There are also jazz summer camps and training festivals/seminars, which offer students the chance to learn new skills and styles.

===Informal training===
In other genres, such as blues, rockabilly, and psychobilly, the pedagogical systems and training sequences are not as formalized and institutionalized. There are not degrees in blues bass performance, or conservatories offering multiple-year diplomas in rockabilly bass. However, there are a range of books, playing methods, and, since the 1990s, instructional DVDs (e.g., on how to play rockabilly-style slap bass). As such, performers in these other genres tend to come from a variety of routes, including informal learning by using bass method books or DVDs, taking private lessons and coaching, and learning from records and CDs. In some cases, blues or rockabilly bassists may have obtained some initial training through the classical or jazz pedagogy systems (e.g., youth orchestra or high school big band). In genres such as tango, which use a lot of bowed passages and jazz-style pizzicato lines, the bassists tend to come from classical or jazz training routes.

==Careers==
Careers in double bass vary widely by genre and by region or country. Most bassists earn their living from a mixture of performance and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance jobs is by playing at an [[audition]]. In some styles of music, such as jazz-oriented stage bands, bassists may be asked to [[sight reading|sight read]] printed music or perform standard pieces (e.g., a [[jazz standard]] such as ''Now's the Time'') with an ensemble. Similarly, in a rock or blues band, auditionees may be asked to play various rock or blues standards. An upright bassist auditioning for a blues band might be asked to play in a Swing-style walking [[bassline]], a rockabilly-style [[Slap bass|"slapping"]] bassline (in which the strings are percussively struck against the fingerboard) and a 1950s ballad with long held notes. A person auditioning for a role as a bassist in some styles of pop or rock music may be expected to demonstrate the ability to perform [[harmony vocals]] as a [[backup singer]].

===Classical music===
In [[classical music]], bassists audition for playing jobs in orchestras and for admission into university or Conservatory programs or degrees. At a classical bass audition, the performer typically plays a movement from a Bach suite or a movement from a bass concerto and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature. The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts of bass parts and bass solos from the orchestral literature. Orchestral bass auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[Concertmaster]], the Principal bass player and possibly other principal players such as the Principal cellist.

The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to [[sight read]] orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a ''test week'', in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that double bass sections are mostly male. The article stated that while "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists", the double bass, brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras "...are still predominantly male."<ref> http://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms</ref>A 2014 BBC article stated that the "...introduction of [[Blind audition|‘blind’ auditions]], where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift."<ref>http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors </ref>

===Performance jobs===
Performance jobs include playing as a freelancer in small groups, large ensembles, or performing solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio (as the studio's house bassist). Many bass players find extra work by substituting ("subbing") for bassists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for bass players to find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a bass player can come to this is in the case of classical bass players who win an audition at a professional orchestra or the tiny number of top session pros that are hired by recording studios. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral bassists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.

Teaching work for double bassist includes giving private lessons in the home or at colleges and universities; coaching bass players who are preparing for recordings or auditions; doing group coaching at music camps or for youth ensembles; and working as a high school music teacher.

In jazz, blues, rockabilly and other genres, most bassists cannot earn a living from playing in a single group (with the exception of the small number of bassists in top touring bands or groups with recording contracts), so they work in different bands and supplement their income with session playing and teaching. Due to the limited number of full-time orchestral jobs, many classical bassists are similarly not able to find full-time work with a single orchestra. Some bassists increase their employ-ability by learning several different styles, such as classical and jazz or rockabilly and bluegrass.

In some cases, bassists supplement their performing and teaching income with other related music jobs, such as working as a bass repairer (luthier); as a contractor who hires musicians for orchestras or big bands, composing music (e.g., [[Dave Holland]]), songwriting, conducting (e.g., [[David Currie (conductor)|David Currie]]), acting as a bandleader (e.g., [[Charles Mingus]]), or coordinating jam sessions (e.g., [[John Geggie]]). Some regions may not have enough work in music to provide a living, even if a bassist plays several styles and does recordings and teaching. As such, in some regions, bassists may have to supplement musical work with income from another field.
