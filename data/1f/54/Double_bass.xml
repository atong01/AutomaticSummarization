The double bass's proportions are dissimilar to those of the violin and cello; for example, it is deeper (the distance from top to back is proportionally much greater than the violin). In addition, while the violin has bulging shoulders, most double basses have shoulders carved with a more acute slope, like members of the viol family. Many very old double basses have had their shoulders cut or sloped to aid playing with modern techniques. Before these modifications, the design of their shoulders was closer to instruments of the violin family.</paragraph><paragraph>The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths (like a viol), rather than<space/><link><target>Perfect fifth</target><part>fifths</part></link><space/>(see<space/><link><target>#Tuning</target><part>Tuning</part></link><space/>below).

A third less common design, called the<space/><italics>busetto</italics><space/>shape, can also be found, as can the even more rare<space/><italics>guitar</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>pear</italics><space/>shape. The back of the instrument can vary from being a round, carved back similar to that of the violin, to a flat and angled back similar to the viol family.</paragraph><paragraph>The double bass features many parts that are similar to members of the violin family, including a bridge,<space/><link><target>f-hole</target><trail>s</trail></link>, a<space/><link><target>tailpiece</target></link>, a<space/><link><target>scroll (music)</target><part>scroll</part></link>, and a<space/><link><target>sound post</target></link>. Unlike the rest of the violin family, the double bass still reflects influence, and can be considered partly derived, from the<space/><link><target>viol</target></link><space/>family of instruments, in particular the<space/><link><target>violone</target></link>, the bass member of the viol family.</paragraph><paragraph>The double bass also differs from members of the violin family in that the shoulders are typically sloped, the back is often angled (both to allow easier access to the instrument, particularly in the upper range).<space/><link><target>machine head</target><part>Machine tuners</part></link><space/>are always fitted, in contrast to the rest of the violin family, where traditional wooden friction pegs are still the primary means of tuning. Lack of standardization in design means that one double bass can sound and look very different from another.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Construction</heading><paragraph>The double bass is closest in construction to violins, but has some notable similarities to the violone (literally &quot;large viol&quot;), the largest and lowest member of the viol family. Unlike the violone, however, the fingerboard of the double bass is<space/><link><target>fret</target><part>unfretted</part></link>, and the double bass has fewer strings (the violone, like most viols, generally had six strings, although some specimens had five or four).</paragraph><paragraph>An important distinction between the double bass and other members of the violin family is the construction of the<space/><link><target>pegbox</target></link>. While the violin,<space/><link><target>viola</target></link>, and cello all use friction<space/><link><target>tuning peg</target><part>pegs</part></link><space/>for fine tuning adjustments, the double bass has metal<space/><link><target>machine head</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The key on the tuning machine turns a metal<space/><italics>worm</italics>, which drives a<space/><link><target>worm gear</target></link><space/>that winds a string. While this development makes fine tuners unnecessary, a very small number of bassists use them nevertheless. At the base of the double bass is a metal rod with a spiked or rubberized end called the endpin, which rests on the floor. This<space/><link><target>endpin</target></link><space/>is generally thicker and more robust than that of a cello, because of the greater mass of the instrument.</paragraph><paragraph>The materials most often used in double bass construction are maple (back, neck, ribs), spruce (top), and ebony (fingerboard, tailpiece). Exceptions to this include less-expensive basses that have<space/><link><target>laminate</target><trail>d</trail></link><space/>(<link><target>plywood</target></link>) tops, backs, and ribs, and some newer mid-range basses made of<space/><link><target>willow</target></link>. These basses are resistant to changes in heat and humidity, which can cause cracks in spruce tops. Plywood laminate basses, which are used in music schools,<space/><link><target>youth orchestra</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and in popular and folk music settings, are very resistant to humidity and heat, as well to the physical abuse they are apt to encounter in a school environment (or, for blues and folk musicians, to the hazards of touring and performing in bars).</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>soundpost</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>bass bar</target></link><space/>are components of the internal construction. All the parts of a double bass are glued together, except the soundpost, bridge, and tailpiece, which are held in place by string tension (although the soundpost usually remains in place when the instrument's strings are loosened or removed). The metal tuning machines are attached to the sides of the pegbox with metal screws. While tuning mechanisms generally differ from the higher-pitched orchestral stringed instruments, some basses have non-functional, ornamental<space/><link><target>tuning peg</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>projecting from the side of the pegbox, in imitation of the tuning pegs on a cello or violin.</paragraph><paragraph>Famous double bass makers come from around the world and often represent varied national characteristics. The most highly sought (and expensive) instruments come from Italy and include basses made by Giovanni Paolo Maggini, Gaspar da Salo, the Testore family (Carlo Antonio, Carlo Giuseppe, Gennaro, Giovanni, Paulo Antonio), Celestino Puolotti, and Matteo Gofriller. French and English basses from famous makers are also sought out by players.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">September 2014</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Strings</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Bridgedetail.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>upright</part><part>Detail of the bridge and strings</part></link><link><target>Image:Double bass gut strings.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>Gut strings</part></link>The history of the double bass is tightly coupled to the development of string technology, as it was the advent<extension extension_name='ref' name="briefhistoryofthedoublebass"></extension><space/>of<space/><link><target>Strings (music)#Winding</target><part>overwound</part></link><space/>gut strings, which first rendered the instrument more generally practicable, as (over<template><target>nbhyph</target></template>) wound strings attain low notes within a smaller overall string diameter than non-wound strings.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/jw/strings.html#music'>Strings, standing waves and harmonics</link>, Prof. Joe Wolfe, University of New South Wales</extension><space/>Professor Larry Hurst argues that had &quot;it not been for the appearance of the overwound gut string in the 1650s, the double bass would surely have become extinct.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="oocities.org"></extension><space/>because thicknesses needed for regular gut strings made the lower-pitched strings almost unplayable.</paragraph><paragraph>Prior to the mid-20th century,<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">May 2010</arg></template><space/>double bass strings were usually made of<space/><link><target>Catgut</target><part>gut</part></link>, but, since that time, steel has largely replaced it, because steel strings hold their pitch better and yield more volume when played with the bow.<extension extension_name='ref' name="bow_wood"><link type='external' href='http://doublebassworkshop.com/double-bass-strings-articles-44'>Article on bass strings by the Double Bass Workshop</link><space/><template><target>wayback</target><arg name="url">http://doublebassworkshop.com/double-bass-strings-articles-44<space/></arg><arg name="date">20120325185214<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>Gut strings are also more vulnerable to changes of humidity and temperature, and break more easily than steel strings.</paragraph><paragraph>Gut strings are nowadays mostly used by bassists who perform in<space/><link><target>Baroque music</target><part>baroque</part></link><space/>ensembles,<space/><link><target>rockabilly</target></link><space/>bands, traditional<space/><link><target>blues</target></link><space/>bands, and<space/><link><target>Bluegrass music</target><part>bluegrass</part></link><space/>bands.

Steel strings can be set up closer to the fingerboard and, additionally, strings can be played in higher positions on the lower strings and still produce clear tone. The classic 19th century<space/><link><target>Franz Simandl</target></link><space/>method does not use the low E string in higher positions because older gut strings, set up high over the fingerboard, could not produce clear tone in these higher positions. However, with modern steel strings, bassists can play with clear tone in higher positions on the low E and A strings, particularly when they use modern lighter-gauge, lower-tension steel strings.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Bows</heading><paragraph>The double bass<space/><link><target>bow (music)</target><part>bow</part></link><space/>comes in two distinct forms (shown below). The &quot;French&quot; or &quot;overhand&quot; bow is similar in shape and implementation to the bow used on the other members of the orchestral string instrument family, while the &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Butler&quot; bow is typically broader and shorter, and is held in a &quot;hand shake&quot; (or maybe &quot;hacksaw&quot;) position.<link><target>Image:French and german bows.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>French and German bows compared</part></link>These two bows provide different ways of moving the arm and distributing force on the strings.

The differences between the two, however, are minute for a proficient player, and modern players in major orchestras use both bows.</paragraph><heading level='4'>German bow</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:German bow2.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>German-style bow</part></link>The German bow (sometimes called the Butler bow) is the older of the two designs.

The thumb rests on the shaft of the bow, next to the frog while the other fingers drape on the other side of the bow. Various styles dictate the curve of the fingers and thumb, as do the style of piece; a more pronounced curve and lighter hold on the bow is used for virtuoso or more delicate pieces, while a flatter curve and sturdier grip on the bow sacrifices some power for easier control in strokes such as detach, spiccato, and staccato.<link><target>Image:AGK bass bow grip.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>A bassist holding a French bow; note how the thumb rests on the shaft of the bow next to the frog.</part></link></paragraph><heading level='4'>Bow construction and materials</heading><paragraph>Double bass bows vary in length, ranging from 60&amp;nbsp;cm (24&quot;) to 75&amp;nbsp;cm (30&quot;).<space/><link><target>Brazilwood</target><part>Pernambuco</part></link>, also known as Brazilwood, is regarded as an excellent quality stick material, but due to its scarcity and expense, other materials are increasingly being used.

This is an extra section of fingerboard mounted on the head of the bass. It extends the fingerboard under the lowest string and gives an additional four semitones of downward range. The lowest string is typically tuned down to C, an octave below the lowest note on the cello. More rarely this string may be tuned to a low B, as a few works in the orchestral repertoire call for a low<space/><italics>B</italics>, such as<space/><link><target>Ottorino Respighi</target><part>Respighi</part></link>'s<space/><italics>The Pines of Rome</italics>. In rare cases, some players have a low B extension, which has B as its lowest note. There are several varieties of extensions:</paragraph><paragraph>In the simplest mechanical extensions, there are no mechanical aids attached to the fingerboard extension except a locking nut for the &quot;E&quot; note. To play the extension notes, the player reaches back over the pegs to press the string to the fingerboard. The advantage of this &quot;fingered&quot; extension is that the player can adjust the intonation of all of the<space/><link><target>stopped note</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>on the extension, and there are no mechanical noises from metal keys and levers. The disadvantage of the &quot;fingered&quot; extension is that it can be hard to perform rapid alternations between low notes on the extension and notes on the regular fingerboard, such as a bassline that quickly alternates between &quot;G&quot; and the low &quot;D&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>The simplest type of mechanical aid is the use of wooden &quot;fingers&quot; that can be closed to press the string down and fret the C<template><target>music</target><arg>♯</arg></template>, D, E<template><target>music</target><arg>b</arg></template>, or E notes. This system is particularly useful for basslines that have a repeating<space/><link><target>pedal point</target></link><space/>such as a low D, because once the note is locked in place with the mechanical &quot;finger,&quot; the lowest string sounds a different note when played open (e.g., a low D).</paragraph><paragraph>The most complicated mechanical aid for use with extensions is the mechanical lever system nicknamed the<space/><italics>machine</italics>. This lever system, which superficially resembles the keying mechanism of reed instruments such as the bassoon, mounts levers beside the regular fingerboard (near the nut, on the &quot;E&quot; string side), which remotely activate metal &quot;fingers&quot; on the extension fingerboard. The most expensive metal lever systems also give the player the ability to &quot;lock&quot; down notes on the extension fingerboard, as with the wooden &quot;finger&quot; system. One criticism of these devices is that they may lead to unwanted metallic clicking noises.</paragraph><paragraph>Once a mechanical &quot;finger&quot; of the wooden &quot;finger&quot; extension or the metal &quot;finger&quot; machine extension is locked down or depressed, it is not easy to make microtonal pitch adjustments, as is possible with a hand-fingered extension.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Other tuning variations</heading><paragraph>A small number of bass players tune their strings in<space/><link><target>Fifths tuning</target><part>fifths</part></link>, like a cello but an octave lower (CGDA low to high). This tuning was used by the jazz player<space/><link><target>Red Mitchell</target></link><space/>and is increasingly used by classical players, notably the Canadian bassist<space/><link><target>Joel Quarrington</target></link>. In classical solo playing the double bass is usually tuned a whole tone higher (F<template><target>music</target><arg>#</arg></template>BEA). This higher tuning is called<space/><italics>solo tuning</italics>, whereas the regular tuning is known as &quot;orchestral tuning.&quot; Solo tuning strings are generally thinner than regular strings. String tension differs so much between solo and orchestral tuning that a different set of strings is often employed that has a lighter gauge. Strings are always labelled for either solo or orchestral tuning, and published solo music is arranged for either solo or orchestral tuning. Some popular solos and concerti, such as the<space/><italics><link><target>Koussevitsky</target></link><space/>Concerto</italics><space/>are available in both solo and orchestral tuning arrangements.</paragraph><paragraph>Many contemporary composers specify highly specialized scordatura.<space/><link><target>Luciano Berio</target><part>Berio</part></link>, for example, asks the player to tune his strings EG<template><target>music</target><arg>♯</arg></template>DG in<space/><italics>Sequenza XIVb</italics><space/>and<space/><link><target>Giacinto Scelsi</target><part>Scelsi</part></link><space/>asks for both FADE and FAFE in<space/><italics>Nuits</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>A variant and much less-commonly used form of solo tuning used in some Eastern European countries is (ADGC), which uses three of the strings from orchestral tuning (ADG) and then adds a high &quot;C&quot; string. Some bassists with five-string basses use a high &quot;C&quot; string as the fifth string, instead of a low &quot;B&quot; string. Adding the high &quot;C&quot; string facilitates the performance of solo repertoire with a high tessitura (range). Another option is to utilize both a low C (or B) extension and a high C string.</paragraph><paragraph>When choosing a bass with a fifth string, the player may decide between adding a higher or lower-tuned string. Six-stringed instruments are generally regarded as impractical. To accommodate the additional string, the fingerboard is usually slightly wider, and the top slightly thicker to handle the increased tension. Some five-stringed instruments are converted four-string instruments. Because these do not have wider fingerboards, some players find them more difficult to finger and bow. Converted four-string basses usually require either a new, thicker top, or lighter strings to compensate for the increased tension.</paragraph><paragraph>The Berlioz/Strauss<space/><link><target>Treatise on Instrumentation</target></link><space/>states that, &quot;A good orchestra should have several four-string double-basses, some of them tuned in fifths and thirds.&quot; The book then shows a tuning of E, G, D, A from bottom to top string. &quot;Together with the other double-basses tuned in fourths, a combination of open strings would be available, which would greatly increase the sonority of the orchestra.&quot;</paragraph><heading level='2'>Playing and performance considerations</heading><heading level='3'>Body and hand position</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Renaudgarciafons.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>200px</part><part>French double-bass player and composer Renaud Garcia-Fons pictured during a performance.</part></link>Double bassists either stand or sit to play the instrument. The instrument height is set by adjusting the endpin such that the player can reach the desired playing zones of the strings with bow or plucking hand. Bassists who stand and bow sometimes set the endpin by aligning the first finger in either first or half position with eye level, although there is little standardization in this regard. Players who sit generally use a stool about the height of the player's pants inseam length.</paragraph><paragraph>Traditionally, double bassists stood to play solo and sat to play in the orchestra or opera pit.

Rockabilly style can be very physically demanding for double bass players.</part></link>Performing on bass can be physically demanding, because the strings are large and thick. Also, the space between notes on the fingerboard is large, due to scale length and string spacing, so players must shift positions frequently. As with all non-fretted<space/><link><target>string instrument</target><trail>s</trail></link>, performers must learn to place their fingers precisely to produce the correct pitch. For bassists with shorter arms or smaller hands, the large spaces between pitches may present a significant challenge, especially in the lowest range, where the spaces between notes are largest. However, the increased use of playing techniques such as thumb position and modifications to the bass, such as the use of lighter-gauge strings at lower tension, have eased the difficulty of playing the instrument.</paragraph><paragraph>Bass parts have relatively fewer fast passages, double stops, or large jumps in range. These parts are usually given to the cello section, since the cello is a smaller instrument on which these techniques are more easily performed.</paragraph><paragraph>Until the 1990s, child-sized double basses were not widely available, and the large size of the bass prevented children from playing the instrument until they grew to a height and hand size that let them to play a 3/4-size model (the most common size). Starting in the 1990s, smaller half, quarter, eighth, and even sixteenth-sized instruments became more widely available, so children could start younger.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Volume</heading><paragraph>Despite the size of the instrument, it is not as loud as many other instruments, due to its low range.

The player uses the mute when the Italian instruction<space/><italics>con sordino</italics><space/>appears in the bass part, and removes it in response to<space/><italics>senza sordino</italics>. With the mute on, the tone of the bass is quieter, darker, and more somber. Bowed bass parts with a mute can have a nasal tone.

The use of only the top three strings was popular for bass soloists and Principal bassists in orchestras in the 19th century, because it reduced the pressure on the wooden top of the bass, which was thought to create a more resonant sound. As well, the low &quot;E&quot; strings used during the 19th century were thick cords made of gut, which were difficult to tune and play.</paragraph><heading level='4'>1800s</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:BottesiniTestore.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>150px</part><part>The virtuoso nineteenth-century bassist and composer Giovanni Bottesini with his 1716 Carlo Antonio Testore bass.</part></link>In the 19th century, the opera conductor, composer, and bassist<space/><link><target>Giovanni Bottesini</target></link><space/>was considered the &quot;<link><target>Paganini</target></link><space/>of the double bass&quot; of his time. His compositions were written in the popular Italian opera style of the 19th century, which exploit the double bass in a way that was not seen beforehand. They require virtuosic runs and great leaps to the highest registers of the instrument, even into the realm of harmonics. Many early 20th century bassists considered these compositions unplayable, but are now they frequently performed.

The upright bass produces a different sound than the bass guitar, because its strings are not stopped by metal<space/><link><target>fret</target><trail>s</trail></link>, instead having a continuous tonal range on the uninterrupted fingerboard.

Some contemporary bluegrass bands favor the electric bass, because it is easier to transport than the large and somewhat fragile upright bass. However, the bass guitar has a different musical sound. Many musicians feel the slower attack and percussive, woody tone of the upright bass gives it a more &quot;earthy&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; sound than an electric bass, particularly when gut strings are used.</paragraph><paragraph>Common rhythms in bluegrass bass playing involve (with some exceptions) plucking on beats 1 and 3 in 4/4 time; beats 1 and 2 in 2/4 time, and on the downbeat in 3/4 time (waltz time). Bluegrass bass lines are usually simple, typically staying on the root and fifth of each chord throughout most of a song. There are two main exceptions to this rule. Bluegrass bassists often do a diatonic<space/><italics>walkup</italics><space/>or<space/><italics><link><target>walkdown</target></link>,</italics><space/>in which they play every beat of a bar for one or two bars, typically when there is a chord change.

When bluegrass bass players slap the string by pulling it until it hits the fingerboard or hit the strings against the fingerboard, it adds the high-pitched percussive &quot;clack&quot; or &quot;slap&quot; sound to the low-pitched bass notes, sounding much like the clacks of a tap dancer.

In the 1960s and 1970s bands were playing at louder volumes and performing in larger venues. The electric bass was able to provide the huge, highly amplified stadium-filling bass tone that the pop and rock music of this era demanded, and the upright bass receded from the limelight of the popular music scene.<link><target>File:JimCreeggan1.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>200px</part><part>right</part><part>Jim Creeggan from the Barenaked Ladies, pictured at a 2009 show.</part></link>The upright bass began making a modest comeback in popular music in the mid-1980s, in part due to a renewed interest in earlier forms of rock and country music. In the 1990s, improvements in pickups and amplifier designs for electro-acoustic horizontal and upright basses made it easier for bassists to get a good, clear amplified tone from an acoustic instrument. Some popular bands decided to anchor their sound with an upright bass instead of an electric bass, such as the Barenaked Ladies.

Some players use the more nimble tips of the fingers to play fast-moving solo passages or to pluck lightly for quiet tunes.The use of amplification allows the player to have more control over the tone of the instrument, because amplifiers have equalization controls that allow the bassist to accentuate certain frequencies (often the bass frequencies) while de-accentuating some frequencies (often the high frequencies, so that there is less finger noise).</paragraph><paragraph>An unamplified acoustic bass's tone is limited by the frequency responsiveness of the instrument's hollow body, which means that the very low pitches may not be as loud as the higher pitches. With an amplifier and equalization devices, a bass player can boost the low frequencies, which changes the frequency response. In addition, the use of an amplifier can increase the sustain of the instrument, which is particularly useful for accompaniment during ballads and for melodic solos with held notes.</paragraph><paragraph>In traditional jazz,<space/><link><target>Swing (genre)</target><part>swing</part></link>,<space/><link><target>polka</target></link>, rockabilly, and psychobilly music, it is sometimes played in the<space/><italics><link><target>Slapping (music)</target><part>slap style</part></link></italics>. This is a vigorous version of pizzicato where the strings are &quot;slapped&quot; against the fingerboard between the main notes of the bass line, producing a<space/><link><target>snare drum</target></link>-like percussive sound. The main notes are either played normally or by pulling the string away from the fingerboard and releasing it so that it bounces off the fingerboard, producing a distinctive percussive attack in addition to the expected pitch. Notable slap style bass players, whose use of the technique was often highly syncopated and virtuosic, sometimes interpolated two, three, four, or more slaps in between notes of the bass line.</paragraph><paragraph>&quot;Slap style&quot; may have influenced electric bass guitar players<space/><template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">April 2013</arg></template><space/>who, from the mid-sixties (particularly Larry Graham of Sly and the Family Stone), developed a technique called<space/><italics><link><target>Slap-back</target><part>slap and pop</part></link></italics><space/>that used the thumb of the plucking hand to hit the string, making a slapping sound but still letting the note ring, and the index or middle finger of the plucking hand to pull the string back so it hits the fretboard, achieving the pop sound described above.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Double bassists</heading><heading level='3'>Historical</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Domenico Dragonetti</target></link><space/>(17631846)<space/><link><target>Virtuoso</target></link>, composer, conductor</listitem><listitem><link><target>Giovanni Bottesini</target></link><space/>(18211889) Virtuoso, composer, conductor</listitem><listitem><link><target>Franz Simandl</target></link><space/>(18401912) Virtuoso, composer,<space/><link><target>pedagogue</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Edouard Nanny</target></link><space/>(18721943) Virtuoso, composer</listitem><listitem><link><target>Serge Koussevitzky</target></link><space/>(18741951) Virtuoso, composer, conductor</listitem><listitem><link><target>Gary Karr</target></link><space/>(1941-) Virtuoso</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Contemporary (1900s)</heading><heading level='4'>Classical</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Gary karr.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Double bass soloist Gary Karr</part></link>Some of the most influential contemporary classical double bass players are known as much for their contributions to pedagogy as for their performing skills, such as US bassist<space/><link><target>Oscar G.

See also the<space/><link><target>List of double bassists in popular music</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Pedagogy and training</heading><paragraph>The pedagogy and training for the double bass varies widely by genre and country. Classical double bass has a history of pedagogy dating back several centuries, including teaching manuals, studies, and progressive exercises that help students to develop the endurance and accuracy of the left hand, and control for the bowing hand. Classical training methods vary by country: many of the major European countries are associated with specific methods (e.g., the<space/><link><target>Edouard Nanny</target></link><space/>method in France or the<space/><link><target>Franz Simandl</target></link><space/>method in Germany). In classical training, the majority of the instruction for the right hand focuses on the production of bowing tone; little time is spent studying the varieties of pizzicato tone.</paragraph><paragraph>In contrast, in genres that mainly or exclusively use pizzicato (plucking), such as jazz and blues, a great deal of time and effort is focused on learning the varieties of different pizzicato styles used for music of different styles of tempi. For example, in jazz, aspiring bassists have to learn how to perform a wide range of pizzicato tones, including using the sides of the fingers to create a full, deep sound for ballads, using the tips of the fingers for fast walking basslines or solos, and performing a variety of percussive<space/><italics>ghost notes</italics><space/>by raking muted or partially muted strings.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Formal training</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Nobel Peace Price Concert 2009 Esperanza Spalding1.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>Jazz singer/bassist<space/><link><target>Esperanza Spalding</target></link><space/>performing on 10 December 2009 at the<space/><link><target>Nobel Peace Prize</target><part>Nobel Peace Prize Concert</part></link><space/>of 2009</part></link>Of all of the genres, classical and jazz have the most established and comprehensive systems of instruction and training. In the classical milieu, children can begin taking private lessons on the instrument and performing in children's or youth orchestras. Teens who aspire to becoming professional classical bassists can continue their studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges, conservatories, and universities. Colleges offer certificates and diplomas in bass performance.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Music school</target><part>Conservatories</part></link>, which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur orchestral experience for double bass players. Universities offer a range of double bass programs, including bachelor's degrees, Master of Music degrees, and<space/><link><target>Doctor of Musical Arts</target></link><space/>degrees. As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and orchestral, opera, or chamber music training festivals, which give students the opportunity to play a wide range of music.</paragraph><paragraph>Bachelor's degrees in bass performance (referred to as<space/><link><target>B.Mus.</target></link><space/>or B.M) are four-year programs that include individual bass lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Usually, bass performance students perform several recitals of solo double bass music, such as concertos, sonatas, and Baroque suites.</paragraph><paragraph>Master of music degrees (<link><target>M.mus.</target></link>) in double bass performance consist of private lessons, ensemble experience, coaching in playing orchestral double bass parts, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two solo recitals. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an<space/><link><target>M.Mus.</target></link><space/>or M.M.) is often a required credential for people who wish to become a professor of double bass at a university or conservatory.<link><target>File:TimothyBCobb.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>upright</part><part>200px</part><part>Manhattan School of Music professor<space/><link><target>Timothy Cobb</target></link><space/>teaching a bass lesson in the late 2000s.

For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination-recital, are required. Students perform a number of recitals (around six), including a lecture-recital with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework, and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D.M.A program.</paragraph><paragraph>Throughout the early history of jazz, double bass players either learned the instrument informally, or from getting classical training early on, as in the case of Ron Carter and Charles Mingus. In the 1980s and 1990s, colleges and universities began to introduce diplomas and degrees in jazz performance. Students in jazz diploma or Bachelor of Music programs take individual bass lessons, get experience in small jazz combos with coaching from an experienced player, and play in jazz big bands. As with classical training programs, jazz programs also include classroom courses in music history and music theory. In a jazz program, these courses focus on the different eras of jazz history. such as Swing, Bebop, and fusion. The theory courses focus on the musical skills used in jazz improvisation and in jazz comping (accompanying) and the composition of jazz tunes. There are also jazz summer camps and training festivals/seminars, which offer students the chance to learn new skills and styles.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Informal training</heading><paragraph>In other genres, such as blues, rockabilly, and psychobilly, the pedagogical systems and training sequences are not as formalized and institutionalized. There are not degrees in blues bass performance, or conservatories offering multiple-year diplomas in rockabilly bass. However, there are a range of books, playing methods, and, since the 1990s, instructional DVDs (e.g., on how to play rockabilly-style slap bass). As such, performers in these other genres tend to come from a variety of routes, including informal learning by using bass method books or DVDs, taking private lessons and coaching, and learning from records and CDs. In some cases, blues or rockabilly bassists may have obtained some initial training through the classical or jazz pedagogy systems (e.g., youth orchestra or high school big band). In genres such as tango, which use a lot of bowed passages and jazz-style pizzicato lines, the bassists tend to come from classical or jazz training routes.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Careers</heading><paragraph>Careers in double bass vary widely by genre and by region or country. Most bassists earn their living from a mixture of performance and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance jobs is by playing at an<space/><link><target>audition</target></link>. In some styles of music, such as jazz-oriented stage bands, bassists may be asked to<space/><link><target>sight reading</target><part>sight read</part></link><space/>printed music or perform standard pieces (e.g., a<space/><link><target>jazz standard</target></link><space/>such as<space/><italics>Now's the Time</italics>) with an ensemble. Similarly, in a rock or blues band, auditionees may be asked to play various rock or blues standards. An upright bassist auditioning for a blues band might be asked to play in a Swing-style walking<space/><link><target>bassline</target></link>, a rockabilly-style<space/><link><target>Slap bass</target><part>&quot;slapping&quot;</part></link><space/>bassline (in which the strings are percussively struck against the fingerboard) and a 1950s ballad with long held notes.

At a classical bass audition, the performer typically plays a movement from a Bach suite or a movement from a bass concerto and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature. The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts of bass parts and bass solos from the orchestral literature. Orchestral bass auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the<space/><link><target>conductor (music)</target><part>conductor</part></link>, the<space/><link><target>Concertmaster</target></link>, the Principal bass player and possibly other principal players such as the Principal cellist.</paragraph><paragraph>The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates.

Many bass players find extra work by substituting (&quot;subbing&quot;) for bassists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for bass players to find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a bass player can come to this is in the case of classical bass players who win an audition at a professional orchestra or the tiny number of top session pros that are hired by recording studios. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral bassists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.</paragraph><paragraph>Teaching work for double bassist includes giving private lessons in the home or at colleges and universities; coaching bass players who are preparing for recordings or auditions; doing group coaching at music camps or for youth ensembles; and working as a high school music teacher.</paragraph><paragraph>In jazz, blues, rockabilly and other genres, most bassists cannot earn a living from playing in a single group (with the exception of the small number of bassists in top touring bands or groups with recording contracts), so they work in different bands and supplement their income with session playing and teaching. Due to the limited number of full-time orchestral jobs, many classical bassists are similarly not able to find full-time work with a single orchestra. Some bassists increase their employ-ability by learning several different styles, such as classical and jazz or rockabilly and bluegrass.</paragraph><paragraph>In some cases, bassists supplement their performing and teaching income with other related music jobs, such as working as a bass repairer (luthier); as a contractor who hires musicians for orchestras or big bands, composing music (e.g.,<space/><link><target>Dave Holland</target></link>), songwriting, conducting (e.g.,<space/><link><target>David Currie (conductor)</target><part>David Currie</part></link>), acting as a bandleader (e.g.,<space/><link><target>Charles Mingus</target></link>), or coordinating jam sessions (e.g.,<space/><link><target>John Geggie</target></link>). Some regions may not have enough work in music to provide a living, even if a bassist plays several styles and does recordings and teaching. As such, in some regions, bassists may have to supplement musical work with income from another field.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><italics><link><target>Bach: Unaccompanied Cello Suites Performed on Double Bass</target></link></italics></listitem><listitem><link><target>Double bass concerto</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Electric upright bass</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of historical classical double bass players</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Octobass</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Triple contrabass viol</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Piccolo bass</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Tololoche</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>30em</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><paragraph><template><target>Wikisource1911Enc</target><arg>Double bass</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>Wiktionary-inline</target></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>Commons category-inline</target><arg>Double basses</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>dmoz</target><arg>/Arts/Music/Instruments/Stringed/Bowed_Strings/Bass/</arg><arg>Bass</arg></template></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.EarlyBass.com'>EarlyBass.com by Jerry Fuller</link></listitem><listitem>http://www.paulnemeth.com/basschamber.htm</listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Use dmy dates</target><arg name="date">July 2012</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Bass (sound)</target></template><template><target>Violin family</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Authority control</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Category:Bass (sound)</target></link><link><target>Category:Bowed instruments</target></link><link><target>Category:Compositions for double bass</target><part></part></link><link><target>Category:Continuous pitch instruments</target></link><link><target>Category:Contrabass instruments</target></link><link><target>Category:Double basses</target></link><link><target>Category:Double-bassists</target><part></part></link><link><target>Category:String instruments</target></link><link><target>Category:C instruments</target></link></paragraph></article>
