'''Courtney Michelle Love''' (born '''Courtney Michelle Harrison''', July 9, 1964) is an American [[alternative rock]] singer, songwriter, musician, actress, and visual artist. Prolific in the [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s as the frontwoman of [[Hole (band)|Hole]], Love became a fixture in alternative music, drawing public attention for her uninhibited stage presence and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Kurt Cobain]].

The daughter of psychotherapist [[Linda Carroll]] and publisher Hank Harrison, Love mainly grew up in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she was in a series of short-lived bands before landing roles in films by British cult director [[Alex Cox]]. After forming Hole in 1989, Love received substantial attention from underground rock press for the group's debut album, produced by [[Kim Gordon]], while their second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), lent her a more high-profile renown, receiving critical accolades and going multi-[[RIAA certification|platinum]]. In 1995, she returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama|Golden Globe Nomination]] for her performance in [[Miloš Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996). Shortly after, Hole's third release, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), earned Love recognition as a mainstream musician, and was nominated for multiple [[Grammy Award]]s.

Love continued to work as an actress, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), and released her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. In 2010, she released ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' under the Hole [[moniker]] with a reformed band. Love debuted a new solo single in early 2014, and also saw a return to acting after appearing on multiple TV series, including ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''. She was also cast in [[James Franco]]'s ''[[The Long Home]]'' (2016). In 2015, Love toured with [[Lana Del Rey]] as an opening act for Del Rey's [[Endless Summer Tour]].

In addition to music and film, Love has had ventures in modeling and visual art, and has advocated for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence, AIDS research, and [[LGBT rights]]. She has one daughter, [[Frances Bean Cobain]], from her marriage to Kurt Cobain.

After the release of ''Pretty on the Inside'', Love began dating [[Kurt Cobain]] and became pregnant, which temporarily put her music career on hold. During Love's pregnancy, Hole recorded a cover of "Over the Edge" for a [[Wipers]] tribute album,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Ask For It|others=Hole|year=1995|publisher=Caroline Records|id=CAROL 1470-1}}</ref> and recorded their fourth single, "[[Beautiful Son]]", which was released in April 1993.

=== 1994–1997: ''Live Through This'', acting career ===
In October 1993, Hole recorded their second album, titled ''[[Live Through This]]'', in Atlanta, Georgia. The album featured a new lineup, with bassist [[Kristen Pfaff]] and drummer [[Patty Schemel]]. ''Live Through This'' was released on [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]'s subsidiary [[DGC Records|DGC]] label in April 1994, four days after Love's husband, Cobain, was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound in their home. Two months later, in June 1994, bassist Kristen Pfaff died of a heroin overdose,<ref name="vh1" /> and Love recruited [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] for the band's impending tour. Throughout the months preceding the tour, Love was rarely seen in public, spending time at her Seattle home, or visiting the [[Namgyal Monastery Institute of Buddhist Studies|Namgyal Buddhist Monastery]] in New York.<ref name="thepoweroflove" />

''Live Through This'' was a commercial and critical success,<ref>{{cite news|first=Josh|last=Tyrangiel|url=http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/0,27693,Live_Through_This,00.html|title=The All-TIME 100 Albums: ''Live Through This'' by Hole|work=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=November 13, 2006|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/6862/35223/47810|title=Rolling Stone's Greatest Albums of All Time|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name=success /> hitting [[platinum record|platinum sales]] in April 1995 and receiving unanimous critical accolades.<ref name=success>{{cite book|title=Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia|author=Claudia A.

In February 1995, Hole performed a well-reviewed acoustic set on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MdmBYULpTrAC&pg=PT77&dq=hole+mtv+unplugged#v=onepage&q=hole%20mtv%20unplugged&f=false|title=This Is the Sound: The Best of Alternative Rock|first=Randi|last=Reisfeld|pages=71–76|publisher=Simon Pulse|isbn=978-0-689-80670-4|date=May 1, 1996}}</ref> and continued to tour late into the year, concluding their world tour with an appearance at the 1995 ''[[MTV Video Music Awards]]'', in which they performed "[[Violet (Hole song)|Violet]]," and were nominated for Best Music Video for "Doll Parts."

After Hole's world tour concluded in 1996, Love made a return to acting; first in small roles in ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' and ''[[Feeling Minnesota]]'' (1996), before landing the co-starring role of [[Larry Flynt]]'s wife, Althea, in [[Miloš Forman]]'s critically acclaimed 1996 film ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]''. {{quote|"I went for that part so hard," she recalled, "because I felt a need for atonement for some cultural damage that had arisen out of me and things that I had done.

In late 1997, Hole released a compilation album, ''[[My Body, the Hand Grenade]]'' as well as an EP titled ''[[The First Session]]'' which consisted of the band's earliest recordings. In September 1998, Hole released their third studio album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'', which marked something of a transformation for Love, featuring a stark [[power pop]] sound as opposed to the group's earlier punk rock influences. Love divulged her ambition of making an album where "art meets commerce&nbsp;... there are no compromises made, it has commercial appeal, and it sticks to the [our] original vision."<ref name="int" /> She claimed to have been influenced by [[Neil Young]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] when writing the album.<ref name="int">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Interview|others=Hole|year=1998|type=CD|publisher=Geffen|id=PRO-CD-1232}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hole: Celebrity Skin (songbook)|date=March 1, 1999|publisher=Cherry Lane Music|isbn=978-1-57560-137-3}}</ref> ''Celebrity Skin'' was well received by critics; ''Rolling Stone'' called the album "accessible, fiery and intimate—often at the same time&nbsp;... a basic guitar record that's anything but basic."<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Hunter |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/celebrity-skin-19980901|title=James Hunter reviews Celebrity Skin |work=Rolling Stone  |date=September 1, 1998|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}</ref> ''Celebrity Skin'' went on to go multi-platinum, and topped "Best of Year" lists at ''Spin'', the ''Village Voice'', and other periodicals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrityhollywoodnews.com/erlandson-also-declared-that-patty/|title=Erlandson also declared that Patty |publisher=Celebrity Hollywood News|date=October 10, 2008|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}</ref> The album garnered the band their only No.&nbsp;1 hit single on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart with the title track "[[Celebrity Skin (song)|Celebrity Skin]]".

Though a demo was completed, the project never reached fruition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weston |first=Colin |url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/1018 |title=Sort The 'Bastard' Out |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=May 4, 2001|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}</ref>

In 2002, Love began composing an album with [[Linda Perry]], titled ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with [[Virgin Records]] to release it, and initially recorded it in France, but was forced by the label to re-record the entire album in the summer of 2003.<ref name="foxnews">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,120430,00.html|title=Courtney Love: Did Virgin Records Use Her?|work=Fox News|date=May 20, 2004|accessdate=June 26, 2013|author=Roger Friedman}}</ref> ''America's Sweetheart'' was released in February 2004, and was embraced by critics with mixed reviews. ''Spin'' called it a "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's ''Live Through This''" and awarded it eight out of ten stars,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/courtney-love-americas-sweetheart-virgin|title=Courtney Love, America's Sweetheart Review|author=Charles Aaron}}</ref> while ''Rolling Stone'' suggested that, "for people who enjoy watching celebrities fall apart, ''America's Sweetheart'' should be more fun than an [[The Osbournes|Osbournes]] marathon." The album sold 86,000 copies in its first three months, with the singles "[[Mono (Courtney Love song)|Mono]]" and "Hold on to Me", both of which earned competent spots on album charts. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, calling it "a crap record" and reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/hole/49737|work=NME |location=UK|title=Courtney Love blasts UK music scene and slags off 'America's Sweetheart' during Oxford Union speech|date=February 13, 2010|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref> Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on [[TRL]]: "I cannot exist as a solo artist.

A rough acoustic version of "Never Go Hungry Again", recorded during an interview for ''[[The Times]]'' in November, was also released.

=== 2008–2011: Hole reformation ===
On June 17, 2009, ''[[NME]]'' reported that Hole would be reuniting. Former Hole guitarist Erlandson stated in ''Spin'' magazine that contractually no reunion can take place without his involvement; therefore ''Nobody's Daughter'' would remain Love's solo record, as opposed to a "Hole" record. Love responded to Erlandson's comments in a [[Twitter]] post, claiming "he's out of his mind, Hole is my band, my name, and my Trademark".<ref>CourtneyLoveUK (verified account) Twitter posting (June 18, 2009).</ref> ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' was released worldwide as a Hole album on April 27, 2010. For the new line-up, Love recruited guitarist [[Micko Larkin]], Shawn Dailey (bass guitar), and Stu Fisher (drums, percussion). ''Nobody's Daughter'' featured a great deal of material written and recorded for Love's aborted solo album, ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean'', including "Pacific Coast Highway", "Letter to God", "Samantha", and "Never Go Hungry", although they were re-produced with Larkin. The first single from ''Nobody's Daughter'' was "[[Skinny Little Bitch]]", which became a hit on alternative rock radio in early March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courtney-love.org/skinny-little-bitch-most-added-song-on-alternative-radio|title=Skinny Little Bitch, most added song on alternative radio|date=March 15, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2010|work=courtney-love.org}}</ref>

The album received mixed reviews. ''Rolling Stone'' gave the album three out of five stars, saying that Love "worked hard on these songs, instead of just babbling a bunch of druggy bullshit and assuming people would buy it, the way she did on her 2004 flop, ''America's Sweetheart''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/nobodys-daughter-20100426|first=Robert|last=Sheffield|title=Nobody's Daughter by Hole|work=Rolling Stone|date=April 26, 2010|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref> ''Slant Magazine'' also gave the album three out of five stars, saying "It's [[Marianne Faithfull]]'s substance-ravaged voice that comes to mind most often while listening to songs like "Honey" and "For Once in Your Life." The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date. Co-penned by Linda Perry, the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/hole-nobodys-daughter/2083|work=Slant|date=April 21, 2010|accessdate=June 25, 2013|first=Sal|last=Cinquemani|title=Hole: Nobody's Daughter}}</ref> The album's subject matter was largely centered on Love's tumultuous life between 2003 and 2007, and featured a polished folk-rock sound with much more acoustic work than previous Hole albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2010/jun/12/nobodys-daughter/|work=San Diego Reader|title=Nobody's Daughter|first=Michael|last=Caldwell|date=June 12, 2010|accessdate=November 16, 2013|quote=Despite the heaviness in Beinhorn and Hole's respective pasts, most of the tracks here are singer-songwriterly, where acoustics provide the backbone.

In 1993, Love and husband Kurt Cobain performed an acoustic set together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Los Angeles, California, which raised awareness and provided resources for victims of sexual abuse.<ref name="rar" /> Love has also contributed to [[amfAR]]'s [[AIDS]] research benefits and held live musical performances at their events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amfar.org/in-the-spotlight/press-releases/sharon-stone,-kylie-minogue,-dita-von-teese,-courtney-love,-kenneth-cole,-and-kevin-huvane-join-for-amfar-inspiration-gala-in-los-angeles/|work=amfAR|title=Sharon Stone, Kylie Minogue, Dita von Teese, Courtney Love, Kenneth Cole, and Kevin Huvane Join For amfAR Inspiration Gala in Los Angeles|date=October 28, 2010|accessdate=December 21, 2013}}</ref> In 2009, Love performed a benefit concert for the [[Product Red|RED Campaign]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] alongside [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[Scarlett Johansson]], with proceeds going to AIDS research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267389/u2-scarlett-johannson-courtney-love-set-for-aids-charity-concert|work=Billboard|date=September 15, 2009|accessdate=December 21, 2013|title=U2, Scarlett Johansson, Courtney Love Set For AIDS Charity Concert|author=Michael D.

Love has also participated with LGBT youth charities, specifically with the [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]], where she has taken part in performances at the center's "An Evening with Women" events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/26/courtney-love-gay-fans_n_3817210.html|work=Huffington Post|title=Courtney Love Discusses Gay Fans In 'Vanity Fair' Article|first=Christopher|last=Rudolph|date=August 26, 2013|accessdate=December 21, 2013}}</ref> The proceeds of the event help provide food and shelter for homeless youth; services for seniors; legal assistance; domestic violence services; health and mental health services, and cultural arts programs. Love participated with [[Linda Perry]] for the event again in 2012, relating her experiences as a nomadic teenager and having to live on the street: <blockquote>This really resonates with me, [because] I was a kid from Oregon, and I came to Hollywood like a lot of people do, and you know, what happens is that we end up on the street&nbsp;... and if you're gay, or lesbian, or [[transgendered]]— the more "outside" you are, the more screwed you are in a lot of ways&nbsp;... Seven thousand kids in Los Angeles a year go out on the street, and forty percent of those kids are gay, lesbian, or transgendered. They [[Coming out of the closet|come out]] to their parents, and become homeless. [The charity helps them] get sent to the right foster care, they can get medical help, food, clothing&nbsp;... and for whatever reason, I don't really know why, but gay men have a lot of foundations, I've played many of them— but the lesbian side of it doesn't have as much money and/or donors, so we're excited that this has grown to cover women and women's affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/courtney-love-linda-perry-team-up-for-gay-rights-20120514|work=Rolling Stone|first=Steve|last=Balkin|title=Courtney Love, Linda Perry Team Up for Gay Rights|date=May 14, 2012|accessdate=December 21, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

== Cultural impact ==
Love had a significant impact on female-fronted alternative acts and performers, particularly the [[Riot grrrl]] movement, with Hole's first album, [[Pretty on the Inside]].<ref name="girlsrock">{{cite book|title=Girls rock!: fifty years of women making music|author=Carson, Mina Julia; Lewis, Tisa; Shaw, Susan Maxine|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|pages=89–90|isbn=978-0-8131-2310-3}}</ref> She has been cited as particularly influential to young female instrumentalists,<ref name="girlsrock" /> once infamously proclaiming: "I want every girl in the world to pick up a guitar and start screaming".<ref name="millard">{{cite book|title=The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon|editor=Millard, André|date=June 15, 2004|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zUlt7Q71_ssC&pg=PA195&dq=courtney+love+girl+guitar#v=onepage&q=courtney%20love%20girl%20guitar&f=false|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-7862-6}}</ref> "I strap on that motherfucking guitar and you cannot fuck with me. That's my feeling," she said.<ref name="millard" /> In ''The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon'', it is noted that, "[Love] truly lived up to Paul Westerberg's ([[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]]) assessment of pretty girls 'playing makeup/wearing guitar' [...] She frequently stood on stage, microphone in hand and foot on monitor, and simply let her Fender guitar dangle around her neck. She truly embodied the empowerment that came with playing the electric guitar [...] Love depended heavily upon her male lead guitar foil Eric Erlandson, but the rest of her band remained exclusively female throughout several lineup changes."<ref name="millard" /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' deemed Hole's [[Live Through This]] to be supplemented by "primal guitar riffs and high-IQ lyrics."<ref>Farley, Christopher John; Lisa McLaughlin.
