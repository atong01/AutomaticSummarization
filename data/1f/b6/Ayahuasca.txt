'''Ayahuasca''' (usually pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|j|ə|ˈ|w|æ|s|k|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|j|ə|ˈ|w|aː|s|k|ə}}), also  commonly called '''yagé''' ({{IPAc-en|j|aː|ˈ|h|eɪ}}), is an [[entheogen|entheogenic]] brew made out of ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'' vine, often in combination with various other plants. The brew is used as a [[Traditional medicine|traditional spiritual medicine]] in ceremonies among the [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|Indigenous peoples]] of [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonian]] [[Peru]], many of whom say that they received the instructions in its use directly from the plants and plant spirits themselves.  

Ayahuasca was first described outside of Indigenous communities in the early 1950s by [[Harvard]] ethnobotanist [[Richard Evans Schultes]], who became aware of the Native communities who use it for divinatory and healing purposes. It has been reported that some effects can be felt from consuming the caapi vine alone, but that DMT-containing plants (such as ''Psychotria'') remain inactive when drunk as a brew without a source of [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI) such as ''B. caapi''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Riba|title=Human Pharmacology of Ayahuasca: Subjective and Cardiovascular Effects, Monoamine Metabolite Excretion, and Pharmacokinetics|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Theraputics|date=Jul 2003|volume=306|issue=1|pages=73-85|doi=10.1124/jpet.103.049882|url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/306/1/73.full|accessdate=12 August 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  It can be mixed with the leaves of Chacruna or Chagropanga, [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT)-containing plant species, and is known by a number of different names (see [[#Nomenclature|below]]).<ref name="discovery">{{cite web |url=http://www.ayahuasca.com/ayahuasca-overviews/on-the-origins-of-ayahuasca/ |title=Overviews Shamanism – On The Origin of Ayahuasca |publisher=Ayahuasca.com |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}</ref>

== Nomenclature ==
[[File:Ayahuasca prep.JPG|thumb|right|Ayahuasca]]
Ayahuasca is known by many names throughout [[Northern South America]] and [[Brazil]].

''Ayahuasca'' is the [[hispanicized]] style spelling of a word in the [[Quechua languages]], which are spoken in the [[Andean states]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and [[Colombia]]. Speakers of Quechua languages or of the [[Aymara language]] may prefer the spelling ''ayawaska''. This word refers both to the liana ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'', and to the brew prepared from it. In the Quechua languages, ''aya'' means "spirit, soul", "corpse, dead body", and ''waska'' means "rope" and "woody vine", "liana".<ref>Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)</ref> The word ''ayahuasca'' has been variously translated as "liana of the soul", "liana of the dead", and "spirit liana".<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/revue-psychotropes-2002-1-page-79.htm  Ayahuasca : une synthèse interdisciplinaire]. {{lang|fr|Por Frédérick Bois-Mariage}}. ''Psychotropes'' 1/2002 (Vol. 8), p. 79-113. DOI : 10.3917/psyt.081.0079.</ref>

In Brazil, the brew and the liana are informally called either '''''caapi''''' or '''''cipó'''''; the latter is the Portuguese word for [[liana]] (or woody climbing vine). In the [[União do Vegetal]] of Brazil, an organised spiritual tradition in which people drink ayahuasca, the brew is prepared exclusively from ''B. caapi'' and ''P. viridis''. Adherents of União do Vegetal call this brew '''''hoasca''''' or '''''vegetal'''''.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In the [[Tucanoan languages]] it is called  '''''yagé''''' or '''''yajé''''' (both pronounced {{IPA-xx|jaˈhe|}}).<ref>This term was popularized in English in the 1960s by the [[beat generation]] writers [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] in ''[[The Yage Letters]]''.

== Chemistry ==
[[Harmala alkaloid]]s are MAO-inhibiting [[beta-Carboline|''beta''-carboline]]s. The three most studied harmala alkaloids in the ''B. caapi'' vine are [[harmine]], [[harmaline]] and [[tetrahydroharmine]]. Harmine and harmaline are [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Selectivity|selective]] and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Reversibility|reversible]] inhibitors of [[monoamine oxidase A]] (MAO-A), while tetrahydroharmine is a weak [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SRI).<ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/>

This inhibition of MAO-A allows [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes in the stomach and small intestine, and eventually cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without [[Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A|RIMA]]s or the MAOI of MAO-A, DMT would be oxidised (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.<ref name="RIBA, J 2003">RIBA, J.

== Preparation ==
Sections of ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' vine are [[liquid-liquid extraction|macerated]] and boiled alone or with leaves from any of a number of other plants, including ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' (''chacruna'') or ''[[Diplopterys cabrerana]]'' (also known as ''chaliponga'' and ''chacropanga'').  The resulting brew may contain the powerful [[psychedelic drug]] [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibiting]] [[harmala alkaloid]]s, which are necessary to make the DMT orally active.

Brews can also be made with no DMT-containing plants; ''Psychotria viridis'' being substituted by plants such as ''Justicia pectoralis'', ''[[Brugmansia]]'', or sacred tobacco, also known as ''Mapacho'' ([[Nicotiana rustica]]), or sometimes left out with no replacement. The potency of this brew varies radically from one batch to the next, both in potency and psychoactive effect, based mainly on the skill of the shaman or brewer, as well as other admixtures sometimes added and the intent of the ceremony.  Natural variations in plant alkaloid content and profiles also affect the final concentration of alkaloids in the brew, and the physical act of cooking may also serve to modify the alkaloid profile of [[harmala]] alkaloids.<ref name="Callaway2005b">{{cite journal |last=Callaway |first=J.

== Traditional brew ==
[[File:aya-preparation.jpg|thumb|Ayahuasca being prepared in the [[Napo Province|Napo]] region of [[Ecuador]]]]
Traditional ayahuasca brews are often made with ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' as an [[MAOI]], although [[Dimethyltryptamine]] sources and other admixtures vary from region to region.  There are several [[Banisteriopsis caapi#Types of vine|varieties of caapi]], often known as different "colors", with varying effects, potencies, and uses.

DMT admixtures:
* ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' (Chacruna)<ref name="RatschIngredients">[[#Ratsch2005|Ratsch 2005]], pp. 704–708</ref> – leaves
* ''[[Diplopterys cabrerana]]'' (Chaliponga, Chagropanga, ''Banisteriopsis rusbyana'')<ref name="RatschIngredients" /> – leaves
* ''[[Psychotria carthagenensis]]'' (Amyruca)<ref name="RatschIngredients" /> – leaves

Other common admixtures:
* ''[[Justicia pectoralis]]''
* ''[[Brugmansia]]'' (Toé)<ref name="RatschIngredients" />
* ''[[Nicotiana rustica]]''<ref name="RatschIngredients" /> (Mapacho, variety of tobacco)
* ''[[Ilex guayusa]]'',<ref name="RatschIngredients" /> a relative of [[yerba mate]]

Common admixtures with their associated ceremonial values and spirits:

*'''[[Ayahuma]]<ref name="RatschIngredients" /> bark''': Dead Head Tree. Provides protection and is used in healing susto (soul loss from spiritual fright or trauma). Head spirit is a headless giant.
*'''Capirona<ref name="RatschIngredients" /> bark''': Provides cleansing and protection. It is noted for its smooth bark, white flowers, and hard wood. Head spirits look Caucasian.
*'''Chullachaki Caspi<ref name="RatschIngredients" /> bark''' (''[[Brysonima christianeae]]''): Provides cleansing to the physical body. Used to transcend physical body ailments. Head spirits look Caucasian.
*'''Lopuna Blanca bark''': Provides protection. Head spirits take the form of giants.
*'''Punga Amarilla bark''': Yellow Punga. Provides protection. Used to pull or draw out negative spirits or energies. Head spirit is the yellow anaconda.
*'''Remo Caspi<ref name="RatschIngredients" /> bark''': Oar Tree. Used to move dense or dark energies. Head spirit is a native warrior.
*'''Wyra (huaira) Caspi<ref name="RatschIngredients" /> bark''' (''[[Cedrelinga catanaeformis]]''): Air Tree. Used to create purging, transcend gastro/intestinal ailments, calm the mind, and bring tranquility. Head spirit looks African.
*'''Shiwawaku bark''': Brings purple medicine to the ceremony. Provides healing and protection.
*'''[[Camu camu]] Gigante''': Head spirit comes in the form of a large dark skinned giant. He provides medicine and protection in the form of warding off dark and demonic spirits.
*'''Tamamuri''': Head spirit looks like an old Asian warrior with a long white wispy beard. He carries a staff and manages thousands of spirits to protect the ceremony and send away energies that are purged from the participants.
*'''Uchu Sanango''': Head of the sanango plants. Provides power, strength, and protection. Head doctor spirit is a grandfather with a long, gray-white beard.
*'''Huacapurana''': Giant tree of the Amazon with very hard bark. Its head spirits come in the form of Amazonian giants and provide a strong grounding presence in the ceremony.

== Usage ==
[[File:Ayahuasca preparation.JPG|thumb|right|Ayahuasca]]

Ayahuasca is used largely as a religious [[sacrament]].  Users of ayahuasca in non-traditional contexts often align themselves with the philosophies and cosmologies associated with ayahuasca [[shamanism]], as practiced among [[indigenous people]]s like the [[Urarina]] of [[Peru]]vian [[Amazonia]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dean |first1= Bartholomew |year=2009 |title=Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |location=Gainesville |publisher=University Press of Florida |isbn=978-0-8130-3378-5 |url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 }}</ref>  While non-native users know of the spiritual applications of ayahuasca, a less well-known traditional usage focuses on the medicinal properties of ayahuasca. When used for its medicinal purposes, ayahuasca affects the human consciousness for fewer than six hours, beginning half an hour after consumption and peaking after two hours. Ayahuasca also has cardiovascular effects, moderately increasing both heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. In some cases, individuals experience significant psychological stress during the experience.  It is for this reason that extreme caution should be taken with those who may be at risk of heart disease.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tafur |first=Joseph |title=Ayahuasca |url=http://www.nihuerao.com/eng/ayawaska.htm}}</ref>

The psychedelic effects of ayahuasca include visual and auditory stimulation, the mixing of sensory modalities, and psychological introspection that may lead to great elation, fear, or illumination. Its purgative properties are important (known as ''la purga'' or "the purge"). The intense [[vomiting]] and occasional [[diarrhea]] it induces can clear the body of worms and other tropical [[parasite]]s,<ref name="Andritzky1989">{{cite journal |last=Andritzky |first=Walter |title=Sociopsychotherapeutic Functions of Ayahuasca Healing in Amazonia |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |location=San Francisco |publisher=Haight-Ashbury Pub. in assoc. w.

Dietary taboos are often associated with the use of ayahuasca.<ref name="Jonathan Ott, 1994">{{cite book |last1=Ott |first1= J. |title=Ayahuasca Analogues: Pangaean Entheogens |location=Kennewick, WA |publisher=Natural Books |year=1994  |isbn=978-0-9614234-4-5}}</ref> In the rainforest, these tend towards the purification of one's self – abstaining from spicy and heavily-seasoned foods, excess fat, salt, caffeine, acidic foods (such as citrus) and sex before, after, or during a ceremony. A diet low in [[Tyramine#Occurrence|foods containing tyramine]] has been recommended, as the speculative interaction of [[tyramine]] and MAOIs could lead to a [[hypertensive crisis]]. However, evidence indicates that [[harmala alkaloids]] act only on [[Monoamine oxidase A|MAO-A]], in a reversible way similar to [[moclobemide]] (an antidepressant that does not require dietary restrictions). Dietary restrictions are not used by the highly urban Brazilian ayahuasca church [[União do Vegetal]], suggesting the risk is much lower than perceived, and probably non-existent.<ref name="Jonathan Ott, 1994"/>

=== Non-traditional usage ===
In the late 20th century, the practice of ayahuasca drinking began spreading to [[Europe]], [[North America]] and elsewhere.<ref name=Tupper>{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=The Globalization of Ayahuasca: Harm Reduction or Benefit Maximization?|journal=International Journal of Drug Policy|volume=19|issue=4|pages=297–303|date=August 2008|doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2006.11.001|accessdate=2013-12-12}}</ref> The first ayahuasca Churches, affiliated with the [[Brazil]]ian [[Santo Daime]], were established in the [[Netherlands]]. A legal case was filed against two of the Church's leaders, [[Hans Bogers]] (one of the original founders of the Dutch Santo Daime community) and [[Geraldine Fijneman]] (the head of the [[Amsterdam]] Santo Daime community). Bogers and Fijneman were charged with distributing a [[controlled substance]] (DMT); however, the prosecution was unable to prove that the use of ayahuasca by members of the Santo Daime constituted a sufficient threat to public health and order that it warranted denying their rights to [[religious freedom]] under [[ECHR#Article 9 - conscience and religion|ECHR Article 9]]. The 2001 verdict of the Amsterdam district court is an important precedent. Since then groups that are not affiliated to the Santo Daime have used ayahuasca, and a number of different 'styles' have been developed, including non-religious approaches.

In modern Europe and North America, ayahuasca analogues are often prepared using non-traditional plants which contain the same alkaloids. For example, seeds of the [[Syrian rue]] plant can be used as a substitute for the ayahuasca vine, and the DMT-rich ''[[Mimosa hostilis]]'' is used in place of ''chakruna''. Australia has several indigenous plants which are popular among modern ayahuasqueros there, such as various DMT-rich species of ''[[Acacia]]''.

The name 'ayahuasca' specifically refers to a botanical decoction that contains ''Banisteriopsis caapi''. A synthetic version, known as [[pharmahuasca]], is a combination of an appropriate MAOI and typically DMT. In this usage, the [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] is generally considered the main psychoactive active ingredient, while the MAOI merely preserves the psychoactivity of orally ingested DMT, which would otherwise be destroyed in the gut before it could be absorbed in the body. Thus, ayahuasqueros and most others working with the brew maintain that the ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi|B. caapi]]'' vine is the defining ingredient, and that this beverage is not ayahuasca unless ''B. caapi'' is in the brew. The vine is considered to be the "spirit" of ayahuasca, the gatekeeper and guide to the otherworldly realms.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Ayahuasca may be prepared using several plants not traditionally used in South America:

DMT admixtures:
* ''[[Acacia maidenii]]'' (Maiden's Wattle) *not all plants are 'active strains'; meaning some plants will have very little DMT and others larger amounts, ''[[Acacia phlebophylla]]'', and other [[Acacia]]s, most commonly employed in [[Australia]] – bark
* ''[[Acacia obtusifolia]]'' Has a similar range to Acacia Maidenii – bark
* ''[[Anadenanthera peregrina]]'', ''A. colubrina, A. excelsa, A. macrocarpa''
* ''[[Mimosa hostilis]]'' (Jurema) – root bark – not traditionally employed with ayahuasca by any existing cultures, though likely it was in the past. Popular in Europe and North America.

MAOI:
* [[Harmal]] (''Peganum harmala'', Syrian rue) – seeds
* [[Passion flower]]
* [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#List of MAOIs|synthetic MAOIs]]

== History ==
In the 16th century, Christian missionaries from Spain and Portugal first encountered indigenous South Americans using ayahuasca; their earliest reports described it as the work of the devil.<ref>Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975, p. 48 as cited in Soibelman 1995, p. 14.</ref>  In the 20th century, the active chemical constituent of ''B. caapi'' was named ''[[telepathine]]'', but it was found to be identical to a chemical already isolated from ''Peganum harmala'' and was given the name [[harmaline]].  Beat writer William Burroughs read a paper by [[Richard Evans Schultes]] on the subject and while traveling through South America in the early 1950s sought out ''yagé'' in the hopes that it could relieve or cure [[opiate]] [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] (see ''[[The Yage Letters]]''). Ayahuasca became more widely known when the McKenna brothers published their experience in the Amazon in ''True Hallucinations''.  [[Dennis McKenna]] later studied the pharmacology, [[botany]], and [[chemistry]] of ayahuasca and [[oo-koo-he]], which became the subject of his master's thesis.

In [[Brazil]], a number of modern religious movements based on the use of ayahuasca have emerged, the most famous of them being [[Santo Daime]] and the [[União do Vegetal]] (or UDV), usually in an [[Spiritism|animistic]] context that may be shamanistic or, more often (as with Santo Daime and the UDV), integrated with [[Christianity]]. Both Santo Daime and [[União do Vegetal]] now have members and churches throughout the world.  Similarly, the US and Europe have started to see new religious groups develop in relation to increased ayahuasca use.<ref>{{cite book |author=Labate, B.C.; Rose, I.S. & Santos, R.G. |title=Ayahuasca Religions: a comprehensive bibliography and critical essays |location=Santa Cruz |publisher=Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies – MAPS |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9798622-1-2}}</ref>  Some Westerners have teamed up with shamans in the Amazon rainforest regions, forming ayahuasca healing retreats that claim to be able to cure mental and physical illness and allow communication with the spirit world.

In recent years, the tea has been popularized by [[Wade Davis]] (''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|The Serpent and The Rainbow]]''), English novelist [[Martin J.

In 2008, [[psychology]] [[professor]] [[Benny Shanon]] published a controversial hypothesis that a brew [[analogous]] to Ayahuasca was heavily connected to early [[Judaism]], and that the effects of this brew were responsible for some of the most significant events of [[Moses]]' life, including his vision of the [[burning bush]].<ref name="Shanon2008">{{cite journal |last1=Shanon |first1=Benny |authorlink1=Benny Shanon |date=March 2008 |title=Biblical Entheogens: a Speculative Hypothesis |journal=Time and Mind |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=51–74 |publisher=Berg |issn=1751-6978 |doi=10.2752/175169608783489116|url=http://catbull.com/alamut/Bibliothek/7616docid6743.pdf |ref=Shanon2008 |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>

in 2013 writer [[Graham Hancock]] gave a [[TEDx]] lecture titled “The War on Consciousness”, in which he attempted to outline the case for the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]], particularly the [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] found in ayahuasca. While making clear that their toxicity often produced a physical ordeal, and that he did not approve of their use for casual recreation, he said that they may be essential for [[self-improvement]], [[spirituality|spiritual growth]] and [[social progress]], as well as for curing [[drug addiction|addictions to more harmful drugs]]. He revealed that until relatively recently he had maintained a 24-year-long daily [[cannabis]] habit during which he was “stoned for 16 hours a day”, and had suffered from rages and [[paranoia]] as a result. Hancock said he had been successfully cured by a drug-trip on ayahuasca in [[South America]], during which he experienced an arduous [[Near-death experience|life-review]] by the [[Amerind peoples|Amerind]] spirit “Mother Ayahuasca”.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0c5nIvJH7w Graham Hancock The War on Consciousness – TEDx (2013)]</ref> The lecture was removed by TED organisers, a decision which drew criticism.<ref>[http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/14/open-for-discussion-graham-hancock-and-rupert-sheldrake News TEDx - Open for discussion: Graham Hancock and Rupert Sheldrake from TEDx Whitechapel Posted by: TED Staff March 14, 2013 at 11:59 am EST - TED response to criticism of withdrawal of Hancock lecture]</ref>

== Research ==
[[Charles Grob]] directed the first major study of the effects of ayahuasca on humans with the Hoasca Project in 1993.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.maps.org/ayahuasca/hoasca.html |title=The Hoasca Project |work=maps.org}}</ref> The project studied members of the [[União do Vegetal]] (UDV) church in Brazil who use hoasca as a sacrament.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Da Silveria|first1=D. X.|title=Ayahuasca in adolecence: a preliminary psychiatric assessment|journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs|volume=37|issue=2|pages=129–133|doi=10.1080/02791072.2005.10399792 }}</ref> As part of the Hoasca Project, Da Silveria et al. (2005) conducted a comparative study of adolescents subscribing to an indigenous Amazonian belief system that sacramentally used ayahuasca and their urban Brazilian counterparts. Da Silveria et al. measured psychiatric diagnoses scores to chosen participants who used ayahuasca in a culturally specific manner twice per month and started doing so just at the onset of adolescence. Next, all the participants were scored for substance abuse disorders, anxiety, and depression, body image disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder using preestablished questionnaires and the DSM-IV. As compared to the control group, ayahuasca-using adolescents scored as much as seven times less in criteria where differences were statistically significant. Those criteria were body image perception, anxiety, and attention disorders, which often trouble Western youth. This data suggests that culturally specific use of ayahuasca could circumvent some of the psychological and cognitive issues adolescents are prone to facing and enhance their ability to self-actuate to the fullest potential.

However, as with research on other [[entheogen]]s or psychedelics, scientific studies of ayahuasca present some significant challenges to investigators, including philosophical questions relating to [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tupper|first1=Kenneth W.|last2=Labate|first2=Beatriz C.|title=Ayahuasca, Psychedelic Studies and Health Sciences: The Politics of Knowledge and Inquiry into an Amazonian Plant Brew|journal=Current Drug Abuse Reviews|volume=7|issue=2|pages=71–80|year=2014|accessdate=2015-01-31|url=http://eurekaselect.com/127467|doi=10.2174/1874473708666150107155042}}</ref>

== Legal status ==
Internationally, DMT is a Schedule I drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes, however, that the plants containing it are not subject to international control:<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.maps.org/pipermail/maps_forum/2001-March/003376.html |title=DMT – UN report |publisher=MAPS |date=1971-02-21 |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>
<blockquote>
The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention. . . . Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the Peyote cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principals, [[mescaline]], [[DMT]] and [[psilocin]].
</blockquote>

A [[fax]] from the Secretary of the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) to the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health sent in 2001 goes on to state that "Consequently, preparations (e.g. decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca, are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention."<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law10.shtml |title=Ayahuasca Vault : Law : UNDCP's Ayahuasca Fax |publisher=Erowid.org |date=2001-01-17 |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>

Despite the INCB's 2001 affirmation that ayahuasca is not subject to drug control by international convention, in its 2010 Annual Report the Board recommended that governments consider controlling (i.e. criminalizing) ayahuasca at the national level. This recommendation by the INCB has been criticized as an attempt by the Board to overstep its legitimate mandate and as establishing a reason for governments to violate the human rights (i.e., religious freedom) of ceremonial ayahuasca drinkers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tupper|first1=Kenneth W.|last2=Labate|first2=Beatriz C.|title=Plants, Psychoactive Substances and the International Narcotics Control Board: The Control of Nature and the Nature of Control|journal=Human Rights & Drugs|volume=2|issue=1|pages=17–28|year=2012|accessdate=2012-12-12
|url=http://www.hr-dp.org/files/2013/12/12/HRDP_Journal_Tupper_Labate.pdf}}</ref>

The legal status in the United States of DMT-containing plants is somewhat questionable. Ayahuasca plants and preparations are legal, as they contain no scheduled chemicals. However, brews<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.rockmaceguitars.com/ayahuasca-retreats-shamans-dmt/ |title=Ayahuasca Brew Confiscated in New York City |accessdate=2014-08-31}}</ref> made using DMT containing plants are illegal since DMT is a Schedule I drug.  That said, some people are challenging this, using arguments similar to those used by peyotist religious sects, such as the [[Native American Church]]. A court case allowing the [[União do Vegetal]] to import and use the tea for religious purposes in the United States, ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', was heard by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] on November 1, 2005; the decision, released February 21, 2006, allows the UDV to use the tea in its ceremonies pursuant to the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]]. In a similar case an Ashland, Oregon-based Santo Daime church sued for their right to import and consume ayahuasca tea.  In March 2009, U.S. District Court Judge Panner ruled in favor of the Santo Daime, acknowledging its protection from prosecution under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.<ref>{{citation |url=http://csp.org/society/docs/SantoDaimeAshland20090318.pdf |title=Ruling by District Court Judge Panner in Santo Daime case in Oregon |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>

Religious use in Brazil was legalized after two official inquiries into the tea in the mid-1980s, which concluded that ayahuasca is not a recreational drug and has valid spiritual uses.<ref>More on the legal status of ayahuasca can be found in the [[Erowid]] vault on the [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law.shtml legality of ayahuasca].</ref>

In France, [[Santo Daime]] won a court case allowing them to use the tea in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled.<ref>''Cour d'appel de Paris, 10ème chambre, section B,  dossier n° 04/01888.  Arrêt du 13 janvier 2005'' [Court of Appeal of Paris, 10th Chamber, Section B, File No. 04/01888. Judgement of 13 January 2005]. https://web.archive.org/web/20060510000632/http://www.santodaime.it/Library/LAW/Francia/courdapeldeparis05_france.pdf</ref>  Four months after the court victory, the common ingredients of ayahuasca as well as harmala were declared ''stupéfiants'', or narcotic schedule I substances, making the tea and its ingredients illegal to use or possess.<ref>''JO'', 2005-05-03. [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&dateJO=20050503&numTexte=18&pageDebut=07636&pageFin=07636 ''Arrêté du 20 avril 2005 modifiant l'arrêté du 22 février 1990 fixant la liste des substances classées comme stupéfiants'' (PDF)] [Decree of 20 April 2005 amending the decree of 22 February 1990 establishing the list of substances scheduled as narcotics].</ref>
<!-- NPR reported in August 2010 that it was legal, is that wrong?
In Peru, the government is undergoing the legislation process of legalizing and regulating ayahuasca usage and monitoring ayahuasca centers. Currently (April 2010) the use of ayahuasca is not technically legal but since it is an accepted practice of its indigenous cultures the Peruvian government is going through of the process maintaining the continuity of its culture whilst avoiding international issues.

== Legal issues ==

Ayahuasca has also stirred debate regarding intellectual property protection of traditional knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Ayahuasca Healing Beyond the Amazon: The Globalization of a Traditional Indigenous Entheogenic Practice|journal=Global Networks: A Journal of Transnational Affairs|volume=9|issue=1|pages=117–136|date=January 2009|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0374.2009.00245.x|accessdate=2013-12-12}}</ref> In 1986 the US Patent and Trademarks Office allowed the granting of a patent on the ayahuasca vine B. Caapi. It allowed this patent based on the assumption that ayahuasca's properties had not been previously described in writing. Several public interest groups, including the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) and the Coalition for Amazonian Peoples and Their Environment (Amazon Coalition) objected. In 1999 they brought a legal challenge to this patent which had granted a private US citizen "ownership" of the knowledge of a plant that is well-known and sacred to many indigenous peoples of the Amazon, and used by them in religious and healing ceremonies.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ciel.org/Bio/Biodiversity_Accomplishments.html |title=CIEL Biodiversity Program Accomplishments |publisher=Ciel.org |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>

Later that year the PTO issued a decision rejecting the patent, on the basis that the petitioners' arguments that the plant was not "distinctive or novel" were valid. However, the decision did not acknowledge the argument that the plant's religious or cultural values prohibited a patent. In 2001, after an appeal by the patent holder, the US Patent Office reinstated the patent. The law at the time did not allow a third party such as COICA to participate in that part of the reexamination process. The patent, held by US entrepreneur Loren Miller, expired in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Ayahuasca Patent Case |url=http://www.ciel.org/Bio/ayahuascapatentcase.html |work=Our Programs: Biodiversity |publisher=The Centre for International Environmental Law |accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref>
