'''Base pairs''' (unit: '''bp'''), which form between specific [[nucleobase]]s (also termed [[nitrogenous base]]s), are the building blocks of the [[DNA]] double helix and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and [[RNA]]. Dictated by specific [[hydrogen bonding]] patterns, Watson-Crick base pairs ([[guanine]]-[[cytosine]] and [[adenine]]-[[thymine]]) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its [[nucleotide sequence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/0-387-29148-2_2 |title=Sequence-Dependent Variability of B-DNA |publisher=Springer}}</ref> The [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] nature of this based-paired structure provides a backup copy of all [[genetic information]] encoded within double-stranded DNA. The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information, while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which [[DNA polymerase]] replicates DNA, and [[RNA polymerase]] transcribes DNA into RNA. Many DNA-binding proteins can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes.

Intramolecular base pairs can occur within single-stranded nucleic acids. This is particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g., [[transfer RNA]]), where Watson-Crick base pairs (G-C and A-U) permit the formation of short double-stranded helices, and a wide variety of non-Watson-Crick interactions (e.g., G-U or A-A) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional [[RNA structure|structures]]. In addition, base-pairing between transfer RNA (tRNA) and [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) forms the basis for the [[molecular recognition]] events that result in the nucleotide sequence of mRNA becoming [[Genetic code|translated]] into the amino acid sequence of [[protein]]s.

The size of an individual [[gene]] or an organism's entire [[genome]] is often measured in base pairs because DNA is usually double-stranded. Hence, the number of total base pairs is equal to the number of nucleotides in one of the strands (with the exception of non-coding single-stranded regions of [[telomere]]s). The [[haploid]] [[human genome]] (23 [[chromosomes]]) is estimated to be about 3.2 billion bases long and to contain 20,000–25,000 distinct protein-coding genes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moran |first=Laurence A. |url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-big-is-human-genome.html |title=The total size of the human genome is very likely to be ~3,200 Mb |publisher=Sandwalk.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-24 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicgenomics.com/Genome/index.htm |title=The finished length of the human genome is 2.86 Gb |publisher=Strategicgenomics.com |date=2006-06-12 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref><ref name="IHSGC2004">{{cite journal | author = International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011 | pages = 931–45 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15496913 | doi = 10.1038/nature03001 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7011/full/nature03001.html}}</ref> A [[kilobase]] (kb) is a unit of measurement in [[molecular biology]] equal to 1000 base pairs of DNA or RNA.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Organization of the ribosomal RNA genes of dictyostelium discoideum: Mapping of the nontrascribed spacer regions | last1 = Cockburn | first1 = Andrew F. | last2 = Jane Newkirk | first2 = Mary | last3 = Firtel | first3 = Richard A. | date = 1976 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WSN-4C8GBDB-4Y/2/0c09db014fb73f4a8e0f3b5af596da01 | journal = Cell | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 605–613 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(76)90043-X }}</ref> The total amount of related [[DNA]] base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10<sup>37</sup>, and weighs 50 billion [[tonne]]s.<ref name="NYT-20150718-rn">{{cite news |last=Nuwer |first=Rachel |date=18 July 2015 |title=Counting All the DNA on Earth |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2015-07-18}}</ref><!--- PLOS paper cited by NYT used 'tonne' unit. ---> In comparison, the total [[Biomass (ecology)|mass]] of the [[biosphere]] has been estimated to be as much as 4 [[tonnes#Derived units|TtC]] (trillion tons of [[carbon]]).<ref name="AGCI-2015">{{cite web |url=http://www.agci.org/classroom/biosphere/index.php |title=The Biosphere: Diversity of Life |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |work=Aspen Global Change Institute |location=Basalt, CO |accessdate=2015-07-19}}</ref><!--- Aspen Global Change Institute (US-based) defined TtC as 'trillion tons of C'. --->

[[Hydrogen bond]]ing is the chemical interaction that underlies the base-pairing rules described above. Appropriate geometrical correspondence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors allows only the "right" pairs to form stably. DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content, but, contrary to popular belief, the hydrogen bonds do not stabilize the DNA significantly, and stabilization is mainly due to stacking interactions.<ref name="Yakovchuk2006">Peter Yakovchuk, Ekaterina Protozanova and Maxim D. Frank-Kamenetskii. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkj454 Base-stacking and base-pairing contributions into thermal stability of the DNA double helix]. Nucleic Acids Research 2006 34(2):564-574.</ref>

The larger [[nucleobase]]s, adenine and guanine, are members of a class of double-ringed chemical structures called [[purine]]s; the smaller nucleobases, cytosine and thymine (and uracil), are members of a class of single-ringed chemical structures called [[pyrimidine]]s. Purines are complementary only with pyrimidines: pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too far apart for hydrogen bonding to be established; purine-purine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too close, leading to overlap repulsion. Purine-pyrimidine base pairing of AT or GC or UA (in RNA) results in proper duplex structure. The only other purine-pyrimidine pairings would be AC and GT and UG (in RNA); these pairings are mismatches because the patterns of hydrogen donors and acceptors do not correspond. The GU pairing, with two hydrogen bonds, does occur fairly often in [[RNA]] (see [[wobble base pair]]).

Paired DNA and RNA molecules are comparatively stable at room temperature but the two nucleotide strands will separate above a [[Dna melting|melting point]] that is determined by the length of the molecules, the extent of mispairing (if any), and the GC content. Higher GC content results in higher melting temperatures; it is, therefore, unsurprising that the genomes of [[extremophile]] organisms such as ''[[Thermus thermophilus]]'' are particularly GC-rich. On the converse, regions of a genome that need to separate frequently — for example, the promoter regions for often-[[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] genes — are comparatively GC-poor (for example, see [[TATA box]]). GC content and melting temperature must also be taken into account when designing  [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] for [[PCR]] reactions.

===Examples===
The following DNA sequences illustrate pair double-stranded patterns. By convention, the top strand is written from the [[5' end]] to the [[3' end]]; thus, the bottom strand is written 3' to 5'.

==Base analogs and intercalators==

{{Main|Nucleic acid analogues}}
Chemical analogs of nucleotides can take the place of proper nucleotides and establish non-canonical base-pairing, leading to errors (mostly [[point mutation]]s) in [[DNA replication]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|DNA transcription]]. This is due to their [[isosteric]] chemistry. One common mutagenic base analog is [[5-bromouracil]], which resembles thymine but can base-pair to guanine in its [[enol]] form.

Other chemicals, known as [[DNA intercalation|DNA intercalators]], fit into the gap between adjacent bases on a single strand and induce [[frameshift mutation]]s by "masquerading" as a base, causing the DNA replication machinery to skip or insert additional nucleotides at the intercalated site. Most intercalators are large [[polyaromatic]] compounds and are known or suspected [[carcinogen]]s. Examples include [[ethidium bromide]] and [[acridine]].

==Unnatural base pair (UBP)==
{{See also|Artificial gene synthesis|Expanded genetic code|Nucleic acid analogue|Synthetic genomics}}
An unnatural base pair (UBP) is a designed subunit (or [[nucleobase]]) of [[DNA]] which is created in a laboratory and does not occur in nature.  DNA sequences have been described which use newly created nucleobases to form a third base pair, in addition to the two base pairs found in nature, A-T ([[adenine]] - [[thymine]]) and G-C ([[guanine]] - [[cytosine]]).  A few research groups have been searching for a third base pair for DNA, including teams led by [[Steven A. Benner]], [[Philippe Marliere]], [[Floyd Romesberg]] and [[Ichiro Hirao]].<ref name="Fikes">{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/08/tp-life-engineered-with-expanded-genetic-code/|title=Life engineered with expanded genetic code|last=Fikes|first=Bradley J.|date=May 8, 2014|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref> Some new base pairs have been reported.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Zunyi|date=August 15, 2011|title=Amplification, Mutation, and Sequencing of a Six-Letter Synthetic Genetic System|journal=J.

In 2012, a group of American scientists led by Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] in San Diego, California, published that his team designed an unnatural base pair (UBP).<ref name="Malyshev PNAS 20120724">{{cite journal |title=Efficient and sequence-independent replication of DNA containing a third base pair establishes a functional six-letter genetic alphabet |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) |date=24 July 2012 |last=Malyshev |first=Denis A. |last2=Dhami |first2=Kirandeep |last3=Quach |first3=Henry T. |last4=Lavergne |first4=Thomas |last5=Ordoukhanian |first5=Phillip |volume=109 |issue=30 |pages=12005–12010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1205176109 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/30/12005 |accessdate=2014-05-11 }}</ref>  The two new artificial nucleotides or ''Unnatural Base Pair'' (UBP) were named '''d5SICS''' and '''dNaM'''.

In 2014 the same team from the Scripps Research Institute reported that they synthesized a stretch of circular DNA known as a [[plasmid]] containing natural T-A and C-G base pairs along with the best-performing UBP Romesberg's laboratory had designed, and inserted it into cells of the common bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that successfully replicated the unnatural base pairs through multiple generations.<ref name="Fikes">{{cite news| url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/08/tp-life-engineered-with-expanded-genetic-code/| title=Life engineered with expanded genetic code| last=Fikes| first=Bradley J.| date=May 8, 2014 |work=San Diego Union Tribune| accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref> The [[transfection]] did not hamper the growth of the ''E. coli'' cells, and showed no sign of losing its unnatural base pairs to its natural [[DNA repair]] mechanisms.

The successful incorporation of a third base pair is a significant breakthrough toward the goal of greatly expanding the number of [[amino acid]]s which can be encoded by DNA, from the existing 20 amino acids to a theoretically possible 172, thereby expanding the potential for living organisms to produce novel [[protein]]s.<ref name="Fikes"/> The artificial strings of DNA do not encode for anything yet, but scientists speculate they could be designed to manufacture new proteins which could have industrial or pharmaceutical uses.<ref name="Pollack">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/business/researchers-report-breakthrough-in-creating-artificial-genetic-code.html?hpw&rref=business&_r=0| title=Scientists Add Letters to DNA’s Alphabet, Raising Hope and Fear |last=Pollack| first=Andrew| date=May 7, 2014| work=New York Times| accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref> Experts said the synthetic DNA incorporating the unnatural base pair raises the possibility of life forms based on a different DNA code.<ref name = "fox">{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/05/08/scientists-create-organism-using-artificial-dna/| title=Scientists create first living organism containing artificial DNA| date=May 8, 2014| work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Fox News| accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref><ref name = "Pollack" />

==Length measurements==<!-- This section is linked from [[KB]] -->
The following abbreviations are commonly used to describe the length of a D/R[[DNA|NA molecule]]:
* bp  = base pair(s)— one bp corresponds to approximately 3.4 [[Angstrom|Å]] (340 [[picometre|pm]]) of length along the strand, and to roughly 618 or 643 [[Atomic mass units|daltons]] for DNA and RNA respectively.
* kb (= kbp) = kilo base pairs = 1,000 bp
* Mb (= Mbp) = mega base pairs = 1,000,000 bp
* Gb = giga base pairs = 1,000,000,000 bp.

For case of single-stranded DNA/RNA units of [[nucleotide]]s are used, abbreviated nt (or knt, Mnt, Gnt), as they are not paired.
For distinction between units of [[computer storage]] and bases kbp, Mbp, Gbp, etc. may be used for base pairs.

The [[centimorgan]] is also often used to imply distance along a chromosome, but the number of base pairs it corresponds to varies widely. In the Human genome, the centimorgan is about 1 million base pairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/Glossary.aspx?acronym=False#C |title=NIH ORDR - Glossary - C |publisher=Rarediseases.info.nih.gov |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Matthew P Scott|author2=Paul Matsudaira|author3=Harvey Lodish|author4=James Darnell|author5=Lawrence Zipursky|author6=Chris A Kaiser|author7=Arnold Berk|author8=Monty Krieger |title=Molecular Cell Biology |edition=Fifth |publisher=W.
