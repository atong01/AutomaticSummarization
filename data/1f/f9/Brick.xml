Bull in the late 19th century.</paragraph><paragraph>An oval or circular trench is dug, 69 metres wide, 2-2.5 metres deep, and 100150 metres in circumference. A tall exhaust chimney is constructed in the centre. Half or more of the trench is filled with &quot;green&quot; (unfired) bricks which are stacked in an open lattice pattern to allow airflow. The lattice is capped with a roofing layer of finished brick.</paragraph><paragraph>In operation, new green bricks, along with roofing bricks, are stacked at one end of the brick pile; cooled finished bricks are removed from the other end for transport to their destinations. In the middle, the brick workers create a firing zone by dropping fuel (coal,<space/><link><target>wood</target></link>, oil, debris, and so on) through access holes in the roof above the trench.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Roskilde domkirke west fassade.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>upright</part><part>West face of<space/><link><target>Roskilde Cathedral</target></link><space/>in Roskilde, Denmark.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The advantage of the BTK design is a much greater energy efficiency compared with<space/><link><target>clamp kiln</target><part>clamp</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>scove kiln</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Sheet metal or boards are used to route the airflow through the brick lattice so that fresh air flows first through the recently burned bricks, heating the air, then through the active burning zone. The air continues through the green brick zone (pre-heating and drying the bricks), and finally out the chimney, where the rising gases create suction which pulls air through the system. The reuse of heated air yields savings in fuel cost.</paragraph><paragraph>As with the rail process above, the BTK process is continuous. A half dozen labourers working around the clock can fire approximately 15,00025,000 bricks a day. Unlike the rail process, in the BTK process the bricks do not move. Instead, the locations at which the bricks are loaded, fired, and unloaded gradually rotate through the trench.<extension extension_name='ref'>Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency,<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.environment.gov.pk/EA-GLines/I1B-Brick%20Kilns.pdf'>Brick Kiln Units (PDF file)</link></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>Dry pressed bricks</heading><paragraph>The dry press method is similar to the soft mud method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix, so it forms more accurate, sharper-edged bricks.

This mixture is forced through a<space/><link><target>Die (manufacturing)</target><part>die</part></link><space/>to create a long cable of material of the desired width and depth. This mass is then cut into bricks of the desired length by a wall of wires. Most structural bricks are made by this method as it produces hard, dense bricks, and suitable dies can produce perforations as well. The introduction of such holes reduces the volume of clay needed, and hence the cost. Hollow bricks are lighter and easier to handle, and have different thermal properties from solid bricks. The cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to 150&amp;nbsp;C before being fired. The heat for drying is often waste heat from the<space/><link><target>kiln</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>European-style extruded bricks or blocks are used in single-wall construction with finishes applied on the inside and outside.

When made with adequate amount of cement they are suitable for harsh environments such as wet conditions and retaining walls. They are made to standards BS 6073, EN 771-3.

Bricks are usually laid flat and as a result the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about four inches (about 100&amp;nbsp;mm). In most cases, the length of a brick is about twice its width, about eight inches (about 200&amp;nbsp;mm) or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid<space/><italics><link><target>Brickwork</target><part>bonded</part></link></italics><space/>in a structure which increases stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in<space/><italics>English bond</italics>, at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of<space/><italics>stretchers</italics>, bricks laid longways, and<space/><italics>headers</italics>, bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall is built in a variation of<space/><italics>English bond</italics><space/>called<space/><italics>English cross bond</italics><space/>where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length.
