A '''brick''' is a [[concrete masonry unit|block]] or a single unit of a kneaded [[clay]]-bearing soil, sand and lime, or concrete material, fire-hardened or air-dried, used in [[masonry]] construction.

Lightweight bricks (also called "lightweight blocks") are made from [[expanded clay aggregate]]. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are ''fired'' and ''non-fired'' bricks. Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest [[building material]]s, sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 5000 BC. Air-dried bricks, also known as [[mudbrick]]s, have a history older than fired bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw. Bricks are laid in ''courses'' and numerous patterns known as ''bonds'', collectively known as [[brickwork]], and may be laid in various kinds of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.

=== Middle East and South Asia ===
The earliest bricks were ''dried brick'', meaning they were formed from clay-bearing earth or mud and dried (usually in the sun) until they were strong enough for use. The oldest discovered bricks, originally made from shaped mud and dating before 7500 BC, were found at [[Tell Aswad]], in the upper [[Tigris]] region and in southeast [[Anatolia]] close to [[Diyarbakir]].<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://wikis.ifporient.org/archeologie/index.php/Tell_Aswad IFP Orient – Tell Aswad].

=== China ===
In [[History of China|pre-modern China]], bricks were being used from the 2nd millennium BCE at a site near [[Xi'an]].<ref name="brook 19 20">[[#Brook|Brook]], 19–20</ref> Bricks were produced on a larger scale under the [[Western Zhou]] dynasty about 3,000 years ago, and evidence for some of the first fired bricks ever produced has been discovered in ruins dating back to the Zhou.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100416132054/http://www.takungpao.com/news/10/01/28/_IN-1208245.htm Earliest Chinese building brick appeared in Xi'an (中國最早磚類建材在西安現身)]. takungpao.com (2010-1-28)</ref><ref>[http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/collection/2010-01/29/content_12896997.htm China's first brick, possible earliest brick in China] (藍田出土"中華第一磚" 疑似我國最早的"磚")</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100306112243/http://news.sina.com.tw/article/20100130/2743984.html 西安發現全球最早燒制磚 (Earliest fired brick discovered in Xi'an)]. Sina Corp.com.tw. 2010-01-30 (in Chinese)</ref> The carpenter's manual ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'', published in 1103 at the time of the [[Song dynasty]] described the brick making process and [[Ceramic glaze|glazing]] techniques then in use. Using the 17th century encyclopaedic text ''[[Song Yingxing|Tiangong Kaiwu]]'', historian [[Timothy Brook (historian)|Timothy Brook]] outlined the brick production process of [[Ming Dynasty]] China:

:"...the kilnmaster had to make sure that the temperature inside the kiln stayed at a level that caused the clay to shimmer with the colour of molten gold or silver. He also had to know when to quench the kiln with water so as to produce the surface glaze. To anonymous labourers fell the less skilled stages of brick production: mixing clay and water, driving oxen over the mixture to trample it into a thick paste, scooping the paste into standardised wooden frames (to produce a brick roughly 42&nbsp;cm long, 20&nbsp;cm wide, and 10&nbsp;cm thick), smoothing the surfaces with a wire-strung bow, removing them from the frames, printing the fronts and backs with stamps that indicated where the bricks came from and who made them, loading the kilns with fuel (likelier wood than coal), stacking the bricks in the kiln, removing them to cool while the kilns were still hot, and bundling them into pallets for transportation. It was hot, filthy work.
In the 21st century, the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs|ILAB]] has recorded significant instances of [[child labor]] and [[forced labor]] in the bricks manufacture sector and classified China as one of the 76 countries mentioned in its 2014 ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''.<ref>[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/ List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]. dol.gov</ref>

=== Europe ===
{{Main|Roman brick}}
Early civilisations around the [[Mediterranean]] adopted the use of fired bricks, including the [[Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The [[Roman legion]]s operated mobile [[kiln]]s,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and built large brick structures throughout the [[Roman Empire]], stamping the bricks with the seal of the legion.

During the [[Early Middle Ages]] the use of bricks in construction became popular in [[Northern Europe]], after being introduced there from Northern-Western [[Italy]]. An independent style of brick architecture, known as [[brick Gothic]] (similar to [[Gothic architecture]]) flourished in places that lacked indigenous sources of rocks. Examples of this architectural style can be found in modern-day [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]].

This style evolved into [[List of Brick Renaissance buildings|Brick Renaissance]] as the stylistic changes associated with the [[Italian Renaissance]] spread to northern Europe, leading to the adoption of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] elements into brick building. A clear distinction between the two styles only developed at the transition to [[Baroque architecture]]. In [[Lübeck]], for example, Brick Renaissance is clearly recognisable in buildings equipped with terracotta reliefs by the artist Statius von Düren, who was also active at [[Schwerin]] ([[Schwerin Castle]]) and [[Wismar]] (Fürstenhof).
[[File:Chilehaus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chilehaus|Chile house]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany]]

Long distance bulk transport of bricks and other construction equipment remained prohibitively expensive until the development of modern transportation infrastructure, with the construction of [[canal]], [[road]]s and [[railway]]s.

=== Industrial era ===
Production of bricks increased massively with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise in factory building in [[England]]. For reasons of speed and economy, bricks were increasingly preferred as building material to stone, even in areas where the stone was available. It was at this time in [[London]], that bright red brick was chosen for construction to make the buildings more visible in the heavy fog and to prevent traffic accidents.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0099422581|title=London the Biography|author=Peter Ackroyd|page=435|publisher=Random House|year=2001}}</ref>

The transition from the traditional method of production known as 'hand-moulding' to a mechanised form of mass production slowly took place during the first half of the nineteenth century. Possibly the first successful brick-making machine was [[patent]]ed by a Mr Henry Clayton, employed at the Atlas Works in [[Middlesex]], [[England]], in 1855, and was capable of producing up to 25,000 bricks daily with minimal supervision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US13123|title=Henry Clayton|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref> His mechanical apparatus soon achieved widespread attention after it was adopted for use by the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway Company]] for brick-making at their factory near [[Folkestone]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=S54AAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA361|title=The Mechanics Magazine and Journal of Engineering, Agricultural Machinery, Manufactures and Shipbuilding|accessdate=2012-12-17|year=1859}}</ref> The [[Bradley & Craven Ltd]] ‘Stiff-Plastic Brickmaking Machine’ was patented in 1853, apparently predating Clayton. Bradley & Craven went on to be a dominant manufacturer of brickmaking machinery.<ref>''The First Hundred Years: the Early History of Bradley & Craven, Limited, Wakefield, England'' by Bradley & Craven Ltd (1963)</ref>  Predating both Clayton and Bradley & Craven Ltd. however was the brick making machine patented by Richard A. Ver Valen of Haverstraw, New York in 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US9082|title=US Patent 9082|accessdate=2014-09-26}}</ref>

The demand for high office building construction at the turn of the 20th century, led to a much greater use of [[cast iron|cast]] and [[wrought iron]] and later steel and [[concrete]]. The use of brick for [[skyscraper]] construction severely limited the size of the building – the [[Monadnock Building]], built in 1896 in Chicago required exceptionally thick walls to maintain the structural integrity of its 17 storeys.

Following pioneering work in the 1950s at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] and the [[Building Research Establishment]] in [[Watford]], UK, the use of improved masonry for the construction of tall structures up to 18 storeys high was made viable. However, the use of brick has largely remained restricted to small to medium-sized buildings, as steel and concrete remain superior materials for high-rise construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dehoopsteenwerwe.co.za/information03.html|title=The History of Bricks|publisher=De Hoop:Steenwerve Brickfields}}</ref>

== Methods of manufacture ==
<!-- Brick kiln redirects here, needs more information-->
[[File:BrickMakingTurnOfTheCentury.jpg|thumb|upright|Brick making at the beginning of the 20th century.]]

Three basic types of brick are un-fired, fired, and chemically set bricks. Each type is manufactured differently.

=== Mudbrick ===
{{Main|mudbrick}}
Unfired bricks, also known as [[mudbrick]]s, are made from a wet, clay-containing soil mixed with straw or similar binders. They are air-dried until ready for use.

=== Fired brick ===
[[File:Brick making in Java.jpg|thumb|Raw bricks were sun dried before fired]]
Fired bricks are burned in a kiln which makes them durable. Modern, fired, clay bricks are formed in one of three processes – soft mud, dry press, or extruded.

Normally, brick contains the following ingredients:<ref name="punmia">{{Citation|author=Punmia, B.C.; Jain, Ashok Kumar |title=Basic Civil Engineering |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sWZxu_muxyIC&pg=PA33 |year= 2003  |isbn=978-81-7008-403-7 |pages=33–}}</ref>

# Silica (sand) – 50% to 60% by weight
# Alumina (clay) – 20% to 30% by weight
# Lime – 2 to 5% by weight
# Iron oxide – ≤ 7% by weight
# Magnesia – less than 1% by weight

The soft mud method is the most common, as it is the most economical. It starts with the raw clay, preferably in a mix with 25–30% sand to reduce shrinkage. The clay is first ground and mixed with water to the desired consistency. The clay is then pressed into steel moulds with a [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] press. The shaped clay is then fired ("burned") at 900–1000&nbsp;°C to achieve strength.

==== Rail kilns ====
[[File:Xhosa brickmaker at kiln near Ngcobo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] brickmaker at [[kiln]] near [[Ngcobo]] in the former [[Transkei]] in 2007.]]

In modern [[brickworks]], this is usually done in a continuously fired tunnel [[kiln]], in which the bricks are fired as they move slowly through the kiln on [[conveyors]], rails, or kiln cars, which achieves a more consistent brick product. The bricks often have [[Lime (material)|lime]], ash, and organic matter added, which accelerates the burning process.

==== Bull's Trench Kilns ====
[[File:A brickmaker - Tashrih al-aqvam (1825), f.253v - BL Add. 27255.jpg|thumb|A brickmaker in India  – ''Tashrih al-aqvam'' (1825)]]
In [[India]], brick making is typically a manual process. The most common type of brick kiln in use there is the '''Bull's Trench Kiln''' (BTK), based on a design developed by British engineer W. Bull in the late 19th century.

An oval or circular trench is dug, 6–9 metres wide, 2-2.5 metres deep, and 100–150 metres in circumference. A tall exhaust chimney is constructed in the centre. Half or more of the trench is filled with "green" (unfired) bricks which are stacked in an open lattice pattern to allow airflow. The lattice is capped with a roofing layer of finished brick.

In operation, new green bricks, along with roofing bricks, are stacked at one end of the brick pile; cooled finished bricks are removed from the other end for transport to their destinations. In the middle, the brick workers create a firing zone by dropping fuel (coal, [[wood]], oil, debris, and so on) through access holes in the roof above the trench.

[[File:Roskilde domkirke west fassade.jpg|thumb|left|upright|West face of [[Roskilde Cathedral]] in Roskilde, Denmark.]]

The advantage of the BTK design is a much greater energy efficiency compared with [[clamp kiln|clamp]] or [[scove kiln]]s. Sheet metal or boards are used to route the airflow through the brick lattice so that fresh air flows first through the recently burned bricks, heating the air, then through the active burning zone. The air continues through the green brick zone (pre-heating and drying the bricks), and finally out the chimney, where the rising gases create suction which pulls air through the system. The reuse of heated air yields savings in fuel cost.

As with the rail process above, the BTK process is continuous. A half dozen labourers working around the clock can fire approximately 15,000–25,000 bricks a day. Unlike the rail process, in the BTK process the bricks do not move. Instead, the locations at which the bricks are loaded, fired, and unloaded gradually rotate through the trench.<ref>Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.environment.gov.pk/EA-GLines/I1B-Brick%20Kilns.pdf Brick Kiln Units (PDF file)]</ref>

==== Dry pressed bricks ====
The dry press method is similar to the soft mud method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix, so it forms more accurate, sharper-edged bricks. The greater force in pressing and the longer burn make this method more expensive.

==== Extruded bricks ====
For extruded bricks the clay is mixed with 10–15% [[water]] (stiff extrusion) or 20–25% water (soft extrusion) in a [[pugmill]]. This mixture is forced through a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] to create a long cable of material of the desired width and depth. This mass is then cut into bricks of the desired length by a wall of wires. Most structural bricks are made by this method as it produces hard, dense bricks, and suitable dies can produce perforations as well. The introduction of such holes reduces the volume of clay needed, and hence the cost. Hollow bricks are lighter and easier to handle, and have different thermal properties from solid bricks. The cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to 150&nbsp;°C before being fired. The heat for drying is often waste heat from the [[kiln]].

European-style extruded bricks or blocks are used in single-wall construction with finishes applied on the inside and outside. Their many voids comprise a greater proportion of the volume than the solid, thin walls of fired clay. Such bricks are made in 15-, 25-, 30-, 42- and 50-cm widths. Some models have very high thermal insulation properties, making them suitable for [[zero-energy building]]s.

==== Influences on colour ====
[[File:London stock brick (bridge).jpg|right|thumb|Yellow London Stocks at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo station]]]]
The fired colour of tired clay bricks is influenced by the chemical and mineral content of the raw materials, the firing temperature, and the atmosphere in the kiln. For example, pink coloured bricks are the result of a high iron content, white or yellow bricks have a higher lime content. Most bricks burn to various red hues; as the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red, purple and then to brown or grey at around {{convert|1300|C|0|abbr=on}}. The names of bricks may reflect their origin and colour, such as [[London stock brick]] and Cambridgeshire White. ''Brick tinting'' may be performed to change the color of bricks to blend-in areas of brickwork with the surrounding masonry.

An impervious and ornamental surface may be laid on brick either by [[salt glaze pottery|salt glazing]], in which salt is added during the burning process, or by the use of a "[[Slip (ceramics)|slip]]," which is a glaze material into which the bricks are dipped. Subsequent reheating in the kiln fuses the slip into a glazed surface integral with the brick base.

==== Types of fired clay bricks ====
[[File:2008 BeaconHill Boston 2302897829.jpg|thumb|This wall in [[Beacon Hill, Boston]] shows different types of brickwork and stone foundations]]
There are thousands of types of bricks that are named for their use, size, forming method, origin, quality, texture, and/or materials.

*[[Staffordshire blue brick]] – a type of construction brick.

=== Chemically set bricks ===
Chemically set bricks are not fired but may have the curing process accelerated by the application of heat and pressure in an autoclave.

==== Calcium-silicate bricks ====
[[File:Mexitegel.jpg|thumb|Swedish Mexitegel is a sand-lime or lime-cement brick.]]
<!--
    NB: This is NOT related to the chemical compound "calcium silicate"
    These are bricks made from calcium compounds (lime) and silicate compounds (sand)
-->
Calcium-silicate bricks are also called sandlime or flintlime bricks depending on their ingredients. Rather than being made with clay they are made with [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] binding the silicate material. The raw materials for calcium-silicate bricks include lime mixed in a proportion of about 1 to 10 with sand, [[quartz]], crushed [[flint]] or crushed siliceous rock together with mineral [[colourant]]s. The materials are mixed and left until the lime is completely hydrated; the mixture is then pressed into moulds and cured in an [[autoclave]] for three to fourteen hours to speed the chemical hardening.<ref name="EMS">McArthur, Hugh, and Duncan Spalding. ''Engineering materials science: properties, uses, degradation and remediation''. Chichester, U.K.: Horwood Pub., 2004. 194. Print.</ref> The finished bricks are very accurate and uniform, although the sharp [[arris]]es need careful handling to avoid damage to brick and bricklayer. The bricks can be made in a variety of colours; white, black, buff and grey-blues are common and pastel shades can be achieved. This type of brick is common in Sweden, especially in houses built or renovated in the 1970s. In India these are known as [[fly ash brick]]s, manufactured using the FaL-G (fly ash, lime and gypsum) process. Calcium-silicate bricks are also manufactured in Canada and the United States, and meet the criteria set forth in ASTM C73 – 10 Standard Specification for Calcium Silicate Brick (Sand-Lime Brick).

==== Concrete bricks ====
{{Main|Concrete masonry unit}}
[[File:Brickworks in Hainan - cement vessel, maker, stacker 01.jpg|thumb|right|A concrete brick-making assembly line in [[Guilinyang]] Town, Hainan, China. This operation produces a pallet containing 42 bricks, approximately every 30 seconds.]]

Bricks formed from [[concrete]] are usually termed blocks, and are typically pale grey in colour. They are made from a dry, small aggregate concrete which is formed in steel moulds by vibration and compaction in either an "egglayer" or static machine. The finished blocks are cured rather than fired using low-pressure steam. Concrete blocks are manufactured in a much wider range of shapes and sizes than clay bricks and are also available with a wider range of face treatments – a number of which simulate the appearance of clay bricks.

Concrete bricks are available in many colours and as an engineering brick made with sulfate-resisting Portland cement or equivalent. When made with adequate amount of cement they are suitable for harsh environments such as wet conditions and retaining walls. They are made to standards BS 6073, EN 771-3. Concrete bricks expand and contract more than clay or sandlime bricks so they need movement joints every 5 to 6 metres, but are similar to other bricks of similar density in thermal and sound resistance and fire resistance.<ref name="EMS" />

== Optimal dimensions, characteristics, and strength ==
[[File:Brick pile.jpg|thumb|Loose bricks]]
For efficient handling and laying, bricks must be small enough and light enough to be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free for the trowel). Bricks are usually laid flat and as a result the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about four inches (about 100&nbsp;mm). In most cases, the length of a brick is about twice its width, about eight inches (about 200&nbsp;mm) or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid ''[[Brickwork|bonded]]'' in a structure which increases stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in ''English bond'', at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of ''stretchers'', bricks laid longways, and ''headers'', bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall is built in a variation of ''English bond'' called ''English cross bond'' where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length. In true ''English bond'', the perpendicular lines of the stretcher courses are in line with each other.

A bigger brick makes for a thicker (and thus more insulating) wall. Historically, this meant that bigger bricks were necessary in colder climates (see for instance the slightly larger size of the Russian brick in table below), while a smaller brick was adequate, and more economical, in warmer regions. A notable illustration of this correlation is the [[Green Gate]] in Gdansk; built in 1571 of imported [[Dutch brick]], too small for the colder climate of Gdansk, it was notorious for being a chilly and drafty residence. Nowadays this is no longer an issue, as modern walls typically incorporate specialised insulation materials.

The correct brick for a job can be selected from a choice of colour, surface texture, density, weight, absorption and pore structure, thermal characteristics, thermal and moisture movement, and fire resistance.

In [[England]], the length and width of the common brick has remained fairly constant over the centuries (but see [[brick tax]]), but the depth has varied from about two inches (about 51&nbsp;mm) or smaller in earlier times to about two and a half inches (about 64&nbsp;mm) more recently. In the [[United Kingdom]], the usual size of a modern brick is 215 × 102.5 × 65&nbsp;mm (about {{frac|8|5|8}} × {{frac|4|1|8}} × {{frac|2|5|8}}&nbsp;inches), which, with a nominal 10&nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|8}}&nbsp;inch) mortar joint, forms a ''[[unit size]]'' of 225 × 112.5 × 75&nbsp;mm (9 × {{frac|4|1|2}} × 3&nbsp;inches), for a ratio of 6:3:2.

In the [[United States]], modern standard bricks are (controlled by American Society for Testing and Materials [[ASTM]] <ref>[http://www.astm.org/Standards/C652.htm ASTM C652 – 13 Standard Specification for Hollow Brick (Hollow Masonry Units Made From Clay or Shale)]. Astm.org. Retrieved 2013-10-01.</ref>) about 8 × {{frac|3|5|8}}&nbsp; × {{frac|2|1|4}}&nbsp;inches (203 × 92 × 57&nbsp;mm). The more commonly used is the modular brick {{frac|7|5|8}}&nbsp; × {{frac|3|5|8}}&nbsp; × {{frac|2|1|4}}&nbsp;inches (194 × 92 × 57&nbsp;mm). This modular brick of {{frac|7|5|8}} with a {{frac|3|8}} mortar joint eases the calculation of the number of bricks in a given run.<ref>[http://www.maconline.org/tech/materials/BRICK/bricksizes/bricksizes.html bricksizes]. Maconline.org. Retrieved 2013-10-01.</ref>

Some brickmakers create innovative sizes and shapes for bricks used for plastering (and therefore not visible) where their inherent mechanical properties are more important than their visual ones.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20081206161820/http://www.crammix.co.za/maxilite.htm Crammix ''Maxilite'']. crammix.co.za</ref> These bricks are usually slightly larger, but not as large as blocks and offer the following advantages:
* a slightly larger brick requires less mortar and handling (fewer bricks), which reduces cost
* their ribbed exterior aids plastering
* more complex interior cavities allow improved insulation, while maintaining strength.

Blocks have a much greater range of sizes. Standard co-ordinating sizes in length and height (in mm) include 400×200, 450×150, 450×200, 450×225, 450×300, 600×150, 600×200, and 600×225; depths (work size, mm) include 60, 75, 90, 100, 115, 140, 150, 190, 200, 225, and 250. They are usable across this range as they are lighter than clay bricks. The density of solid clay bricks is around 2,000&nbsp;kg/m³: this is reduced by frogging, hollow bricks, and so on, but aerated autoclaved concrete, even as a solid brick, can have densities in the range of 450–850&nbsp;kg/m³.

Bricks may also be classified as ''solid'' (less than 25% perforations by volume, although the brick may be "frogged," having indentations on one of the longer faces), ''perforated'' (containing a pattern of small holes through the brick, removing no more than 25% of the volume), ''cellular'' (containing a pattern of holes removing more than 20% of the volume, but closed on one face), or ''hollow'' (containing a pattern of large holes removing more than 25% of the brick's volume). Blocks may be solid, cellular or hollow

The term "frog" can refer to the indentation or the implement used to make it. Modern brickmakers usually use plastic frogs but in the past they were made of wood.

The compressive strength of bricks produced in the United States ranges from about 1000&nbsp;lbf/in² to 15,000&nbsp;lbf/in² (7 to 105 [[MPa]] or N/mm² ), varying according to the use to which the brick are to be put. In England clay bricks can have strengths of up to 100 [[MPa]], although a common house brick is likely to show a range of 20–40 [[MPa]].

== Use ==
Bricks are used for building, [[block paving]] and [[pavement (material)|pavement]]. In the US, brick pavement was found incapable of withstanding heavy traffic,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} but it is coming back into use as a method of [[traffic calming]] or as a decorative surface in [[pedestrianized zone|pedestrian precincts]]. For example, in the early 1900s, most of the streets in the city of [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]], were paved with brick. Today, there are only about 20 blocks of brick paved streets remaining (totalling less than 0.5 percent of all the streets in the city limits).<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090704104107/http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/preserveamerica/stories/michigan/index.cfm Michigan | Success Stories | Preserve America | Office of the Secretary of Transportation | U.S. Department of Transportation].</ref>

Bricks in the [[metallurgy]] and [[glass]] industries are often used for lining [[furnace]]s, in particular [[refractory]] bricks such as [[silica]], [[Periclase|magnesia]], [[Grog (clay)|chamotte]] and neutral ([[chromomagnesite]]) [[fire brick|refractory bricks]]. This type of brick must have good [[thermal shock]] resistance, [[refractory|refractoriness]] under load, high melting point, and satisfactory [[porosity]]. There is a large refractory [[brick industry]], especially in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Japan]], the [[United States]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]].

In Northwest Europe, bricks have been used in construction for centuries. Until recently, almost all houses were built almost entirely from bricks. Although many houses are now built using a mixture of [[concrete block]]s and other materials, many houses are skinned with a layer of bricks on the outside for aesthetic appeal.

'''[[Engineering brick]]s''' are used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.

In the UK a [[redbrick university]] is one founded and built in the Victorian era. The term is used to refer to such institutions collectively to distinguish them from the older [[Oxbridge]] institutions, the post-war 'plate glass' universities, and the 'new' universities of the 1990s.

Colombian architect [[Rogelio Salmona]] was noted for his extensive use of red brick in his buildings and for using natural shapes like spirals, radial geometry and curves in his designs.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/arts/06salmona.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | first=Simon | last=Romero | title=Rogelio Salmona, Colombian Architect Who Transformed Cities, Is Dead at 78 | date=6 October 2007}}</ref> Most buildings in [[Colombia]] are made of brick, given the abundance of clay in equatorial countries like this one.

== Limitations ==
Starting in the 20th century, the use of brickwork declined in some areas due to concerns with earthquakes. Earthquakes such as the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco earthquake of 1906]] and the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] revealed the weaknesses of brick masonry in earthquake-prone areas. During seismic events, the mortar cracks and crumbles, and the bricks are no longer held together. Brick masonry with steel reinforcement, which helps hold the masonry together during earthquakes, was used to replace many of the unreinforced masonry buildings. Retrofitting older unreinforced masonry structures has been mandated in many jurisdictions.
