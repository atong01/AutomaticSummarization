Both were near Ethiopia on the Horn of Africa and both were impoverished. Italy sought to improve its position in Africa by conquering Ethiopia and joining it with its two territories. Menelik II was the brilliant Ethiopian leader who pitted Italy against its European rivals while stockpiling weapons to defend itself against the Italians.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Background</heading><paragraph>In 1889, the Italians signed the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Wuchale</target></link><space/>with then<space/><italics><link><target>Negus</target></link></italics>#tag:ref<space/><link><target>Menelik II of Ethiopia</target><part>Menelik</part></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Shewa</target></link>.

In return, Italy promised Menelik's rule, financial assistance and military supplies. A dispute later arose over the interpretation of the two versions of the document. The Italian-language version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated that the Emperor of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities. This would in effect make Ethiopia a<space/><link><target>protectorate</target></link><space/>of the Kingdom of Italy. The<space/><link><target>Amharic</target></link><space/>version of the article however stated that the Emperor could use the good offices of the Kingdom of Italy in his relations with foreign nations if he wished. However, the Italian diplomats claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and that Menelik knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="author">Piero Pastoretto<space/></arg><arg name="title">Battaglia di Adua<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.arsmilitaris.org/pubblicazioni/ADUA/adua.htm<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2006-06-04<space/></arg><arg name="archiveurl"><space/>https://web.archive.org/web/20060531223251/http://www.arsmilitaris.org/pubblicazioni/ADUA/adua.htm<space/></arg><arg name="archivedate">May 31, 2006</arg><arg name="language">it</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The Italian government decided on a military solution to force Ethiopia to abide by the Italian version of the treaty.

By late February 1896, supplies on both sides were running low. General<space/><link><target>Oreste Baratieri</target></link>, commander of the Italian forces, knew the Ethiopian forces had been living off the land, and once the supplies of the local peasants were exhausted, Emperor<space/><link><target>Menelik II of Ethiopia</target><part>Menelik</part></link>'s army would begin to melt away. However, the Italian government insisted that General Baratieri act.</paragraph><paragraph>On the evening of 29 February, Baratieri, about to be replaced by a new governor, General Baldissera, met with his<space/><link><target>Brigadier General</target><part>brigadiers</part></link><space/><link><target>Matteo Albertone</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Giuseppe Arimondi</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Vittorio Dabormida</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Giuseppe Ellena</target></link>, concerning their next steps.

In Rome, to prevent these violent protests, the universities and theatres were closed. Police were called out to disperse rock-throwers in front of Prime Minister Crispi's residence. Crispi resigned on 9 March. Troops were called out to quell demonstrations in Naples. In Pavia, crowds built barricades on the railroad tracks to prevent a troop train from leaving the station. The Association of Women of Rome, Turin, Milan and Pavia called for the return of all military forces in Africa. Funeral masses were intoned for the known and unknown dead. Families began sending to the newspapers letters they had received before Adwa in which their menfolk described their poor living conditions and their fears at the size of the army they were going to face. King Umberto declared his birthday (14 March) a day of mourning. Italian communities in [[St. Petersburg]], [[London]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Jerusalem]] collected money for the families of the dead and for the Italian Red Cross.''<ref>Prouty, ''Empress Taytu'', pp. 159f.</ref></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The Russian support for Ethiopia led to the advent of a Russian Red Cross mission.

Levine also noted that the victory &quot;gave encouragement to isolationist and conservative strains that were deeply rooted in Ethiopian culture, strengthening the hand of those who would strive to keep Ethiopia from adopting techniques imported from the modern West resistances with which both Menelik and Ras Teferi/Haile Selassie would have to contend&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/2009/03/the-battle-of-adwa-as-a-historic-event/'>&quot;The Battle of Adwa as a 'Historic' Event&quot;</link>,<space/><italics><link><target>Ethiopian Review</target></link></italics>, 3 March 2009 (Retrieved 9 March 2009)</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Film</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Adwa (film)</target><part>''Adwa'' (film)</part></link><space/>- 1999 documentary directed by<space/><link><target>Haile Gerima</target></link>.</listitem></list><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Battle of Annual</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Battle of Isandlwana</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Battle of the Little Bighorn</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Massacre of Elphinstone's Army</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>St. Clair's Defeat</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>Notes</heading><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Footnotes</defkey></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>2</arg><arg name="group">nb</arg></template></paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Citations</defkey></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>2</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Refbegin</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Berkeley, G.F.-H.
