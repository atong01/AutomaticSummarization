A '''campus''' is traditionally the land on which a [[college]] or [[university]] and related institutional buildings are situated. A modern campus is a collection of buildings that belong to a given institution, either academic or non-academic. Usually a campus includes [[library|libraries]], [[lecture]] halls, [[residence hall]]s, student centers or dining halls, and park-like settings.

==Etymology==
The word derives from a [[Latin]] word for "field" and was first used to describe the grounds of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) during the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=campus |first=Douglas |last=Harper |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=20 December 2013 |title=Campus (n.)}}</ref> Some other American colleges later adopted the word to describe individual fields at their own institutions, but "campus" did not yet describe the whole university property. A school might have one space called a campus, one called a field, and another called a yard.

==History==
The tradition of a campus begain with the medieval [[Europe]]an universities where the students and teachers lived and worked together in a [[cloister]]ed environment.<ref name=chap>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KOZIHCV04SoC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=American Places: In Search of the Twenty-first Century Campus |last=Chapman |first=M. Perry |page=7 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2006}}</ref> The notion of the importance of the setting to academic life later migrated to America, and early colonial educational institutions were based on the Scottish and English collegiate system.<ref name=chap/>

==Uses==
The meaning expanded to include the whole institutional [[real property|property]] during the 20th century, with the old meaning persisting into the 1950s in some places. 

===Office buildings===
Sometimes the lands on which company office buildings sit, along with the buildings, are called campuses. The [[Microsoft Campus]] in [[Redmond, Washington]] is a good example.  Hospitals, and even airports sometimes use the term to describe the territory of their facilities.

===Universities===
The word "campus" has also been applied to European universities, although most such institutions are characterized by ownership of individual buildings in urban settings rather than park-like lawns in which buildings are placed.{{cn|date=May 2015}}
