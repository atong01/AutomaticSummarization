Sipe passed for 4,000 yards and 30 touchdowns with only 14 interceptions (enough for him to be named the<space/><link><target>National Football League Most Valuable Player Award</target><part>NFL MVP</part></link>), behind an offensive line that sent three members to the Pro Bowl:<space/><link><target>Doug Dieken</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Tom DeLeone</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Joe DeLamielleure</target></link>.

However, a heartbreaking end to this dramatic season came in the closing seconds when Rutigliano called what became known as &quot;<link><target>Red Right 88</target></link>&quot; and had Sipe pass toward the end zone, only to watch Oakland's<space/><link><target>Mike Davis (defensive back)</target><part>Mike Davis</part></link><space/>intercept the ball.

Sipe threw only 17 touchdowns while being picked off 25 times. The Browns went 511, and few of their games were particularly close.

The Browns had little success rushing or defending against it, finishing in the bottom five teams in both yardage categories. Despite going 45, Cleveland was able to make the playoffs due to an expanded playoff system in the strike-shortened year. They were matched up again with the Raiders in the playoffs, but were easily defeated 2710.</paragraph><paragraph>Sipe and the Browns got some of their spark back in<space/><template><target>nfly</target><arg>1983</arg></template>. Sipe had 26 touchdown passes and 3,566 yards, while Mike Pruitt ran for 10 scores on 1,184 yards. Cleveland even won two games in overtime and another in the fourth quarter. A fourth-quarter loss to the Oilers in their second-to-last game dashed their playoff hopes. At 97, the Browns finished one game behind the Steelers, and lost out on a wild-card spot due to a tiebreaker.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1984, a rebuilding year, Brian Sipe had defected to the upstart<space/><link><target>United States Football League</target></link><space/>after the 1983 season, and Paul McDonald was named the starting quarterback.

As a rookie, Kosar learned through trial by fire as he took over for<space/><link><target>Gary Danielson</target></link><space/>midway through the 1985 season. Progressing a bit more each Sunday, the young quarterback helped turn the struggling season around, as the Browns won four of the ten games Kosar started. Two young rushers,<space/><link><target>Earnest Byner</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Kevin Mack</target></link>, played a large part in the team's success, as well; each ran for 1,000+ yards. The Browns' 88 record gave the team the top spot in a weak AFC Central, and they looked poised to shock the heavily favored Miami Dolphins in the divisional playoff game with a 213 lead at halftime. It took<space/><link><target>Dan Marino</target></link>'s spirited second-half comeback to win the game for Miami 2421. While the Browns' faithful may have felt the initial sting of disappointment, there was tremendous upside in the loss: Schottenheimer's team, with Kosar at quarterback, reached the playoffs each of the next five seasons, advancing to the AFC championship game in three of those years.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Bernie-Kosar-Browns-Preseason-Game-Aug31-06.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>175px</part><part>Former Browns<space/><link><target>Pro Bowl</target></link><space/>QB<space/><link><target>Bernie Kosar</target></link>, who led the Browns to four<space/><link><target>AFC Central</target></link><space/>titles, and three<space/><link><target>AFC Championship</target></link><space/>games during the 1980s</part></link>The Browns broke into the ranks of the NFL's eliteparticularly on defensewith a 124 showing in<space/><template><target>nfly</target><arg>1986</arg></template>.

In the divisional playoffs, the Browns needed some serious heroics (and a bit of luck) to overcome the New York Jets. The Jets were leading 2010 with less than four minutes to play, with the Browns in a dire third and 24 situation.<space/><link><target>Mark Gastineau</target></link><space/>was called for roughing the passer, which gave Cleveland a first down. The drive ended with Kevin Mack running into the end zone for a touchdown. After going<space/><link><target>three-and-out</target></link>, the Jets went back on defense, but allowed the rejuvenated Browns to again drive the ball deep into their end of the field. With 11 seconds remaining in regulation,<space/><link><target>Mark Moseley</target></link><space/>kicked a field goal to tie the game. In the first of two ensuing overtime periods, Moseley missed his next attempt, but later redeemed himself by ending what had become the second-longest game in NFL history, a 2320 victory for the Browns.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 1986 AFC championship game, the<space/><link><target>Denver Broncos</target></link><space/>arrived in the windswept, hostile confines of<space/><link><target>Cleveland Municipal Stadium</target></link>. No one knew at the time, but the Broncos would become Cleveland's nemesis of the Kosar era, having only lost once to the Browns in a span that still continues to this day. As with the divisional playoffs of the previous week, the AFC title game would also prove to be an overtime heart-stopper. But this time,<space/><link><target>John Elway</target></link><space/>and the Broncos came away the victors. Pinned in on the Denver two-yard line with 5:11 left to play and the wind in his face, Elway embarked on his now-famous 98-yard march downfield, which is now known by NFL historians as simply &quot;<link><target>the Drive</target></link>&quot;. With 34 seconds on the clock, Elway's five-yard touchdown pass to<space/><link><target>Mark Jackson (American football player)</target><part>Mark Jackson</part></link><space/>tied the game at 20 apiece.

Cleveland won another AFC Central crown with a 105 record and easily defeated the Indianapolis Colts 3821 in the divisional playoff to set up a rematch with the Broncos in the AFC championship game, this time in Denver. With the score 213 in favor of the Broncos at halftime, Kosar led a third-quarter comeback with two touchdowns by Earnest Byner and another by<space/><link><target>Reggie Langhorne</target></link>.

Kosar drove the Browns to the Broncos' 8-yard line with 1:12 to go, and handed off to Byner. Just when it looked like he had an open route to the end zone, Broncos defensive back<space/><link><target>Jeremiah Castille</target></link><space/>stripped him of the ball. The Broncos recovered what became known as &quot;<link><target>The Fumble</target></link>&quot;.

The rest of the season was headlined by Slaughter's Pro Bowl-worthy 1,236 yards receiving, and was a success at 73 until a 1010 tie with Schottenheimer's Chiefs in November led to a three-game losing streak. Two comeback wins over the Minnesota Vikings and Houston Oilers in the season's final two weeks kept them in the playoff race. The tie ended up being the Browns' saving grace, with their 961 record winning them the AFC Central title and first-round bye over the Oilers and Pittsburgh Steelers at 97.

The Browns continued to struggle as they became accustomed to a completely new coaching staff. Throughout the preseason, Brady Quinn and Derek Anderson competed for the starting quarterback position. Quinn ended up winning the job, but after three games marked by team inconsistency (and an 03 record), he was benched in favor of Anderson. On November 1, the team announced the firing of GM Kokinis after only eight regular-season games (and a 17 record), with his duties essentially being assumed by Mangini. Soon afterwards, Mangini decided that a quarterback switch was to be made again, and Quinn given the starting job back. After being 111 at the three-quarters point in the season, the team went on a four-game winning streak and finished with a record of 511, highlighted by the team beating the Steelers after 12 consecutive losses against their rival.</paragraph><paragraph>On December 21, 2009, as Mangini's first season was coming to a close, former Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks head coach<space/><link><target>Mike Holmgren</target></link><space/>was hired as team president and was given authority over the team's football operations.

However, both Delhomme and Wallace injured their ankles over the first five games, forcing Colt McCoy to start in week 6 against the Steelers, though Mike Holmgren stated he would sit and learn the entire season. Though McCoy lost his first NFL start against the Steelers, he was able to win the following week when the Browns upset the defending Super Bowl champions, the New Orleans Saints. With this victory, the Browns defeated the defending Super Bowl Champions three years in a row, becoming the seventh NFL team to achieve this feat.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/10495/browns-stun-super-bowl-champs-again</arg><arg name="title">Browns stun Super Bowl champs again</arg><arg name="date">October 24, 2010</arg><arg name="accessdate">October 24, 2010<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>The Browns continued this positive streak by outplaying the New England Patriots for a 3414 victory in their next game.

Starting several rookies, Shurmur's team was frequently beset by confusion in personnel and play-calling at critical junctures. Early in the year, the defense surrendered a touchdown on a failure to break the defensive huddle, and the team's chances in several games were compromised by a host of special-teams mistakes and meltdowns. At the midpoint of the season, in a telling series in which Shurmur called for a conservative ball-protection strategy, the Browns recovered their own fumble resulting from a mistakenly called handoff to a third-string tight end lined up at fullback, only to botch a short go-ahead field goal attempt with a failed snap and uncoordinated line movement.</paragraph><paragraph>The Browns went 412 in Shumur's first season, including losing six in a row to end the 2011 campaign.</paragraph><paragraph>New owner<space/><link><target>Jimmy Haslam</target></link><space/>announced on October 16, 2012, that Holmgren would stay on through the 2012 season in a lesser role (though still officially listed as president), and would then retire.

Home Uniforms: brown (officially &quot;<link><target>seal brown</target></link>&quot;) with white numerals and a white-orange-white-orange-white stripe sequence on the sleeves. 2. Away Uniforms: white with brown numerals and a brown-orange-brown-orange-brown stripe sequence on the sleeves. The three white or brown stripes are approximately twice the width of the two orange stripes. (The original 1946 jerseys featured block-shadow numerals.) 3. A third orange jersey was used for night games in the 1953, 54 and 55 seasons, as well as games from 2002 to 2005 when the NFL encouraged teams to create a third jersey. In 2013 the Browns wore a combination of brown pants and jerseys in honor of Jim Brown.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Pants:</bold><space/>1. White white with an orange-brown-orange stripe sequence on the sides (the stripes are of equal width). 2. Brown solid brown (no stripes). Orange pants with a wider brown-white-brown stripe sequence were worn from 1975 to 1983 and become symbolic of the &quot;Kardiac Kids&quot; era. The orange pants were worn again occasionally in 2003 and 2004.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Socks:</bold><space/>Brown or white with matching stripe pattern to jerseys (194683; 198595; 19992002 mid-season); solid brown with brown jerseys and solid orange with white jerseys (1984); solid brown when worn with white pants (2002 mid-season2008); white striped socks with brown pants (2009) Exceptions: White striped socks appeared occasionally with the white jerseys in 20032005 and again in 2007. Brown striped socks appeared with 1957-style throwback uniforms in 20062008.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Helmet:</bold><space/>Solid white (19461949); solid white for day games and solid orange for night games (195051); orange with a single white stripe (195256); orange with a single white stripe and brown numerals on the sides (195759); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence and brown numerals on the sides (1960); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence (196195 and 1999present).</paragraph><paragraph>Over the years, the Browns have had on-again / off-again periods of wearing white for their home games, particularly in the 1970s and 80s, as well as in the early 2000s after the team returned to the league. Until recently, when more NFL teams have started to wear white at home at least once a season, the Browns were the only non-<link><target>subtropical</target></link><space/>team north of the<space/><link><target>Mason-Dixon line</target></link><space/>to wear white at home on a regular basis.</paragraph><paragraph>Numerals first appeared on the jersey sleeves in 1961. Over the years, there have been minor revisions to the sleeve stripes, the first occurring in 1968 (brown jerseys worn in early season) and 1969 (white and brown jerseys) when stripes began to be silk screened onto the sleeves and separated from each other to prevent color bleeding. However, the basic five-stripe sequence has remained intact (with the exception of the 1984 season). A recent revision was the addition of the initials &quot;AL&quot; to honor team owner<space/><link><target>Al Lerner</target></link><space/>who died in 2002; this was removed in 2013 upon Jimmy Haslam assuming ownership of the team.</paragraph><paragraph>Orange pants with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence were worn from 1975 to 1983 and become symbolic of the &quot;Kardiac Kids&quot; era. The orange pants were worn again occasionally in 2003 and 2004.</paragraph><paragraph>Other than the helmet, the uniform was completely redesigned for the 1984 season. New striping patterns appeared on the white jerseys, brown jerseys and pants. Solid brown socks were worn with brown jerseys and solid orange socks were worn with white jerseys. Brown numerals on the white jerseys were outlined in orange. White numerals on the brown jerseys were double outlined in brown and orange. (Orange numerals double outlined in brown and white appeared briefly on the brown jerseys in one pre-season game.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://news.google.com/newspapers?id</arg><arg name="title">Browns' Home Jerseys Will Be Modified</arg><arg name="newspaper">Youngstown Vindicator</arg><arg name="date">August 8, 1984</arg><arg name="accessdate">December 30, 2010</arg></template></extension>) However, this particular uniform set was not popular with the fans, and in 1985 the uniform was returned to a look similar to the original design. It remained that way until 1995.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1999, the expansion Browns adopted the traditional design with two exceptions: 1.) Jersey-sleeve numbers were moved to the shoulders, and 2.) The orange-brown-orange pants stripes were significantly widened.</paragraph><paragraph>Experimentation with the uniform design began in 2002. An alternate orange jersey was introduced that season as the NFL encouraged teams to adopt a third jersey, and a major design change was made when solid brown socks appeared for the first time since 1984 and were used with white, brown and orange jerseys. Other than 1984, striped socks (matching the jersey stripes) had been a signature design element in the team's traditional uniform. The white striped socks appeared occasionally with the white jerseys in 20032005 and 2007.</paragraph><paragraph>Experimentation continued in 2003 and 2004 when the traditional orange-brown-orange stripes on the white pants were replaced by two variations of a brown-orange-brown sequence, one in which the stripes were joined (worn with white jerseys) and the other in which they were separated by white (worn with brown jerseys). The joined sequence was used exclusively with both jerseys in 2005. In 2006, the traditional orange-brown-orange sequence returned.</paragraph><paragraph>Additionally in 2006, the team reverted to an older uniform style, featuring gray face masks; the original stripe pattern on the brown jersey sleeves (The white jersey has had that sleeve stripe pattern on a consistent basis since the 1985 season.) and the older, darker shade of brown.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.cleveland.com/browns/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1143967223212420.xml&amp;coll=2&amp;thispage=3<template><target>Dead link</target><arg name="date">December 2010</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The Browns wore brown pants for the first time in team history on August 18, 2008, preseason game against the<space/><link><target>New York Giants</target></link>.
