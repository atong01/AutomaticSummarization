In 1969, American club DJ<space/><link><target>Francis Grasso</target></link><space/>popularized beatmatching at<space/><link><target>New York</target></link>'s Sanctuary nightclub. Beatmatching is the technique of creating seamless transitions between records with<space/><italics>matching</italics><space/><italics>beats</italics>, or tempos. Grasso also developed<space/><link><target>slip-cueing</target><part>slip-cuing</part></link>, the technique of holding a record still while the turntable is revolving underneath, releasing it at the desired moment to create a sudden transition from the previous record. (This technique had long been used in radio.)</paragraph><paragraph>By 1968, the number of dance clubs started to decline; most American clubs either closed or were transformed into clubs featuring live bands.

Unlike many late-1960s clubs, which featured live bands, discothques used the DJ's selection and mixing of records as the entertainment.

Lewis introduced the Disco Bible (later renamed Disco Beats), which published hit disco songs listed by beats per minute (tempo), as well as by either artist or song title. Billboard ran an article on the new publication, and it went national relatively quickly. The list made it easier for beginning DJs to learn how to create seamless transitions between songs without dancers having to change their rhythm on the dance floor. Today, DJs can find the beats per minute of songs in the BPM List.</paragraph><heading level='3'>1980s</heading><paragraph>In 1981, the cable television network<space/><link><target>MTV</target></link><space/>was launched, originally devoted to music videos, especially popular rock music. The term &quot;<link><target>video jockey</target></link>&quot;, or VJ, was used to describe the fresh-faced youth who introduced the music videos. In 1982, the demise of disco in the mainstream by the summer of 1982 forced many nightclubs to either close or change entertainment styles, such as by providing MTV-style video dancing or live bands. Released in 1982, the song &quot;Planet Rock&quot; by DJ<space/><link><target>Afrika Bambaataa</target></link><space/>was the first hip-hop song to feature<space/><link><target>synthesizer</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

This event is often seen as the &quot;Big Bang&quot; of the<space/><link><target>digital audio</target></link><space/>revolution.</paragraph><paragraph>In the early 1980s, NYC disco DJ<space/><link><target>Larry Levan</target></link>, known for his electric mixes, gained a cult following, and the<space/><link><target>Paradise Garage</target></link>, the nightclub at which he spun, became the prototype for the modern dance club where the music and the DJ were showcased. Around the same time, the disco-influenced electronic style of dance music called<space/><link><target>house music</target></link><space/>emerged in Chicago. The name was derived from the<space/><link><target>Warehouse Club</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Chicago</target></link>, where resident DJ<space/><link><target>Frankie Knuckles</target></link><space/>mixed old disco classics and Eurosynth pop. House music is essentially disco music with electronic drum machine beats. The common element of most house music is a 4/4 beat generated by a<space/><link><target>drum machine</target></link><space/>or other electronic means (such as a sampler), together with a solid (usually also electronically generated) synth<space/><link><target>bassline</target></link>. In 1983,<space/><link><target>Jesse Saunders</target></link><space/>released what some consider the first house music track, &quot;On &amp; On.&quot; The mid-1980s also saw the emergence of<space/><link><target>New York house</target><part>New York Garage</part></link>, a house music hybrid that was inspired by Levan's style and sometimes eschewed the accentuated high-hats of the<space/><link><target>Chicago house</target></link><space/>sound.</paragraph><paragraph>During the mid-1980s,<space/><link><target>techno music</target></link><space/>emerged from the<space/><link><target>Detroit</target></link><space/>club scene. Being geographically located between Chicago and New York, Detroit techno artists combined elements of Chicago house and New York garage along with European imports. Techno distanced itself from disco's roots by becoming almost purely electronic with synthesized beats. In 1985, the Winter Music Conference started in<space/><link><target>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</target><part>Fort Lauderdale</part></link><space/>Florida and became the premier electronic music conference for dance music disc jockeys.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1985, TRAX Dance Music Guide was launched by<space/><link><target>American Record Pool</target></link><space/>in Beverly Hills. It was the first national DJ-published music magazine, created on the<space/><link><target>Macintosh</target></link><space/>computer using extensive music market research and early desktop publishing tools. In 1986, &quot;<link><target>Walk This Way</target></link>&quot;, a rap/rock collaboration by<space/><link><target>Run DMC</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Aerosmith</target></link>, became the first hip-hop song to reach the Top 10 on the<space/><link><target>Billboard Hot 100</target><part>''Billboard'' Hot 100</part></link>. This song was the first exposure of hip-hop music, as well as the concept of the disc jockey as band member and artist, to many mainstream audiences. In 1988,<space/><italics>DJ Times</italics><space/>magazine was first published. It was the first US-based magazine specifically geared toward the professional mobile and club DJ.</paragraph><heading level='3'>1990s</heading><paragraph>During the early 1990s, the rave scene built on the<space/><link><target>acid house</target></link><space/>scene. The rave scene changed dance music, the image of DJs, and the nature of promoting. The innovative marketing surrounding the rave scene created the first<space/><link><target>superstar</target></link><space/>DJs who established marketable &quot;brands&quot; around their names and sound. Some of these celebrity DJs toured around the world and were able to branch out into other music-related activities. During the early 1990s, the Compact Disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity, but gramophone records continued to be made (although in very limited quantities) into the 21st centuryparticularly for club DJs and for local acts recording on small regional labels.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1991,<space/><italics>Mobile Beat</italics><space/>magazine, geared specifically toward mobile DJs, began publishing. In 1992, the<space/><link><target>Moving Picture Experts Group</target></link><space/>released the MPEG-1 standard, designed to produce reasonable sound at low bit rates. The lossy compression scheme MPEG-1 Layer-3, popularly known as<space/><link><target>MP3</target></link>, later revolutionized the digital music domain. In 1993, the first<space/><link><target>internet</target></link><space/>&quot;radio station&quot;, Internet Talk Radio, was developed by<space/><link><target>Carl Malamud</target></link>. Because the audio was relayed over the internet, it was possible to access internet radio stations from anywhere in the world.

While it would take sometime for this novel concept to catch on with the &quot;die hard Vinyl DJs&quot;, This would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the &quot;CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit&quot;, to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1999,<space/><link><target>Shawn Fanning</target></link><space/>released<space/><link><target>Napster</target></link>, the first of the massively popular<space/><link><target>peer-to-peer file sharing</target></link><space/>systems. During this period, the AVLA (Audio Video Licensing Agency) of Canada announced an MP3 DJing license, administered by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. This meant that DJs could apply for a license giving them the right to perform publicly using music stored on a hard drive, instead of having to cart their whole CD collections around to their gigs.</paragraph><heading level='3'>2000s</heading><paragraph>At the start of the new century, the introduction of advances in technology made it possible for new sounds to be developed.
