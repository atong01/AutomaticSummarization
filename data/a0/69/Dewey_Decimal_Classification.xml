Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit<space/><link><target>Arabic numerals</target></link><space/>for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, on the basis of its subject. The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves.<extension extension_name='ref' group="notes">Consider as an example a book on the network protocol IPv6.

This would have required some changes to the classification, which was under copyright.

Dewey did not agree, however, to allow the International Institute of Bibliography to later create an English version of the resulting classification, considering that a violation of their agreement, as well as a violation of Dewey's copyright.

Main divisions include philosophy, social sciences, science, technology, and history. The scheme is made up of ten classes, each divided into ten divisions, each having ten sections. The system's notation uses Arabic numbers, with three whole numbers making up the main classes and sub-classes and decimals creating further divisions. The classification structure is<space/><link><target>hierarchical</target></link><space/>and the notation follows the same hierarchy. Libraries not needing the full level of detail of the classification can trim right-most decimal digits from the class number to obtain a more general classification.<extension extension_name='ref'>Chan (2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;326331</extension><space/>For example:</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem>500 Natural sciences and mathematics<list type='ident'><listitem>510 Mathematics<list type='ident'><listitem>516 Geometry<list type='ident'><listitem>516.3 Analytic geometries<list type='ident'><listitem>516.37 Metric differential geometries<list type='ident'><listitem>516.375 Finsler Geometry</listitem></list></listitem></list></listitem></list></listitem></list></listitem></list></listitem></list><paragraph>The classification was originally enumerative, meaning that it listed all of the classes explicitly in the schedules. Over time it added some aspects of a<space/><link><target>faceted classification</target></link><space/>scheme, allowing classifiers to construct a number by combining a class number for a topic with an entry from a separate table. Tables cover commonly used elements such as geographical and temporal aspects, language, and bibliographic forms. For example, a class number could be constructed using 330 for economics + .9 for geographic treatment + .04 for Europe to create the class 330.94 European economy. Or one could combine the class 973 for United States + .05 for<space/><link><target>periodical</target></link><space/>publications on the topic to arrive at the number 973.05 for periodicals concerning the United States generally. The classification also makes use of mnemonics in some areas, such that the number 5 represents the country Italy in classification numbers like 945 (history of Italy), 450 (Italian language), 195 (Italian philosophy). The combination of faceting and mnemonics makes the classification<space/><italics>synthetic</italics><space/>in nature, with meaning built into parts of the classification number.<extension extension_name='ref'>Chan (2007), p. 331</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The Dewey Decimal Classification has a number for all subjects, including fiction, although many libraries create a separate fiction section shelved by alphabetical order of the author's surname. Each assigned number consists of two parts: a class number (from the Dewey system) and a book number, which &quot;prevents confusion of different books on the same subject.&quot;<space/><extension extension_name='ref' name="DDC1876"></extension><space/>A common form of the book number is called a<space/><link><target>Cutter number</target></link>, which represents the author and distinguishes the book from other books on the same topic.<extension extension_name='ref'>Chan (2007), p. 333-362</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Classes</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>List of Dewey Decimal classes</arg></template>(From DDC 23<extension extension_name='ref' name="DDC23intro"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Introduction to the Dewey Decimal Classification<space/></arg><arg name="author"><space/>OCLC<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.oclc.org/dewey/versions/print.en.html</arg><arg name="accessdate">8 December 2013</arg></template></extension>)</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>List of Dewey Decimal classes#Class 000 &amp;ndash; Computer science, information &amp; general works</target><part>000</part></link><space/>General works, Computer science and Information</listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Dewey Decimal classes#Class 100 &amp;ndash; Philosophy and psychology</target><part>100</part></link><space/>Philosophy and psychology</listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Dewey Decimal classes#Class 200 &amp;ndash; Religion</target><part>200</part></link><space/>Religion</listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Dewey Decimal classes#Class 300 &amp;ndash; Social sciences</target><part>300</part></link><space/>Social sciences</listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Dewey Decimal classes#Class 400 &amp;ndash; Language</target><part>400</part></link><space/>Language</listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Dewey Decimal classes#Class 500 &amp;ndash; Science</target><part>500</part></link><space/>Pure Science</listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Dewey Decimal classes#Class 600 &amp;ndash; Technology</target><part>600</part></link><space/>Technology</listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Dewey Decimal classes#Class 700 &amp;ndash; Arts &amp; Recreation</target><part>700</part></link><space/>Arts &amp; recreation</listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Dewey Decimal classes#Class 800 &amp;ndash; Literature</target><part>800</part></link><space/>Literature</listitem><listitem><link><target>List of Dewey Decimal classes#Class 900 &amp;ndash; History &amp; geography</target><part>900</part></link><space/>History &amp; geography</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Tables</heading><paragraph>(From DDC 23<extension extension_name='ref' name="DDC23intro"></extension>)</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>T1 Standard Subdivisions</listitem><listitem>T2 Geographic Areas, Historical Periods, Biography</listitem><listitem>T3 Subdivisions for the Arts, for Individual Literatures, for Specific Literary Forms<list type='bullet'><listitem>T3A Subdivisions for Works by or about Individual Authors</listitem><listitem>T3B Subdivisions for Works by or about More than One Author</listitem><listitem>T3C Notation to Be Added Where Instructed in Table 3B, 700.4, 791.4, 808809</listitem></list></listitem><listitem>T4 Subdivisions of Individual Languages and Language Families</listitem><listitem>T5 Ethnic and National Groups</listitem><listitem>T6 Languages</listitem></list><heading level='3'>&quot;Relativ Index&quot;</heading><preblock><preline>The &quot;Relativ Index&quot;<template><target>sic</target></template><space/>is an alphabetical index to the classification, for use both by classifiers but also by library users when seeking books by topic. The index was &quot;relative&quot; because the index entries pointed to the class numbers, not to the page numbers of the printed classification schedule.
