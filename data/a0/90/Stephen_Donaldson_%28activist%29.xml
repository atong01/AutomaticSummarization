Contemplating that question, I organized an impromptu workshop on [[bisexuality]] and was astonished to find 130 [[Quakers]], one of every ten General Conference attendees, overflowing into five meeting rooms and an auditorium for two days of lively discussion based more on experience than on abstract theories.

Bill Schaffer was advising me that the civil suit would be considerably handicapped if I did not go through with prosecution of the inmates.

I felt that my masculinity was at stake, that I had to regain control of the situation or go under trying. As the [[Bruce Springsteen]] song goes, "Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode...." These feelings are directly related to my D.C. experience, the subconscious emotions that are dredged up when I feel completely vulnerable. In this state I went out with a gun and violently confronted the government, though without injuring anyone. I knew I would be going back to jail for it, and this was probably a major factor as well in determining my action. It was in jail that I felt I knew the rules and could find security, a means of coping with my helplessness. The jail Punk in me was looking for a way home, even as the man in me was striking back, by force of arms assuming control of the situation, returning the government some of the rape it had given me.

Having accomplished my objective, I surrendered to the police and was led away once more to the darkness on the edge of society, to the "[[darkness on the edge of town]]" that Springsteen sings about.<ref name">punks-song /></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Less than a year into his term, Donaldson had been &quot;raped once, assaulted once, and claimed by five different men&quot; in jail and was fearing his upcoming transfer to his first<space/><link><target>Incarceration in the United States#Security levels</target><part>maximum security prison</part></link>,<extension extension_name='ref' name="punks-song"></extension><space/>where he went on to spend over a year in<space/><link><target>protective custody</target></link>, which he described as &quot;a solitary retreat&quot; in a letter to<space/><link><target>Bo Lozoff</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="lozoff"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Lozoff
