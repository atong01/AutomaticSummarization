In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia.

After both of the World Wars, the use of red bricks was popular. In the 1960s, cream bricks became popular, and in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular. Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with corrugated iron or clay tiles (usually red clay). Since then, cement tiles and colourbond corrugated (and other types of) iron have also become popular. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s, the majority of houses were of &quot;double brick&quot; construction upon &quot;dwarf wall&quot; foundations. Progressively since then there has been a move to &quot;<link><target>brick veneer</target></link>&quot; over a timber frame on a concrete slab foundation, and more recently, over a steel frame. In addition to this, a significant factor in Adelaide's suburban history is the role of the<space/><link><target>South Australian Housing Trust</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 1960s and 1970s, many of the older houses were demolished and replaced by &quot;home units&quot; a group of three-to-five single-storey dwellings on a common title with shared access.

The style was brought to South Australia by George Gavin Lawson.
