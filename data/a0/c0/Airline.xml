Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation, indeed the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel. Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining<space/><link><target>frequent flyer</target></link><space/>loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, from almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put long distance intercity<space/><link><target>railroad</target></link><space/>travel and bus lines under pressure, with most of the latter having withered away, whilst the former is still protected under<space/><link><target>nationalization</target></link><space/>through the continuing existence of<space/><link><target>Amtrak</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>By the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.</paragraph><paragraph>Toward the end of the century, a new style of<space/><link><target>low-cost carrier</target><part>low cost airline</part></link><space/>emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price.<space/><link><target>Southwest Airlines</target></link>,<space/><link><target>JetBlue</target></link>,<space/><link><target>AirTran Airways</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Skybus Airlines</target></link><space/>and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called &quot;legacy airlines&quot;, as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries. Their commercial viability represented a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers. However, of these,<space/><link><target>ATA Airlines</target><part>ATA</part></link><space/>and Skybus have since ceased operations.</paragraph><paragraph>Increasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and<space/><link><target>off spin</target><part>spun off</part></link><space/>by newly created and internally led management companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control. Among some of these<space/><link><target>holding company</target><part>holding companies</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>parent company</target><part>parent companies</part></link><space/>which are relatively well known, are the<space/><link><target>UAL Corporation</target></link>, along with the<space/><link><target>AMR Corporation</target></link>, among a long<space/><link><target>list of airline holding companies</target></link><space/>sometime recognized worldwide.

In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.<link><target>File:Cyprus airways a330.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Cyprus Airways</target></link>, the now defunct national airline of Cyprus</part></link>The entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.</paragraph><paragraph>As a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines.

The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized<space/><link><target>yield management</target></link><space/>systems.</paragraph><paragraph>Because of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability, airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler. Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments.</paragraph><paragraph>Most airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of<space/><link><target>price discrimination</target></link>, to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day.

Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for A$200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to pay A$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the $200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $1300?

In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer pre-announced and simplified price structure, and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.</paragraph><paragraph>Computers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for &quot;no-shows,&quot; but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with<space/><link><target>overbooking</target></link><space/>on high demand flights can help reduce this figure.

Thus all but a small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.</paragraph><paragraph>Moreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the original country.</paragraph><paragraph>Analysis of the 19921996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2-3.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10-13%, handling companies 11-14%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%.

Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline.</paragraph><paragraph>If a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper.

An early example of this was Japan Airlines' (JAL) codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the 1960s on<space/><link><target>Tokyo</target></link><link><target>Moscow</target></link><space/>flights; Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. Another example was the<space/><link><target>Austrian Airlines</target><part>Austrian</part></link><link><target>Sabena</target></link><space/>partnership on the<space/><link><target>Vienna</target></link><link><target>Brussels</target></link><link><target>New York City</target><part>New York</part></link>/JFK route during the late '60s, using a Sabena<space/><link><target>Boeing 707</target></link><space/>with Austrian<space/><link><target>Aircraft livery</target><part>livery</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Since airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as &quot;show me flights from Chicago to Dsseldorf&quot;), an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago<link><target>Dsseldorf</target></link><space/>flight. The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to Dsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms to increase sales.</paragraph><paragraph>A more recent development is the<space/><link><target>airline alliance</target></link>, which became prevalent in the late 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. Alliances of airlines such as<space/><link><target>Star Alliance</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Oneworld</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>SkyTeam</target></link><space/>coordinate their passenger service programs (such as lounges and<space/><link><target>frequent-flyer program</target><trail>s</trail></link>), offer special interline tickets, and often engage in extensive codesharing (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinationssometimes including cross-equity arrangementsin which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was<space/><link><target>KLM</target></link>, who partnered with<space/><link><target>Northwest Airlines</target></link>. Both airlines later entered the SkyTeam alliance after the<space/><link><target>Air France-KLM</target><part>fusion of KLM and Air France</part></link><space/>in 2004.</paragraph><paragraph>Often the companies combine<space/><link><target>Information technology</target><part>IT</part></link><space/>operations, or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Fuel hedging</heading><paragraph><template><target>Unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">November 2010</arg></template><link><target>File:Jetfuel.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Average jet fuel prices per gallon for major United States airlines.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Southwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between 1999 and the early 2000s due to its fuel hedging policy.

In the 1950s and 1960s, annual growth rates of 15% or more were common. Annual growth of 5-6% persisted through the 1980s and 1990s<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2007</arg></template>. Growth rates are not consistent in all regions, but countries with a de-regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom. This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The U.S., Australia, Canada,<space/><link><target>Japan</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Brazil</target></link>,<space/><link><target>India</target></link><space/>and other markets exhibit this trend. The industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance. Four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement. But profitability even in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2-3% net profit after interest and tax. In times of profit, airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand. Since 1980, the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse.<space/><link><target>Warren Buffett</target></link><space/>once said that despite all the money that has been invested in all airlines, the net profit is less than zero.

Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, most consolidation takes place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have merged, been taken over, or gone out of business since deregulation in 1978. Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><paragraph><template><target>Columns-list</target><arg>2</arg><arg>
