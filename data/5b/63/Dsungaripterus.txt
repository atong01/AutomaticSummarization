'''''Dsungaripterus''''' was a [[genus]] of [[pterosaur]], with an average wingspan of {{convert|3|m|ft}}.<ref name=EoDP>{{cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= 105|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}}</ref> It lived during the [[Early Cretaceous]], in China, where the first fossil was found in the [[Junggar Basin]].

''Dsungaripterus'' was in 1964 named by [[Yang Zhongjian]]. The genus name combines a reference to the Junggar Basin with a Latinized Greek ''pteron'', "wing". The [[type species]] is ''Dsungaripterus weii'', the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] honouring paleontologist C.M. Wei of the Palaeontological Division, Institute of Science, Bureau of Petroleum of [[Sinkiang]]. The [[holotype]] is '''IVPP No. V-2776''', a partial skull and skeleton. From 1973 more material has been found including almost complete skulls.

In 1980 [[Peter Galton]] renamed ''Pterodactylus brancai'' (Reck 1931), a form from a late Jurassic African formation, into ''Dsungaripterus brancai'', but the identification is now commonly rejected. In 1982 [[Natasha Bakhurina]] named a new species, ''Dsungaripterus parvus'', based on a smaller skeleton from [[Mongolia]]. Later this was renamed into "Phobetor", a preoccupied name, and in 2009 concluded to be identical to ''[[Noripterus]]''. In 2002 a ''Dsungaripterus'' wing finger phalanx was reported from [[Korea]].

==Appearance==
''Dsungaripterus weii'' had a wing span of 3 to 3.5 metres (9.8-11.5&nbsp;ft). Its skull, forty to fifty centimetres long, bore a low bone crest that ran down from the base of the skull to halfway to the beak. ''Dsungaripterus'''s head and neck were together almost a meter long. Its most notable feature are its long, narrow, upcurved jaws with a pointed tip, making the animal look like a pair of flying tweezers. It had no teeth in the front part of its jaws, which were probably used to remove shellfish and worms from cracks in rocks or/and the sandy, muddy beaches it inhabited. It had knobbly flat teeth more to the back of the jaw that were well suited for crushing the armor of shellfish.<ref name=EoDP/>
