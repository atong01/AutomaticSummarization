For this reason they resolved to seek the episcopal succession. At that time a colony of Waldenses lived on the Bohemian border. The synod was satisfied that these people possessed the regular authenticated episcopal succession. Their chief was Stephen. To him the Brethren sent a deputation consisting of three priests or presbyters. These were Michael Bradacius, a priest of the Roman Catholic, and a priest of the Waldensian Church, whose names have not been preserved. They were instructed to inquire into the validity of the Waldensian episcopate. Stephen received the deputies with great kindness, assembled his assistant bishops, and entered into a minute account of the episcopacy which they had. Fully satisfied with what they lad learned the deputies requested to be consecrated bishops. This request Bishop Stephen and his assistants fulfilled in a solemn convocation of the Waldensian Church. The new bishops immediately returned to the barony of Lititz where another synod was convened and three of the brethren were set apart for the work of the ministry, by the laying on of hands. In spite of the terrible persecutions suffered by the Ancient Church, this episcopate was most wonderfully preserved.</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Schaff2007"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Schaff</arg><arg name="first">Philip</arg><arg name="title">The Creeds of Christendom: History of the Creeds – Volume I, Part II</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">11 November 2012</arg><arg name="date">30 November 2007</arg><arg name="publisher">Cosimo, Inc.</arg><arg name="isbn">9781602068902</arg><arg name="page">567</arg><arg name="quote">they sought regular ordination from a Waldensian bishop, Stephen of Austria, who was reported to have been ordained by a Roman bishop in 1434, and who afterwards suffered martyrdom in Vienna.</arg></template></extension><space/>These three consecrated bishops returned to Lititz and then ordained other Moravians, thereby preserving the historic episcopate.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Stocker1918"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Denominations that reject apostolic succession</heading><paragraph>Some Nonconformist Protestants, particularly those in the Calvinist tradition, deny the doctrine of apostolic succession, believing that it is neither taught in Scripture nor necessary for Christian teaching, life, and practice.

The divine call confers the office, not ordination. Ordination is the public declaration of the man's fitness for office and the public recognition or confirmation of the legitimacy of the call that was extended and accepted. Although it is still our custom to lay on hands during the right of ordination, the laying on of hands is not commanded by God and is not necessary.<ref name">WELS-DC>{{cite web |url</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Confessional Lutheran churches teach:<extension extension_name='ref' name="WELS-DCM"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID</arg><arg name="archiveurl">http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080629231826/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID</arg><arg name="archivedate">29 June 2008<space/></arg><arg name="work">WELS Topical Q&A<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Definition of Church and Ministry - Apostolic Sucession<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">23 Sep 2015<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>"Since the first ordained Lutheran pastors were ordained by pastors who had been ordained in the Roman Catholic church and so on through the generations, we could claim historic succession as plausibly as can Roman Catholic priests if it simply were dependent on being ordained in a line of pastors. But for the historic succession to be considered legitimate by Rome or the Othodox or Anglicans it must be mediated through the correct bishops. Rome does not recognize as legitimate even the ordinations done by bishops in historic succession as in the Church of Sweden and the Church of England. Only through bishops connected to the pope is the historic succession legitimate in their eyes."</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Lutheran apologists state that there are a number of major problems with the Roman Catholic view on apostolic succession:<extension extension_name='ref' name="WELS-DCM"></extension></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>There is no evidence the popes have historic succession to Peter other than their own claim that it is so.</listitem><listitem>The bishops claiming succession have not preserved apostolic doctrine, therefore they have no meaningful apostolic succession.</listitem><listitem>There is no evidence that the apostles were ordained by laying on of hands when they entered their office.</listitem><listitem>There is no evidence in Scripture that the office must be conveyed by laying on of hands and no command that it must be by a special class of bishops.</listitem></list><paragraph>For example, the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, a Confessional Lutheran church body, holds that it's their custom that ordination of pastors is by other pastors, and that neither the Bible nor the Lutheran confessions make this the only divinely mandated way of entering the pastoral ministry.
