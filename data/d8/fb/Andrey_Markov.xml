In 1905, he was appointed merited professor and was granted the right to retire, which he did immediately.

Markov refused to accept this decree, and he wrote an explanation in which he declined to be an &quot;agent of the governance&quot;. Markov was removed from further teaching duties at St. Petersburg University, and hence he decided to retire from the university.</paragraph><paragraph>Markov was an<space/><link><target>atheist</target></link>.
