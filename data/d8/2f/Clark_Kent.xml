From his first introduction in 1938 to the mid-1980s, &quot;Clark Kent&quot; was seen mostly as a disguise for Superman, enabling him to mix with ordinary people. This was the view in most comics and other media such as movie serials and TV (e.g., in<space/><italics><link><target>Atom Man vs. Superman</target></link></italics><space/>starring<space/><link><target>Kirk Alyn</target></link><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>Adventures of Superman (TV series)</target><part>The Adventures of Superman</part></link></italics><space/>starring<space/><link><target>George Reeves</target></link>) and radio. In 1986, during<space/><link><target>John Byrne (comics)</target><part>John Byrne</part></link>'s revamping of the character, Clark Kent became more emphasized. Different takes persist in the present.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Overview</heading><paragraph>As Superman's<space/><link><target>alter ego</target></link>, the personality, concept, and name of Clark Kent have become ingrained in popular culture as well, becoming synonymous with<space/><link><target>secret identity</target><part>secret identities</part></link><space/>and innocuous fronts for ulterior motives and activities. In 1992, Superman co-creator Joe Shuster told the<space/><italics>Toronto Star</italics><space/>that the name derived from 1930s cinematic leading men<space/><link><target>Clark Gable</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Kent Taylor</target></link>, but the persona from bespectacled silent film comic<space/><link><target>Harold Lloyd</target></link><space/>and himself.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://davidschutz.tripod.com/superman3.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">When Superman Worked at The Star<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Davidschutz.tripod.com<space/></arg><arg name="date">April 26, 1992<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">December 25, 2010</arg></template></extension><space/>Another, perhaps more likely possibility, is that Jerry Siegel pulled from his own love of pulp heroes<space/><link><target>Doc Savage</target><part>Doc Clark Savage</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>The Shadow</target></link><space/>alias Kent Allard.

Clark thus acted as little more than a front for Superman's activities. Although his name and history were taken from his early life with his adoptive Earth parents, everything about Clark was staged for the benefit of his alternate identity: as a reporter for the<space/><italics><link><target>Daily Planet</target></link></italics>, he receives late-breaking news before the general public, has a plausible reason to be present at crime scenes, and need not strictly account for his whereabouts as long as he makes his story deadlines. He sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his Superman responsibilitiesbringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little guy. He believes that everybody has the right to know what is going on in the world, regardless of who is involved.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.batman-superman.com/superman/cmp/index.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">The New Batman/Superman Adventures<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">[[Warner Bros.]]</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>To deflect suspicion that he is Superman, Clark Kent adopted a largely passive and introverted personality with conservative mannerisms, a higher-pitched voice, and a slight slouch. This personality is typically described as &quot;mild-mannered,&quot; perhaps most famously by the opening narration of<space/><link><target>Max Fleischer</target></link>'s<space/><link><target>Superman (1940s cartoons)</target><part>''Superman'' animated theatrical shorts</part></link>. These traits extended into Clark's wardrobe, which typically consists of a bland-colored business suit, a red necktie, black-rimmed glasses (which in<space/><link><target>Pre-Crisis</target></link><space/>stories had lenses of Kryptonian material that would not be damaged when he fired his<space/><link><target>Energy blasts</target><part>heat vision</part></link><space/>through them), combed-back hair, and occasionally a<space/><link><target>Fedora (hat)</target><part>fedora</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Fellow reporter<space/><link><target>Lois Lane</target></link><space/>became the object of Clark's/Superman's romantic affection.

Originally during his appearances in<space/><italics><link><target>Action Comics</target></link></italics><space/>and later in his own magazine, the Man of Steel would strip to his costume and stand revealed as Superman, often with the transformation having already been completed. But within a short time, Joe Shuster and his ghost artists began depicting Clark Kent ripping open his shirt to reveal the &quot;S&quot; insignia on his chestan image that became so iconic that other superheroes, during the Golden Age and later periods, would copy the same type of change during transformations.</paragraph><paragraph>In the Fleischer theatrical cartoons released by Paramount, the mild-mannered reporter often ducked into a telephone booth or stockroom to make the transformation. Since the shorts were produced during the rise of<space/><link><target>film noir</target></link><space/>in cinema, the change was usually represented as a stylized sequence: Clark Kent's silhouette is clearly seen behind a closed door's pebble glass window (or a shadow thrown across a wall) as he strips to his Superman costume. Then, the superhero emerges having transformed from his meek disguise to his true self. In the comic books and in the George Reeves television series, he favors the<space/><italics>Daily Planet</italics><template><target>'</target></template>s storeroom for his changes of identities (the heroic change between identities within the storeroom is almost always seen in the comics, but never viewed in the Reeves series).</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>CBS</target></link><space/>Saturday morning series<space/><italics><link><target>The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)</target><part>The New Adventures of Superman</part></link></italics><space/>produced by Filmation Studiosas well as<space/><italics><link><target>The Adventures of Superboy (TV series)</target><part>The Adventures of Superboy</part></link></italics><space/>from the same animation housefeatured the iconic &quot;shirt rip&quot; to reveal the &quot;S&quot; or Clark Kent removing his unbuttoned white dress shirt in a secluded spot, usually thanks to stock animation which was reused over dozens of episodes, to reveal his costume underneath while uttering his famed line &quot;This is a job for<space/><bold>Superman!</bold>&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>As a dramatic plot device, Clark often has to quickly improvise in order to find a way to change unnoticed. For example, in<space/><italics>Superman</italics><space/>(1978), Clark, unable to use a newer, open-kiosk pay phone (and getting a nice laugh from the theater audience), runs down the street and rips open his shirt to reveal his costume underneath. He quickly enters a revolving door, spinning through it at incredible speed while changing clothes. Thus made invisible, he appears to have entered the building as Clark Kent and exited seconds later as Superman. Later in the film, when the need to change is more urgent (as he believes the city is about to be poisoned by Lex Luthor), he simply jumps out a window of the Daily Planet offices, changing at super-speed as he falls (the film merely shows the falling Kent blurring into a falling Superman) and flies off. Further films in the series continued this tradition, with Clark blurring into Superman, changing at super-speed while he runs.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><italics>Lois &amp; Clark,</italics><space/>Clark's usual method of changing was to either &quot;suddenly&quot; remember something urgent that required his immediate attention or leave the room/area under the pretense of contacting a source, summoning the police, heading to a breaking story's location, etc. The change would then frequently occur off-screen, although the shirt-rip reveal was a prominently used move well-associated with the show. Clark also developed a method of rapidly spinning into his costume at super speed which became a trademark change, especially during the third and fourth seasons of the series, and extremely popular with the show's fans.</paragraph><paragraph>In one scene of<space/><italics><link><target>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</target></link></italics>, Clark becomes aware of an emergency while talking with<space/><link><target>Bruce Wayne</target></link><space/>and, in the next<space/><link><target>panel (comics)</target><part>panel</part></link>, he has flown out of his Kent clothing and glasses so quickly that they have had no time to fall.</paragraph><paragraph>In Season 8 of<space/><italics>Smallville,</italics><space/>Clark begins to show a bit more of his double identity.

This is made explicit by Clark himself in<space/><italics>Superman</italics><space/>(vol. 2) #53, when following his revelation to Lois of his role as Superman (<italics>Action Comics</italics><space/>#662), he states: &quot;I'm Clark, the man you love. Superman is the creation&amp;nbsp; you named me, Lois.&quot; In pre-Crisis continuity, Kal-El was already a toddler before leaving Krypton, and retained memories of that childhood that later resurfaced, while, in Post-<italics>Crisis</italics><space/>continuity, he was sent to Earth pre-natally in a &quot;birthing matrix&quot; (more recently<space/><link><target>retcon</target><trail>ned</trail></link><space/>as an infant) and raised entirely by the Kents. As a result of their rearing, Kal-El grows up to think of himself as Clark Kent, completely unaware of his alien heritage until he was well into adulthood (the fact that the Kents found him sometime just after the<space/><link><target>Cold War</target></link><space/>meant that the Kents assumed the rocket they found him in was from an Earth-based space program&amp;nbsp; possibly that of<space/><link><target>Communist</target></link><space/>Russia&amp;nbsp; and that Clark had superhuman abilities because he was either a metahuman or some kind of genetic experiment). Although the morals instilled in him by the Kents have motivated Kal-El to use his abilities to help others, he developed the Superman persona to protect his Clark Kent identity. In the<space/><italics><link><target>Superman: The Animated Series</target></link></italics><space/>episode &quot;The Late Mr. Kent&quot;, wherein Clark Kent is presumed dead, Superman expresses frustration at the idea of not being Clark and having to be someone else instead (&quot;I<space/><italics>am</italics><space/>Clark.

In a previous episode, the third part of the &quot;Last Son of Krypton&quot; arc, Jonathan &quot;Pa&quot; Kent assures his adoptive son that he will &quot;always be Clark Kent&quot; and that &quot;Superman just helps out every now and then.&quot; In the &quot;Tempus Fugitive&quot; episode of<space/><italics>Lois &amp; Clark</italics>, Clark attempts to persuade Lois that Superman doesn't define him: &quot;Superman is what I can do.

At the very end of the novel, where Superman stands poised to destroy the United Nations, Norman McCay makes him realise that, when he abandoned Clark Kent fifteen years ago after the murder of Lois Lane by the Joker and retreated into his Superman self, he lost this instinctive morality and thus the ability to be the hero Superman. With this knowledge and a pair of glasses given to him as a gift by Wonder Woman, 'Clark' regains his humanity, and sets out to become a hero again by re-fertilizing the irradiated fields of Kansas.

Lex would like to transcend his family background and be a better person than his father, but after multiple setbacks he slowly slips into evil, becoming convinced that only he can 'protect' the world from the perceived alien threats by taking control of it, regardless of the cost to others. In turn, Clark Kent has a slightly dark side with which he comes to grips over time, made even worse by his experiences with Red Kryptonite, which causes him to lose his morals and act solely on impulse while under its influence. In different ways to Luthor, Clark also does not have fully ideal relationship either with his adoptive father, Jonathan, nor with an A.I. based on Jor-El that was sent by the original to guide him, Jonathan occasionally having trouble relating to Clark while Jor-El's lack of his template's emotions causes him to treat Clark too harshly at times. The younger Luthor slightly envies Clark's 'clean-cut' and wholesome parents (who disapprove of Clark's friendship with Luthor), while Clark is impressed with Luthor's wealth while failing to understand some of the manipulations he carries out in his interactions with others. Even in his better days, Luthor is highly ambitious for power and wealth, at one time noting that he shares his name with<space/><link><target>Alexander the Great</target></link>.
