Following his military overthrow of<space/><link><target>Hissne Habr</target></link><space/>in December 1990, Dby won presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. The constitutional basis for the government is the 1996 constitution, under which the president was limited to two terms of office until Dby had that provision repealed in 2005. The president has the power to appoint the prime minister and the Council of State (or cabinet), and exercises considerable influence over appointments of judges, generals, provincial officials and heads of Chads parastatal firms. In cases of grave and immediate threat, the president, in consultation with the National Assembly President and Council of State, may declare a state of emergency. Most of the Dby's key advisors are members of the<space/><link><target>Zaghawa people</target><part>Zaghawa</part></link><space/>clan, although some southern and opposition personalities are represented in his government.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Legislative branch</heading><paragraph>According to the 1996 constitution, the<space/><link><target>National Assembly of Chad</target><part>National Assembly</part></link><space/>deputies are elected by universal suffrage for 4-year terms. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for spring 2002. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions as necessary and called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a president of the National Assembly every 2 years. Assembly deputies or members of the executive branch may introduce legislation; once passed by the Assembly, the president must take action to either sign or reject the law within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime ministers plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no-confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branchs program twice in one year, the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through the MPS party structure.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Judicial branch</heading><paragraph>Despite the constitutions guarantee of judicial independence from the executive branch, the president names most key judicial officials. The Supreme Court is made up of a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councilors chosen by the president and National Assembly; appointments are for life. The Constitutional Council, with nine judges elected to 9-year terms, has the power to review all legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption. The constitution recognizes customary and traditional law in locales where it is recognized and to the extent it does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality for all citizens.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Political parties and elections</heading><paragraph><template><target>Elect</target><arg>List of political parties in Chad</arg><arg>Elections in Chad</arg></template><template><target>Chadian presidential election, 2011</target></template><template><target>Chadian parliamentary election, 2011</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>International organization participation</heading><paragraph><link><target>Agency for the French-Speaking Community</target><part>ACCT</part></link>,<space/><link><target>African, Caribbean, and Pacific Group of States</target><part>ACP</part></link>,<space/><link><target>African Development Bank</target><part>AfDB</part></link>,<space/><link><target>African Union</target><part>AU</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Central African States Development Bank</target><part>BDEAC</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Monetary and Economic Community of Central Africa</target><part>CEMAC</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Food and Agriculture Organization</target><part>FAO</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Franc Zone</target><part>FZ</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Group of 77</target><part>G-77</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development</target><part>IBRD</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Civil Aviation Organization</target><part>ICAO</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Criminal Court</target><part>ICCt</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Confederation of Free Trade Unions</target><part>ICFTU</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement</target><part>ICRM</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Development Association</target><part>IDA</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Islamic Development Bank</target><part>IDB</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Fund for Agricultural Development</target><part>IFAD</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Finance Corporation</target><part>IFC</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</target><part>IFRCS</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Labour Organization</target><part>ILO</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Monetary Fund</target><part>IMF</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Criminal Police Organization</target><part>Interpol</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Olympic Committee</target><part>IOC</part></link>,<space/><link><target>International Telecommunication Union</target><part>ITU</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Multilateral Investment Geographic Agency</target><part>MIGA</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Non-Aligned Movement</target><part>NAM</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Organisation of Islamic Cooperation</target><part>OIC</part></link>,<space/><link><target>United Nations Operation in Burundi</target><part>ONUB</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</target><part>OPCW</part></link>,<space/><link><target>United Nations</target><part>UN</part></link>,<space/><link><target>United Nations Conference on Trade and Development</target><part>UNCTAD</part></link>,<space/><link><target>United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization</target><part>UNESCO</part></link>,<space/><link><target>United Nations Industrial Development Organization</target><part>UNIDO</part></link>,<space/><link><target>United Nations Operation in Cte d'Ivoire</target><part>UNOCI</part></link>,<space/><link><target>United Nations University</target><part>UPU</part></link>,<space/><link><target>World Confederation of Labour</target><part>WCL</part></link>,<space/><link><target>World Health Organization</target><part>WHO</part></link>,<space/><link><target>World Intellectual Property Organization</target><part>WIPO</part></link>,<space/><link><target>World Meteorological Organization</target><part>WMO</part></link>,<space/><link><target>World Tourism Organization</target><part>WToO</part></link>,<space/><link><target>World Trade Organization</target><part>WTrO</part></link></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Chad topics</target></template><template><target>Africa in topic</target><arg>Politics of</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Politics Of Chad</target></template><link><target>Category:Politics of Chad</target><part></part></link></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>pt:Chade#Poltica</target></link></paragraph></article>
