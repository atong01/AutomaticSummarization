'''Dolly Rebecca Parton''' (born January 19, 1946<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Rebecca Parton - The Beginning|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/dolly-rebecca-parton/|publisher=Dolly Parton Productions|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref>) is an American [[singer-songwriter]], actress, author, businesswoman, and humanitarian, known primarily for her work in [[country music]]. Her career began as a child performer on the Cas Walker<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly performs on Cas Walker Show - WIVK Radio|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/uncle-bill-owens-introduces-dolly-to-cas-walker/|publisher=Dolly Parton Productions|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref> radio show, then recording a few singles from the age of 13. Relocating to Nashville at age 18 in 1964, her first commercial successes were as a songwriter (her songs during this period were covered by numerous artists, including [[Bill Phillips (singer)|Bill Phillips]] and [[Kitty Wells]]). She rose to prominence in 1967 as a featured performer on singer [[Porter Wagoner]]'s weekly syndicated TV program; their first duet single, a cover of [[Tom Paxton]]'s "[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]", was a top-ten hit on the country singles chart and led to several successful albums before they ended their partnership in 1974. Moving towards mainstream pop music, her 1977 single "[[Here You Come Again]]" was a success on both the country and pop charts. A string of pop-country hits followed into the mid-1980s, the most successful being her 1980 hit "[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]" (from the [[9 to 5 (film)|film of the same name]]) and her 1983 duet with [[Kenny Rogers]] "[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]", both of which topped the U.S. pop and country singles charts. A pair of albums recorded with [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Emmylou Harris]] were among her later successes. In the late 1990s, she returned to classic country/[[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with a series of acclaimed recordings. Non-musical ventures include [[Dollywood]], a theme park in Pigeon Forge in the [[Smoky Mountains]] of Tennessee, and her efforts on behalf of childhood literacy, particularly her Imagination Library, as well as [[Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede]] and Pirates Voyage Dinner & Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dollyparton.com/family_destinations/pirates_voyage/pirates-voyage-grand-opening/|title=Pirates Voyage Grand Opening |publisher=DollyParton.com |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref>

Parton is the most honored female country performer of all time. Achieving 25 RIAA certified gold, platinum, and multi-platinum awards, she has had 25 songs reach No. 1 on the Billboard Country charts, a record for a female artist. She has 41 career top 10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career charted singles over the past 40 years. All-inclusive sales of singles, albums, hits collections, and digital downloads during her career have topped 100 million worldwide. She has garnered eight [[Grammy Awards]], two [[Academy Award]] nominations, ten [[Country Music Association Awards]], seven [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award. Parton has received 46 Grammy nominations, tying her with [[Bruce Springsteen]] for the [[Grammy Award records#Most Grammy nominations|most Grammy nominations]] and placing her in tenth place overall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton's Awards & Milestones|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/movies-television/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref>

In 1999, she was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. She has composed over 3,000 songs, the best known of which include "[[I Will Always Love You]]" (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper for Parton, as well as an international pop hit for [[Whitney Houston]]), "[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]", "[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]", "[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]", and "[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]]". Parton is also [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Four nominations|one of the few]] to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, [[Tony Awards]], and [[Emmy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton - Chart History - Billboard|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/chart?sort=position&f=379|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref>

==Early years==
Parton was born in [[Sevier County, Tennessee]], the fourth of twelve children of Robert Lee Parton (1921&ndash;2000), a farmer and construction worker,<ref>{{cite web|title=Daddy's Dinner Bucket: Mr. Lee Parton|url=http://dollyparton.com/front-porch-stories/daddys-dinner-bucket-lee-parton/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref> and his wife Avie Lee (née Owens) (1923&ndash;2003). Parton's middle name comes from her maternal great-great grandmother, Rebecca (Dunn) Whitted (1861&ndash;1930).<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton Biography|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/dolly-parton.html;jsessionid=9CECAFF05AFFF508B71898273634EA3A|publisher=thebiographychannel.co.uk|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/35/Dolly-Parton.html|title=Dolly Parton bio|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref> She has described her family as being "dirt poor".<ref>{{cite news|title=Dolly Parton talks new album, tour|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/09/dolly.parton.cnna/index.html|accessdate=July 14, 2014|publisher=CNN|date=July 9, 2002|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060512112052/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/09/dolly.parton.cnna/index.html|archivedate=May 12, 2006}}</ref> Parton's father paid the doctor who helped deliver her with a bag of oatmeal. She outlined her family's poverty in her early songs: "[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]" and "In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)". They lived in a rustic, one-room cabin in Locust Ridge,<ref>{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=Todd Aaron|title=On Gratitude: Sheryl Crow, Jeff Bridges, Alicia Keys, Daryl Hall, Ray Bradbury, Anna Kendrick, B.B.

===Career discovery===
[[File:DollyParton-Goldband-.jpg|thumb|left|Dolly Parton portrait for Goldband Records]]
Parton began performing as a child, singing on local radio and television programs in the [[Eastern Tennessee]] area.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magill|first1=Frank Northen|last2=Aves|first2=Alison|title=Dictionary of World Biography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uiQAaGgOChIC&pg=PA2896|accessdate=July 14, 2014|year=1999|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-57958-048-3|page=2896}}</ref> She received her first guitar at eight.<ref name="Backwoods Glam"/> By ten, she was appearing on ''[[Cas Walker#Radio and television|The Cas Walker Show]]'' on both [[WIVK-FM|WIVK Radio]] and [[WBIR-TV]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. At thirteen, she was recording (the single "Puppy Love") on a small Louisiana label, [[Goldband Records]],<ref name="Backwoods Glam"/> and appeared at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] where she first met [[Johnny Cash]], who encouraged her to follow her own instincts regarding her career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly's first Grand Ole Opry performance 1959|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/awards_milestones/grand-ole-opry-performance-1959/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref>

The day after she graduated from high school in 1964, she moved to Nashville.<ref name="Backwoods Glam"/> Her initial success came as a songwriter, having signed with Combine Publishing shortly after her arrival;<ref>{{cite web|title=Special Presentation: Dolly Parton Timeline|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/html/dollyparton/dollyparton-partontimeline.html|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=July 15, 2014|date=April 8, 2010}}</ref> with her frequent songwriting partner, her uncle Bill Owens, she wrote several charting singles during this time, including two top ten hits: [[Bill Phillips (singer)|Bill Phillips]]'s 1966 record "Put It Off Until Tomorrow", and [[Skeeter Davis]]' 1967 hit "[[Fuel to the Flame]]". Her songs were recorded by many other artists during this period, including [[Kitty Wells]] and [[Hank Williams Jr.]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Whitburn|2005|pages=108, 422}}.</ref> She signed with [[Monument Records]] in 1965, at 19, where she was initially pitched as a [[bubblegum pop]] singer. She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, "Happy, Happy Birthday Baby", did not crack the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique voice with its strong vibrato was not suited to the genre.

It was only after her composition, "Put It Off Until Tomorrow", as recorded by [[Bill Phillips (singer)|Bill Phillips]] (and with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to No. 6 on the country chart in 1966, that the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, "Dumb Blonde" (one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached No. 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by "Something Fishy", which went to No. 17. The two songs appeared on her first full-length album, ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hello I'm Dolly - Dolly's first solo album 1967|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/hello-im-dolly-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref>

===Marriage===
On May 30, 1966, Parton and Carl Thomas Dean (born {{birth date|1942|7|20}} in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]) were married in [[Ringgold, Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smokykin.com/ged/f004/f84/a0048409.htm|title=Dolly Rebecca Parton|publisher=Smokykin.com|date=May 2, 2011|accessdate=October 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Parton|1994|p=142}}.</ref> Although Parton does not use Dean's surname professionally, she has stated that her passport says "Dolly Parton Dean" and that she sometimes uses Dean when signing contracts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lamont|first1=Tom|title=Dolly Parton: 'There's more to me than the big hair and the phoney stuff'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/06/dolly-parton-more-to-me-than-big-hair-phoney-stuff|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=The Guardian|date=6 December 2014}}</ref>

Dean, who runs an [[asphalt]] road-paving business in Nashville, has always shunned publicity and rarely accompanies his wife to any events. According to Parton, he has only ever seen her perform once. However, she has also commented in interviews that, although it appears they spend little time together, it is simply that nobody sees him publicly. She has commented on Dean's romantic side, saying that he does spontaneous things to surprise her and sometimes even writes poems for her.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parton|first=Dolly|title=Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EXtOewAACAAJ|accessdate=December 13, 2012|date=May 1, 1996|publisher=Thorndike Press|isbn=978-0-7862-0364-2|page=214}}</ref>

Parton and Dean helped raise several of Parton's younger siblings in Nashville, leading her nieces and nephews to refer to her as "Aunt Granny", a moniker that later lent its name to one of Parton's [[Dollywood]] restaurants. The couple have no children of their own but Parton is the godmother of performer [[Miley Cyrus]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20184725,00.html|first=Brian|last=Orloff|title=Dolly Parton Calls Miley Cyrus a 'Little Elvis'|work=[[People (American magazine)|People]]|date=March 17, 2008|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref>

In 2011, the couple celebrated their 45th anniversary. Later, Parton said, "We're really proud of our marriage. It's the first for both of us. And the last."<ref>{{cite news|author=Sterdan, Darryl|date=July 4, 2011|publisher=[[QMI Agency]] (via the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'')|title=Dolly Parton a Quote Machine|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/07/04/dolly-parton-a-quote-machine|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref>

==Music career==

===1967–75: Country music success===
In 1967, country singer [[Porter Wagoner]] invited Parton to join his organization, offering her a regular spot on his weekly [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television program ''The Porter Wagoner Show'', as well as in his road show. As documented in her 1994 autobiography,<ref name=allMusicGuide/> initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|work=Billboard|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref> With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a cover of [[Tom Paxton]]'s "[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]", released in late 1967, reached the country top ten in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted top ten singles for the pair.

Parton's first solo single for RCA Victor, "[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]]", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching No. 17. For the remainder of the decade, none of her solo efforts – even "[[In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)]]", which later became a standard – were as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named ''[[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]]'' in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future: as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly and Uncle Bill Owens start Owe-Par Publishing Company|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/awards_milestones/owe-par-publishing-company/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref> the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens. By 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success. Wagoner persuaded Parton to record [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers's]] "[[Mule Skinner Blues]]", a [[gimmick]] that worked. The record shot to No. 3, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first No. 1 single, "Joshua". For the next two years, she had numerous solo hits – including her signature song "[[Coat of Many Colors]]" (#4, 1971) – in addition to her duets. Top twenty singles included "The Right Combination" and "Burning the Midnight Oil" (both duets with [[Porter Wagoner]], 1971); "Lost Forever in Your Kiss" (with Wagoner) and "[[Touch Your Woman]] (1972); and "[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]]" and "Travelin' Man" (1973).<ref name="DollyPartonEntertainment.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton Entertainment|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}</ref>

Although her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was "[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]". Released in late 1973, it topped the country chart in February 1974, and reached the lower regions of the Hot 100 (it eventually also charted in the UK, reaching No. 7 in 1976, representing Parton's first UK success). Parton and Wagoner performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated; he helped produce her records through 1975.<ref name=allMusicGuide>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1759|pure_url=yes}} Dolly Parton profile], Allmusic.com; accessed March 31, 2014.</ref> The pair continued to release duet albums, their final release being 1975's "Say Forever You'll Be Mine".<ref name="officialmusicwebsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton official music website|work=Dolly Parton Entertainment|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}</ref>

In 1974, her song, "[[I Will Always Love You]]", written about her professional break from Wagoner, went to No. 1 on the country chart. Around the same time, [[Elvis Presley]] indicated that he wanted to cover the song. Parton was interested until Presley's wily manager, [[Colonel Tom Parker]], told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song recorded by Presley.<ref>{{Wayback|date=20071012164144|url=http://cmt.com/artists/news/1535871/20060707/presley_elvis.jhtml|title="Dolly Parton Reflects on Her Greatest Moments"}}, cmt.com; July 7, 2006.</ref> Parton refused. That decision has been credited with helping to make her many millions of dollars in royalties from the song over the years.

Parton had three solo singles reach No. 1 on the country chart in 1974 ("Jolene", "I Will Always Love You", and "[[Love Is Like a Butterfly (song)|Love Is Like a Butterfly]]"), as well as the duet with Porter Wagoner, "[[Please Don't Stop Loving Me]]"; she again topped the singles chart in 1975 with "[[The Bargain Store]]".<ref>[http://www.dollymania.net/chartb.html On The Charts - The Singles], dollymania.net; accessed September 20, 2014.</ref>

===1976–86: Branching out into pop music===
From 1974 to 1980, she consistently charted in the country [[Top 40|Top 10]], with eight singles reaching No. 1. Parton had her own syndicated television variety show, ''[[Dolly!]]'' (1976–77). During this period, many performers, including [[Rose Maddox]], [[Kitty Wells]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Emmylou Harris]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] covered her songs, and her siblings Randy and Stella both received recording contracts of their own.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>

During this period, Parton began to embark on a high-profile crossover campaign, attempting to aim her music in a more mainstream direction and increase her visibility outside of the confines of country music. In 1976, she began working closely with [[Sandy Gallin]], who would serve as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album ''[[All I Can Do (album)|All I Can Do]]'', which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, ''[[New Harvest – First Gathering|New Harvest ... First Gathering]]'' (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs – the album contained covers of the pop and R&B classics "[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]" and "[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]" – and production.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Harvest...First Gathering - 18th Solo Album|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/new-harvest-first-gathering-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it, nor its single "[[Light of a Clear Blue Morning]]" made much of an impact on the pop charts.

After ''New Harvest'''s disappointing chart performance, Parton turned to high profile pop producer [[Gary Klein (producer)|Gary Klein]] for her next album. The result, 1977's ''[[Here You Come Again]],'' became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching No. 20 on the pop chart; the [[Barry Mann]]-[[Cynthia Weil]]-penned [[Here You Come Again (song)|title track]] topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first top-ten single on the pop chart (#3). A second single, the double A-sided "[[Two Doors Down]]"/"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop top twenty. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles charted on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-[[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton's Official Song List|url=http://dollyparton.com/music-discography-song-list/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref>

In 1978, Parton won a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her ''Here You Come Again'' album. She continued to have hits with "[[Heartbreaker (Dolly Parton song)|Heartbreaker]]" (1978), "[[Baby I'm Burning]]" (1979), and "[[You're the Only One (Dolly Parton song)|You're the Only One]]" (1979), all of which charted in the pop [[Top 40]] and topped the country chart. "[[Sweet Summer Lovin']]" (1979) became the first Parton single in two years to not top the country chart (though it did reach the Top 10). During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a ''[[Barbara Walters Special]]'' in 1977 (timed to coincide with ''Here You Come Again'''s release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on [[Cher]]'s ABC television special, and her own joint special with [[Carol Burnett]] on CBS, ''Carol and Dolly in Nashville''.<ref name="IMDb name|573|Dolly Parton"/>

Parton served as one of three co-hosts (along with [[Roy Clark]] and [[Glen Campbell]]) on the CBS special ''Fifty Years of Country Music''. In 1979, Parton hosted the NBC special ''The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music'', performed live at the [[Ford Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and whose audience included President [[Jimmy Carter]].
Her commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive No. 1 hits: the [[Donna Summer]]-written "[[Starting Over Again]]", "[[Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You]]", and "[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]", which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981.<ref name="allMusicGuide"/> She had another Top 10 single that year with "Making Plans", a single released from a 1980 [[Porter & Dolly|reunion album with Porter Wagoner]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Just Between Me And You compilation w/Porter Wagoner|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/just-between-you-and-me-compilation/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Dolly Parton 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dolly Parton holding a baby in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], 1983]]
"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]", the theme song to the 1980 feature film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' she starred in along with [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lily Tomlin]], not only reached No. 1 on the country chart, but also, in February 1981, reached No. 1 on the pop and the [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] charts, giving her a triple No. 1 hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a No. 1 single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top 10: between 1981 and 1985, she had 12 Top 10 hits; half of them hit No. 1. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of "I Will Always Love You" from the feature film, ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982) scraped the Top 50 that year and her duet with [[Kenny Rogers]], "[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]" (written by the [[Bee Gees]] and produced by [[Barry Gibb]]), spent two weeks at No. 1 in 1983.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>

Other chart hits during this period included her chart-topping cover of the 1969 [[First Edition]] hit, "[[But You Know I Love You]]" and "[[The House of the Rising Sun]]" (1981); "[[Single Women]]", "[[Heartbreak Express]]", and "[[Hard Candy Christmas]]" (1982); and "[[Potential New Boyfriend]]" (1983), which was accompanied by one of her first music videos and reached the U.S. dance chart. She continued to explore new business and entertainment ventures such as her [[Dollywood]] theme park that opened in 1986 in [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]].

In the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with "[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]", "[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]", "[[Tennessee Homesick Blues]]" (1984); "[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]" (another duet with Kenny Rogers), "[[Don't Call It Love]]" (1985); and "[[Think About Love]]" (1986) all reaching the country Top 10. ("Tennessee Homesick Blues" and "Think About Love" reached No. 1; "Real Love" also reached No. 1 on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit). However, RCA Records did not renew her contract after it expired that year, and she signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1987.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>

===1987–94: Return to country roots===
Along with [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]], she released ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'' (1987) to critical acclaim. The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Country Albums chart, and also reached the top-ten on Billboard's Top-200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and producing four Top 10 country hits including [[Phil Spector]]'s "[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]", which went to No. 1. "Trio" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. After a further attempt at pop success with "[[Rainbow (Dolly Parton album)|Rainbow]]" (1987), including the single "[[The River Unbroken]]", Parton focused on recording country material. "[[White Limozeen]]" (1989) produced two No. 1 hits in "[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]" and "[[Yellow Roses]]". Although it looked like Parton's career had been revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came on in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the chart.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>

A duet with [[Ricky Van Shelton]], "[[Rockin' Years]]" (1991), reached No. 1, though Parton's greatest commercial fortune of the decade came when Whitney Houston recorded "I Will Always Love You" for the soundtrack of the feature film ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992); both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful. But her 1993 album ''[[Slow Dancing with the Moon]]'' won critical acclaim, and did well on the charts, reaching No. 4 on the country albums chart, and No. 16 on the Billboard 200 album chart. She recorded "The Day I Fall in Love" as a duet with [[James Ingram]] for the feature film ''[[Beethoven's 2nd]]'' (1993). The songwriters (Sager, Ingram, and Clif Mangess) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song and Parton and Ingram performed the song on the awards telecast. Similar to her earlier collaborative album with Harris and Ronstadt, Parton released "[[Honky Tonk Angels]]" in the fall of 1993 with [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Tammy Wynette]].<ref name="bio">[http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/parton_dolly/bio.jhtml "Dolly Parton Biography"]. [[Country Music Television]]; retrieved February 12, 2012.</ref> It was certified as [[Oro album|a gold album]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and helped revive both Wynette's and Lynn's careers. Also in 1994, Parton contributed the song "You Gotta Be My Baby" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/red-hot-country-mw0000622534]</ref> A live acoustic album, ''[[Heartsongs: Live from Home|Heartsongs]]'', featuring stripped down versions of some of her hits, as well as some traditional songs, was released in late 1994.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/heartsongs-live-from-home-mw0000119223]</ref>

===1995–present===
[[File:Dolly Parton Australia.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Dolly Parton in [[Australia]], November 2011]]
Parton's recorded music during the mid-to late 1990s remained steady, though somewhat eclectic. Her 1995 re-recording of "I Will Always Love You" (performed as a duet with [[Vince Gill]]), from her album ''[[Something Special (Dolly Parton album)|Something Special]]'' won the Country Music Association's [[Country Music Association Awards#Awards by year|Vocal Event of the Year Award]]. The following year, ''[[Treasures (Dolly Parton album)|Treasures]]'', an album of covers of 1960s/70s hits was released, and featured a diverse collection of material, including songs by [[Mac Davis]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Cat Stevens]], and [[Neil Young]]. Her recording of Stevens' "[[Peace Train]]" was later remixed and released as a dance single, reaching Billboard's dance singles chart. Her 1998 country-rock album ''[[Hungry Again]]'' was made up entirely of her own compositions. Although neither of the album's two singles, "(Why Don't More Women Sing) Honky Tonk Songs" and "Salt in my Tears", charted, videos for both songs received significant airplay on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]. A second and more contemporary collaboration with Harris and Ronstadt, ''[[Trio 2 (album)|Trio II]]'', was released in early 1999. Its cover of [[Neil Young]]'s song "[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]]. Parton was also inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1999.<ref name=bio/>

Parton recorded a series of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-inspired albums, beginning with ''[[The Grass Is Blue]]'' (1999), winning a [[Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album]], and ''[[Little Sparrow]]'' (2001), with its cover of [[Collective Soul]]'s "[[Shine (Collective Soul song)|Shine]]" winning a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]. The third, ''[[Halos & Horns]]'' (2002) included a bluegrass version of the [[Led Zeppelin]] song "[[Stairway to Heaven]]". In 2005 she released ''[[Those Were the Days (Dolly Parton album)|Those Were The Days]]'' consisting of her interpretations of hits from the [[folk-rock]] era of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]", "[[Where Do the Children Play?]]", "[[Crimson and Clover]]", and "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]"<ref name=bio/>

Parton earned her second Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for "[[Transamerica (soundtrack)|Travelin' Thru]]", which she wrote specifically for the feature film ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]'' (2005). Due to the song's (and film's) uncritical acceptance of a [[transgender]] woman, Parton received [[death threats]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Wunderink, Susan|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/glimpses/2008/backwoodsbarbie.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080804100023/http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/glimpses/2008/backwoodsbarbie.html|archivedate=October 13, 2008|title=Dolly Parton{{spaced ndash}}Backwoods Barbie (Dolly Records)|work=[[Christianity Today]]|date=August 4, 2008|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}</ref> She returned to No. 1 on the country chart later in 2005 by lending her distinctive harmonies to the [[Brad Paisley]] ballad, "[[When I Get Where I'm Going|When I Get Where I'm Goin']]".<ref name=bio/>

==In concert and on tour==
Parton [[Concert tour#Concert tour|toured]] extensively from the late 1960s until the early 1990s. In the 1960s and early 1970s, Parton toured as a member of [[Porter Wagoner]]'s road show, as well as with other country musicians, including [[George Jones]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]]. Upon leaving Wagoner's organization in 1974, Parton formed her own "Travelin' Family Band", made up largely of siblings, cousins, and other family members, and touring with other acts, including [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Mac Davis]].

In 1976, she disbanded the Travelin' Family Band, to form a new band, Gypsy Fever, composed of seasoned musicians who had more of a rock sensibility, to support her impending crossover. Parton toured as a headline act with Gypsy Fever from 1977 to 1979, to promote her albums, ''[[New Harvest - First Gathering]]'', ''[[Here You Come Again (album)|Here You Come Again]]'', 
''[[Heartbreaker (Dolly Parton album)|Heartbreaker]]'', and ''[[Great Balls of Fire (Dolly Parton album)|Great Balls of Fire]]''. In the 1980s, movie roles and other ventures caused Parton to tour less than she had done during the previous decade. In 1982 and early 1983, she toured in support of her ''[[Heartbreak Express]]'' album, but health problems resulted in the cancellation of a several of that tour's dates. From 1984 to 1985, she toured alongside [[Kenny Rogers]] for the ''[[Real Love (Dolly Parton album)|Real Love]] Tour''. She continued touring in 1986 with the ''[[Think About Love]] Tour'', and 1989 for the ''[[White Limozeen]] Tour''. Parton's only tour in the 1990s was between 1991&ndash;92 in support of her ''Eagle When She Flies'' album. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Compositions in films and television and covers===
Parton's songwriting has been featured prominently in several films. In addition to the title song for ''Nine to Five'' (1980), she also recorded a second version of "I Will Always Love You" for ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' (1982). The second version was a No. 1 country hit and also managed to reach the pop charts, going to No. 53.

"I Will Always Love You" has been covered by many country artists, including Ronstadt on ''[[Prisoner In Disguise]]'' (1975); [[Kenny Rogers]] on ''[[Vote for Love]]'' (1996); and [[LeAnn Rimes]] on ''[[Unchained Melody: The Early Years]]'' (1997).

On May 8, 2009, Parton gave the [[commencement speech]] at the [[graduation|commencement ceremony]] for the [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville]]'s College of Arts and Sciences.<ref name="utk"/> During the ceremony she received an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters|DHL]] from the university. It was only the second honorary degree given by the university, and in presenting the degree, the university's [[chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], Jimmy G.

Parton has turned down several offers to pose for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, although she did appear on the cover of ''Playboy'''s October 1978 issue wearing a [[Playboy bunny]] outfit, complete with ears (the October 1978 ''Playboy'' issue featured Lawrence Grobel's extensive and candid interview with Parton, representing one of her earliest high profile interviews with the mainstream press). The association of breasts with Parton's public image is illustrated in the naming of [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] after her, since the sheep was cloned from a cell taken from an adult ewe's mammary gland.<ref>{{cite news|author= Staff|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/22/newsid_4245000/4245877.stm|title=1997: Dolly the Sheep Is Cloned|publisher=BBC News ("On This Day{{spaced ndash}}1950–2005" database)|date=n.d.|accessdate= February 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Weise, Elizabeth|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/genetics/2006-07-04-dolly-anniversary_x.htm|title=Dolly Was World's Hello to Cloning's Possibilities|work=[[USA Today]]|date=July 4, 2006|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref>

Parton replied that cosmetic surgery was imperative in keeping with her famous image, but jokingly admitted, "If I have one more [[facelift]], I'll have a beard!"{{episode|date=April 2014}}

Parton has also become a [[gay icon]] within the gay community. Parton supports [[LGBT equality]] and has said that "Christians who judge LGBT people are sinners". She is currently{{when|date=February 2015}} working on a dance album catered to her gay audience.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Parton has repeatedly joked about her physical image and surgeries, saying, "If I see something sagging, bagging, and dragging, I'm going to nip it, suck it and tuck it. Why should I look like an old barn yard dog if I don't have to?"{{cite quote|date=November 2014}} and "It takes a lot of money to look this cheap."<ref>{{cite web|author=The Proust Questionnaire|date=November 2012|title=The Proust Questionnaire: Dolly Parton|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/11/dolly-parton-proust-questionnaire|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}</ref> Her breasts have garnered mention of her in several songs including: "Dolly Parton's Hits" by [[Bobby Braddock]], "[[Marty Feldman]] Eyes" by [[Bruce Baum]] (a parody of "[[Bette Davis Eyes]]"), "[[Talk Like Sex]]" by [[Kool G Rap]] & DJ Polo, "Dolly Parton's Tits" by [[MacLean & MacLean]], "Kokayne" by [[RiFF RAFF]], "[[Crazy Rap|Colt 45]]" by [[Afroman]], "Jokes on you" by [[Fabolous]], "Lollipop Remix" by [[Lil Wayne]] ft.
