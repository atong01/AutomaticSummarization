While the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly four more centuries, and the Crusades would contest the issue for some time, the victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkish ascendancy in<space/><link><target>Anatolia</target></link>. Most historians, including<space/><link><target>Edward Gibbon</target></link>, date the defeat at Manzikert as the beginning of the end of the Eastern Roman Empire. Certainly the entry of Turkic farmers following their horsemen ended the themes in Anatolia that had furnished the Empire with men and treasure.</paragraph><heading level='2'>State organization</heading><paragraph>Alp Arslan's strength lay in the military realm. Domestic affairs were handled by his able vizier,<space/><link><target>Nizam al-Mulk</target></link>, the founder of the administrative organization that characterized and strengthened the sultanate during the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son, Malik Shah. Military<space/><link><target>fiefdom</target><part>fiefs</part></link>, governed by Seljuq princes, were established to provide support for the soldiery and to accommodate the nomadic Turks to the established Anatolian agricultural scene. This type of military fiefdom enabled the nomadic Turks to draw on the resources of the sedentary Persians, Turks, and other established cultures within the Seljuq realm, and allowed Alp Arslan to field a huge standing army without depending on tribute from conquest to pay his soldiers. He not only had enough food from his subjects to maintain his military, but the taxes collected from traders and merchants added to his coffers sufficiently to fund his continuous wars.</paragraph><paragraph>According to the poet<space/><link><target>Saadi Shirazi</target></link>:<extension extension_name='blockquote'><paragraph>Arslan possessed a fort, which raised at the height of Alwand, from all were those within its walls, for its roads were a labyrinth, like the curls of a bride. From a learned traveler Arslan once inquired: &quot;Didst thou ever, in thy wanderings, see a fort as strong as this?&quot; &quot;Splendid it is,&quot; was the travelers reply, &quot;but methinks not it confers much strength. Before thee, did not other kings possess it for a while, then pass away? After thee, will not other kings assume control, and eat the fruits of the tree of thy hope?&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>In the estimation of the wise, the world is a false gem that passes each moment from one hand to another. (the fort was sacked by the Mongols led by<space/><link><target>Hulagu</target></link>).</paragraph></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Suleyman I of Rm</target><part>Suleiman ibn Kutalmish</part></link><space/>was the son of the contender for Arslan's throne; he was appointed governor of the north-western provinces and assigned to completing the invasion of Anatolia. An explanation for this choice can only be conjectured from<space/><link><target>Ibn al-Athir</target></link>s account of the battle between Alp-Arslan and<space/><link><target>Kutalmish</target></link>, in which he writes that Alp-Arslan wept for the latter's death and greatly mourned the loss of his kinsman.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Death</heading><paragraph>After Manzikert, the dominion of Alp Arslan extended over much of western<space/><link><target>Asia</target></link>. He soon prepared to march for the conquest of<space/><link><target>Turkestan</target></link>, the original seat of his ancestors. With a powerful army he advanced to the banks of the Oxus. Before he could pass the river with safety, however, it was necessary to subdue certain fortresses, one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor,<space/><link><target>Yussuf el-Harezmi</target></link>, a<space/><link><target>Khwarezmid Empire</target><part>Khwarezmian</part></link>. He was obliged to surrender, however, and was carried as a prisoner before the sultan, who condemned him to death. Yussuf, in desperation, drew his dagger and rushed upon the sultan. Alp Arslan, who took great pride in his reputation as the foremost archer of his time, motioned to his guards not to interfere. He drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he received the assassin's dagger in his breast. Alp Arslan died from this wound four days later, on 25 November 1072, in his 42nd year, and he was taken to<space/><link><target>Merv</target></link><space/>to be buried next to his father,<space/><link><target>Chaghri Beg</target></link>. Upon his tomb lies the following inscription:</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem>O those who saw the sky-high grandeur of Alp Arslan, behold!

I had been warned against trying to protect myself, and against letting my courage get in the way of my good sense. I forgot those warnings, and here I lie, dying in agony.
