Having presided over relatively serene political, economic and social conditions, the feeling of prosperity in the UK had been maintained into the new millennium, and Labour would have a free hand to assert its ideals in the subsequent parliament.Despite the victory, voter apathy was a major issue, as turnout fell below 60% for the first time in history, 12% down on 1997. All of the 3 main parties saw their total votes fall, with Labour's total vote dropping by 2.8 million on 1997, the Conservatives 1.3 million, and the Liberal Democrats 428,000. Some suggested this dramatic fall was a sign of the general acceptance of the status quo and the likelihood of Labour's majority remaining unassailable.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1383000/1383403.stm<space/></arg><arg name="work">BBC News<space/></arg><arg name="title">The poll that never was<space/></arg><arg name="date">11 June 2001</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>For the Conservatives, the huge loss they had sustained in 1997 was repeated. Despite gaining 9 seats the Tories lost 8 behind them to the Liberal Democrats and one even to Labour. The inevitable result was the speedy resignation of<space/><link><target>William Hague</target></link><space/>in the election aftermath. Some believed that Hague had been unlucky, although most considered him to be a talented orator and an intelligent statesman, he had come up against the charismatic<space/><link><target>Tony Blair</target></link><space/>in the pomp of his political career, and it was no surprise that little progress was made in reducing Labour's majority after a relatively smooth parliament. Staying at what they considered rock-bottom however showed that the Conservatives had failed to improve their negative public image, had remained somewhat disunited over Europe and had not regained the trust that they had lost in the 1990s. But in Scotland they managed to scrape one seat from the SNP, despite continuing its vote collapse. It failed to retake former strongholds in Scotland as the Nationalists consolidated their grip on the Northeastern portion of the country.<space/><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1377000/1377378.stm<space/></arg><arg name="work">BBC News<space/></arg><arg name="title">Labour romps home again<space/></arg><arg name="date">8 June 2001</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The Liberal Democrats could point to steady progress under<space/><link><target>Charles Kennedy</target></link>, gaining more seats than the main two parties albeit only six overall and maintaining the performance of a pleasing 1997 election, where the party had doubled its number of seats from 20 to 46.
