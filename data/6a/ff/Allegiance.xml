Persons who from having been born within British territory are British subjects, but who at birth became under the law of any foreign state subjects of such state, and also persons who though born abroad are British subjects by reason of parentage, may by declarations of alienage get rid of British nationality.

Every natural-born citizen of a foreign state who is also an American citizen and every natural-born American citizen who is a citizen of a foreign land owes a double allegiance, one to the United States, and one to his homeland (in the event of an immigrant becoming a citizen of the US), or to his adopted land (in the event of an emigrant natural born citizen of the US becoming a citizen of another nation). If these allegiances come into conflict, he or she may be guilty of treason against one or both. If the demands of these two sovereigns upon his duty of allegiance come into conflict, those of the United States have the paramount authority in American law; likewise, those of the foreign land have paramount authority in their legal system. In such a situation, it may be incumbent on the individual to<space/><link><target>Renunciation of citizenship</target><part>renounce</part></link><space/>one of his citizenships to avoid possibly being forced into situations where countervailing duties are required of him, such as might occur in the event of war.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Oath of allegiance</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Oath of allegiance</arg><arg>Pledge of allegiance</arg></template>The oath of allegiance is an<space/><link><target>oath</target></link><space/>of fidelity to the sovereign taken by all persons holding important public office and as a condition of naturalization.
