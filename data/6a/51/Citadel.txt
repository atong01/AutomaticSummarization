A '''citadel''' is the core fortified area of a town or city. It may be a  [[Fortification|fortress]], [[castle]], or fortified center.<ref>{{cite book|title=Castles: Their Construction and History |author= [[Sidney Toy]]|year=1985|publisher=[[Courier Dover]]|isbn=0-486-24898-4}}</ref> The term is a diminutive of "city" and thus means "little city", so called because it is a smaller part of the city of which it is the defensive core.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/citadel |title=Citadel |accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref>

In a fortification with [[bastion]]s, the citadel is the strongest part of the system, sometimes well inside the outer walls and bastions, but often forming part of the outer wall for the sake of economy. It is positioned to be the last line of defense, should the enemy breach the other components of the fortification system. A citadel is also a term of the third part of a medieval castle, with higher walls than the rest. It was to be the last line of defence before the [[keep]] itself.

In various countries, the citadels gained a specific name such as "[[Kremlin]]" in Russia or "[[Alcázar]]" in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In European cities, the term "Citadel" and "City Castle" are often used interchangeably. The term "tower" is also used in some cases such as the [[Tower of London]] and Jerusalem's [[Tower of David]]. However, the Haitian citadel, which is the largest citadel in the Western Hemisphere, is called [[Citadelle Laferrière]] or simply the "Citadel" in English.

==History==

===8000 BC–600 AD===
In [[Ancient Greece]], the  [[Acropolis]] (literally: "peak of the city"), placed on a commanding eminence, was important in the life of the people, serving as a refuge and stronghold in peril and containing military and food supplies, the [[shrine]] of the god and a royal [[palace]]. The most well-known is the [[Acropolis of Athens]], but nearly every Greek city-state had one – the [[Acrocorinth]] famed as a particularly strong fortress. In a much later period, when Greece was ruled by the [[Latin Empire]], the same strongpoints were used by the new feudal rulers for much the same purpose.

====167–160 BC====
Rebels who took power in the city but with the citadel still held by the former rulers could by no means regard their tenure of power as secure. One such incident played an important part in the history of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] against the [[Seleucid Empire]]. The [[Hellenistic]] [[garrison]] of [[Jerusalem]] and local supporters of the Seleucids held out for many years in the [[Acra (fortress)|Acra]] citadel, making Maccabean rule in the rest of Jerusalem precarious. When finally gaining possession of the place, the Maccabeans pointedly destroyed and razed the Acra, though they constructed another citadel for their own use in a different part of Jerusalem.

====3300–1300 BC====
Some of the oldest known structures which have served as citadels were built by the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], where the citadel represented a centralised authority. The main citadel in Indus Valley was almost 12 meters tall.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thapar |first=B. K. |year=1975 |title=Kalibangan: A Harappan Metropolis Beyond the Indus Valley |journal=Expedition |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=19–32}}</ref> The purpose of these structures, however, remains debated. Though the structures found in the ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]] were walled, it is far from clear that these structures were defensive against enemy attacks. Rather, they may have been built to divert flood waters.

===500–1500 AD===
At various periods, and particularly during the [[Middle Ages]], the citadel – having its own fortifications, independent of the city walls – was the last defence of a besieged army, often held after the town had been conquered. A city where the citadel held out against an invading army was not considered conquered. For example, in the 1543 [[Siege of Nice]] the Ottoman forces led by [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa]] conquered and pillaged the town itself and took many captives – but the city castle held out, due to which the townspeople were accounted the victors.

===1600–1860 AD===
As late as the 19th century, a similar situation developed at [[Antwerp]], where a Dutch garrison under General [[David Hendrik Chassé]] held out in the city's citadel between 1830 and 1832, while the city itself had already become part of the independent Belgium.

In time of war the citadel in many cases afforded retreat to the people living in the areas around the town. However, Citadels were often used also to protect a garrison or political power from the inhabitants of the town where it was located, being designed to ensure loyalty from the town that they defended.

For example, [[Barcelona]] had a great citadel built in 1714 to intimidate the [[Catalan people|Catalans]] against repeating their mid-17th- and early-18th-century rebellions against the Spanish central government. In the 19th century, when the political climate had liberalised enough to permit it, the people of Barcelona had the citadel torn down, and replaced it with the city's main central park, the [[Parc de la Ciutadella]]. A similar example is the [[Citadella]] in [[Budapest]], Hungary.

The attack on the [[Bastille]] in the [[French Revolution]] – though afterwards remembered mainly for the release of the handful of prisoners incarcerated there – was to considerable degree motivated by the structure being a Royal citadel in the midst of revolutionary Paris.

Similarly, after [[Garibaldi]]'s overthrow of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] rule in [[Palermo]], during the 1860 [[Unification of Italy]], Palermo's Castellamare Citadel – symbol of the hated and oppressive former rule – was ceremoniously demolished.

The [[Siege of the Alcázar]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], in which the Nationalists held out against a much larger Republican force for two months until relieved, shows that in some cases a citadel can be effective even in modern warfare; a similar case is the [[Battle of Huế]] during the [[Vietnam war]], where a [[North Vietnamese Army]] division held the citadel of Huế for 26 days against roughly their own numbers of much better-equipped US and South Vietnamese troops.

===1820–present AD===
[[File:La Citadelle de Québec, vue du ciel.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Citadelle of Québec]], [[Québec City]] (Canada)]]
The [[Citadelle of Québec]] (construction started 1673, completed 1820) still survives as the largest citadel still in official military operation in North America. It is home to the Royal 22nd Regiment of Canada;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lacitadelle.qc.ca/en/la-citadelle.html |title=Musée Royal 22e Régiment - La Citadelle |accessdate=28 Feb 2014}}</ref> and forms part of the fortified walls of [[Vieux-Québec]] dating back to 1608.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=13037&pid=0 |title=Canada's Historic Places - HistoricPlaces.ca |accessdate=28 Feb 2014}}</ref>

==Modern usage==
Citadels since the mid 20th century, are commonly military command and control centres built to resist attack commonly aerial or nuclear bombardment. The [[Military citadels under London]] such as the massive underground complex beneath the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]  called Pindar is one such example, as is the [[Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker]] in the US.

==Naval term==
On armored warships, the heavily armored section of the ship that protects the ammunition and machinery spaces is called the citadel.

The [[safe room]] on a ship is also called a citadel.
