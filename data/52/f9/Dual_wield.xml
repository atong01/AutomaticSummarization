Though using two hand guns at a time confers an advantage by allowing more ready ammunition, it is rarely done due to other aspects of weapons handling. Dual wielding is present in many films and video games, which have the freedom of ignoring the impracticality of the style. The term itself is often invoked in the context of games.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph>Dual wielding has not been used or mentioned much in military history, though it appears in<space/><link><target>Martial arts#Variation and scope</target><part>weapon based martial arts</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>fencing</target></link><space/>practices. This style of combat requires special training, since the user is unable to swing both weapons at the same time. Due the positioning of the body and the need to maintain balance, the use of two weapons requires the practitioner to use one weapon offensively and the other defensively. To perform an attack by the defensive weapon after the first, the user needs to perform a separate and distinct action.<extension extension_name='ref' name="SwordfightinStarwars"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Nick Jamilla<space/></arg><arg name="title">Sword Fighting in the Star Wars Universe: Historical Origins, Style and Philosophy<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">12 June 2013<space/></arg><arg name="date">1 January 2008<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">McFarland<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">978-0-7864-5179-1<space/></arg><arg name="page">257</arg></template></extension><space/>The main advantage of using two weapons is the user can use one as a holding weapon after contact is made and use the other to attack the open area of the opponent. Otherwise, there is not much advantage compared to a user who wields a single weapon with both hands in terms of power and control. The latter has more maneuverability due to a more controlled<space/><link><target>center of gravity</target></link>; a person using a single weapon can use their legs for kicking or tripping. Though the dual wielder has more options for attacking or defending, they will still be weaker. A single-handed grip on each weapon also means it can be knocked away with a sufficiently powerful blow.<extension extension_name='ref' name="SwordfightinStarwars"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The use of weapon combinations in each hand has been mentioned for close combat in western Europe during the<space/><link><target>Byzantine</target></link>,<extension extension_name='ref' name="Byzantine"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Tim Dawson PhD</arg><arg name="title">Byzantine Infantryman</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">12 June 2013</arg><arg name="date">7 September 2010</arg><arg name="publisher">Osprey Publishing</arg><arg name="isbn">978-1-84603-105-2</arg><arg name="page">48</arg></template></extension><space/><link><target>Medieval</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Renaissance era</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ShacklefordSpiritofSword"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Steve Shackleford</arg><arg name="title">Spirit Of The Sword: A Celebration of Artistry and Craftsmanship</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">12 June 2013</arg><arg name="date">7 September 2010</arg><arg name="publisher">Adams Media</arg><arg name="isbn">978-1-4402-1638-1</arg><arg name="page">48</arg></template></extension><space/>The use of a<space/><link><target>parrying dagger</target></link><space/>such as a main gauche along with a<space/><link><target>rapier</target></link><space/>is common in historical European martial arts.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Oxford Medieval warfare"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Clifford Rogers</arg><arg name="title">The Oxford Encyclopaedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">12 June 2013</arg><arg name="date">June 2010</arg><arg name="publisher">Oxford University Press</arg><arg name="isbn">978-0-19-533403-6</arg><arg name="page">240</arg></template></extension><space/>Traditional schools of<space/><link><target>Japanese martial arts</target></link><space/>include dual wield techniques, particularly a style of classical<space/><link><target>Japanese swordsmanship</target></link><space/>conceived by the<space/><link><target>Miyamoto Musashi</target></link><space/>involving the<space/><link><target>katana</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>wakizashi</target></link>, two-sword<space/><link><target>kenjutsu</target></link><space/>techniques he called<space/><italics><link><target>Niten Ichi-ry</target></link></italics>.<space/><link><target>Eskrima</target></link>, the traditional martial arts of the Philippines teaches<space/><italics>Doble Baston</italics><space/>techniques involving the basic use of a pair of<space/><link><target>rattan sticks</target></link><space/>and also Espada y daga or Sword/Stick and Dagger.<space/><link><target>Okinawan martial arts</target></link><space/>have a method that uses a pair of<space/><link><target>Sai (weapon)</target><part>''sai''</part></link>.<space/><link><target>Chinese martial arts</target></link><space/>involve the use of a pair of<space/><link><target>Butterfly swords</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Hook sword</target><trail>s</trail></link>.<space/><link><target>Gatka</target></link>, a weapon-based martial art from the<space/><link><target>Punjab region</target></link>, is known to use two sticks at a time.

Apart from having a dominant hand, human eyesight is subject to<space/><link><target>ocular dominance</target></link>. This has the effect of making it impossible to use the sight line of both guns at the same time, thus severely impairing the accuracy of the off-hand pistol. Additionally, pistols are reloaded in a standing position with the off-hand while the main hand holds the weapon. Occupying both hands with handguns means that one cannot conventionally reload either without discarding or holstering one.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Popular culture</heading><paragraph><template><target>refimprove section</target><arg name="date">July 2013</arg></template><link><target>File:Alison Carroll 20080927 Festival du jeu video 02.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Model dressed as Lara Croft dual wielding pistols</part></link>It is unknown when dual wielding was first used in fiction, but it was likely from early western novels before spilling over into other works.
