He started out in 1989 as a student at the current<space/><link><target>Radboud University Nijmegen</target></link><space/>in the Netherlands, where he lived in a typical student house with all the stereotypical side-kicks, such as the fat boy, the beer drinker, the bossy girl who checks if everybody keeps to the house rules, and the tramps who use the heated shared hallway to stay the night. Early DirkJans contained many references to the student life of<space/><link><target>Nijmegen</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Publication</heading><paragraph>DirkJan was first published in<space/><italics>Critic</italics>, the magazine for the local union of psychology students. It then moved on to monthly publication in the student magazine of Nijmegen (<link><target>Algemeen Nijmeegs Studentenblad</target></link>, ANS). DirkJan became known nationally when the then only commercial comics magazine of the Netherlands SjoSji (now defunct) started publishing the strip.</paragraph><paragraph>With the last move, the nature of the strip changed. Most of the student side-kicks got cancelled and DirkJan left university, first for jail (DJ is a notorious<space/><link><target>Kabouter</target></link><space/>abuser) and then to wander the globe and indeed space.</paragraph><paragraph>As of November 2007, there are thirteen DirkJan albums, tentatively named 'DirkJan 1' through 'DirkJan 13'.
