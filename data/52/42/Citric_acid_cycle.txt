The name of this metabolic pathway is derived from [[citric acid]] (a type of [[tricarboxylic acid]]) that is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of reactions to complete the cycle.  In addition, the cycle consumes acetate (in the form of [[acetyl-CoA]]) and [[water]], reduces [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] to NADH, and produces carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct.  The NADH generated by the TCA cycle is fed into the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] (electron transport) pathway.  The net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable chemical energy in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

In [[eukaryotic]] cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the [[mitochondrion]].  In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria which lack mitochondria, the TCA reaction sequence is performed in the [[cytosol]] with the proton gradient for ATP production being across the cell's surface ([[plasma membrane]]) rather than the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.

== Discovery ==

Several of the components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established in the 1930s by the research of the Nobel laureate [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1937 for his discoveries pertaining to [[fumaric acid]], a key component of the cycle.<ref name="Nobel_Prize_1937">{{cite web | url =  http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1937/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1937 | accessdate = 2011-10-26 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation }}</ref> The citric acid cycle itself was finally identified in 1937 by [[Hans Adolf Krebs]] while at the [[University of Sheffield]], for which he received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1953.<ref name="Nobel_Prize_1953">{{cite web | url =  http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1953/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1953 | accessdate = 2011-10-26 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation }}</ref>

== Overview ==
The citric acid cycle is a key metabolic pathway that unifies carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. The reactions of the cycle are carried out by 8 enzymes that completely oxidize acetate, in the form of [[acetyl-CoA]], into two molecules each of carbon dioxide and water. Through [[catabolism]] of sugars, fats, and proteins, a two-carbon organic product acetate in the form of acetyl-CoA is produced which enters the citric acid cycle. The reactions of the cycle also convert three equivalents of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD<sup>+</sup>) into three equivalents of reduced NAD<sup>+</sup> (NADH), one equivalent of [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD) into one equivalent of FADH<sub>2</sub>, and one equivalent each of [[guanosine diphosphate]] (GDP) and inorganic [[phosphate]] (P<sub>i</sub>) into one equivalent of [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP). The NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> generated by the citric acid cycle are in turn used by the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] pathway to generate energy-rich [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).

One of the primary sources of acetyl-CoA is from the breakdown of sugars by [[glycolysis]] which yield [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] that in turn is decarboxylated by the enzyme [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] generating acetyl-CoA according to the following reaction scheme:

* [[pyruvic acid|CH<sub>3</sub>C(=O)C(=O)O<sup>−</sup>]] (pyruvate) + [[Coenzyme A|HSCoA]] + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] → [[acetyl-CoA|CH<sub>3</sub>C(=O)SCoA]] (acetyl-CoA) + NADH + CO<sub>2</sub>

The product of this reaction, acetyl-CoA, is the starting point for the citric acid cycle. Acetyl-CoA may also be obtained from the oxidation of fatty acids. Below is a schematic outline of the cycle:

* The [[citric acid]] cycle begins with the transfer of a two-carbon [[acetyl]] group from [[acetyl-CoA]] to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate).
* The citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing two [[carboxyl]] groups as CO<sub>2</sub>. The carbons lost as CO<sub>2</sub> originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of the citric acid cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated carbons as CO<sub>2</sub> requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. However, because of the role of the citric acid cycle in [[anabolic|anabolism]],  they might not be lost, since many TCA cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules.<ref name="pmid2106256">{{cite journal | author = Wolfe RR, Jahoor F | title = Recovery of labeled CO2 during the infusion of C-1- vs C-2-labeled acetate: implications for tracer studies of substrate oxidation | journal = Am. J. Clin. Nutr. | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–52 |date=February 1990 | pmid = 2106256 | doi = }}</ref>
* Most of the energy made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle is transferred as energy-rich [[electrons]] to NAD<sup>+</sup>, forming NADH. For each acetyl group that enters the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH are produced.
* Electrons are also transferred to the electron acceptor Q, forming QH<sub>2</sub>.
* At the end of each cycle, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been regenerated, and the cycle continues.

== Steps ==
Two [[carbon]] atoms  are [[oxidation|oxidized]] to [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], the energy from these reactions being transferred to other metabolic processes by [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] (or [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and as electrons in [[NADH]] and [[Ubiquinol|QH<sub>2</sub>]]. The  NADH generated in the TCA cycle may later donate its electrons  [[oxidative phosphorylation]] to drive ATP synthesis; [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH<sub>2</sub>]] is covalently attached to [[succinate dehydrogenase]], an enzyme functioning both in the TCA cycle and the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] in oxidative phosphorylation. FADH<sub>2</sub>, therefore, facilitates transfer of electrons to [[coenzyme Q]], which is the final electron acceptor of the reaction catalyzed by the Succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, also acting as an intermediate in the electron transport chain.<ref name="Stryer">{{cite book | author = Stryer L, Berg J, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H.

The GTP that is formed by GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase may be utilized by [[nucleoside-diphosphate kinase]] to form ATP (the catalyzed reaction is GTP + ADP → GDP + ATP).<ref name="Stryer"/>

== Products ==
Products of the first turn of the cycle are: ''one GTP (or ATP), three NADH, one QH<sub>2</sub>, two CO<sub>2</sub>''.

Because two acetyl-CoA [[molecules]] are produced from each [[glucose]] molecule, two cycles are required per glucose molecule. Therefore, at the end of two cycles, the products are: two GTP, six NADH, two QH<sub>2</sub>, and four CO<sub>2</sub>''

The above reactions are balanced if P<sub>i</sub> represents the H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> ion, ADP and GDP the ADP<sup>2−</sup> and GDP<sup>2−</sup> ions, respectively, and ATP and GTP the ATP<sup>3−</sup> and GTP<sup>3−</sup> ions, respectively.

The total number of ATP obtained after complete oxidation of one glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] is estimated to be between 30 and 38.<ref name="pmid7654171"/>

== Efficiency ==
The theoretical maximum yield of ATP through oxidation of one molecule of glucose  in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] is 38 (assuming 3 [[molar equivalent]]s of ATP per equivalent NADH and 2 ATP per FADH<sub>2</sub>).  In eukaryotes, two equivalents of NADH are generated in [[glycolysis]], which takes place in the cytoplasm. Transport of these two equivalents into the mitochondria consumes two equivalents of ATP, thus reducing the net production of ATP to 36. Furthermore, inefficiencies in [[oxidative phosphorylation]] due to leakage of protons across the mitochondrial membrane and slippage of the [[ATP synthase]]/proton pump commonly reduces the ATP yield from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> to less than the theoretical maximum yield.<ref name="pmid7654171">{{cite journal | author = Porter RK, Brand MD | title = Mitochondrial proton conductance and H+/O ratio are independent of electron transport rate in isolated hepatocytes | journal = Biochem.

== Variation ==

While the TCA cycle is in general highly conserved, there is significant variability in the enzymes found in different taxa<ref name="Citric acid cycle variants at MetaCyc">{{cite web | title = Citric acid cycle variants at MetaCyc | url = http://www.biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=TCA-VARIANTS }}</ref> (note that the diagrams on this page are specific to the mammalian pathway variant).

Some differences exist between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The conversion of D-''threo''-isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate is catalyzed in eukaryotes by the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=1.1.1.41 EC 1.1.1.41], while prokaryotes employ the NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=1.1.1.42 EC 1.1.1.42].<ref name="pmid12005040">{{cite journal |author=Sahara T, Takada Y, Takeuchi Y, Yamaoka N, Fukunaga N |title=Cloning, sequencing, and expression of a gene encoding the monomeric isocitrate dehydrogenase of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Azotobacter vinelandii |journal=Biosci.

A step with significant variability is the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate. Most organisms utilize [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=6.2.1.5 EC 6.2.1.5], succinate–CoA ligase (ADP-forming) (despite its name, the enzyme operates in the pathway in the direction of ATP formation).

Some variability also exists at the previous step&nbsp;– the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. While most organisms utilize the ubiquitous NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, some bacteria utilize a ferredoxin-dependent 2-oxoglutarate synthase ([http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=1.2.7.3 EC 1.2.7.3]).<ref name="pmid19936047">{{cite journal |author=Baughn AD, Garforth SJ, Vilchèze C, Jacobs WR |title=An anaerobic-type alpha-ketoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase completes the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle of Mycobacterium tuberculosis |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=e1000662 |date=November 2009  |pmid=19936047 |pmc=2773412 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000662 |url=}}</ref>

== Regulation ==
The regulation of the TCA cycle is largely determined by product inhibition and substrate availability. If the cycle were permitted to run unchecked, large amounts of metabolic energy could be wasted in overproduction of reduced coenzyme such as NADH and ATP. The major eventual substrate of the cycle is ADP which gets converted to ATP. A reduced amount of ADP causes accumulation of precursor NADH which in turn can inhibit a number of enzymes. NADH, a product of all dehydrogenases in the TCA cycle with the exception of [[succinate dehydrogenase]], inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]],  [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]], and also [[citrate synthase]]. [[Acetyl-coA]] inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], while [[succinyl-CoA]] inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and [[citrate synthase]]. When tested in vitro with TCA enzymes,  ATP inhibits [[citrate synthase]] and [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]]; however, ATP levels do not change more than 10% in vivo between rest and vigorous exercise. There is no known [[allosteric]] mechanism that can account for large changes in reaction rate from an [[allosteric]] effector whose concentration changes less than 10%.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Voet D, Voet JG | year = 2004 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc. | location = New York | page = 615}}</ref>

Citrate is used for feedback inhibition, as it inhibits [[phosphofructokinase]], an enzyme involved in [[glycolysis]] that catalyses formation of [[fructose 1,6-bisphosphate]],a precursor of pyruvate. This prevents a constant high rate of flux when there is an accumulation of citrate and a decrease in substrate for the enzyme.

Recent work has demonstrated an important link between intermediates of the citric acid cycle and the regulation of [[hypoxia-inducible factors]] ([[HIF1A|HIF]]). HIF plays a role in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis, and is a transcription factor that targets angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, glucose utilization, iron transport and apoptosis. HIF is synthesized consititutively, and hydroxylation of at least one of two critical proline residues mediates their interaction with the von Hippel Lindau [[E3 ubiquitin ligase]] complex, which targets them for rapid degradation. This reaction is catalysed by [[prolyl hydroxylase|prolyl 4-hydroxylase]]s. Fumarate and succinate have been identified as potent inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylases, thus leading to the stabilisation of HIF.<ref name="pmid17182618">{{cite journal | author = Koivunen P, Hirsilä M, Remes AM, Hassinen IE, Kivirikko KI, Myllyharju J | title = Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylases by citric acid cycle intermediates: possible links between cell metabolism and stabilization of HIF | journal = J.

== Major metabolic pathways converging on the TCA cycle ==
Several [[catabolic]] pathways converge on the TCA cycle. Most of these reactions add intermediates to the TCA cycle, and are therefore known as [[anaplerotic reactions]], from the Greek meaning to “fill up”. Processes that remove intermediates from the cycle are termed "cataplerotic" reactions.

In this section and in the next, the citric acid cycle intermediates are indicated in ''italics'' to distinguish them from other substrates and end-products.

[[Pyruvate]] molecules produced by [[glycolysis]] are [[active transport|actively transported]] across the inner [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] membrane, and into the matrix where they can either be [[Redox|oxidized]] and combined with [[coenzyme A]] to form CO<sub>2</sub>, ''[[acetyl-CoA]]'', and [[NADH]],<ref name=Voet>{{cite book |last=Voet |first=Donald |author2=Judith G. Voet |author3=Charlotte W. Pratt  |title=Fundamentals of Biochemistry, 2nd Edition |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc. |year=2006 |pages=547, 556 |isbn=0-471-21495-7}}</ref>  or they can be [[carboxylated]] (by [[pyruvate carboxylase]]) to form ''oxaloacetate''. This latter reaction ”fills up” the amount of ''oxaloacetate'' in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic reaction, increasing the cycle’s capacity to metabolize ''acetyl-CoA'' when the tissue's energy needs (e.g. in [[striated muscle tissue|muscle]]) are suddenly increased by activity.<ref name=stryer>{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Citric acid cycle. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|publication-date= 1995 |pages= 509–527, 569–579, 614–616, 638–641, 732–735, 739–748, 770–773 |isbn= 0 7167 2009 4 }}</ref>

In the citric acid cycle all the intermediates (e.g. ''citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate'' and ''oxaloacetate'') are regenerated during each turn of the cycle. Adding more of any of these intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, during the course of the cycle, increase or decrease the amount of ''oxaloacetate'' available to combine with ''acetyl-CoA'' to form ''citric acid''. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.<ref name=stryer />

''Acetyl-CoA'', on the other hand, derived from pyruvate oxidation, or from the [[beta-oxidation]] of [[fatty acids]], is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn of the cycle one molecule of ''acetyl-CoA'' is consumed for every molecule of ''oxaloacetate'' present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of ''acetyl-CoA'' that produces CO<sub>2</sub> and water, with the energy thus released captured in the form of ATP.<ref name=stryer />

In the liver, the carboxylation of [[cytosol]]ic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial ''oxaloacetate'' is an early step in the [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic]] pathway which converts [[lactic acid|lactate]] and de-aminated [[alanine]] into glucose,<ref name=Voet /><ref name=stryer /> under the influence of high levels of [[glucagon]] and/or [[epinephrine]] in the blood.<ref name=stryer /> Here the addition of ''oxaloacetate'' to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (''malate'') is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of [[glycolysis]].<ref name=stryer />

In [[protein catabolism]], [[protein]]s are broken down by [[protease]]s into their constituent amino acids. Their carbon skeletons (i.e. the de-aminated amino acids) may either enter the citric acid cycle as intermediates (e.g. ''alpha-ketoglutarate'' derived from glutamate or glutamine), having an anaplerotic effect on the cycle, or, in the case of leucine, isoleucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, they are converted into ''acetyl-CoA'' which can be burned to CO<sub>2</sub> and water, or used to form [[ketone bodies]], which too can only be burned in tissues other than the liver where they are formed, or excreted via the urine or breath.<ref name=stryer /> These latter amino acids are therefore termed "ketogenic" amino acids, whereas those that enter the citric acid cycle as intermediates can only be cataplerotically removed by entering the gluconeogenic pathway via ''malate'' which is transported out of the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate and ultimately into [[glucose]]. These are the so-called "glucogenic" amino acids. De-aminated alanine, cysteine, glycine, serine, and threonine are converted to pyruvate and can consequently either enter the citric acid cycle as ''oxaloacetate'' (an anaplerotic reaction) or as ''acetyl-CoA'' to be disposed of as CO<sub>2</sub> and water.<ref name=stryer />

In [[fat catabolism]], [[triglyceride]]s are [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to break them into [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. In the liver the glycerol can be converted into glucose via [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] and [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] by way of gluconeogenesis. In many tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle tissue, fatty acids are broken down through a process known as [[beta oxidation]], which results in the production of mitochondrial ''acetyl-CoA'', which can be used in the citric acid cycle. Beta oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of [[methylene bridge]]s produces [[propionyl-CoA]], which is then converted into ''[[succinyl-CoA]]'' and fed into the citric acid cycle as an anaplerotic intermediate.<ref name="pmid2647392">{{cite journal | author = Halarnkar PP, Blomquist GJ | title = Comparative aspects of propionate metabolism | journal = Comp. Biochem. Physiol., B | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–31 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2647392 | doi = 10.1016/0305-0491(89)90270-8 }}</ref>

The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one (six-carbon) molecule of glucose by [[glycolysis]], the formation of 2 ''acetyl-CoA'' molecules, their catabolism in the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules, in eukaryotes. The number of ATP molecules derived from the beta oxidation of a 6 carbon segment of a fatty acid chain, and the subsequent oxidation of the resulting 3 molecules of ''acetyl-CoA'' is 40.

== Citric acid cycle intermediates serve as substrates for biosynthetic processes ==
In this subheading, as in the previous one, the TCA intermediated are identified by ''italics''.
  
Several of the  citric acid cycle intermediates are used for the synthesis of important compounds, which will have significant cataplerotic effects on the cycle.<ref name=stryer /> 
''Acetyl-CoA'' cannot be transported out of the mitochondrion. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, ''citrate'' is removed from the citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by [[ATP citrate lyase]] into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate can be used for gluconeogenesis (in the liver), or it can be returned into mitochondrion as ''malate''. The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is used for [[fatty acid synthesis]] and the [[Mevalonate pathway|production of cholesterol]]. Cholesterol can, in turn, be used to synthesize the [[Steroid#Steroidogenesis|steroid hormones]], [[Bile acids|bile salts]], and [[vitamin D]].<ref name=Voet /><ref name=stryer />

The carbon skeletons of many [[Essential amino acid|non-essential amino acids]] are made from citric acid cycle intermediates. To turn them into amino acids the [[Keto acid|alpha keto-acids]] formed from the citric acid cycle intermediates have to acquire their amino groups from [[glutamate]] in a [[transamination]] reaction, in which [[Pyridoxine|pyridoxal phosphate]] is a cofactor. In this reaction the glutamate is converted into [[alpha-Ketoglutaric acid|''alpha-ketoglutarate'']], which is a citric acid cycle intermediate. The intermediates that can provide the carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis are ''oxaloacetate'' which forms [[aspartate]] and [[asparagine]]; and ''alpha-ketoglutarate'' which forms [[glutamine]], [[proline]], and [[arginine]].<ref name=Voet /><ref name=stryer />

Of these amino acids, aspartate and glutamine are used, together with carbon and nitrogen atoms from other sources, to form the [[purines]] that are used as the bases in [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], as well as in [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]], [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]], [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]] and [[Coenzyme A|CoA]].<ref name=stryer />

The [[pyrimidines]] are partly assembled from aspartate (derived from ''oxaloacetate''). The pyrimidines, [[thymine]], [[cytosine]] and [[uracil]], form the complementary bases to the purine bases in DNA and RNA, and are also components of [[Cytidine triphosphate|CTP]], [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]], [[Uridine diphosphate|UDP]] and [[Uridine triphosphate|UTP]].<ref name=stryer />

The majority of the carbon atoms in the [[porphyrin]]s come from the citric acid cycle intermediate, ''[[succinyl-CoA]]''. These molecules are an important component of the [[hemoprotein]]s, such as [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]] and various [[cytochrome]]s.<ref name=stryer />

During gluconeogenesis [[Gluconeogenesis#Pathway|mitochondrial ''oxaloacetate'' is reduced to ''malate'']] which is then transported out of the mitochondrion, to be oxidized back to oxaloacetate in the cytosol. Cytosolic oxaloacetate is then decarboxylated to [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] by [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]], which is the rate limiting step in the conversion of nearly all the gluconeogenic precursors (such as the glucogenic amino acids and lactate) into glucose by the liver and kidney.<ref name=Voet /><ref name=stryer />

Because the citric acid cycle is involved in both [[catabolic]] and [[anabolic]] processes, it is known as an [[amphibole]] pathway.
