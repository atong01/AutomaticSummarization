The CERT concept differs because it includes nonmilitary emergencies, and is coordinated with all levels of emergency authorities, local to national, via an overarching<space/><link><target>incident command system</target></link>.</paragraph><preblock><preline>== CERT Organization ==</preline></preblock><paragraph>A<space/><link><target>local government</target></link><space/>agency, often a<space/><link><target>fire department</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>emergency management</target></link><space/>agency, agrees to sponsor CERT within its jurisdiction. The sponsoring agency liaises with, deploys and may train or supervise the training of CERT members. The sponsoring agency receives and disburses federal and state Citizen Corps grant funds allocated to its CERT program. Many sponsoring agencies employ a full-time community-service person as liaison to the CERT members. In some communities, the liaison is a volunteer and CERT member.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>As people are trained and agree to join the community emergency response effort, a CERT is formed. Initial efforts may result in a team with only a few members from across the community. As the number of members grow, a single community-wide team may subdivide. Multiple CERTs are organized into a hierarchy of teams consistent with<space/><link><target>Incident Command System</target><part>ICS</part></link><space/>principles. This follows the<space/><link><target>Incident Command System</target></link><space/>(ICS) principle of<space/><link><target>Span of control</target></link><space/>until the ideal distribution is achieved: one or more teams are formed at each neighborhood within a community.</paragraph><paragraph>A<space/><bold>Teen Community Emergency Response Team</bold><space/>(<bold>TEEN CERT</bold>), or<space/><bold>Student Emergency Response Team</bold><space/>(<bold>SERT</bold>), can be formed from any group of teens.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.floridadisaster.org/citizencorps/TeenCert/documents/0209%20Teen%20CERT%20Workbook.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="title">Teen CERT: Disaster Teen Training Guide<space/></arg><arg name="last1"><space/></arg><arg name="first1"><space/></arg><arg name="last2"><space/></arg><arg name="first2"><space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="website">floridadisaster.org<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Volunteer USA Foundation<space/></arg><arg name="access-date">17 July 2015<space/></arg><arg name="quote"></arg></template></extension><space/>A Teen Cert can be formed as a school club, service organization,<space/><link><target>Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)</target><part>Venturing</part></link><space/>Crew,<space/><link><target>Exploring (Learning for Life)</target><part>Explorer</part></link><space/>Post, or the training can be added to a school's graduation curriculum. Some CERTs form a club or service corporation, and recruit volunteers to perform training on behalf of the sponsoring agency. This reduces the financial and human resource burden on the sponsoring agency.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:FEMA - 7756 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 03-10-2003 in Maryland.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>250px</part><part>A CERT volunteer practices using a fire extinguisher.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>When not responding to disasters, CERTs may</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>raise funds for emergency response equipment in their community;</listitem><listitem>provide first-aid, crowd control or other services at community events;</listitem><listitem>hold planning, training, or recruitment meetings; and</listitem><listitem>conduct or participate in disaster response exercises.</listitem></list><paragraph>Some sponsoring agencies use Citizen Corps grant funds to purchase response tools and equipment for their members and team(s) (subject to Stafford Act limitations). Most CERTs also acquire their own supplies, tools, and equipment. As community members, CERTs are aware of the specific needs of their community and equip the teams accordingly.</paragraph><heading level='2'>CERT Response</heading><paragraph>The basic idea is to use CERT to perform the large number of tasks needed in emergencies. This frees highly trained professional responders for more technical tasks. Much of CERT training concerns the Incident Command System and organization, so CERT members fit easily into larger command structures.</paragraph><paragraph>A team may self-activate (self-deploy) when their own neighborhood is affected by disaster. An effort is made to report their response status to the sponsoring agency. A self-activated team will size-up the loss in their neighborhood and begin performing the skills they have learned to minimize further loss of life, property, and environment. They will continue to respond safely until redirected or relieved by the sponsoring agency or professional responders on-scene.</paragraph><paragraph>Teams in neighborhoods not affected by disaster may be deployed or activated by the sponsoring agency. The sponsoring agency may communicate with neighborhood CERT leaders through an<space/><link><target>Organic (military)</target><part>organic</part></link><space/>communication team. In some areas the communications may be by<space/><link><target>amateur radio</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Family Radio Service</target><part>FRS</part></link>,<space/><link><target>GMRS</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Multi-Use Radio Service</target><part>MURS</part></link><space/>radio, dedicated telephone or fire-alarm networks. In other areas, relays of bicycle-equipped runners can effectively carry messages between the teams and the local emergency operations center.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:FEMA - 7746 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 03-10-2003 in Maryland.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>250px</part><part>CERT volunteers try on their equipment.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The sponsoring agency may activate and dispatch teams in order to gather or respond to intelligence about an incident. Teams may be dispatched to affected neighborhoods, or organized to support operations. CERT members may augment support staff at an<space/><link><target>Incident Command Post</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Emergency Operations Center</target></link>. Additional teams may also be created to guard a morgue, locate supplies and food, convey messages to and from other CERT teams and local authorities, and other duties on an as-needed basis as identified by the team leader.</paragraph><paragraph>In the short term, CERTs perform data gathering, especially to locate mass-casualties requiring professional response, or situations requiring professional rescues, simple fire-fighting tasks (for example, small fires, turning off gas), light search and rescue, damage evaluation of structures,<space/><link><target>triage</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>first aid</target></link>. In the longer term, CERTs may assist in the evacuation of residents, or assist with setting up a neighborhood shelter.</paragraph><paragraph>While responding, CERT members are temporary volunteer government workers. In some areas, (such as<space/><link><target>California</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Hawaii</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Kansas</target></link>) registered, activated CERT members are eligible for worker's compensation for on-the-job injuries during declared disasters.</paragraph><heading level='2'>CERT Member Roles</heading><paragraph>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends that the standard, ten-person team be comprised as follows:<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">https://www.thewoodlandstownship-tx.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1551<space/></arg><arg name="title">Standing Operating Procedures<space/></arg><arg name="last1"><space/></arg><arg name="first1"><space/></arg><arg name="last2"><space/></arg><arg name="first2"><space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="website"><space/></arg><arg name="publisher">The Woodlands CERT Committee<space/></arg><arg name="access-date">17 July 2015<space/></arg><arg name="quote"></arg></template></extension></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><bold>CERT Leader</bold>. Generally, the first CERT team member arriving on the scene becomes team leader, and is the designated Incident Commander (IC) until the arrival of someone more competent. This person makes the IC initial assessment of the scene and determines the appropriate course of action for team members; assumes role of Safety Officer until assigned to another team member; assigns team member roles if not already assigned; designates triage area, treatment area, morgue, and vehicle traffic routes; coordinates and directs team operations; determines logistical needs (water, food, medical supplies, transportation, equipment, and so on.) and determines ways to meet those needs through team members or citizen volunteers on the scene; collects and writes reports on the operation and victims; and communicates and coordinates with the incident commander, local authorities, and other CERT team leaders. The team leader is identified by two pieces of crossed tape on the hard hat.</listitem><listitem><bold>Safety Officer</bold>.

This is important during a disaster response because not all members of a regular team may be available to respond. Hasty teams may be formed by whichever members are responding at the time. Additionally, members may need to adjust team roles due to stress, fatigue, injury, or other circumstances.</paragraph><heading level='2'>CERT Training</heading><paragraph>While state and local jurisdictions will implement training in the manner that best suits the community, the Citizen Corps CERT program has an established curriculum. Jurisdictions may augment the training, but are strongly encouraged to deliver the entire core content.
