In keeping with the [[Westminster system]] of governance, Barbados has evolved into am independent [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[Constitutional monarchy]], meaning that all [[political power]] rests with the Parliament under a non-political monarch as [[head of state]], which allows [[Monarchy of Barbados#stability|stability]].  Executive authority is vested in the monarch, who normally acts only on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who are collectively responsible to Parliament.<ref>[https://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/TheQueenandBarbados/Overview.aspx The Queen and the Commonwealth], Royal.gov.uk</ref> Barbadian law is rooted in [[English law|English common law]], and the [[Constitution of Barbados]] implemented in 1966, is the supreme [[law of the land]].

The Governor-General appoints as Leader of the Opposition the member of House of Assembly who commands the support of the largest number of members of that House in opposition to the ruling party's government.

The maximum duration of a Parliament is five years from the first sitting. There is a simultaneous dissolution of both Houses of Parliament by the Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister.

==History==
[[File:Simplification of govt structure of Barbados.gif|thumb|right|300px|A simplified diagram of the Barbados government]]
The government has been chosen by elections since [[Barbadian general election, 1961|1961 elections]], when Barbados achieved full [[Self-governing colony|self-governance]].  Before then, the government was a [[Crown colony]] consisting of either colonial administration solely (such as the [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]]), or a mixture of colonial rule and a partially elected assembly, such as the [[Legislative Council of Barbados|Legislative Council]].   

Since independence the [[Barbados Labour Party]] (BLP) governed from 1976 to 1986, and from September 1994 – 2008. The [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] (DLP) held office 1966 to 1976, from 1986 to 1994, and has formed the Government January 2008 to present.

== Executive branch ==
The Prime Minister and Cabinet are appointed from the [[political party]] which gains a simple majority in the [[Elections in Barbados|general election]]s held in Barbados.  These elections constitutionally must be held no longer than every five years apart; however, elections can be called whenever the Government chooses to seek a new mandate or loses a vote of [[no confidence]] in [[Parliament of Barbados|Parliament]].

==Law==
The [[Constitution of Barbados]] is the supreme law of the nation.<ref>[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Barbados/barbados66.html The official Constitution of Barbados] (1966) version.</ref> The Attorney General heads the independent [[judiciary]]. Historically, Barbadian law was based entirely on [[English common law]] with a few local adaptations. At the time of independence, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] lost its ability to legislate for Barbados, but the existing English and British common law and statutes in force at that time, together with other measures already adopted by the [[Barbadian Parliament]], became the basis of the new country's legal system.

Legislation may be shaped or influenced by such organisations as the United Nations, the [[Organization of American States]], or other international bodies to which Barbados has obligatory commitments by treaty. Additionally, through international co-operation, other institutions may supply the Barbados Parliament with key sample legislation to be adapted to meet local circumstances before enacting it as local law.

New acts are passed by the Barbadian Parliament and require [[royal assent]] by the Governor-General to become law.

==Judicial branch ==
{{main|Judiciary of Barbados}}

The local court system of Barbados is made up of:
*Magistrates' Courts: Covering Criminal, Civil, Domestic, Domestic Violence, and Juvenile matters. But can also take up matters dealing with Coroner's Inquests, Liquor Licences, and civil marriages. Further, the Magistrates' Courts deal with Contract and Tort law where claims do not exceed $10,000.00.<ref name="court">{{cite web|url=http://www.lawcourts.gov.bb/Aboutus.html |title=Law Courts of Barbados |publisher=Lawcourts.gov.bb |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>
*The [[Supreme Court of Barbados|Supreme Court]]: is made up of High Court and Court of Appeals.<ref name="court" />
**High Court: Consisting of Civil, Criminal, and Family law divisions.
**Court of Appeal: Handles appeals from the High Court and Magistrates' Court. It hears appeals in both the civil, and criminal law jurisdictions. It may consist of a single Justice of Appeal sitting in Chambers; or may sit as a Full Court of three Justices of Appeals.
*The [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ), (based in [[Port of Spain]], Trinidad and Tobago), is the court of last resort (final jurisdiction) over Barbadian law. It replaced the London-based [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (JCPC). The CCJ may resolve other disputed matters dealing with the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy|Caribbean Single Market and Economy]] (CSME).

==Perception==
[[Transparency International]] ranked Barbados as 17th place (of 179) in the world on its corruption perceptions index in 2010, with only one nation scoring better in the [[Western Hemisphere|Americas]]. ([http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results])
