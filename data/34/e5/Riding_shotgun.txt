== Etymology ==
The expression "riding shotgun"  is derived from "[[shotgun messenger]]", a colloquial term for "express messenger", in the days of [[stagecoach]] travel the person in the position next to the driver. However, apparently the phrase "riding shotgun" was not coined until 1919.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|title=Riding shotgun|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/riding-shotgun.html|accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref> It was later used in print and especially film depiction of stagecoaches and wagons in the [[Old West]] in danger of being robbed or attacked by [[bandit]]s. A special armed employee of the express service using the stage for transportation of bullion or cash would sit beside the driver, carrying a short [[shotgun]] (or alternatively a [[rifle]]),{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} to provide an armed response in case of threat to the cargo, which was usually a strongbox. Absence of an armed person in that position often signaled that the stage was not carrying a strongbox, but only passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/riding-shotgun.html|title=Riding shotgun|work=phrases.org.uk|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>

== Modern usage ==

More recently, the term has been applied to a [[game]], typically played by groups of friends to determine who rides beside the driver in a car. Typically, this involves claiming the right to ride shotgun by being the first person to call out "shotgun".  While there exist myriad additional rules for the game, such as a requirement that the vehicle be in sight, nearly all players agree that the game may only begin on the way to the car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bored.com/shotgunguide/index.htm|title=Shotgun Rules|work=bored.com|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref><ref name="Dalzell2008">{{cite book|author=Tom Dalzell|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=neVBmSyNRnEC&pg=PA877|date=25 July 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-19478-1|page=877}}</ref> In addition, a number of humorous rules for calling shotgun has been developed by organizations and individuals (for example, the "survival of the fittest rule").<ref>
