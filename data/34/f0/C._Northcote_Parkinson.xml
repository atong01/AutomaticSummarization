For example, on 16 October 1957, at 10 a.m., he spoke on this at the International Women's Club programme talk held at the Y.W.C.A. at Raffles Quay.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Singapore Diary.&quot;<space/><italics>The Straits Times</italics><space/>[Singapore] 16 Oct. 1957: 5.

Parkinson, it was reported, wanted to trace the illegibility of signatures, the attempt being made to fix the point in a successful executive career at which the handwriting becomes meaningless, even to the executive himself.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;A professor's cocktail party secret.&quot;The Straits Times [Singapore] 27 Oct. 1957: 8.

As J. D. Scott, in his review of Parkinson's book two weeks later, notes, &quot;Of course, Parkinson's Law, like all satire, is serious it wouldn't be so comic if it weren't and because it is serious there will be some annoyance and even dismay under the smiles.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>The Singapore Free Press 25 Apr. 1958: 13. Print: J. D. Scott's review of Parkinson Law and the Pursuit of Progress asks three questions, &quot;Why is staff always rising, although the volume of work remains steady or even goes down? Why did things go so well when we had that filthy little office at the back of the gasworks? And why has everything gone to pieces since we moved into the specially designed administration block?&quot; And then proceeds to answer them, referencing parts of the book.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>His celebrity did not remain local. Parkinson travelled to England, arriving there aboard the P. &amp; O. Canton, in early June 1958, as reported by Reuters, and made the front page of the Straits Times on the 9th of June.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;REUTER.&quot; The Straits Times [Singapore] 9 Jun. 1958: 1.

Parkinson of the University of Malaya, whose book, Parkinson's Law has sold more than 80,000 copies, has had a good deal of publicity since he arrived in England in the Canton.&quot; Romney noted that, &quot;a television interview was arranged, a profile of him appeared in a highbrow Sunday newspaper, columnists gave him almost as much space as they gave to Leslie Charteris, and he was honoured by the Institute of Directors, whose reception was attended by many of the most notable men in the commercial life of London.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Romney, Hall. &quot;Parkinson's Law author makes hit in London.&quot; The Straits Times [Singapore] 15 Jun. 1958: 13.

Parkinson is reported to have said &quot;Britain spent about $500 million building a naval base there [Singapore] and the only fleet which has used it is the Japanese.&quot; A navy spokesman, then, attempting to counter that statement said that the Royal Navy's Singapore base had only been completed in 1939, and, while it was confirmed that the Japanese had, indeed used it during the Second World War, it had been used extensively by the Royal Navy's Far East fleet, after the war.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Professor fires a broadside and the Navy replies: Base is main Far East centre.&quot; The Straits Times [Singapore] 26 Mar. 1959: 4.

The 120-page book of short studies, published in the United States and then in Britain, was illustrated by<space/><link><target>Osbert Lancaster</target></link><space/>and became an instant best seller. It explained the inevitability of bureaucratic expansion, arguing that 'work expands to fill the time available for its completion'.

He is reported to have said, &quot;Perhaps the day has gone by for public monuments except in a useful form. And if that be so, might not, some enterprise of local importance be graced with the late King's name? One plan he could certainly have warmly approved would be that of building a Central Public Library,&quot; he opined. Parkinson noted that the Raffles Library was growing in usefulness and would, in short time, outgrow the building that then housed it. He said, given the educational work that was producing a large literate population demanding books in English, Malay and Chinese, what was surely needed was a genuinely public library,air-conditioned to preserve the books, and of a design to make those books readily accessible. He suggested that the building, equipment and maintenance of the public library ought to be the responsibility of the Municipality rather than the Government.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Public Library as memorial to King.&quot; The Straits Times [Singapore] 24 Mar. 1952: 7.

McNeice, the then President of the Singapore City Council, as well as leading educationists of the time, thought the suggestion &quot;an excellent, first-class suggestion to meet a definite and urgent need.&quot; McNeice also agreed that the project ought to be the responsibility of the City Council. Also in favour of the idea was Director of Education, A. W. Frisby who thought that there ought to be branches of the library, which could be fed by the central library, Raffles Institution Principal P. F. Howitt, Canon R. K. S. Adams (Principal of St. Andrews School) and Homer Cheng, the President of the Chinese Y.M.C.A. Principal of the Anglo-Chinese School, H. H. Peterson suggested the authorities also consider a mobile school library.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Royal library plan praised.&quot; The Straits Times [Singapore] 25 Mar. 1952: 7. Print.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>While Parkinson had originally suggested that this be a Municipal and not a Government undertaking, something changed. A public meeting, convened by the Friends of Singapore - Parkinson was its President - at the British Council Hall on 15 May, decided that Singapore's memorial to King George VI would take the form of a public library, possibly with mobile units and sub-libraries in the out-of-town districts. Parkinson, in addressing the assembly noted that Raffles Library was not a free library, did not have vernacular sections, and its building could not be air-conditioned. McNeice, the Municipal President then proposed a resolution be sent to Government that the meeting considered the most appropriate memorial to the late King ought to take the form of a library (or libraries) and urged Government to set up a committee with enough non-Government representation, to consider the matter.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Library may be S'pore memorial.&quot; The Straits Times [Singapore] 16 May 1952: 7.

G. G.

From news coverage we learn that yet another committee had been formed, this time to consider what would be necessary to establish an institution along the lines of the London Polytechnic.

He asked that these be passed to the Raffles Library or the University of Malaya library, instead of being thrown away, as they might aid research and help those studying the history of the country to set down an account of what had happened in Malaya since 1867. &quot;The time will come when school-children will be taught the history of their own land rather than of Henry VIII or the capture of Quebec. Parkinson told his audience that there was a large volume of documentary evidence about Malaya written in Portuguese and Dutch. He said that the arrival of the Pluto in Singapore, one of the first vessels to pass through the Suez Canal when it opened in 1869, might be described as the moment when British Malaya was born. &quot;I would urge you not to scrap old correspondence just because it clutters up the office.

In his letter, Parkinson, who was still abroad attending the Anglo-American Conference of Historians, in London, said that the formation of an Archives Office was already in discussion, and was urgent, in view of the climate where documents were liable to damage by insects and mildew. He said that many private documents relating to Malaya were kept in the U.K., where they were not appreciated because names like Maxwell, Braddell and Swettenham might mean nothing there. &quot;The establishment of a Malayan Archives Office would do much to encourage the transfer of these documents,&quot; he wrote.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;ARCHIVES OFFICE URGED.&quot; The Straits Times [Singapore] 26 Sep. 1951: 8.

Of Malayan history, he said, it &quot;has mostly still to be written.

In June 1953 he urged the speedy establishment of a national archives, where, &quot;in air-conditioned rooms, on steel shelves, with proper skilled supervision and proper precaution against fire and theft, the records of Malayan history might be preserved indefinitely and at small expense. He noted that cockroaches had nibbled away at many vital documents and records, shrouding many years of Malaya's past in mystery, aided by moths and silverfish and abetted by negligent officials.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Lumps are being eaten out of our history.

According to the news report a large-scale project, developing a ten-volume series, the result of ten years of research by University of Malaya staff, was currently in progress, detailing events dating back to the Portuguese occupation of 1511, to the, then, present day. The first volume, written by Parkinson, covered the years 1867 to 1877 and was to be published within three months thence. It was estimated that the last volume would be released after 1960. The report noted that, as at that time, Parkinson and his wife had already released two books on history for junior students, entitled &quot;The Heroes&quot; and &quot;Malayan Fables.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;At lasta history book of Malaya.&quot; The Singapore Free Press 2 Apr. 1956: 7.

He told of his reorganisation of the Department of History during the last term to facilitate a new syllabus. The interview took place in Parkinson's sitting room beneath a frieze depicting Malaya's history, painted by Parkinson. Departing from the usual syllabus, Parkinson had decided to leave out European History almost entirely in order to give greater focus to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaya. The course, designed experimentally, takes in the study of world history up to 1497 in the first year, the impact of different European nations on Southeast Asia in the second year, and the study of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaya, after the establishment of British influence at the Straits Settlements in the third year. The students who make it through and decide to specialise in history will, then, have been brought to a point where they can profitably undertake original research in the history of modern Malaya, i.e. the 19th and 20th centuries, an area where, according to Parkinson, little had been done, with hardly any serious research attempted for the period after 'the transfer,' in 1867. Parkinson hoped that lecturing on this syllabus would ultimately produce a full-scale history of Malaya. This would include discovering documentation from Portuguese and Dutch sources from the time when those two countries still had a foothold in Malaya. He said that, while the period of development of the Straits Settlements under the East India Company were well-documented - the bulk of these archived at the Raffles Museum, local records after 1867 were not as plentiful and that it would be necessary to reconstruct those records from microfilm copies of documents kept in the United Kingdom. The task for the staff at the History Department was made formidable because their unfamiliarity with the Dutch and Portuguese languages. &quot;I have no doubt that the history of Malaya must finally be written by Malayans, but we can at least do very much to prepare the way.&quot; Parkinson told Wright. &quot;Scholars trained at this University in the spirit and technique of historical research, a study divorced from all racial and religious animosities, a study concerned only with finding the truth and explaining it in a lucid and attractive literary form, should be able to make a unique contribution to the mutual understanding of East and West,&quot; he said. &quot;History apart, nothing seems to be of more vital importance in our time than the promotion of this understanding. In no field at the present time does the perpetuation of distrust and mutual incomprehension seem more dangerous. If we can, from this university, send forth graduates who can combine learning and ways of thought of the Far East and of the West, they may play a great part in overcoming the barriers of prejudice, insularity and ignorance,&quot; he concluded.<extension extension_name='ref'>&quot;Towards A Full-Scale history Of Malaya by Noni Wright&quot; The Straits Times [Singapore] 29 Jan. 1951: 4.

Lecturer in Economics, P. Sherwood was appointed Parkinson's assistant. These measures were taken to ensure that rioters were dispersed and ejected if they trespassed onto University grounds.

In Parkinson's case, however, the council determined that that resignation had been submitted after the regulations came into effect, and a decision had been made to write to him, asking that he report back to work before a certain date, failing which the council said it was free to take any action they thought appropriate.<extension extension_name='ref'>Mahadeva, A. &quot;'NO CASE' AGAINST PROF.
