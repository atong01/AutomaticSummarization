'''Cologne''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|k|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n}}; [[German language|German]] '''''Köln''''' {{IPA-de|kœln||Koeln.ogg}}, {{lang-ksh|Kölle}} {{IPA-ksh|ˈkœɫə||Koelle.ogg}}), Germany's [[List of cities in Germany by population|fourth-largest city]] (after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Munich]]), is the largest city both in the German Federal State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and within the [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Area]], one of the major European metropolitan areas with more than ten million inhabitants.

Cologne is located on both sides of the [[Rhine]] River, fewer than eighty kilometers from [[Belgium]]. The city's famous [[Cologne Cathedral]] (''Kölner Dom'') is the seat of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[List of bishops and archbishops of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]]. The [[University of Cologne]] (''Universität zu Köln'') is one of Europe's oldest and largest universities.<ref name="Cologneeconomy">{{cite web|title= Economy|url= http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/economy|publisher= KölnTourismus|accessdate= 18 April 2011}}</ref>

Cologne was founded and established in [[Ubii]] territory in the first century AD as the [[Roman colony|Roman]] ''[[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]'', from which it gets its name.<ref name="Cologne History">{{cite web|title= From Ubii village to metropolis|url= http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/history/from_ubii_village_metropolis|publisher= City of Cologne|accessdate= 16 April 2011}}</ref> "Cologne", the French version of the city's name, has become standard in English as well. The city functioned as the capital of the Roman province of ''[[Germania Inferior]]'' and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks|Franks]] in 462. During the [[Middle Ages]] it flourished on one of the most important major [[trade routes]] between east and west in Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the [[Hanseatic League]] and one of the largest cities north of the [[Alps]] in medieval and Renaissance times. Up until World War II the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918-1926). Cologne was one of the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|most heavily-bombed cities]] in Germany during World War II, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) dropping 34,711 long tons of bombs on the city.<ref>http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201571.html</ref> The bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city. With the intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.

Cologne is a major cultural centre for the [[Rhineland]]; it hosts more than thirty museums and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture. The [[Cologne Trade Fair]] hosts a number of [[trade show]]s such as [[Art Cologne]], [[imm Cologne]], [[Gamescom]], and the [[Photokina]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Cologne|Timeline of Cologne}}

===Roman Cologne===
The first urban settlement on the grounds of modern-day Cologne was ''Oppidum Ubiorum'', founded in 38&nbsp;BC by the [[Ubii]], a [[Germani cisrhenani|Cisrhenian]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]. In 50&nbsp;AD, the Romans founded Colonia on the [[Rhine]]<ref name="Cologne History"/> and the city became the provincial capital of [[Germania Inferior]] in 85&nbsp;AD.<ref name="Facts and figures">{{cite web|title=Facts and figures|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/history/facts_and_figures|publisher=City of Cologne|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> The city was named "''[[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]''" in 50&nbsp;AD.<ref name="Facts and figures"/> Considerable Roman remains can be found in present-day Cologne, especially near the wharf area, where a notable discovery of a 1900-year-old Roman boat was made in late 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18208 |title=C.Michael Hogan, '&#39;Cologne Wharf'&#39;, The Megalithic Portal, editor Andy Burnham, 2007 |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref> From 260 to 271 Cologne was the capital of the [[Gallic Empire]] under [[Postumus]], [[Marcus Aurelius Marius|Marius]], and [[Victorinus]]. In 310 under [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] a bridge was built over the Rhine at Cologne. Roman imperial governors resided in the city and it became one of the most important trade and production centres in the Roman Empire north of the Alps.<ref name="Cologne History"/>

Maternus, who was elected as bishop in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] in 462. Parts of the original Roman sewers are preserved underneath the city, with the [[Cologne sewerage system|new sewerage system]] having opened in 1890.

===Middle Ages===
Early medieval Cologne was part of [[Austrasia]] within the [[Frankish Empire]].
Cologne had been the seat of a bishop since the Roman period; under [[Charlemagne]], in 795, bishop [[Hildebold]] was promoted to [[archbishop]].<ref name="Cologne History"/> In 843 Cologne became a city within the [[Treaty of Verdun]]-created [[East Francia]].

In 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power, when bishop [[Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne|Bruno]] was appointed as duke by his brother [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]]. In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his successors on the bishop's see with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the [[Electorate of Cologne]], formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the [[Rhine]] east of [[Jülich]], as well as the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] on the other side of the Rhine, beyond [[Berg (state)|Berg]] and [[County of Mark|Mark]].
By the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince elector, he was Arch-chancellor of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.

Following the [[Battle of Worringen]] in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a [[Free Imperial City|Free City]]. Archbishop [[Sigfried II von Westerburg]] was forced into exile in [[Bonn]].<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia">Harry de Quetteville. "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm History of Cologne]". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 28 November 2009.</ref>
The archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of capital punishment. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, which sentence was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge, the so-called "Greve". This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Besides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's Archbishop [[Rainald of Dassel]] gave the relics of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they in fact had been captured from [[Milan]]). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of [[Saint Ursula]] and [[Albertus Magnus]].<ref>Joseph P. Huffman, ''Family, Commerce, and Religion in London and Cologne'' (1998) covers from 1000 to 1300.</ref>

Cologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major [[trade route]]s between east and west and was the basis of Cologne's growth. By 1300 the city population were 50,000-55,000.<ref>T''he population of European cities'', Bairoch</ref> Cologne was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1475, when [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] confirmed the city's imperial immediacy.<ref name="Cologne History"/>

[[File:Cologn1411.jpg|thumb|550px|center|Cologne around 1411]]

===Early modern history===
The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterised by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub on the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organised by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.

As a free city, Cologne was a sovereign state within the Holy Roman Empire and as such had the right (and obligation) to maintain its own military force. As they wore a red uniform, these troops were known as the ''Rote Funken'' (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ("Reichskontingent") and fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France, when the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the ''Rote Funken''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rote-funken.de/ |title=Rote Funken – Kölsche Funke rut-wieß vun 1823 e.V. – Rote Funken Koeln |publisher=Rote-funken.de |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>

The free city of Cologne must not be confused with the [[Archbishopric of Cologne]] which was a state of its own within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Since the second half of the 16th century the archbishops were drawn from the [[Bavaria]] [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in [[Bonn]] and later in [[Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Brühl]] on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family, and supported by their outstanding status as [[Prince-elector|electors]], the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.

===From the 19th century until World War II===
[[File:Hängebrücke - Köln (1).tif|thumb|Hängebrücke]]
Cologne lost its status as a [[Free Imperial City|free city]] during the French period. According to the Peace [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (1801) all the territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] Empire. Cologne was part of the French [[Department (administrative division)|Département]] [[Roer (department)|Roer]] (named after the River Roer, German: [[Rur]]) with [[Aachen]] (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the [[Napoleonic code]] and removing the old elites from power. The [[Napoleonic code]] remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'') was introduced in the [[German Empire]]. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Cologne was made part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], first in the [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Jülich-Cleves-Berg province]] and then the [[Rhine province]].

The permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic [[Rhineland]] and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, [[Clemens August von Droste-Vischering]], was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (''Mischehenstreit''). In 1874, during the [[Kulturkampf]], Archbishop [[Paul Melchers]] was imprisoned before taking refuge in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, [[Konrad Adenauer]], became the first West German chancellor.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War&nbsp;I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing were especially successful, though heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the [[Ruhr area]]. The [[Cologne Cathedral|cathedral]], started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded [[German empire]] and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by contemporary buildings.

Cologne was designated as one of the [[Fortresses of the German Confederation]].<ref name=USM>[http://books.google.com/books?dq=%22Federal+Fortress+on+the+Upper+Rhine%22&pg=PA254&id=B77POH6Wgk4C United Services Magazine], December 1835</ref> It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of [[Verdun]] and [[Liège (city)|Liège]]) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altearmee.de/zwischenwerk/index.htm |title=Festung Köln |accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref> The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very densely built-up area within the city itself.

During [[World War&nbsp;I]] Cologne was the target of several minor air raids, but suffered no significant damage. Cologne was occupied by the [[British Army of the Rhine]] until 1926, under the terms of the Armistice and the subsequent [[Peace Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Treaty]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721598,00.html Cologne Evacuated], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 15 February 1926</ref>
In contrast with the harsh behaviour of the French occupation troops in Germany, the British forces were more lenient to the local population. [[Konrad Adenauer]], the mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and later a West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially since Britain had opposed French demands for a permanent Allied occupation of the entire Rhineland.

As part of the demilitarisation of the [[Rhineland]], the city's fortifications had to be dismantled. This was an opportunity to create two green belts (''Grüngürtel'') around the city by converting the fortifications and their fields of fire into large public parks. This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the [[University of Cologne]], closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the [[University of Strasbourg]] on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of [[Alsace]]. Cologne prospered during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at Müngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and [[Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport]] soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to [[Tempelhof International Airport|Berlin Tempelhof Airport]].

The democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the [[Nazi Party]] and other right wing parties. The Nazis then arrested the [[KPD|Communist]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] members of the city assembly, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed. Compared to some other major cities, however, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne. (Significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections had always been the national average.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080211085633/http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archivedate=11 February 2008 |title=Weimarer Wahlen |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/wrtwkoelnaachen.htm |title=Voting results 1919–1933 Cologne-Aachen |publisher=Wahlen-in-deutschland.de |date= |accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> By 1939 the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.

===World War II===
[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|The devastation of Cologne, 1945]]
During World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters (''Militärbereichshauptkommandoquartier'') for the [[Military district (Germany)|Military District]] (''Wehrkreis'') VI of [[Münster]]. Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in [[Bonn]], [[Siegburg]], [[Aachen]], [[Jülich]], [[Düren]], and [[Monschau]]. Cologne was home to the 211th Infantry Regiment and the 26th Artillery Regiment.

During the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II]], Cologne endured 262 air raids<ref>{{cite web|author=koelnarchitektur |url=http://www.koelnarchitektur.de/pages/de/home/news_archiv/823.htm |title=on the reconstruction of Cologne |publisher=Koelnarchitektur.de |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref> by the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the central part of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of "[[Operation Millennium]]", the first 1,000 bomber raid by the [[Royal Air Force]] in World War&nbsp;II. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary.<ref>Tourtellot, Arthur B. et al. ''Life's Picture History of World War&nbsp;II'', p. 237. Time, Inc., New York, 1950.</ref> This raid lasted about 75 minutes, destroyed {{convert|600|acre|ha|0}} of built-up area, killed 486 civilians and made 59,000 people homeless. By the end of the war, the population of Cologne had been reduced by 95 percent. This loss was mainly caused by a massive evacuation of the people to more rural areas. The same happened in many other German cities in the last two years of war. By the end of 1945, however, the population had already recovered to approximately 500,000.

By the end of the war, essentially all of Cologne's pre-war [[Jewish]] population of 11,000 had been deported or killed by the Nazis.<ref>Kirsten Serup-Bilfeld, Zwischen Dom und Davidstern. Jüdisches Leben in Köln von den Anfängen bis heute. Köln 2001, page 193</ref> The six synagogues of the city were destroyed. The [[Roonstrasse Synagogue|synagogue on Roonstraße]] was rebuilt in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgk.de/index.php/historie.html |title=Synagogen-Gemeinde Köln |publisher=Sgk.de |date=26 June 1931 |accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref>

===Post-war Cologne until today===
[[File:KölnFromTheISS.jpg|275px|thumb|Cologne, seen from the [[International Space Station]]]]
Despite Cologne's status as the largest city in the region, nearby [[Düsseldorf]] was chosen as the political capital of the [[States of Germany|federated state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. With [[Bonn]] being chosen as the provisional federal capital (''provisorische Bundeshauptstadt'') and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally [[West Germany]]), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centres. The city became - and still is - home to a number of federal agencies and organisations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.

In 1945 architect and urban planner [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]] called Cologne the "world's greatest heap of rubble". Schwarz designed the master plan for reconstruction in 1947, which included the construction of several new thoroughfares through the city centre, especially the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier when most of the city centre was in ruins.

The destruction of 95% of the city centre, including the famous [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]] such as [[St. Gereon's Basilica|St.&nbsp;Gereon]], [[Great St. Martin Church|Great St.&nbsp;Martin]], [[St.&nbsp;Maria im Kapitol]] and several other monuments in World War&nbsp;II, meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks such as the Gürzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of [[St. Kunibert (Cologne)|St.&nbsp;Kunibert]] was finished.

In 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1&nbsp;million for about one year from 1975. It remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1&nbsp;million again.

===Post-reunification===
In the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. The first was the growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strongly visual focal point in Cologne city centre and includes the ''KölnTurm'', one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. The second was the permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure, which made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.

Due to the economic success of the [[Cologne Trade Fair]], the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s, were rented out to [[RTL Group|RTL]], Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.

==Geography==
The metropolitan area encompasses over {{convert|405|km2|0|abbr=off}}, extending around a central point that lies at 50° 56' 33 latitude and 6° 57' 32 longitude. The city's highest point is {{convert|118|m|1|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the Monte Troodelöh) and its lowest point is {{convert|37.5|m|1|abbr=on}} above sea level (the [[Worringer Bruch]]).<ref>Bezirksregierung Köln: Topografische Karte 1:50.000 (TK 50), Blatt L 5108 Köln-Mülheim.

Cologne is the fourth-largest city in Germany in terms of inhabitants after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Munich]]. As of 30 June 2011, there were officially 1,010,269 residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/amtlichebevoelkerungszahlen/index.html |title=Information und Technik Nordrhein-Westfalen (IT.NRW) – Amtliche Bevölkerungszahlen |publisher=It.nrw.de |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> Cologne is the core city of the [[Cologne/Bonn Region]] with around 3&nbsp;million inhabitants (including the neighbouring cities of [[Bonn]], [[Hürth]], [[Leverkusen]], and [[Bergisch Gladbach]]).

According to local statistics, in 2006 the population density in the city was 2,528 inhabitants per square kilometre. 31.4 percent of the population had migrated there, and 17.2 percent of Cologne's population was non-German.

==Government==
{{See also|Cologne City Hall}}
The city's administration is headed by the [[List of mayors of Cologne|mayor]] and the three deputy mayors. [[Jürgen Roters]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) has been mayor since 20 October 2009.<ref name=CologneMayor>{{cite web|title=Der Oberbürgermeister|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/1/oberbuergermeister/|accessdate=15 April 2011|language=German}}</ref>

===Political traditions and developments===
The long tradition of a free imperial city, which long dominated an exclusively Catholic population and the age-old conflict between the church and the bourgeoisie (and within it between the patricians and craftsmen) has created its own political climate in Cologne. Various interest groups often form networks beyond party boundaries. The resulting web of relationships, with political, economic, and cultural links with each other in a system of mutual favours, obligations and dependencies, is called the 'Cologne coterie'. This has often led to an unusual proportional distribution in the city government and degenerated at times into corruption: in 1999, a "waste scandal" over kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions came to light, which led not only to the imprisonment of the entrepreneur Hellmut Trienekens, but also to the downfall of almost the entire leadership of the ruling Social Democrats.

===Mayor===
The Lord Mayor of Cologne is [[Jürgen Roters]] of the SPD. As the joint candidate of the SPD and the Greens, he received 54.67% of the vote at the municipal election on 30 August 2009 and was appointed on 21 October 2009. On 18 October 2015, independent candidate [[Henriette Reker]] was elected as his successor with 52.66% of the vote (preliminary result).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://wahlen.stadt-koeln.de/prod/OB2015/05315000/html5/Oberbuergermeisterwahl_Gemeinde_Stadt_Koeln.html|title = Oberbürgermeisterwahl – Wahl des/der Oberbürgermeisters/in 2015 in der Stadt Köln – Gesamtergebnis|accessdate = 18 October 2015|website = stadt-koeln.de|language = de}}</ref>

The inner city of Cologne was completely destroyed during World War&nbsp;II. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the "Wiederaufbauzeit" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house by [[Wilhelm Riphahn]], are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the [[Cologne Opera]] house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.

Green areas account for over a quarter of Cologne, which is approximately {{convert|75|m2|2|abbr=on}} of public green space for every inhabitant.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Cologne|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/exploring_city/green_cologne|publisher=KölnTourismus|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>

==Wildlife==
The presence of animals in Cologne is generally limited to insects, small rodents, and several species of birds. [[Pigeon]]s are the most often seen animals in Cologne, although the number of birds is augmented each year by a growing population of [[Feral organism|feral]] exotics, most visibly [[parrots]] such as the [[rose-ringed parakeet]]. The sheltered climate in southeast [[Westphalia]] allows these birds to survive through the winter, and in some cases they are displacing native species. The plumage of Cologne's green [[parrots]] is highly visible even from a distance, and contrasts starkly with the otherwise muted colours of the cityscape.<ref>{{cite web|title=In NRW behaupten sich immer mehr exotische Vögel|url=http://www.rp-online.de/wissen/leben/in-nrw-behaupten-sich-immer-mehr-exotische-voegel-1.2313710|publisher=RP Online|accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref>

==Tourism==
Cologne had 4.31&nbsp;million overnight stays booked and 2.38&nbsp;million arrivals in 2008.<ref name="Cologneglance"/> The city also has the most pubs per capita in Germany.<ref name="Nightlife">{{cite web|title=Nightlife|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/nightlife|publisher=KölnTourismus|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> The city has 70 clubs, "countless" bars, restaurants, and pubs.<ref name="Nightlife"/>

===Landmarks===

====Churches====
* [[Cologne Cathedral]] (German: ''Kölner Dom'') is the city's most famous monument and the Cologne residents' most loved landmark. It is a [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] church, started in 1248, and completed in 1880. In 1996, it was designated a [[World Heritage site]]; it houses the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]], which supposedly contains the [[relic]]s of the [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] (see also<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=dreikoenigenschrein |title=Offizielle Webseite des Kölner Doms &#124; Bedeutende Werke |publisher=Koelner-dom.de |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>). Residents of Cologne sometimes refer to the cathedral as "the eternal construction site" (''die ewige Baustelle'').
* [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]]: These buildings are outstanding examples of medieval church architecture. The origins of some of the churches go back as far as Roman times, for example St.&nbsp;Gereon, which was originally a chapel in a Roman graveyard. With the exception of St. Maria Lyskirchen all of these churches were very badly damaged during World War&nbsp;II. Reconstruction was only finished in the 1990s.

====Medieval houses====
The Cologne City Hall (''Kölner Rathaus''), founded in the 12th century, is the oldest [[city hall]] in Germany still in use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cologne.strategicmanagement.net/tuesday.php |title=Strategic Management Society – Cologne Conference – Cologne Information |publisher=Cologne.strategicmanagement.net |date=14 October 2008 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref> The Renaissance style loggia and tower were added in the 15th century. Other famous buildings include the Gürzenich, Haus Saaleck and the Overstolzenhaus.

===Streets===
{{Main|Streets in Cologne}}
* The [[Cologne Ring]] boulevards (such as ''Hohenzollernring'', ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ring'', ''Hansaring'') with their medieval city gates (such as ''Hahnentorburg'' on ''Rudolfplatz'') are also known for their night life.
* [[Hohe Straße]] (literally: ''High Street'') is one of the main shopping areas and extends past the cathedral in an approximately southerly direction. The street contains many gift shops, clothing stores, fast food restaurants and electronic goods dealers.
* [[Schildergasse]] – connects ''Neumarkt'' square at its western end to the ''Hohe Strasse'' shopping street at its eastern end and has been named the busiest shopping street in Europe with 13,000 people passing through every hour.
* Ehrenstraße – the shopping area around ''Apostelnstrasse'', ''Ehrenstrasse'', and ''Rudolfplatz'' is a little more on the quirky and stylish side.

===Bridges===
Several bridges cross the Rhine in Cologne. They are (from South to North): the [[Cologne Rodenkirchen Bridge]], [[South Bridge (Cologne)|South Bridge]] (railway), Severin Bridge, Deutz Bridge, [[Hohenzollern Bridge]], Zoo Bridge (''Zoobrücke'') and [[Cologne Mülheim Bridge]]. In particular the iron [[tied arch bridge|tied arch]] Hohenzollern Bridge (''Hohenzollernbrücke'') is a dominant landmark along the river embankment. A Rhine river crossing of a special kind is provided by the [[Cologne Cable Car]] (German: ''Kölner Seilbahn''), a cableway that runs across the Rhine between the [[Cologne Zoological Garden]] in Riehl and the [[Rheinpark]] in Deutz.

===High-rise structures===
Cologne's tallest structure is the [[Colonius]] telecommunication tower at {{convert|266|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}. The observation deck has been closed since 1992. A selection of the tallest buildings in Cologne is listed below. Other tall structures include the Hansahochhaus (designed by architect Jacob Koerfer and completed in 1925—it was at one time Europe's tallest office building), the Kranhaus buildings at [[Rheinauhafen]], and the [[Messeturm Köln]] ("trade fair tower").

==Culture==
[[File:Kolumba Köln - Innenhof.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the [[Kolumba]] museum in 2007, designed by [[Peter Zumthor]]]]
Cologne has [[List of museums in Cologne|several museums]]. The famous [[Roman-Germanic Museum]] features art and architecture from the city's distant past; the [[Museum Ludwig]] houses one of the most important collections of [[modern art]] in Europe, including a [[Picasso]] collection matched only by the museums in [[Museu Picasso|Barcelona]] and [[Musée Picasso|Paris]]. The [[Museum Schnütgen]] of religious art is partly housed in St.&nbsp;Cecilia, one of Cologne's [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]].

Several orchestras are active in the city, among them the [[Gürzenich Orchestra]] and the [[WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne]], both based at the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra Building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6  |title=Kölner Philharmonie |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=11 December 2007 |accessdate=8 August 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071211142559/http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6 |archivedate = 11 December 2007}}</ref> Other orchestras are the [[Musica Antiqua Köln]] and the [[WDR Rundfunkorchester Köln]], as well as the [[Cologne Opera]] and several choirs, including the [[WDR Rundfunkchor Köln]]. Cologne was also an important hotbed for electronic music in the 1950s (Studio für elektronische Musik, [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] was involved in promoting musical movements such as [[Krautrock]] in the 1970s; the influential [[Can (band)|Can]] was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the ''Kwartier Latäng'' (the student quarter around the Zülpicher Straße) and the nightclub-studded areas around [[Hohenzollernring]], Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.

The large annual literary festival Lit. Cologne features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is writer [[Heinrich Böll]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].

Cologne is well known for its beer, called [[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]]. [[Colognian language|Kölsch]] is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of Kölsch being the only language one can drink.

Cologne is also famous for [[Eau de Cologne]] (German: ''Kölnisch Wasser''; lit: "Water of Cologne"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate [[Johann Maria Farina]] at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and ''Farina'' became a household name for ''Eau de Cologne''. In 1803 Wilhelm Mülhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and Mühlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years, and after various court battles, his grandson [[Ferdinand Mülhens]] was forced to abandon the name ''Farina'' for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during the French occupation in the early 19th century, [[4711 (brand)|4711]]. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the [[Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz|Farina family]], currently in the eighth generation, and by [[Mäurer & Wirtz]] who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.

===Carnival===
The [[Cologne carnival]] is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11&nbsp;a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until [[Ash Wednesday]]. However, the so-called "Tolle Tage" (crazy days) do not start until ''Weiberfastnacht'' (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, ''Wieverfastelovend'', the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of the street carnival.

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Cologne}}

===Road transport===
[[File:Koelner Ring.png|thumb|left|Major [[List of streets in Cologne|roads through and around Cologne]].]]
Road building had been a major issue in the 1920s under the leadership of mayor [[Konrad Adenauer]]. The first German limited access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and [[Bonn]]. Today, this is the [[Bundesautobahn 555]]. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ringroad. Roughly at the same time a city centre bypass (''Stadtautobahn'') was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became ''Bundesstraße ("Federal Road") B 55a'' which begins at the ''Zoobrücke'' ("Zoo Bridge") and meets with [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] and [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as ''Stadtautobahn'' by most locals. In contrast to this the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre through-route, which had already been anticipated by planners such as [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] in the 1920s. The last section south of ''Ebertplatz'' was completed in 1972.

In 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was opened to traffic on [[Bundesautobahn&nbsp;3]], part of the eastern section of the [[Cologne Beltway]] between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.

===Cycling===

Compared to other German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout that is not very [[bicycle-friendly]]. It has repeatedly ranked among the worst in an independent evaluation<ref>http://www.adfc.de/fahrradklima-test/adfc-startet-fahrradklima-test/adfc-fahrradklima-test-2014</ref> conducted by the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Fahrrad-Club]]. In 2014 it ranked 36th out of 39 German cities with a population greater than 200,000.

===Rail transport===
Cologne has a railway service with [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[InterCity]] and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]]-trains stopping at ''[[Köln Hauptbahnhof]]'' (Cologne Main Station), ''[[Köln Messe/Deutz station|Köln Messe/Deutz]]'' and ''[[Cologne/Bonn Airport station|Cologne/Bonn Airport]]''. ICE and [[Thalys|TGV Thalys]] high-speed trains link Cologne with [[Amsterdam]], Brussels (in 1h47, 9 departures/day) and Paris (in 3h14, 6 departures/day). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including [[Frankfurt am Main]] and Berlin. ICE Trains to London via the [[Channel Tunnel]] were planned for 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/travel/travel-news/highspeed-trains-to-link-england-and-germany-20111013-1lmq8.html |title=High-speed trains to link England and Germany |publisher=Brisbanetimes.com.au |date=16 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref>

It evolved from the [[tram]] system. Nearby [[Bonn]] is linked by both the Stadtbahn and main line railway trains, and occasional recreational boats on the [[Rhine]]. [[Düsseldorf]] is also linked by [[S-Bahn]] trains which are operated by Deutsche Bahn.

There are also frequent buses covering most of the city and surrounding suburbs, and [[Eurolines]] coaches to London via [[Brussels]].

===Water transport===
''[[Häfen und Güterverkehr Köln]]'' (Ports and Goods traffic Cologne, HGK) is one of the largest operators of [[inland port]]s in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hgk.de/neu/english/contents/HGK_ports_cargo-handling-points.html |title=Häfen und Güterverkehr Köln AG |publisher=Hgk.de |date= |accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> Ports include Köln-Deutz, Köln-Godorf, and Köln-Niehl&nbsp;I and II.
