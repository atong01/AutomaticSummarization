The crankshaft is connected to the fly-wheel (used to smooth out shock and convert energy to torque), the engine block, using bearings on the main journals, and to the pistons via their respective con-rods. An engine loses up to 75% of its generated energy in the form of friction, noise and vibration in the crankcase and piston area.<template><target>cn</target><arg name="date">July 2015</arg></template><space/>The remaining losses occur in the valvetrain (timing chains, belts, pulleys, camshafts, lobes, valves, seals etc.) heat and blow by.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Bearings</heading><paragraph>The crankshaft has a linear<space/><link><target>Axis of rotation</target><part>axis</part></link><space/>about which it rotates, typically with several<space/><link><target>bearing journal</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>riding on replaceable<space/><link><target>Bearing (mechanical)</target><part>bearings</part></link><space/>(the<space/><link><target>main bearing</target><trail>s</trail></link>) held in the engine block. As the crankshaft undergoes a great deal of sideways load from each cylinder in a multicylinder engine, it must be supported by several such bearings, not just one at each end. This was a factor in the rise of<space/><link><target>V8 engine</target><trail>s</trail></link>, with their shorter crankshafts, in preference to<space/><link><target>straight-8</target></link><space/>engines. The long crankshafts of the latter suffered from an unacceptable amount of flex when engine designers began using higher<space/><link><target>compression ratio</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and higher rotational speeds. High performance engines often have more main bearings than their lower performance cousins for this reason.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Piston stroke</heading><paragraph>The distance the axis of the crank throws from the axis of the crankshaft determines the piston<space/><link><target>stroke (engines)</target><part>stroke</part></link><space/>measurement, and thus<space/><link><target>engine displacement</target></link>. A common way to increase the low-speed torque of an engine is to increase the stroke, sometimes known as &quot;shaft-stroking.&quot; This also increases the<space/><link><target>engine balance</target><part>reciprocating vibration</part></link>, however, limiting the high speed capability of the engine. In compensation, it improves the low speed operation of the engine, as the longer intake stroke through smaller valve(s) results in greater turbulence and mixing of the intake charge. Most modern high speed production engines are classified as &quot;over square&quot; or short-stroke, wherein the stroke is less than the diameter of the<space/><link><target>cylinder bore</target></link>. As such, finding the proper balance between shaft-stroking speed and length leads to better results.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Engine configuration</heading><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Engine configuration</target><part>configuration</part></link><space/>and number of pistons in relation to each other and the crank leads to<space/><link><target>straight engine</target><part>straight</part></link>,<space/><link><target>V engine</target><part>V</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>flat engine</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The same basic<space/><link><target>engine block</target></link><space/>can be used with different crankshafts, however, to alter the<space/><link><target>firing order</target></link>; for instance, the 90<space/><link><target>V6 engine</target></link><space/>configuration, in older days sometimes derived by using six cylinders of a<space/><link><target>V8 engine</target></link><space/>with what is basically a shortened version of the V8 crankshaft, produces an engine with an<space/><link><target>V6 engine#Odd and even firing</target><part>inherent pulsation in the power flow</part></link><space/>due to the &quot;missing&quot; two cylinders. The same engine, however, can be made to provide evenly spaced power pulses by using a crankshaft with an individual crank throw for each cylinder, spaced so that the pistons are actually phased 120 apart, as in the<space/><link><target>GM 3800 engine</target></link>. While production V8 engines use four crank throws spaced 90 apart, high-performance V8 engines often use a &quot;flat&quot; crankshaft with throws spaced 180 apart. The difference can be heard as the flat-plane crankshafts result in the engine having a smoother, higher-pitched sound than cross-plane (for example,<space/><link><target>IndyCar Series</target><part>IRL IndyCar Series</part></link><space/>compared to<space/><link><target>Sprint Cup Series</target><part>NASCAR Sprint Cup Series</part></link>, or a<space/><link><target>Ferrari 355</target></link><space/>compared to a<space/><link><target>Chevrolet Corvette</target></link>).

The low alloy content also makes the material cheaper than high alloy steels. Carbon steels are also used, but these require additional heat treatment to reach the desired properties. Iron crankshafts are today mostly found in cheaper production engines (such as those found in the Ford Focus diesel engines) where the loads are lower. Some engines also use cast iron crankshafts for low output versions while the more expensive high output version use forged steel.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Machining</heading><paragraph>Crankshafts can also be<space/><link><target>Machining</target><part>machined</part></link><space/>out of a<space/><link><target>Billet (manufacturing)</target><part>billet</part></link>, often a bar of high quality vacuum remelted steel. Though the fiber flow (local inhomogeneities of the material's chemical composition generated during casting) doesnt follow the shape of the crankshaft (which is undesirable), this is usually not a problem since higher quality steels, which normally are difficult to forge, can be used. These crankshafts tend to be very expensive due to the large amount of material that must be removed with lathes and milling machines, the high material cost, and the additional heat treatment required. However, since no expensive tooling is needed, this production method allows small production runs without high costs.</paragraph><paragraph>In an effort to reduce costs, used crankshafts may also be machined. A good core may often be easily reconditioned by a crankshaft grinding<space/><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Crankshaft Grinding</arg><arg name="url">http://crankshaftrepair.org/grinding/</arg><arg name="publisher">Crankshaft Repair</arg></template></extension><space/>process. Severely damaged crankshafts may also be repaired with a welding operation, prior to grinding, that utilizes a submerged arc welding machine. To accommodate the smaller journal diameters a ground crankshaft has, and possibly an over-sized thrust dimension, undersize engine bearings are used to allow for precise clearances during operation.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Microfinishing</heading><paragraph>To achieve the required specifications, automotive manufacturers which design and produce high-volume, low-cost powertrain components, strive toward surpassing stringent emissions and efficiency regulations (see Euro 6c standards for reference<template><target>full</target><arg name="date">July 2015</arg></template>) to reduce losses. In motorsport, powertrain developers strive to increase power output by reducing weight, using strong metal alloys, hardening crankshafts, improving balance, reducing friction and vibration as previously described.</paragraph><paragraph>To achieve the required specifications, automotive and motorsport powertrain designers and manufacturers adopt a process called microfinishing. Microfinishing (or superfinishing) is an engineering function concerned with metrology and tribology. Microfinishing takes place after the crankshaft grinding process, and is used to improve the geometry of the crankshaft journals from waviness, peaks and lapping caused by the grinding process and establish surface roughness as low as<space/><link><target>surface roughness#amplitude parameters</target><part>''R''<xhtml:sub>a</xhtml:sub></part></link>&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.01&amp;nbsp;m if required.</paragraph><paragraph>Microfinished crankshafts show improved roundness and cylindricity for each main and pin and thrust journal, and where applicable the oil seal journal. Another important function to a geometrically correct shape is to provide it with a specific surface roughness as per design requirements for optimum lubrication hydrodynamics (essential for crankshafts in engines with stop/start fuel saving technology).</paragraph><paragraph>Today, crankshafts used in outboard engines, motorbikes, cars, trucks, busses, marine engines and electric generators and racing engines, are all microfinished for optimum performance. They are designed and manufactured to transfer as much energy to the fly-wheel and drivetrain and absorb as much power from the con-rods, as efficiently as possible for as long as possible.</paragraph><paragraph>With this new technology, a light weight, turbocharged 2.0 liter, 4 cylinder diesel engine, (with a low-cost 4 pin, 5 main induction hardened, cast steel, microfinished crankshaft), in a small family car, potentially delivers 180 hp and provides an average fuel consumption of 60 miles per gallon and beyond.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Fatigue strength</heading><paragraph>The fatigue strength of crankshafts is usually increased by using a radius at the ends of each main and crankpin bearing. The radius itself reduces the stress in these critical areas, but since the radius in most cases is rolled, this also leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface, which prevents cracks from forming.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Hardening</heading><paragraph>Most production crankshafts use induction hardened bearing surfaces, since that method gives good results with low costs. It also allows the crankshaft to be reground without re-hardening. But high performance crankshafts, billet crankshafts in particular, tend to use<space/><link><target>nitridization</target></link><space/>instead. Nitridization is slower and thereby more costly, and in addition it puts certain demands on the alloying metals in the steel to be able to create stable nitrides. The advantage of nitridization is that it can be done at low temperatures, it produces a very hard surface, and the process leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface, which is good for fatigue properties. The low temperature during treatment is advantageous in that it doesnt have any negative effects on the steel, such as<space/><link><target>Annealing (metallurgy)</target><part>annealing</part></link>. With crankshafts that operate on roller bearings, the use of<space/><link><target>carburization</target></link><space/>tends to be favored due to the high<space/><link><target>Hertzian contact stress</target><trail>es</trail></link><space/>in such an application. Like nitriding, carburization also leaves some compressive residual stresses in the surface.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Counterweights</heading><paragraph>Some expensive, high performance crankshafts also use heavy-metal counterweights to make the crankshaft more compact. The heavy-metal used is most often a<space/><link><target>tungsten</target></link><space/>alloy but<space/><link><target>depleted uranium</target></link><space/>has also been used. A cheaper option is to use lead, but compared with tungsten its density is much lower.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Stress on crankshafts</heading><paragraph>The shaft is subjected to various forces but generally needs to be analysed in two positions.Firstly, failure may occur at the position of maximum bending; this may be at the centre of the crank or at either end. In such a condition the failure is due to bending and the pressure in the cylinder is maximal. Second, the crank may fail due to twisting, so the conrod needs to be checked for shear at the position of maximal twisting. The pressure at this position is the maximal pressure, but only a fraction of maximal pressure.''<template><target>Clarify</target><arg name="date">July 2014</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><paragraph><template><target>Commons</target><arg>Crankshaft</arg></template><template><target>div col</target><arg>2</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Crankset</target><part>Bicycle crankset</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Brace (tool)</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Cam</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Camshaft</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Crankcase</target></link>, the housing that surrounds the crankshaft</listitem><listitem><link><target>Torsional vibration#Crankshaft torsional vibration</target><part>Crankshaft torsional vibration</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Crank (mechanism)</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Hudson Motor Car Company</target></link>, balanced crankshaft in 1916 allowed higher RPM &amp; more power</listitem><listitem><link><target>Piston motion equations</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Tunnel crankshaft</target></link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>div col end</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>2</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Sources</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>Citation</target><arg name="last"><space/>Hall
