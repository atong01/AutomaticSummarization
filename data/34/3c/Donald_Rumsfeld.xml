After serving in the<space/><link><target>United States Navy</target><part>Navy</part></link><space/>for three years, he mounted a campaign for Congress in Illinois' 13th Congressional District, winning in 1962 at the age of 30.

Called back to Washington in August 1974, Rumsfeld was appointed Chief of Staff by President Ford, and soon successfully urged Ford to veto an expansion of the Freedom of Information Act, though the veto was easily overridden. Rumsfeld recruited a young one-time staffer of his,<space/><link><target>Dick Cheney</target></link>, to succeed him when Ford nominated him Secretary of Defense in 1975.</paragraph><paragraph>When Ford lost the 1976 election, Rumsfeld returned to private business life, and was named president and CEO of the<space/><link><target>pharmaceutical</target></link><space/>corporation<space/><link><target>G.

During his tenure, he was a leading<space/><link><target>neoconservative</target></link><space/>voice and one of the key individuals responsible for the restructuring of the military in the new 21st century.
