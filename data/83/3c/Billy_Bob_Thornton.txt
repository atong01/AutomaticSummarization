== Career ==

===Acting and filmmaking===
[[File:BillyBobThorntonPointsSXSW2009 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Thornton at the [[South by Southwest]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on March 11, 2008]]
Thornton's first screen role was in 1980's ''South of Reno'', where he played a small role as a counter man in a restaurant. He also made an appearance as a pawn store clerk in the 1987 ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' episode "The Photographer". Another one of his early screen roles was as a cast member on the CBS sitcom ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. His role as the villain in 1992's ''[[One False Move]]'', which he also co-wrote, brought him to the attention of critics. He also had small roles in the 1990s films ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'', ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', ''[[Bound by Honor]]'', and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]''. He went on to write, direct, and star in the 1996 [[independent film]] ''[[Sling Blade]]''.<ref name="actors" /> The film, an expansion of the short film ''[[Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade]]'', introduced the story of a [[mentally handicapped]] man imprisoned for a gruesome and seemingly inexplicable murder.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

''Sling Blade'' garnered international acclaim.

He adapted the book ''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]'' into a 2000 [[All the Pretty Horses (film)|film of the same name]]. The negative experience (he was forced to cut more than an hour of footage) led to his decision to never direct another film; a subsequent release, ''[[Daddy and Them]]'', had been filmed earlier. Also in 2000, an early script which he and [[Tom Epperson]] wrote together was made into ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2000, Thornton appeared in [[Travis Tritt]]'s music video for the song "[[Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde]]".

He stated that, following the success of ''Bad Santa'', audiences "like to watch him play that kind of guy" and that "casting directors call him up when they need an asshole".<ref name="jamshowbiz" /> He referred to this when he said that "it's kinda that simple... you know how narrow the imagination in this business can be".<ref name="dailynews">{{cite web|work=Los Angeles Daily News |title=School is in session |url=http://www.dailynews.com/entertainment/ci_4386629 |accessdate=September 24, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070928003839/http://www.dailynews.com/entertainment/ci_4386629 |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}</ref>
