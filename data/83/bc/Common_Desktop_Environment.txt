The '''Common Desktop Environment''' ('''CDE''') is a [[desktop environment]] for [[Unix]] and [[OpenVMS]], based on the [[Motif (software)|Motif widget toolkit]]. It was part of the [[UNIX98|UNIX98 Workstation Product Standard]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/testing/prodstds.htm|title=Testing requirements by Product Standard|publisher=The Open Group|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=29 September 2013}}</ref> and was long the "classic" Unix desktop associated with commercial Unix [[workstation]]s.

After a long history as [[proprietary software]], CDE was released as [[free software]] on 6 August 2012, under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], version 2 or later.<ref name=osnews2012-08-06>

== History ==
=== Early development ===
[[Hewlett-Packard]], [[IBM]], [[SunSoft, Inc.|SunSoft]], and [[Unix System Laboratories|USL]] announced CDE in June 1993 as a joint development within the [[Common Open Software Environment]] (COSE) initiative. Each development group contributed its own technology to CDE:<ref>{{cite press release

* HP contributed the primary environment for CDE, which was based on HP's [[Visual User Environment]] (VUE). HP VUE was itself derived from the [[Motif Window Manager]].
* IBM contributed its [[Common User Access]] model from [[OS/2]]'s [[Workplace Shell]].
* Sun contributed its [[ToolTalk]] application interaction framework and a port of its [[DeskSet]] productivity tools, including mail and calendar clients, from its [[OpenWindows]] environment.
* USL provided desktop manager components and scalable systems technologies from [[UNIX System V]].

After its release, HP endorsed CDE as the new standard desktop for Unix, and provided documentation and software for migrating HP VUE customizations to CDE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/96apr/apr96a4.pdf|title=Migrating HP VUE Desktop Customizations to CDE|author=Molly Joy|date=August 1996|accessdate=2014-08-19}}</ref>

In March 1994 CDE became the responsibility of the "new OSF", a merger of the [[Open Software Foundation]] and [[Unix International]];<ref>

In February 1997, the Open Group released their last major version of CDE, version 2.1.<ref>TOG Press Release: [http://www.opengroup.org/desktop/Press_Releases/cde2.1ga.htm The Open Group Announces Common Desktop Environment 2.1]</ref>

[[Red Hat Linux]] was the only Linux distribution to which proprietary CDE was ported. In 1997, Red Hat began offering a version of CDE licensed from [[TriTeal Corporation]]. In 1998, [[Xi Graphics]], a company specializing in the X Windowing System, offered a version of CDE bundled with Red Hat Linux, called ''Xi Graphics maXimum cde/OS''. These were phased out, and Red Hat moved to the [[GNOME]] desktop.

Until about 2000, users of Unix desktops regarded CDE as the ''[[de facto]]'' standard, but at that time, other desktop environments such as GNOME and [[K Desktop Environment 2]] were quickly becoming mature, and became widespread on [[Linux]] systems.

In 2001, Sun Microsystems announced that they would phase out CDE as the standard [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] desktop environment in favor of GNOME. Solaris 10, released in early 2005, includes both CDE and the GNOME-based [[Java Desktop System]]. The Solaris 11 release in November 2011 only contains GNOME as a full desktop, though some CDE libraries, such as Motif and Tooltalk, remain for binary compatibility. The [[OpenSolaris]] open source project did not include CDE, and had no intent to make Solaris CDE available as open source.<ref>{{cite web

==== Proprietary licensing ====
From its launch until 2012, CDE was proprietary software.

Motif, the toolkit on which CDE is built, was released by The Open Group in 2000 as "Open Motif," under a "revenue sharing" license. That license did not meet either the [[Open Source Definition|open source]] or [[Free software licence|free software]] definitions. The Open Group had wished to make Motif open source, but did not succeed doing so at that time.<ref>{{cite web

=== Release under the GNU LGPL ===
In 2006, a petition was created asking The Open Group to release the source code for CDE and Motif under a free license.<ref>{{cite web

On October 23, 2012, the Motif widget toolkit was also released under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] v2.1.<ref>{{cite web|title = ICS MotifZone|url = http://motif.ics.com/|date=October 2012|accessdate=October 2012}}</ref> This allowed CDE to become a completely free and open source desktop environment.

=== Open-source development ===
Since its release as free software, CDE has been ported to:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/code/ci/master/tree/cde/README|title=Common Desktop Environment: /cde/README|accessdate=21 February 2014}}</ref>

* Major [[Linux distribution]]s ([[Slackware Linux]], [[Debian GNU/Linux]], [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]).
* Major BSD platforms ([[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]]).
* Solaris 11 ([[x86-64]]). Older Solaris releases are not supported because they already include CDE.
* [[illumos]] (x86-64).

Future project goals for CDE include:

* Increased portability to more Linux, BSD, and Unix platforms.
* Further [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]] into other languages.

CDEbian, a Linux [[live CD]] based on [[Debian]] 6 with CDE 2.2.0c pre-installed, was created shortly after CDE was released as free software.<ref>http://andarazoroflove.org/code/cdebian/</ref>

In March 2014, the first stable release of CDE, version 2.2.1, was made since its release as free software.<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Trulson |first=Jon |title=CDE 2.2.1 released |publisher=cdesktopenv-devel |date=2014-03-01 |url=http://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/mailman/message/32043063/ |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>

Beginning with version 2.2.2, released in July 2014, CDE is able to compile under FreeBSD 10 with the default [[Clang]] [[compiler]].<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Trulson |first=Jon |title=CDE 2.2.2 released |publisher=cdesktopenv-devel |date=2014-07-27 |url=http://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/mailman/message/32654428/ |accessdate=2014-07-27}}</ref>
