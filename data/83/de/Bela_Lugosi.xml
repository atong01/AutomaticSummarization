Despite the relative size of their roles, Lugosi inevitably got second billing, below Karloff. Lugosi's attitude toward Karloff is the subject of contradictory reports, some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff's long-term success and ability to get good roles beyond the horror arena, while others suggested the two actors were for a time, at least good friends. Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together, believing that the Englishman would attempt to upstage him. When this proved not to be the case, according to Karloff, Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably (though some have further commented that Karloff's on-set demand to break from filming for mid-afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi). Karloff also insinuated that his iconic rival could not act, claiming that Lugosi &quot;never learned his trade&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Universal did wind up giving Lugosi a couple of heroic parts, as in<space/><italics><link><target>The Black Cat (1934 film)</target><part>The Black Cat</part></link></italics><space/>after Karloff had been accorded the more colorful role of the villain,<space/><italics><link><target>The Invisible Ray (1936 film)</target><part>The Invisible Ray</part></link></italics>, and a romantic role in the adventure serial<space/><italics><link><target>The Return of Chandu</target></link></italics>, but his typecasting problem appears to have been too entrenched to be alleviated by those films.</paragraph><paragraph>Lugosi addressed his plea to be cast in non-horror roles directly to casting directors through his listing in the 1937<space/><link type='external' href='https://www.playersdirectory.com/index.php'>Players Directory</link>, published by the Motion Picture Academy, in which he (or his agent) calls the idea that he is only fit for horror films &quot;an error.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Michael Mallory.<space/><link type='external' href='http://books.google.com/books/about/Universal_Studios_Monsters.html?id=ZHhOPgAACAAJ'>Universal Studios Monsters: A Legacy of Horror</link>, 2009, Universe, p. 63.

Universal changed management in 1936, and because of a British ban on horror films, dropped them from their production schedule; Lugosi found himself consigned to Universal's non-horror<space/><link><target>B-movie</target><part>B-film</part></link><space/>unit, at times in small roles where he was obviously used for &quot;name value&quot; only. Throughout the 1930s, Lugosi, experiencing a severe career decline despite popularity with audiences (Universal executives always preferred his rival Karloff), accepted many leading roles from independent producers like Nat Levine,<space/><link><target>Sol Lesser</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Sam Katzman</target></link>. These low-budget thrillers indicate that Lugosi was less discriminating than Karloff in selecting screen vehicles, but the exposure helped Lugosi financially if not artistically. Lugosi tried to keep busy with stage work, but had to borrow money from the Actors' Fund to pay hospital bills when his only child, Bela George Lugosi, was born in 1938.</paragraph><paragraph>Historian John McElwee reports, in his 2013 book<space/><italics>Showmen, Sell It Hot!</italics>, that Bela Lugosi's popularity received a much-needed boost in August 1938, when California theater owner Emil Umann revived<space/><italics>Dracula</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Frankenstein</italics><space/>as a special double feature. The combination was so successful that Umann scheduled extra shows to accommodate the capacity crowds, and invited Lugosi to appear in person, which thrilled new audiences that had never seen Lugosi's classic performance. &quot;I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre,&quot; said Lugosi of exhibitor Umann. &quot;I was dead, and he brought me back to life.&quot; Universal took notice of the tremendous business and launched its own national re-release of the same two horror favorites. The studio then rehired Lugosi to star in new films.</paragraph><paragraph>The first was Universal's<space/><italics><link><target>Son of Frankenstein</target></link></italics><space/>(1939), when he played the character role of<space/><link><target>Igor (fictional character)</target><part>Ygor</part></link>, who uses the Monster for his own revenge, in heavy makeup and beard. The same year saw Lugosi playing a straight character role in a major motion picture: he was a stern commissar in<space/><link><target>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</target></link>'s comedy<space/><italics><link><target>Ninotchka</target></link></italics>, starring<space/><link><target>Greta Garbo</target></link>. This small but prestigious role could have been a turning point for the actor, but within the year he was back on Hollywood's<space/><link><target>Poverty Row</target></link>, playing leads for Sam Katzman. These horror, comedy and<space/><link><target>Mystery fiction</target><part>mystery</part></link><space/>B-films were released by<space/><link><target>Monogram Pictures</target></link>. At Universal, he often received star billing for what amounted to a supporting part.<space/><italics><link><target>The Gorilla (1939 film)</target><part>The Gorilla</part></link></italics><space/>(1939) had him playing<space/><link><target>double act</target><part>straight man</part></link><space/>to<space/><link><target>Patsy Kelly</target></link>.<link><target>File:LugosiDevilBat1.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Lugosi in ''<link><target>The Devil Bat</target></link>''</part></link>Ostensibly due to injuries received during military service, Lugosi developed severe, chronic<space/><link><target>sciatica</target></link>. Though at first he was treated with pain remedies such as<space/><link><target>asparagus</target></link><space/>juice, doctors increased the medication to<space/><link><target>opiate</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The growth of his dependence on pain-killers, particularly<space/><link><target>morphine</target></link><space/>and, after 1947 when it became available in America,<space/><link><target>methadone</target></link>, was directly proportional to the dwindling of screen offers. He was finally cast in the role of Frankenstein's monster for Universal's<space/><italics><link><target>Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man</target></link></italics><space/>(1943), but Lugosi had no dialogue.

The [[California Supreme Court]] faced the question whether Bela Lugosi's film contracts with Universal included a grant of merchandising rights in his portrayal of Count Dracula, and the descendibility of any such rights. Adopting the opinion of Justice Roth for the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, the court held that the right to exploit one's name and likeness is personal to the artist and must be exercised, if at all, by him during his lifetime.
