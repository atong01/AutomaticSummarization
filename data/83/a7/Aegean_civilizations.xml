It was not until Schliemann exposed the contents of the graves which lay just inside the gate, that scholars recognized the advanced stage of<space/><link><target>art</target></link><space/>which prehistoric dwellers in the Mycenaean citadel had attained.</paragraph><paragraph>There had been, however, a good deal of other evidence available before 1876, which, had it been collated and seriously studied, might have discounted the sensation that the discovery of the citadel graves eventually made. Although it was recognized that certain tributaries, represented for example, in the XVIIIth Dynasty tomb of Rekhmara at<space/><link><target>Egypt</target><trail>ian</trail></link><space/><link><target>Thebes, Egypt</target><part>Thebes</part></link><space/>as bearing vases of peculiar forms, were of some<space/><link><target>Mediterranean</target></link><space/>race, neither their precise habitat nor the degree of their civilization could be determined while so few actual prehistoric remains were known in the<space/><link><target>Mediterranean</target></link><space/>lands. Nor did the Aegean objects which were lying obscurely in museums in 1870, or thereabouts, provide a sufficient test of the real basis underlying the Hellenic myths of the<space/><link><target>Argos</target><part>Argolid</part></link>, the<space/><link><target>Troad</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Crete</target></link>, to cause these to be taken seriously. Aegean vases have been exhibited both at<space/><link><target>Svres</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Neuchtel</target><part>Neuchatel</part></link><space/>since about 1840, the provenance (i.e. source or origin) being in the one case Phylakope in<space/><link><target>Milos</target><part>Melos</part></link>, in the other<space/><link><target>Kefallinia</target><part>Cephalonia</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Ludwig Ross, the<space/><link><target>Germany</target><part>German</part></link><space/><link><target>Archaeology</target><part>archaeologist</part></link><space/>appointed Curator of the Antiquities of<space/><link><target>History of Athens</target><part>Athens</part></link><space/>at the time of the establishment of the Kingdom of<space/><link><target>Greece</target></link>, by his explorations in the Greek islands from 1835 onwards, called attention to certain early<space/><link><target>intaglio (sculpture)</target><part>intaglio</part><trail>s</trail></link>, since known as Inselsteine; but it was not until 1878 that C. T. Newton demonstrated these to be no strayed<space/><link><target>Phoenicia</target><trail>n</trail></link><space/>products. In 1866 primitive structures were discovered on the island of Therasia by quarrymen extracting pozzolana, a<space/><link><target>Silicon dioxide</target><part>siliceous</part></link><space/><link><target>volcanic ash</target></link>, for the<space/><link><target>Suez Canal</target></link><space/>works. When this discovery was followed up in 1870, on the neighbouring<space/><link><target>Santorini</target><part>Santorin (Thera)</part></link>, by representatives of the French School at<space/><link><target>Athens</target></link>, much pottery of a class now known immediately to precede the typical late Aegean ware, and many stone and metal objects, were found. These were dated by the<space/><link><target>geologist</target></link><space/>Ferdinand A. Fouqu, somewhat arbitrarily, to 2000 B.C., by consideration of the superincumbent eruptive stratum.</paragraph><paragraph>Meanwhile, in 1868, tombs at<space/><link><target>Ialysus</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Rhodes</target></link><space/>had yielded to<space/><link><target>Alfred Biliotti</target></link><space/>many fine painted vases of styles which were called later the third and fourth &quot;Mycenaean&quot;; but these, bought by<space/><link><target>John Ruskin</target></link>, and presented to the<space/><link><target>British Museum</target></link>, excited less attention than they deserved, being supposed to be of some local Asiatic fabric of uncertain date. Nor was a connection immediately detected between them and the objects found four years later in a tomb at Menidi in<space/><link><target>Attica</target></link><space/>and a rock-cut &quot;bee-hive&quot; grave near the Argive Heraeum.</paragraph><paragraph>Even Schliemann's first<space/><link><target>excavation (archaeology)</target><part>excavation</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>at Hissarlik in the<space/><link><target>Troad</target></link><space/>did not excite surprise. But the &quot;Burnt City&quot; of his second stratum, revealed in 1873, with its fortifications and vases, and a hoard of<space/><link><target>gold</target></link>,<space/><link><target>silver</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>bronze</target></link><space/>objects, which the discoverer connected with it, began to arouse a curiosity which was destined presently to spread far outside the narrow circle of scholars. As soon as Schliemann came on the Mycenae graves three years later, light poured from all sides on the prehistoric period of<space/><link><target>Greece</target></link>. It was recognized that the character of both the fabric and the decoration of the Mycenaean objects was not that of any well-known art. A wide range in space was proved by the identification of the Inselsteine and the Ialysus vases with the new style, and a wide range in time by collation of the earlier Theraean and Hissarlik discoveries. A relationship between objects of art described by<space/><link><target>Homer</target></link><space/>and the Mycenaean treasure was generally allowed, and a correct opinion prevailed that, while certainly posterior, the civilization of the<space/><link><target>Iliad</target></link><space/>was reminiscent of the Mycenaean.</paragraph><paragraph>Schliemann got to work again at Hissarlik in 1878, and greatly increased our knowledge of the lower strata, but did not recognize the Aegean remains in his &quot;Lydian&quot; city of the sixth stratum. These were not to be fully revealed until Dr. Wilhelm Dorpfeld, who had become Schliemann's assistant in 1879, resumed the work at Hissarlik in 1892 after the first explorer's death. But by laying bare in 1884 the upper stratum of remains on the rock of<space/><link><target>Tiryns</target></link>, Schliemann made a contribution to our knowledge of prehistoric domestic life which was amplified two years later by Christos Tsountas's discovery of the palace at Mycenae. Schliemann's work at Tiryns was not resumed till 1905, when it was proved, as had long been suspected, that an earlier palace underlies the one he had exposed.</paragraph><paragraph>From 1886 dates the finding of Mycenaean<space/><link><target>sepulchre</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>outside the Argolid, from which, and from the continuation of Tsountas's exploration of the buildings and lesser graves at Mycenae, a large treasure, independent of Schliemann's princely gift, has been gathered into the<space/><link><target>National Archaeological Museum of Athens</target><part>National Museum</part></link><space/>at Athens. In that year tholos-tombs, most already pillaged but retaining some of their furniture, were excavated at Arkina and<space/><link><target>Eleusis</target></link><space/>in Attica, at<space/><link><target>Dimini</target></link><space/>near<space/><link><target>Volos</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Thessaly</target></link>, at Kampos on the west of Mount<space/><link><target>Taygetus</target></link>, and at Maskarata in<space/><link><target>Kefallinia</target><part>Cephalonia</part></link>. The richest grave of all was explored at<space/><link><target>Vaphio</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Laconia</target></link><space/>in 1889, and yielded, besides many gems and miscellaneous goldsmiths' work, two golden goblets chased with scenes of bull-hunting, and certain broken vases painted in a large bold style which remained an enigma until the excavation of<space/><link><target>Knossos</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1890 and 1893, Staes cleared out certain less rich tholos-tombs at Thoricus in<space/><link><target>Attica</target></link>; and other graves, either rock-cut &quot;bee-hives&quot; or chambers, were found at Spata and Aphidna in Attica, in<space/><link><target>Aegina</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Salamis Island</target><part>Salamis</part></link>, at the<space/><link><target>Heraion of Argos</target><part>Argive Heraeum</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Nafplion</target><part>Nauplia</part></link><space/>in the Argolid, near<space/><link><target>Thebes, Greece</target><part>Thebes</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Delphi</target></link>, and not far from the<space/><link><target>Thessaly</target><part>Thessalian</part></link><space/><link><target>Larissa</target></link>. During the<space/><link><target>Acropolis</target></link><space/>excavations in Athens, which terminated in 1888, many potsherds of the Mycenaean style were found; but Olympia had yielded either none, or such as had not been recognized before being thrown away, and the temple site at<space/><link><target>Delphi</target></link><space/>produced nothing distinctively Aegean (in dating). The<space/><link><target>United States</target><part>American</part></link><space/>explorations of the Argive Heraeum, concluded in 1895, also failed to prove that site to have been important in the prehistoric time, though, as was to be expected from its neighbourhood to Mycenae itself, there were traces of occupation in the later Aegean periods.</paragraph><paragraph>Prehistoric research had now begun to extend beyond the Greek mainland. Certain central Aegean islands,<space/><link><target>Antiparos</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Ios Island</target><part>Ios</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Amorgos</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Syros</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Siphnos</target></link>, were all found to be singularly rich in evidence of the Middle-Aegean period. The series of Syran-built graves, containing crouching corpses, is the best and most representative that is known in the Aegean. Melos, long marked as a source of early objects but not systematically excavated until taken in hand by the<space/><link><target>British School at Athens</target></link><space/>in 1896, yielded at Phylakope remains of all the Aegean periods, except the<space/><link><target>Neolithic</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>A map of<space/><link><target>Cyprus</target></link><space/>in the later<space/><link><target>Bronze Age</target></link><space/>(such as is given by J.

The island first attracted the notice of archaeologists by the remarkable archaic Greek bronzes found in a cave on<space/><link><target>Mount Ida</target></link><space/>in 1885, as well as by<space/><link><target>epigraph (archeology)</target><part>epigraph</part><trail>ic</trail></link><space/><link><target>monument</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>such as the famous law of Gortyna (also called<space/><link><target>Gortyn</target></link>). But the first undoubted Aegean remains reported from it were a few objects extracted from Cnossus by Minos Kalokhairinos of Candia in 1878. These were followed by certain discoveries made in the S. plain Messara by F. Halbherr. Unsuccessful attempts at Cnossus were made by both W. J. Stillman and H. Schliemann, and A. J. Evans, coming on the scene in 1893, travelled in succeeding years about the island picking up trifles of unconsidered evidence, which gradually convinced him that greater things would eventually be found.
