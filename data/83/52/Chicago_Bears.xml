They faced the problem of ever-rising operation cost, but flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 5,0006,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 40,00050,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers, 210. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning the team's plays from Bears quarterback<space/><link><target>Joey Sternaman</target></link>. Later in 1925, The Bears would go on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 177 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together team of West Coast college all-stars. After a loss to San Francisco, the Bears cruised to a 603 over a semi-pro team called the Portland All Stars.<extension extension_name='ref' name="ChicagoBears"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last1">Whittingham<space/></arg><arg name="first1">Richard<space/></arg><arg name="last2">Ditka<space/></arg><arg name="first2">Mike<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Chicago Bears: From George Halas to Super Bowl XX<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">978-0-671-62885-7<space/></arg><arg name="oclc">13795870</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Any hopes that Grange would lead the Bears to glory in 1926 were quickly dashed.
