'''Alfred Damon Runyon''' (October 4, 1880<ref>{{cite news | title = Birth Announcement | publisher = ''The (Manhattan, Kansas) Nationalist'' | date = October 7, 1880}}
</ref><ref>http://www.cityofmhk.com/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1049</ref> – December 10, 1946) was an American [[newspaperman]] and author.<ref>{{cite book|title=Detective stories |author= Philip Pullman, Nick Hardcastle|year=1998|publisher=Kingfisher Publications|url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0-7534-5636-2&id=6OsgjZkA_pEC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=Damon+Runyon&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&sig=VQFfSVfRpzXaNP9TIdkwsll79ak|isbn=0-7534-5636-2}}</ref>

He was best known for his short stories celebrating the world of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City that grew out of the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] era. To New Yorkers of his generation, a "Damon Runyon character" evoked a distinctive social type from the [[Brooklyn]] or [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] [[demi-monde]]. The adjective "Runyonesque" refers to this type of character as well as to the type of situations and dialog that Runyon depicted.<ref>Webber, Elizabeth; Feinsilber, Mike (1999). [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ACB81ZeNN5sC&lpg=PA479&vq=runyonesque&dq=merriam%20webster%20dictionary%20of%20allusions&pg=PA479#v=snippet&q=runyonesque&f=false Merriam-Webster's dictionary of allusions], page 479–480. ISBN 978-0-87779-628-2.</ref> He spun humorous and sentimental tales of gamblers, hustlers, actors, and gangsters, few of whom go by [[square (slang)|"square"]] names, preferring instead colorful monikers such as  "Nathan Detroit," "Benny Southstreet," "Big Jule," "Harry the Horse," "Good Time Charley," "Dave the Dude," or "The Seldom Seen Kid."  His distinctive vernacular style is known as "Runyonese": a mixture of formal speech and colorful slang, almost always in present tense, and always devoid of [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]]. He is credited with coining the phrase "[[Hooray Henry]]", a term now used in British English to describe an upper-class, loud-mouthed, arrogant twit.

Runyon's fictional world is also known to the general public through the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' based on two of his stories, "[[The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown]]" and "Blood Pressure".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ebooks-library.com/author.cfm/AuthorID/900 |title = Damon Runyon|work = Authors|publisher = The eBooks-Library|accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> The musical additionally borrows characters and story elements from a few other Runyon stories, most notably "Pick The Winner." The film ''[[Little Miss Marker]]'' (and its two remakes, ''[[Sorrowful Jones]]'' and the 1980 ''[[Little Miss Marker (1980 film)|Little Miss Marker]]'') grew from his short story of the same name.

Runyon was also a well-known newspaper reporter, covering sports and general news for decades for various publications and syndicates owned by [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Already famous for his fiction, he wrote a well-remembered "present tense" article on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s Presidential inauguration in 1933 for the Universal Service, a [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] syndicate, which was merged with the co-owned [[International News Service]] in 1937.

==Life and work==
[[File:Damon Runyon House 2012-10-16 11-27-19.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Boyhood home of Damon Runyon in Manhattan, Kansas.]]
Damon Runyon was born '''Alfred Damon Runyan''' to Alfred Lee and Elizabeth (Damon) Runyan.<ref>Maxine Block, editor. "Current Biography, 1942 edition." H.H. Wilson, 1942, p. 723.</ref> His relatives in [[Manhattan, Kansas]] included several newspapermen.<ref name=house/> His grandfather was a newspaper printer from [[New Jersey]] who had relocated to Manhattan, Kansas in 1855, and his father was editor of his own newspaper in the town. In 1882 Runyon's father was forced to sell his newspaper, and the family moved westward. The family eventually settled in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] in 1887, where Runyon spent the rest of his youth. By most accounts, he only attended school through the fourth grade.<ref>"The Press: Hand Me My Kady." ''Time'' magazine, December 23, 1946, n.p.</ref> He began to work in the newspaper trade under his father in Pueblo. In present-day Pueblo, Runyon Field, the Damon Runyon Repertory Theater Company, and [[Runyon Lake]] are named in his honor.

In 1898, when still in his early teens, Runyon enlisted in the U.S. Army to fight in the [[Spanish–American War]]. While in the service, he was assigned to write for the ''Manila Freedom'' and ''Soldier's Letter''.
[[File:Runyon-Damon draft.gif|thumb|right|250px|Runyon's World War I draft card]]

After his military service, he worked for various Colorado newspapers, beginning in Pueblo. His first job as a reporter was in September 1900, when he was hired by the ''Pueblo Star'';<ref>"The Press: Broadway Columnist." ''Time'' magazine, September 30, 1940, n.p.</ref> he then worked in the [[Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountain]] area during the first decade of the 1900s: at the ''Denver Daily News'', he served as "sporting editor" (what would today be called "sports editor") and then worked as a staff writer. His expertise was in covering the semi-professional teams in Colorado; he even briefly managed a semi-pro team in Trinidad, CO.<ref>"An All-Star Team Picked by A.D. Runyon." ''Denver Daily News'', September 15, 1907, p. S2.</ref> At one of the newspapers where he worked, the spelling of his last name was changed from "Runyan" to "Runyon," a change he let stand.

After a notable failure in trying to organize a [[Colorado]] [[minor league baseball|minor baseball league]], which lasted less than a week,<ref>Robert Phipps. "Long Evening Kills League." ''Omaha World Herald'', December 21, 1946, p. 7</ref> Runyon moved to [[New York City]] in 1910. In his first New York byline, the ''American'' editor dropped the "Alfred" and the name "Damon Runyon" appeared for the first time. For the next ten years he covered the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] and professional boxing for the ''[[New York American]]''.

He was the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst newspapers']] baseball columnist for many years, beginning in 1911, and his knack for spotting the eccentric and the unusual, on the field or in the stands, is credited with revolutionizing the way baseball was covered. Perhaps as confirmation, Runyon was inducted into the writers' wing (the [[J. G. Taylor Spink Award]]) of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1967. He is also a member of the [[International Boxing Hall Of Fame]] and is known for dubbing heavyweight champion [[James J. Braddock]], the "[[Cinderella Man]]". Runyon frequently contributed sports poems to the ''American'' on boxing and baseball themes, and also wrote numerous short stories and essays. 
{{Quote box |width=320px |align=left|quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote =<poem>
If I have all the tears that are shed on Broadway by guys in love, I will have enough salt water to start an opposition ocean to the Atlantic and Pacific, with enough left over to run the Great Salt Lake out of business. But I wish to say I never shed any of these tears personally, because I am never in love, and furthermore, barring a bad break, I never expect to be in love, for the way I look at it love is strictly the old phedinkus, and I tell the little guy as much.
</poem>
|source = from "Tobias the Terrible,"<br> collected in ''More than Somewhat'' (1937)}} 
One year, while covering spring training in [[Texas]], he met [[Pancho Villa]] in a bar and later accompanied the unsuccessful American expedition into [[Mexico]] searching for Villa. It was while he was in Mexico that he met the young girl whom he eventually married.

Gambling, particularly on [[craps]] or horse races, was a common theme of Runyon's works, and he was a notorious gambler himself. One of his paraphrases from a well-known line in [[Ecclesiastes]] ran: "The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but that's how the smart money bets."

A heavy drinker as a young man, he seems to have quit drinking soon after arriving in New York, after his drinking nearly cost him the courtship of the woman who became his first wife, Ellen Egan. He remained a heavy smoker.

His best friend was mobster accountant [[Otto Berman]], and he incorporated Berman into several of his stories under the alias "Regret, the horse player." When Berman was killed in a hit on Berman's boss, [[Dutch Schultz]], Runyon quickly assumed the role of damage control for his deceased friend, correcting erroneous press releases (including one that stated Berman was one of Schultz's gunmen, to which Runyon replied, "Otto would have been as effective a bodyguard as a two-year-old.").

[[File:The Family Plot of Damon Runyon in Woodlawn Cemetery.JPG|thumb|The family plot of Damon Runyon in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]]]]Runyon's marriage to Ellen Egan produced two children (Mary and Damon, Jr.), but broke up in 1928 over rumors that Runyon had become infatuated with Patrice Amati del Grande, a Mexican woman he had first met while covering the Pancho Villa raids in 1916 and discovered once again in New York, when she called the ''American'' seeking him out. Runyon had promised her in Mexico that if she would complete the education he paid for her, he would find her a dancing job in New York. She became his companion after he separated from his wife. After Ellen Runyon died of the effects of her own drinking problems, Runyon and Patrice married; that marriage ended in 1946 when Patrice left Runyon for a younger man.

Runyon died in New York City from [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] in late 1946, at age 66. His body was cremated, and his ashes were illegally scattered from a [[DC-3]] airplane over Broadway in [[Manhattan]] by [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Eddie Rickenbacker]] on December 18, 1946.<ref>''Eddie Rickenbacker: An American Hero in the Twentieth Century'', by W. David Lewis, pg. 506.</ref> The family plot of Damon Runyon is located at [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

* In the mid-1930s, Runyon persuaded promoter [[Leo Seltzer]] to formally change his [[History of roller derby|Roller Derby]] spectacle from a marathon [[roller-skating]] race into a full-contact team sport,<ref>{{cite news|title=Blood on the Tracks|last=Turczyn|first=Coury|date=January 28, 1999|publisher=''[[Metro Pulse]]''|url=http://www.popcultmag.com/obsessions/fadsandphenoms/rollerderby/derby2.html|accessdate=February 11, 2008}} (link points to the archived article in the Spring 2000 edition of the author's own ''PopCult Magazine'' website): "The faster skaters would break out and try and get laps so they would get ahead in the race, and some of the slower skaters started to band together to try and hold them back," says Seltzer. “And at first, they didn’t want to let them do that – but then the people liked it so much, they kind of allowed blocking. Then they came down to Miami – I think it was 1936, early ’37 – and Damon Runyon, a very famous sports writer, saw it and he sat down with my father and hammered out the rules, almost exactly as they are today."</ref> an innovation that was eventually revived in a DIY spirit seven decades later.

==Literary style==
[[File:Breach of promise by Nicolas Bentley.png|thumb|An illustration from "Breach of Promise" showing Spanish John and Harry the Horse]]
[[Frank Muir]] comments<ref>''The Oxford Book of Humorous Prose'' (1990), OUP, p. 621</ref> that Runyon's plots were, in the manner of [[O. Henry]], neatly constructed with professionally wrought endings, but their distinction lay in the manner of their telling, as the author invented a peculiar argot for his characters to speak.  Runyon almost totally avoids the past tense (English humourist [[E.C. Bentley]] thought there was only one instance, and was willing to "lay plenty of 6 to 5 that it is nothing but a misprint"<ref>''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 11</ref> but "was" appears in the short stories "The Lily of St Pierre"<ref name="Broadway, Pan Books 1975, p. 116">''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 116</ref> and "A Piece of Pie";<ref>''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 536</ref> "had" appears in "The Lily of St Pierre",<ref name="Broadway, Pan Books 1975, p. 116"/> "Undertaker Song"<ref>''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 258</ref> and "Bloodhounds of Broadway"<ref>''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 85</ref>), and makes little use of the future tense, using the present for both. He also avoided the conditional, using instead the future indicative in situations that would normally require conditional. An example: "Now most any doll on Broadway will be very glad indeed to have Handsome Jack Madigan give her a tumble." (''Guys and Dolls'', "Social error"). [[E. C. Bentley]]<ref>Introduction to ''More Than Somewhat'', included in omnibus volume ''Runyon on Broadway'' (1950), Constable</ref> comments that "there is a sort of ungrammatical purity about it [Runyon's resolute avoidance of the past tense], an almost religious exactitude."  There is an homage to Runyon that makes use of this peculiarity (''Chronic Offender'' by [[Spider Robinson]]) which involves a time machine.

He uses many slang terms (which go unexplained in his stories), such as:
*pineapple = pineapple [[grenade]]
*roscoe/john roscoe/the old equalizer/that thing = gun
*shiv = knife
*noggin = head
*snoot = nose

There are many recurring composite phrases such as:
*ever-loving wife (occasionally "ever-loving doll")
*more than somewhat (or "no little, and quite some"); this phrase was so typical that it was used as the title of one of his short story collections
*loathe and despise
*one and all
[[E. C. Bentley]] notes<ref>Introduction to ''Furthermore'', included in omnibus volume ''Runyon on Broadway'' (1950), Constable.</ref> that Runyon's "telling use of the recurrent phrase and fixed epithet" demonstrates a debt to [[Homer]].

Runyon's stories also employ occasional rhyming slang, similar to the [[cockney slang|cockney]] variety but native to New York (e.g.: "Miss Missouri Martin makes the following crack one night to her: 'Well, I do not see any Simple Simon on your lean and linger.' This is Miss Missouri Martin's way of saying she sees no diamond on Miss Billy Perry’s finger." (from "Romance in the Roaring Forties")

The comic effect of his style results partly from the juxtaposition of broad slang with mock-pomposity. Women, when not "dolls", "Judies", "pancakes", "tomatoes", or "broads", may be "characters of a female nature", for example. He typically avoided contractions such as "don't" in the example above, which also contributes significantly to the humorously pompous effect. In one sequence, a gangster tells another character to do as he's told, or else "find another world in which to live."

Runyon's short stories are told in the first person by a protagonist who is never named, and whose role is unclear; he knows many gangsters and does not appear to have a job, but he does not admit to any criminal involvement, and seems to be largely a bystander.  He describes himself as "being known to one and all as a guy who is just around".<ref name="rob">''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 12</ref>
