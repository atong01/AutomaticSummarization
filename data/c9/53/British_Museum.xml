Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 190614 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by<space/><link><target>George V of the United Kingdom</target><part>King George V</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Mary of Teck</target><part>Queen Mary</part></link><space/>in 1914. They now house the Museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.<link><target>File:BM; Archives - Impression of the proposed extension.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Proposed British Museum Extension, 1906</part></link><link><target>File:British Museum Great Court roof.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>The<space/><link><target>British Museum Reading Room</target><part>Reading Room</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Queen Elizabeth II Great Court</target><part>Great Court</part></link><space/>roof, 2005</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank</target><part>Duveen</part></link><space/>Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek &amp; Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American<space/><link><target>Beaux-Arts architecture</target><part>Beaux-Arts</part></link><space/>architect<space/><link><target>John Russell Pope</target></link>.

Some of the masterpieces include the '<link><target>Standard of Ur</target></link>', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the '<link><target>Royal Game of Ur</target></link>', and two bull-headed<space/><link><target>lyres</target></link>.

However, the undoubted highlight from the early mediaeval period are the magnificent items from the<space/><link><target>Sutton Hoo</target></link><space/>royal grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner<space/><link><target>Edith Pretty</target></link>. The department includes the national collection of<space/><link><target>horology</target></link><space/>with one of the most wide ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces came from the<space/><link><target>Octavius Morgan</target><part>Morgan</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Courtenay Adrian Ilbert</target><part>Ilbert</part></link><space/>collections. The department is also responsible for the curation of<space/><link><target>Romano-British</target></link><space/>objects the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside<space/><link><target>Italy</target></link>. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in<space/><link><target>East Anglia</target></link>, the most important of which is the<space/><link><target>Mildenhall Treasure</target></link>. Many Roman-British objects were purchased from the antiquarian<space/><link><target>Charles Roach Smith</target></link><space/>in 1856, which early on formed the nucleus of the collection.</paragraph><paragraph>Objects from the Department of Prehistory and Europe are mostly found on the upper floor of the museum, with a suite of galleries from Gallery 38 to Gallery 51. Most of the collection is stored in its<space/><link><target>archive</target></link><space/>facilities, where it is available for<space/><link><target>research</target></link><space/>and

Until recently, this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the<space/><link><target>British Empire</target></link>, especially the Indian subcontinent. Examples include the collections made by individuals such as<space/><link><target>Hindu Stuart</target><part>Charles Stuart</part></link>,<space/><link><target>James Prinsep</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Charles Masson</target></link>, Sir<space/><link><target>Alexander Cunningham</target></link>, Sir<space/><link><target>Harold Arthur Deane</target><part>Harold Deane</part></link><space/>and Sir<space/><link><target>John Marshall (archaeologist)</target><part>John Marshall</part></link>. A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo-Greek banker<space/><link><target>George Eumorfopoulos</target></link><space/>in the 1930s. In the second half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the<space/><link><target>philanthropist</target></link><space/>PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="author">Babs.Guthrie<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Collection page</arg><arg name="publisher">Untold London</arg><arg name="accessdate">4 July 2010</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html</arg><arg name="title">Embassy of Japan in the UK</arg><arg name="publisher">Japan Embassy</arg><arg name="accessdate">4 July 2010</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/asia.aspx<space/></arg><arg name="title">Department of Asia</arg><arg name="work">British Museum</arg><arg name="date">14 June 2010</arg><arg name="accessdate">4 July 2010</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and<space/><link><target>hunter-gatherers</target></link>, many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the<space/><link><target>Andaman and Nicobar Islands</target></link><space/>(much assembled by the British naval officer<space/><link><target>Maurice Vidal Portman</target><part>Maurice Portman</part></link>), Sri Lanka, Northern Thailand, south-west China, the<space/><link><target>Ainu people</target><part>Ainu</part></link><space/>of Hokaidu in Japan (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist<space/><link><target>John Anderson (zoologist)</target><part>John Anderson</part></link>), Siberia and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited from the purchase in 1905 of the<space/><link><target>Sarawak</target></link><space/>collection put together by Dr<space/><link><target>Charles Hose</target></link>, as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A Jeffreys. In addition, a unique and valuable group of objects from Java, including shadow puppets and a<space/><link><target>gamelan</target></link><space/>musical set, was assembled by<space/><link><target>Sir Stamford Raffles</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The principal gallery devoted to Asian art in the museum is Gallery 33 with its comprehensive display of Chinese, Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asian objects.

The three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are<space/><link><target>Polynesia</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Melanesia</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Micronesia</target></link><space/>Aboriginal art from<space/><link><target>Australia</target></link><space/>is considered separately in its own right. Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. Prehistoric objects from the region include a bird-shaped<space/><link><target>pestle</target></link><space/>and a group of stone<space/><link><target>Pestle and mortar</target><part>mortars</part></link><space/>from<space/><link><target>Papua New Guinea</target></link>.

The<space/><link><target>Henry Wilson (sailor)</target><part>Wilson</part></link><space/>cabinet of curiosities from<space/><link><target>Palau</target></link><space/>is another example of pre-contact ware.

It was decided to experiment with lighter colours, and the walls of the large room were painted with what was, at its first application, a pure cold white, but which after a year's exposure had unfortunately yellowed. The small Elgin Room was painted with pure white tinted with prussian blue, and the Room of the metopes was painted with pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black; it was necessary, for practical reasons, to colour all the dadoes a darker colour<extension extension_name='ref'>Quoted Ashmole (1994), 125</extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph><bold>g.</bold><space/><template><target>Note label</target><arg>G</arg><arg>g</arg><arg>none</arg></template><space/>Ashmole had never liked the Duveen Gallery:<extension extension_name='blockquote'>It is, I suppose, not positively bad, but it could have been infinitely better. It is pretentious, in that it uses the ancient Marbles to decorate itself. This is a long outmoded idea, and the exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do. And, although it incorporates them, it is out of scale, and tends to dwarf them with its bogus Doric features, including those columns, supporting almost nothing which would have made an ancient Greek artist architect wince. The source of daylight is too high above the sculptures, a fault that is only concealed by the amount of reflection from the pinkish marble walls. These are too similar in colour to the marbles...These half-dozen elementary errors were pointed out by everyone in the Museum, and by many scholars outside, when the building was projected.<extension extension_name='ref'>Ashmole (1994), 126</extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph>It was not until the 1980s that the installation, of a lighting scheme removed his greatest criticism of the building.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>h.</bold><space/><template><target>Note label</target><arg>H</arg><arg>h</arg><arg>none</arg></template><space/>The Cairo Museum has 200,000 artefacts, with leading collections reposited at the Egyptian Museum of Berlin (100,000), Muse du Louvre (60,000), Petrie Museum (80,000), The Metropolitan Museum of art (26,000), University of Pennsylvania (42,000), Ashmolean Museum (40,000), Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (40,000), Museo Egizio, Turin (32,500 objects).</paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>30em</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Further reading</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>Anderson, Robert (2005).<space/><italics>The Great Court and the British Museum</italics>.
