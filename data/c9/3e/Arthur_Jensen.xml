Jensen's conclusion:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'>Until we find out what the relevant psychological predictors are for which racial classification per se is merely a 'stand-in' variable, we have no choice but to include race (or other group membership) as a predictive variable along with the test scores or other predictive measures.
