This caused the upper surfaces to &quot;lift&quot; from the main spar. An investigating team led by Major Hereward de Havilland travelled to India and produced a report in early December 1944 stating that &quot;the accidents were not caused by the deterioration of the glue but by shrinkage of the airframe during the wet monsoon season&quot;. However a later inquiry by Cabot &amp; Myers definitely attributed the accidents to faulty manufacture and this was confirmed by a further investigation team by the Ministry of Aircraft Production at<space/><link><target>RAF Defford</target><part>Defford</part></link><space/>which found faults in six different Marks of Mosquito (all built at de Havilland's Hatfield and Leavesden plants) which showed similar defects, and none of the aircraft had been exposed to monsoon conditions or termite attack; thus it was concluded that there were construction defects found at the two plants.

The ferry operation of the Mosquito from Canada to the war front was problematic, as a small fraction of the aircraft mysteriously disappeared over mid-Atlantic. The theory of &quot;auto-explosion&quot; was offered, and, although a considerable effort by de Havilland Canada to resolve production problems with engine and oil systems reduced the number of aircraft lost, the actual cause of the losses was never established. The company introduced an additional five hours flight testing to clear production aircraft before the ferry flight. By the end of the war, nearly 500 Mosquito bombers and fighter-bombers had been delivered successfully by the Canadian operation.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hotson 1983, pp. 7787.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In total, both during the war and after, de Havilland exported 46 FB.VIs and 29 PR.
