The '''de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] multi-role [[combat aircraft]] with a two-man crew that served during and after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was one of few operational front-line aircraft of the era constructed almost entirely of wood and was nicknamed "The Wooden Wonder".<ref>Price 2009, p. 3.</ref> {{refn|In his book ''First and Last'' (p. 153), [[Adolf Galland]] was very impressed by the Mosquito; amongst other things, he claimed that the Mosquito left [[stealth aircraft|a faint signal on German radar]] in use at the time because of its wooden construction. This trait has not been mentioned in books or other publications on the Mosquito.|group=nb}} The Mosquito was also known affectionately as the "Mossie" to its crews.<ref>Hanson, Dave. [http://www.warbirdalley.com/mossie.htm "deHavilland DH 98 Mosquito."] ''warbirdalley.com''. Retrieved: 21 August 2011.</ref> Originally conceived as an unarmed [[fast bomber]], the Mosquito was adapted to roles including low to medium-altitude daytime [[tactical bomber]], high-altitude [[night bomber]], [[Pathfinder (RAF)|pathfinder]], [[Day fighter|day]] or [[night fighter]], [[fighter-bomber]], [[intruder (air combat)|intruder]], [[maritime strike aircraft]], and fast [[photo-reconnaissance]] aircraft. It was also used by the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) as a fast transport to carry small high-value cargoes to, and from, [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral countries]], through [[German-occupied Europe|enemy-controlled airspace]].<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 338.</ref> A single passenger could be carried in the aircraft's bomb bay, which was adapted for the purpose.<ref name=Aeroplane0415/>

When production of the Mosquito began in 1941, it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 21.">Bowman 2005, p. 21.</ref> Entering widespread service in 1942, the Mosquito was a high-speed, high-altitude photo-reconnaissance aircraft, continuing in this role throughout the war. From mid-1942 to mid-1943, Mosquito bombers flew high-speed, medium or low-altitude missions against factories, railways and other pinpoint targets in Germany and German-occupied Europe. From late 1943, Mosquito bombers were formed into the [[Pathfinder (RAF)#Light Night Striking Force|Light Night Strike Force]] and used as pathfinders for [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s heavy-bomber raids. They were also used as "nuisance" bombers, often dropping Blockbuster bombs – [[Blockbuster bomb|4,000&nbsp;lb (1,812&nbsp;kg) "cookies"]] – in high-altitude, high-speed raids that German night fighters were almost powerless to intercept.

As a night fighter from mid-1942, the Mosquito intercepted ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' raids on the [[United Kingdom]], notably defeating ''[[Operation Steinbock]]'' in 1944. Starting in July 1942, Mosquito night-fighter units raided ''Luftwaffe'' airfields. As part of [[100 Group RAF|100 Group]], it was a night fighter and intruder supporting [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s heavy bombers and reduced bomber losses during 1944 and 1945.<ref name="Has240">Hastings 1979, p. 240.</ref>{{refn|The Mosquito increased German night-fighter losses to such an extent the Germans were said to have awarded two victories for shooting one down.<ref name="Has240"/>|group=nb}} As a fighter-bomber in the [[Second Tactical Air Force]], the Mosquito took part in "special raids", such as the [[Operation Jericho|attack on Amiens Prison]] in early 1944, and in precision attacks against [[Gestapo]] or German intelligence and security forces. Second Tactical Air Force Mosquito supported the [[British Army]] during the 1944 [[Operation Overlord|Normandy Campaign]]. From 1943, Mosquitos with [[RAF Coastal Command]] strike squadrons attacked ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' [[U-boat]]s (particularly in 1943 in the [[Bay of Biscay]], where significant numbers were sunk or damaged) and intercepting transport ship concentrations.

The Mosquito flew with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and other air forces in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European]], [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian]] theatres. The Mosquito was also operated by the RAF in the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South East Asian theatre]], and by the [[Royal Australian Air Force|Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF)]] based in [[Maluku Islands|the Halmaheras]] and [[Borneo]] during the [[Pacific War]].

During the 1950s, the RAF ultimately replaced the Mosquito with the jet-powered [[English Electric Canberra]].

[[File:TMA45 de Havilland Comet.jpg|thumb|Construction concepts pioneered in the de Havilland Comet were later used in the Mosquito.]]
By the early-mid-1930s, [[de Havilland]] had a reputation for innovative high-speed aircraft with the [[de Havilland DH.88|DH.88 Comet]] racer. The later [[de Havilland Albatross|DH.91 Albatross]] airliner pioneered the composite wood construction that the Mosquito used. The 22-passenger Albatross could cruise at {{convert|210|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|11,000|ft|m}}, better than the {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} [[Handley Page H.P.42]] and other biplanes it was replacing.<ref>Stroud 1990, p. 369.</ref>{{refn|Part 2 of article is in the July 1990 volume.|group=nb}} The wooden [[monocoque]] construction not only saved weight and compensated for the low power of the [[de Havilland Gipsy Twelve]] engines used by this aircraft, but simplified production and reduced construction time.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 9.">Bowman 2005, p. 9.</ref>

===Air Ministry bomber requirements and concepts===
On 8 September 1936, the British Air Ministry issued [[list of Air Ministry specifications|Specification]] P.13/36 which called for a twin-engined medium bomber capable of carrying a bomb load of {{convert|3,000|lb|kg}} for {{convert|3000|mi|km}} with a maximum speed of {{convert|275|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|15000|ft|m}}; a maximum bomb load of {{convert|8000|lb|kg}} which could be carried over shorter ranges was also specified.<ref name="Sharb30">Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 30.</ref>  Aviation firms entered heavy designs with new high-powered engines and multiple defensive turrets, leading to the production of the [[Avro Manchester]] and [[Handley Page Halifax]].<ref name="Sharb31">Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 31.</ref>

In May 1937, as a comparison to P.13/36, [[George Volkert]], the chief designer of [[Handley Page]], put forward the concept of a fast unarmed bomber. In 20 pages, Volkert planned an aerodynamically clean medium bomber to carry {{convert|3000|lb|kg}} of bombs at a cruising speed of {{convert|300|mph|km/h}}. There was support in the RAF and Air Ministry;  Captain R N Liptrot, Research Director Aircraft 3 (RDA3), appraised Volkert's design, calculating that its top speed would exceed the new [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. There were, however, counter-arguments that, although such a design had merit, it would not necessarily be faster than enemy fighters for long.<ref>Buttler 2004, pp. 76–77.</ref> The ministry was also considering using non-[[strategic]] materials for aircraft production, which, in 1938, had led to specification B.9/38 and the [[Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle]] medium bomber, largely constructed from spruce and plywood attached to a steel-tube frame. The idea of a small, fast bomber gained support at a much earlier stage than sometimes acknowledged though it was likely that the Air Ministry envisaged it using light alloy components.<ref>Buttler 2004, pp. 74, 77.</ref>

===Inception of the de Havilland fast bomber===
[[File:Albatross 1938 prototype.jpg|thumb|One of de Havilland's early designs was to adapt the [[de Havilland Albatross]] design to a fast, turret-armed bomber.]]
[[Geoffrey de Havilland]] also believed a bomber with an aerodynamic design, with minimal skin area, was better than the P.13/36 specification. He thought that adapting the Albatross to meet the RAF's requirements could save time. In April 1938, performance estimates were produced for a twin [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]]-powered DH.91, with the [[Bristol Hercules]] (radial engine) and [[Napier Sabre]] (H-engine) as alternatives.<ref name="Sharb30"/> On 7 July 1938, Geoffrey de Havilland wrote to [[Air Marshal]] [[Wilfrid Freeman]], the Air Council's member for Research and Development, discussing the specification and arguing that in war there would be shortages of [[duralumin]] and steel but should be plenty of wood. Although inferior [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsionally]], the [[Specific strength|strength to weight ratio]] of wood was as good as duralumin or steel, and a different approach to a high-speed bomber was possible.<ref name="Sharb30"/>

A follow-up letter to Freeman on 27 July said that the P.13/36 specification could not be met by a twin Merlin-powered aircraft and either the top speed or load capacity would be compromised, depending on which was paramount. For example, a larger, slower, turret armed aircraft would have a range of {{convert|1,500|mi|km}} carrying a {{convert|4000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb load, with a maximum of {{convert|260|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|19,000|ft|m}}, and a cruising speed of {{convert|230|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|18,000|ft|m}}. De Havilland believed that too much of a compromise, and that getting rid of surplus equipment would lead to a better design.<ref name="Sharb30"/> On 4 October 1938, de Havilland projected the performance of another design based on the Albatross, powered by two Merlin Xs, with a three-man crew and six or eight forward-firing guns, plus one or two manually operated guns and a tail turret. Based on a total loaded weight of {{convert|19,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} it would have a top speed of {{convert|300|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and cruising speed of {{convert|268|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|22,500|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Sharb31" />

Still believing this could be improved, and after examining more concepts based on the Albatross and the new all-metal [[de Havilland Flamingo|DH.95 Flamingo]], de Havilland settled on designing a new aircraft that would be aerodynamically clean, wooden and powered by the Merlin, which offered substantial future development.<ref name="Sharb31"/> The new design would be faster than foreseeable enemy [[fighter aircraft]], and could dispense with a defensive armament, which would slow it and make interception or losses to anti-aircraft guns more likely. Instead, high speed and good manoeuvrability would make it easier to evade fighters and ground fire.<ref name="Sharb31"/> The lack of turrets simplified production and reduced production time, with a delivery rate far in advance of competing designs. Without armament, the crew could be reduced to a pilot and navigator. Contemporary RAF design philosophy required well-armed heavy bombers more akin to the German ''[[schnellbomber]]''.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 5.">Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 5.</ref> At a meeting in early October 1938 with Geoffrey de Havilland and Charles Walker (de Havilland's chief engineer), the Air Ministry showed little interest, and instead asked de Havilland to build wings for other bombers as a sub-contractor.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6.">Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6.</ref>

By September 1939 de Havilland had produced preliminary estimates for single- and twin-engined variations of light-bomber designs using different engines, speculating on the effects of defensive armament on their designs.<ref name="Buttler, p. 78">Buttler 2004, p. 78.</ref> One design, completed on 6 September, was for an aircraft powered by a single {{convert|2,000|hp|kW|abbr=on}}  Napier Sabre, with a wingspan of {{convert|47|ft|m|adj=on}} and capable of carrying a {{convert|1000|lb|kg}} bomb load {{convert|1,500|mi|km}}. On 20 September, in another letter to Wilfred Freeman, de Havilland wrote "...we believe that we could produce a twin-engine bomber which would have a performance so outstanding that little defensive equipment would be needed."<ref name="Buttler, p. 78"/> By 4 October work had progressed to a twin-engine light bomber with a wingspan of {{convert|51|ft|3|in|abbr=on}}, and powered by Merlin or Griffon engines, the Merlin favoured due to availability.<ref name="Buttler, p. 78"/> On 7 October 1939, a month into the war, the nucleus of a design team under [[Ronald Eric Bishop|Eric Bishop]] moved to the security and secrecy of [[De Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre#Salisbury Hall|Salisbury Hall]] to work on what was later known as the DH.98.<ref name ="Sharb34">Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 34.</ref>{{refn|Bishop had worked on the DH.88 Comet and the Albatross under de Havilland's then chief designer A. E. Hagg.<ref>Bishop 1995,{{page needed|date=January 2012}}</ref>|group=nb}} For more versatility, Bishop made provision for four 20&nbsp;mm cannon in the forward half of the [[bomb bay]], under the cockpit, firing via blast tubes and troughs under the fuselage.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 11.">Bowman 2005, p. 11.</ref>

The DH.98 was too radical for the Ministry, which wanted a heavily armed, multi-role aircraft, combining medium bomber, reconnaissance and general purpose roles, as well as capable of carrying torpedoes.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6."/>  With outbreak of war, the Ministry became more receptive, but still sceptical about an unarmed bomber. It thought the Germans would produce fighters faster than expected.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 31–32.</ref> It suggested two forward and two rear-firing machine guns for defence.<ref name="Bow0510">Bowman 2005, p. 10.</ref> The Ministry also opposed a two-man bomber, wanting at least a third crewman to reduce the work of the others on long flights.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 11."/> The Air Council added further requirements, such as remotely controlled guns, a top speed of {{convert|275|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|15,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} on two-thirds engine power, and a range of {{convert|3,000|mi|km|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|4000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bomb load.<ref name="Bow0510"/> To appease the Ministry, de Havilland built mock-ups with a gun turret just aft of the cockpit but, apart from this compromise, de Havilland made no changes.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 11."/>

On 12 November, at a meeting considering fast bomber ideas put forward by de Havilland, [[Blackburn Aircraft|Blackburn]], and [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]], Air Marshal Freeman directed de Havilland to produce a fast aircraft, powered initially by Merlin engines, with options of using progressively more powerful engines, including the [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]] and the [[Napier Sabre]]. Although estimates were presented for a slightly larger Griffon-powered aircraft, armed with a four-gun tail turret, Freeman got the requirement for defensive weapons dropped, and a draft requirement was raised calling for a high-speed light reconnaissance bomber capable of {{convert|400|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|18,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Buttler 2004, p. 79.</ref>

On 12 December, the [[Vice-Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Vice-Chief of the Air Staff]], Director General of Research and Development, [[Air Officer Commanding|Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (AOC-in-C) of [[RAF Bomber Command]] met to finalize the design and decide how to fit it in the RAF's aims. The AOC-in-C would not accept an unarmed bomber, but insisted on its suitability for reconnaissance missions with F8 or [[F24 camera]]s.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 12.">Bowman 2005, p. 12.</ref> After company representatives, the Ministry and the RAF's operational commands examined a full-scale mock-up at Hatfield on 29 December 1939, the project received backing.<ref name="Bu80">Buttler 2004, p. 80.</ref> This was confirmed on 1 January 1940, when Air Marshal Freeman chaired a meeting with Geoffrey de Havilland, John Buchanan, (Deputy of Aircraft Production) and John Connolly (Buchanan's chief of staff). de Havilland claimed the DH.98 was the "fastest bomber in the world...it must be useful". Freeman supported it for RAF service, ordering a single prototype for an unarmed bomber to specification B.1/40/dh, which called for a light bomber/reconnaissance aircraft powered by two {{convert|1,280|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Rolls-Royce RM3SM (an early designation for the Merlin 21) with [[Meredith effect|ducted radiators]], capable of carrying a {{convert|1000|lb|kg}} bomb load.<ref name="Sharb34"/><ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 12."/> The aircraft was to have a speed of {{convert|397|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|23,700|ft|m}} and a cruising speed of {{convert|327|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|26,600|ft|m}} with a range of {{convert|1,480|mi|km}} at {{convert|24,900|ft|m}} on full tanks. Maximum service ceiling was to be {{convert|32,100|ft|m}}.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 12."/>

On 1 March 1940, [[Air Marshal]] [[Roderic Hill]] issued a contract under Specification B.1/40, for 50 bomber-reconnaissance variants of the DH.98: this contract included the prototype, which was given the [[United Kingdom aircraft test serials|factory serial]] ''E0234''.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 35.</ref><ref>Price 2009, p. 51.</ref> In May 1940, specification F.21/40 was issued, calling for a long-range fighter armed with four 20&nbsp;mm cannon and four .303 machine guns in the nose, after which de Havilland were authorized to build a prototype of a fighter version of the DH.98. It was decided after debate that this prototype, given the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|military serial number]] ''W4052'', would carry [[Radar in World War II#Airborne Intercept|Airborne Interception]] (AI) Mk.IV equipment as a day and night fighter.{{refn|The term [[radar]], which originated in the USA, was not used by the British until later.|group=nb}} By June 1940, the DH.98 had been named "Mosquito".<ref name="Bu80" /> Having the fighter variant kept the Mosquito project alive because there was still criticism within the government and Air Ministry of the usefulness of an unarmed bomber, even after the prototype had shown its capabilities.<ref name="Bu80"/>

===Project Mosquito===
[[Image:DE HAVILLAND 1943 Advertisement s.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 1943 advertisement for de Havilland taken from ''[[Flight International|Flight & Aircraft Engineer]]'' magazine highlights the speed of the B Mk IV.]]
Once design of the DH.98 had started, de Havilland built mock-ups, the most detailed at Salisbury Hall, in the hangar where ''E0234'' was being built. Initially, this was designed with the crew enclosed in the fuselage behind a transparent nose (similar to the Bristol Blenheim or [[Heinkel He 111]]H), but this was quickly altered to a more solid nose with a more conventional canopy.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 18.</ref>

The construction of the prototype began in March 1940, but work was cancelled again after the [[Battle of Dunkirk]], when [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], as [[Minister of Aircraft Production]], decided there was no production capacity for aircraft like the DH.98, which was not expected to be in service until early 1941. Although Lord Beaverbrook told Air Vice-Marshal Freeman that work on the project should stop, he did not issue a specific instruction, and Freeman ignored the request.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 37.</ref> In June 1940, however, Lord Beaverbrook and the Air Staff ordered that production focus on five existing types, namely the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], [[Hawker Hurricane]], [[Vickers Wellington]], [[Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley]] and the [[Bristol Blenheim]].<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 12."/> Work on the DH.98 prototype stopped; it seemed that the project would be shut down when the design team were denied the materials with which to build their prototype.<ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 7.">Jackson 2003, p. 7.</ref>

The Mosquito was only reinstated as a priority in July 1940, after de Havilland's General Manager L.C.L Murray, promised Lord Beaverbrook 50 Mosquitoes by December 1941, and this, only after Beaverbrook was satisfied that Mosquito production would not hinder de Havilland's primary work of producing [[Tiger Moth]] and [[Airspeed Oxford|Oxford]] trainers and repairing [[Hawker Hurricanes|Hurricanes]] as well as the licence manufacture of Merlin engines.<ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 7."/> In promising Beaverbrook 50 Mosquitoes by the end of 1941, de Havilland was taking a gamble, because it was unlikely that 50 Mosquito's could be built in such a limited time; as it transpired only 20 Mosquitoes were built in 1941, but the other 30 were delivered by mid-March 1942.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 35–36, 82.</ref> During the [[Battle of Britain]], interruptions to production due to air raid warnings caused nearly a third of de Havilland's factory time to be lost.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 38.</ref> Nevertheless, work on the prototype went quickly, such that ''E0234'' was rolled out on 19 November 1940.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 19.</ref>

In the aftermath of the Battle of Britain, the original order was changed to 20 bomber variants and 30 fighters. It was still uncertain whether the fighter version should have dual or single controls, or should carry a turret, so three prototypes were eventually built: ''W4052'', ''W4053'' and ''W4073''. The latter, both turret armed, were later disarmed, to become the prototypes for the T.III trainer.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 178.</ref> This caused some delays as half-built wing components had to be strengthened for the expected higher combat load requirements. The nose sections also had to be altered, omitting the clear [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|perspex]] bomb-aimer's position, to solid noses designed to house four .303 machine guns and their ammunition.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6."/>

===Prototypes and test flights===
On 3 November 1940, the aircraft, still coded ''E0234'', was transported by road to [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], and placed in a small blast-proof assembly building, where successful engine runs were made on 19 November. Two Merlin 21 two-speed single-stage supercharged engines were installed driving three-bladed de Havilland Hydromatic [[Controllable pitch propeller|constant-speed, controllable-pitch propellers]].<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 18."/> ''E0234'' had a wingspan of {{convert|52|ft|2|in|abbr=on}} and was the only Mosquito to be built with [[Handley Page]] [[Leading edge slats|slats]] on the outer leading edges of the wings. Test flights showed that these were not needed and they were disconnected and faired over with doped fabric (these slats can still be seen on ''W4050'').<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 33, 269.</ref> On 24 November 1940, taxiing trials were carried out by [[Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr.]], who was the company's chief [[test pilot]] and responsible for maiden flights. The tests were successful and the prototype was subsequently readied for flight testing, making its first flight piloted by Geoffrey de Havilland, on 25 November. The flight was made 11 months after the start of detailed design work, a remarkable achievement considering the conditions of the time.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6."/>

For this maiden flight, ''E0234'', weighing {{convert|14150|lb|kg}}, took off from a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=on}} field beside the shed it was built in. John E. Walker, Chief Engine Installation designer, accompanied de Havilland. The takeoff was "straight forward and easy" and the undercarriage was not retracted until a considerable height was attained.<ref name="Thir25">Thirsk 2006, p. 25.</ref> The aircraft reached {{convert|220|mph|abbr=on}}, with the only problem being the undercarriage doors – which were operated by [[bungee cord]]s attached to the main undercarriage legs – that remained open by some {{convert|12|in|mm}} at that speed.<ref name="Thir25"/> This problem persisted for some time. The left wing of ''E0234'' also had a tendency to drag to port slightly, so a rigging adjustment was carried out before further flights.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 18.">Bowman 2005, p. 18.</ref>
[[File:De Havilland Mosquito Prototype.jpg|thumb|left|Mosquito prototype ''W4050'' landing after a test flight on 10 January 1941. Four test flights were flown that day.<ref name="Thirsk 2006, p. 31">Thirsk 2006, p. 31.</ref>]]

On 5 December 1940, the prototype experienced tail buffeting at speeds between {{convert|240|mph}} and {{convert|255|mph}}. The pilot noticed this most in the control column, with handling becoming more difficult. During testing on 10 December, wool tufts were attached to suspect areas to investigate the direction of airflow. The conclusion was that the airflow separating from rear section of the inner engine [[nacelle]]s was disturbed, leading to a localised [[Stall (flight)|stall]] and the disturbed airflow was striking the tailplane, causing buffeting. In an attempt to smooth the air flow and deflect it from forcefully striking the tailplane, non-retractable [[Leading edge slot|slots]] fitted to the inner engine nacelles and to the leading edge of the tailplane were experimented with.<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 27–29.</ref> These slots, and wing root fairings fitted to the forward fuselage and leading edge of the radiator intakes, stopped some of the vibration experienced but did not cure the tailplane buffeting.<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 28–29.</ref> In February 1941, buffeting was eliminated by incorporating triangular fillets on the trailing edge of the wings and lengthening the nacelles, the trailing edge of which curved up to fair into the fillet some {{convert|10|in|abbr=on}} behind the wing's trailing edge: this meant the [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] had to be divided into inboard and outboard sections.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 19.">Bowman 2005, p. 19.</ref>{{refn|On ''W4050'' the nacelle extensions were not as long as those fitted to production Mosquitoes: nacelles of the definitive shape and length were first fitted to the fighter prototype ''W4052''. The extended nacelles and fillets were not fitted to the first nine PR Mk Is, some of which were converted to B Mk IV series 1 bombers.<ref name="Thirsk 2006, p. 31"/>|group=nb}}

By January 1941, the prototype was carrying the military serial number ''[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|W4050]]''.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6."/>  With the buffeting problems largely resolved, [[John Cunningham (RAF officer)|John Cunningham]] flew ''W4050'' on 9 February 1941. He was greatly impressed by the "lightness of the controls and generally pleasant handling characteristics". Cunningham concluded that when the type was fitted with AI equipment, it would be a perfect replacement for the [[Bristol Beaufighter]].<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 19."/>

During its trials on 16 January 1941, ''W4050'' outpaced a Spitfire at {{convert|6000|ft|abbr=on}}. The original estimates were that as the Mosquito prototype had twice the surface area and over twice the weight of the [[Supermarine Spitfire (early Merlin powered variants)|Spitfire Mk II]], but also with twice its power, the Mosquito would end up being {{convert|20|mph|km/h}} faster. Over the next few months, ''W4050'' surpassed this estimate, easily beating the Spitfire Mk II in testing at [[RAF Boscombe Down]] in February 1941, reaching a top speed of {{convert|392|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|22000|ft|m}} altitude, compared to a top speed of {{convert|360|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|19500|ft|m}} for the Spitfire.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 8."/> On 19 February, official trials began at the [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] (A&AEE)  based at [[MoD Boscombe Down|Boscombe Down]], although de Havilland's representative was surprised by a delay in starting the tests.<ref name="Sharb445">Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 44–45.</ref> On 24 February, as ''W4050'' taxied across the rough airfield, the tailwheel jammed leading to the fuselage fracturing: this was replaced by the fuselage of the Photo-Reconnaissance prototype ''W4051'' in early March.{{refn|This accident occurred because the tailwheel unit was unable to [[caster]] properly, a problem which was solved in June–July 1941 by the fitting of a [[Dowty Group|Dowty]] unit.|group=nb}} In spite of this setback, the ''Initial Handling Report 767'' issued by the A&AEE stated "The aeroplane is pleasant to fly ...

The maximum speed reached was {{convert|388|mph|abbr=on}} at {{convert|22,000|ft|abbr=on}}, with an estimated maximum ceiling of {{convert|33900|ft|abbr=on}} and a maximum rate of climb of {{convert|2,880|ft/min|abbr=on}} at {{convert|11400|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Sharb445"/>

''W4050'' continued to be used for various test programs, essentially as the experimental "workhorse" for the Mosquito family.<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 15–16.</ref> In late October 1941, it returned to the factory to be fitted with [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin 61s]], the first production Merlins fitted with a two-speed, two-stage supercharger. The first flight with the new engines was on 20 June 1942.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 47.</ref> ''W4050'' recorded a maximum speed of {{convert|428|mph|abbr=on}} at {{convert|28,500|ft|abbr=on}} (fitted with straight-through air intakes with snowguards, engines in F.S. gear) and {{convert|437|mph|abbr=on}} at {{convert|29200|ft|abbr=on}} without snowguards.<ref name="Thr34">Thirsk 2006, p. 34.</ref>{{refn|Snowguards were small, oval grids of steel mesh which were fitted in front of the opening of the carburettor air intakes.

In September 1958, ''W4050'' was returned to the Salisbury Hall hangar in which it had been built, restored to its original configuration, and became one of the primary exhibits of the [[de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre]].<ref>Thirsk 2006, 36–38.</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXNXGGNRws&feature=related Time-lapse footage of restoration work on ''W4050'', 9 January 2011.] Retrieved: 3 January 2012.</ref>
[[Image:De Havilland Mosquito - Prototype 1.jpg|thumb|''W4050'' being restored at the [[de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre]] near St Albans.]]
''W4051'', which was designed from the outset to be the prototype for the photo-reconnaissance versions of the Mosquito, was slated to make its first flight in early 1941. However, the fuselage fracture in ''W4050'' meant that ''W4051's'' fuselage was used as a replacement; ''W4051'' was then rebuilt using a production standard fuselage and first flew on 10 June 1941. This prototype continued to use the short engine nacelles, single-piece trailing edge flaps and the {{convert|19|ft|5.5|in|abbr=on}} "No. 1"  tailplane used by ''W4050'', but had production standard {{convert|54|ft|2|in|abbr=on}} wings and, thus configured, became the only Mosquito prototype to fly operationally.<ref name="Thirsk 2006, p. 269">Thirsk 2006, p. 269.</ref>

Construction of the fighter prototype, ''W4052'' was also carried out at the secret [[De Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre#Salisbury Hall|Salisbury Hall]] facility. The new prototype differed from its bomber brethren in a number of ways. It was powered by {{convert|1460|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Merlin 21s and had an altered canopy structure with a flat bullet-proof windscreen. Four 20&nbsp;mm (.79 in) [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano Mk II]] cannon were housed in a compartment under the cockpit floor, with the breeches projecting into the bomb bay. The bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors which incorporated cartridge ejector chutes.<ref name="Thirsk 2006, pp. 125, 134">Thirsk 2006, pp. 125, 134.</ref> The solid nose mounted four [[.303 British|.303 in]] (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]] and their ammunition boxes which were accessed by a single large, sideways hinged panel.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 125.</ref> In accordance with its role as a day/night fighter prototype ''W4052'' was equipped with AI Mk.IV equipment, complete with an "arrowhead"-shaped transmission aerial mounted between the central Brownings, and receiving aerials through each outer wingtip, and it was painted in overall black RDM2a "Special Night" finish.<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 124–127.</ref>{{refn|The RDM2a finish was notoriously rough and it was hard to maintain: tests later proved that it could cut the top speed of a Mosquito by up to {{convert|26|mph|abbr=on}} and, by March 1942 was replaced by the black "Night Type S" (Night Type Smooth) finish.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 134.</ref>|group=nb}} It was also the first prototype constructed with the extended engine nacelles.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 126.</ref>

''W4052'' was later tested with other modifications including bomb racks, drop tanks, [[barrage balloon]] cable cutters in the leading edge of the wings, Hamilton airscrews and braking propellers, as well as drooping aileron systems which enabled steep approaches, and a larger rudder tab. The prototype continued to serve as a test machine until it was scrapped on 28 January 1946.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 21."/> ''W4055'' flew the first operational Mosquito flight on 17 September 1941.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 20."/>

During flight testing, the Mosquito prototypes were modified to test a number of experimental configurations. ''W4050'' was fitted with a turret behind the cockpit for drag tests, after which the idea was abandoned in July 1941. ''W4052'' had the first version of the Youngman Frill airbrake fitted to the fighter prototype. The frill was opened by bellows and [[venturi effect]] to provide rapid deceleration during interceptions and was tested between January – August 1942, but was also abandoned when it was discovered that lowering the undercarriage had the same effect with less buffeting.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 20."/>
<!--- Something is missing here--- It was used to eliminate problems on ''W4052''. Most of this related to the former's exhaust and armament systems. Flash eliminators had to be fitted to the NF.II to prevent the crew from being blinded by muzzle flash during the firing of the weapons.--->

===Production plans and American interest===
The Air Ministry had authorised mass production plans to be drawn up on 21 June 1941, by which time the Mosquito had become one of the world's fastest operational aircraft.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 21."/> The Air Ministry ordered 19 photo-reconnaissance (PR) models and 176 fighters. A further 50 were unspecified; in July 1941, the Air Ministry confirmed these would be unarmed fast bombers.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 21."/>   By the end of January 1942, contracts had been awarded for 1,378 Mosquitos of all variants, including 20 T.III trainers and 334 FB.VI bombers. Another 400 were to be built by [[de Havilland Canada]].<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 24.">Bowman 2005, p. 24.</ref>

On 20 April 1941, ''W4050'' was demonstrated to Lord Beaverbrook, the [[Minister of Aircraft Production]]. The Mosquito made a series of flights, including one rolling climb on one engine. Also present were US General [[Henry H. Arnold]] and his aide [[Major]] [[Elwood Quesada]], who wrote "I ... recall the first time I saw the Mosquito as being impressed by its performance, which we were aware of. We were impressed by the appearance of the airplane that looks fast usually is fast, and the Mosquito was, by the standards of the time, an extremely well streamlined airplane, and it was highly regarded, highly respected."<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 19."/><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7pNBSRkEiQ&feature=related "WWII US Film on Mosquito."] ''youtube.com.'' Retrieved: 3 January 2012.</ref>

The trials set up future production plans between Britain, [[Australia]] and [[Canada]]. The Americans did not pursue their interest. It was thought the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] could handle the same duties just as easily. Arnold felt the design was being overlooked, and urged the strategic personalities in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] to learn from the design if they chose not to adopt it. Several days after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the USAAF then requested one airframe to evaluate on 12 December 1941, signifying that the USAAF realised that they had entered the war without a fast dual-purpose reconnaissance aircraft.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 20.">Bowman 2005, p. 20.</ref>

==Design==

===Overview===
[[File:MossyCloseup42.jpg|thumb|B Mk IV nose closeup showing bombsight and clear nose, plus engine nacelles and undercarriage.]]
The Mosquito was a fast, twin-engined aircraft with [[Shoulder wing|shoulder-mounted]] wings.<ref>Air Ministry 1945, p. 13. (NF 38 notes)</ref> The most-produced variant, [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] the FB Mk VI (Fighter-bomber Mark 6), was powered by two Merlin Mk 23 or Mk 25 engines driving three-bladed de Havilland hydromatic propellers.<!---Both propellers and airscrews have been used, consolidate on one term.---> The typical fixed armament for an FB Mk VI was four Browning .303 machine guns and four 20&nbsp;mm Hispano cannon while the offensive load consisted of up to {{convert|2000|lb|kg}} of bombs, or eight RP-3 unguided rockets.<ref>Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 17.</ref>

The design was noted for having light and effective control surfaces which allowed for good manoeuvrability, but that the rudder should not be used aggressively at high speeds; poor aileron control at low speeds when landing and taking off was also a problem for inexperienced crews.<ref>Air Ministry 1945, pp. 28–29. (FB 6 notes)</ref> For flying at low speeds, the flaps had to be set at 15°, speed reduced to {{convert|201|mph|km/h}} and [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] set to 2,650. The speed could be reduced to an acceptable {{convert|150|mph|km/h}} for low speed flying.<ref name="Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes)"/> For cruising the maximum speed for obtaining maximum range was {{convert|200|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|17000|lb|abbr=on}} weight.<ref name="Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes)"/>

The Mosquito had a low stalling speed of {{convert|121|mph|km/h}} with undercarriage and flaps raised. When both were lowered, the stalling speed decreased to {{convert|100|-|120|mph|km/h}}. Stall speed at normal approach angle and conditions was {{convert|100|-|109|mph|km/h}}. Warning of the stall was given by buffeting and would occur {{convert|12|mph|km/h}} before stall was reached. The conditions and impact of the stall were not severe. The wing did not drop unless the control column was pulled back. The nose drooped gently and recovery was easy.<ref name="Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes)">Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes).</ref>

Early on in the Mosquito's operational life, the cooling intake shrouds that were to cool the exhausts on production aircraft overheated after a while. Flame dampers prevented exhaust glow on night operations, but they had an effect on performance. Multiple ejector and open-ended exhaust stubs helped solve the problem and were used in the PR.VIII, B.IX and B.XVI variants. This increased speed performance in the B.IX alone by {{convert|10|-|13|mi|km}} per hour.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 21."/>

===Fuselage===
The oval-section fuselage was a frameless [[monocoque]] shell built in two halves being formed to shape by [[band clamp]]s over a mahogany or concrete mould, each holding one half of the fuselage, split vertically. The shell halves were made of sheets of Ecuadorean [[balsa]]wood sandwiched between sheets of Canadian [[birch]], but in areas needing extra strength— such as along cut-outs— stronger woods replaced the balsa filler; the overall thickness of the birch and balsa sandwich skin was only {{convert|7/16|in|mm}}. This sandwich skin was so stiff that no internal reinforcement was necessary from the wing's rear spar to the tail bearing bulkhead.<ref>Rhodes{{page needed|date=February 2012}}</ref> The join was along the vertical centre line.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 7.">Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 7.</ref> This split construction greatly aided the assembly of the internal equipment as it allowed the technicians easy access to the fuselage interior.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 15.">Bowman 2005, p. 15.</ref> While the glue in the plywood skin dried, carpenters cut a sawtooth joint into the edges of the fuselage shells, while other workers installed the controls and cabling on the inside wall. When the glue completely dried, the two halves were glued and screwed together. The fuselage was strengthened internally by seven bulkheads made up of two plywood skins separated by spruce blocks, which formed the basis on each half for the outer shell.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 378.</ref> Each bulkhead was a repeat of the spruce design for the fuselage halves; a balsa sheet sandwich between two plywood sheets/skins. Bulkhead number seven carried the fittings and loads for the tailplane and rudder, The type of glue originally used was [[Casein]], which was later replaced by "[[Aerolite (adhesive)|Aerolite]]", a synthetic [[urea-formaldehyde]], which was more durable.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 43.</ref>{{refn| Aerolite was developed by Dr. [[Norman de Bruyne]] at [[Aero Research Limited]] (ARL)<ref>[http://uksaa-www.me.ic.ac.uk/awards.html "The De Bruyne Medal."] ''Society for Adhesion and Adhesives'' .</ref> The de Havilland company also pioneered the use of [[Radio frequency heating|radio frequency (RF) heating]] to accelerate curing of the adhesive.<ref>Mujumdar 1992, p. 131.</ref>|group=nb}} Many other types of screws and flanges (made of various woods) also held the structure together.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 7."/>

The fuselage construction joints were made from [[balsa]] wood and [[plywood]] strips with the [[spruce]] multi-ply being connected by a balsa V joint, along with the interior frame. The spruce would be reinforced by plywood strips at the point where the two halves joined to form the V-joint. Located on top of the joint the plywood formed the outer skin.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 15."/> During the joining of the two halves ("boxing up"), two laminated wooden clamps would be used in the after portion of the fuselage to act as support.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 15."/><ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 8.">Jackson 2003, p. 8.</ref> A covering of [[aircraft dope|doped]] [[Madapolam]] (a fine plain woven cotton) fabric was stretched tightly over the shell and a coat of silver dope was applied, after which the exterior camouflage was applied.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 42.</ref> The fuselage had a large ventral section cut-out, which was braced during construction, to allow it to be lowered onto the wing centre-section. Once the wing was secured the lower panels were replaced, and the bomb bay or armament doors fitted.<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 41–42.</ref>

===Wing===
[[File:Mosquito nmusaf.jpg|right|thumb|A preserved Mosquito B Mk XVI. Note the air and oil coolant radiators in the leading edge of the wing and the intake for the two-stage Merlin's intercooler radiator behind the propeller blade, and the carburettor intake with ice guard behind and below]]
The all-wood wing was built as a one-piece structure and was not divided into separate construction sections. It was made up of two main spars, spruce and plywood compression ribs, [[Longeron|stringers]], and a plywood covering. The outer plywood skin was covered and doped like the fuselage. The wing was installed into the roots by means of four large attachment points.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 7."/> The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 7."/> The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater.<ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 87.">Jackson 2003, p. 87.</ref> The wing contained metal framed and skinned [[ailerons]], but the flaps were made of wood and were hydraulically controlled. The nacelles were mostly wood, although, for strength, the engine mounts were all metal as were the undercarriage parts.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 7."/><ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 9.">Jackson 2003, p. 9.</ref> Engine mounts of welded steel tube were added, along with simple landing gear oleos filled with rubber blocks. Wood was used to carry only in-plane loads, with metal fittings used for all triaxially loaded components such as landing gear, engine mounts, control surface mounting brackets, and the wing-to-fuselage junction.<ref>Miracle and Donaldson 2001, p. 870.</ref> The outer leading wing edge had to be brought {{convert|22|in|cm}} further forward to accommodate this design.<ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 87."/> The main tail unit was all wood built. The control surfaces, the [[rudder]] and [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]], were [[aluminium]] framed and fabric covered.<ref name="Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 7."/><ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 9."/> The total weight of metal castings and forgings used in the aircraft was only {{convert|280|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=raaf>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/RAAFMuseum/exhibitions/restoration/dh_98.htm  "History of the de Havilland Mosquito."] ''RAAF Museum Point Cook'', 2007. Retrieved: 13 August 2009.</ref>

In November 1944, several crashes occurred in the [[Far East]]. At first, it was thought these were as a result of wing structure failures. The casein glue, it was said, cracked when exposed to extreme heat and/or monsoon conditions. This caused the upper surfaces to "lift" from the main spar. An investigating team led by Major Hereward de Havilland travelled to India and produced a report in early December 1944 stating that "the accidents were not caused by the deterioration of the glue but by shrinkage of the airframe during the wet monsoon season". However a later inquiry by Cabot & Myers definitely attributed the accidents to faulty manufacture and this was confirmed by a further investigation team by the Ministry of Aircraft Production at [[RAF Defford|Defford]] which found faults in six different Marks of Mosquito (all built at de Havilland's Hatfield and Leavesden plants) which showed similar defects, and none of the aircraft had been exposed to monsoon conditions or termite attack; thus it was concluded that there were construction defects found at the two plants. It was found that the "Standard of glueing...left much to be desired”.<ref name="Bowman 2005, pp. 15–16.">Bowman 2005, pp. 15–16.</ref><ref>Bowman 2012, p. 306</ref> Records at the time showed that accidents caused by "loss of control" were three times more frequent on Mosquitoes than on any other type of aircraft. The Air Ministry forestalled any loss of confidence in the Mosquito by holding to Major de Havilland's initial investigation in India that the accidents were caused "largely by climate"<ref>Bowman 2012, p. 266</ref> To solve the problem, a sheet of plywood was set along the span of the wing to seal the entire length of the skin joint along the main spar.<ref name="Bowman 2005, pp. 15–16."/>

===Systems===
[[File:RAF Museum London 082.jpg|thumb|upright|A view into the bomb bay showing the brick-red coloured twin fuel tanks fitted into the fuselage.]]

The fuel systems gave the Mosquito good range and endurance, using up to nine fuel tanks. Two outer wing tanks each contained {{convert|58|impgal|L}} of fuel.<ref name="Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes)">Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes).</ref> These were complemented by two inner wing fuel tanks, each containing {{convert|143|impgal|L}}, located between the wing root and engine nacelle. In the central fuselage were twin fuel tanks mounted between bulkhead number two and three aft of the cockpit.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 22.">Bowman 2005, p. 22.</ref> In the FB.VI, these tanks contained {{convert|25|impgal|L}} each,<ref name="Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes)" /> while in the B.IV and other unarmed Mosquitos each of the two centre tanks contained {{convert|68|impgal|L}}.<ref name="Air Ministry 1943, p. 6. (B IV notes)">Air Ministry 1943, p. 6. (B IV notes).</ref><ref name="Air Ministry 1944, p. 6. (PR VIII, PR IX, B IX, PR XVI, B XVI notes)">Air Ministry 1944, p. 6. (PR VIII, PR IX, B IX, PR XVI, B XVI notes).</ref>  Both the inner wing, and fuselage tanks are listed as the "main tanks" and the total internal fuel load of {{convert|452|impgal|L|disp=5}} was initially deemed appropriate for the type.<ref name="Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes)"/> In addition, the FB Mk VI could have larger fuselage tanks, increasing the capacity to {{convert|63|impgal|L}}.
Drop tanks of {{convert|50|impgal|L}} or {{convert|100|impgal|l}} could be mounted under each wing, increasing the total fuel load to {{convert|615|or|715|impgal|L}}.<ref name="Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes)"/>

The design of the Mark VI allowed for a provisional long-range fuel tank to increase range for action over enemy territory, for the installation of bomb release equipment specific for [[depth charge]]s for strikes against enemy shipping, or for the simultaneous use of rocket projectiles along with a {{convert|100|impgal|L}} drop tank under each wing supplementing the main fuel cells.<ref>Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes)</ref> The FB.VI had a wingspan of {{convert|54|ft| 2|in|m}}, a length (over guns) of {{convert|41|ft|2|in|m}}. It had a maximum speed of {{convert|378|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|13200|ft|m}}. Maximum take-off weight was {{convert|22300|lb|kg}} and the range of the aircraft was {{convert|1120|mi|km}} with a service ceiling of {{convert|26000|ft|m}}.<ref>Batchelor and Lowe 2008, pp. 16–17.</ref>

In order to reduce fuel vaporisation at the high altitudes at which photographic reconnaissance variants flew, the central and inner wing tanks were pressurised. The pressure venting cock located behind the pilot's seat controlled the pressure valve; as the altitude increased, the valve increased the volume applied by a pump. This system was extended to include field modifications of the fuel tank system.<ref>Air Ministry 1945, pp. 13–14. (FB 6 Notes)</ref>
The engine oil tanks were in the engine nacelles. Each nacelle contained a {{convert|15|impgal|l}} oil tank, including a {{convert|2.5|impgal|l|abbr=on}} air space. The oil tanks themselves had no separate coolant controlling systems. The coolant header tank was in the forward nacelle, behind the propeller. The remaining coolant systems were controlled by the coolant radiators shutters in the forward inner wing compartment, between the nacelle and the fuselage and behind the main engine cooling radiators which were fitted in the leading edge. Electric-pneumatic operated radiator shutters directed and controlled airflow through the ducts and into the coolant valves, to predetermined temperatures.<ref name="Air Ministry 1945, p. 14. (FB 6 notes)">Air Ministry 1945, p. 14. (FB 6 notes).</ref>

Electrical power came from a 24 volt DC generator on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine which supplied AC power for radios.<ref name="Bishop 1995 Appendix 1"/> The radiator shutters, supercharger gear change, gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release and all the other crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 volt battery.<ref name="Air Ministry 1945, p. 14. (FB 6 notes)"/> The radio communication devices included [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and HF communications, [[GEE (navigation)|GEE navigation]], and [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] and G.P. devices. The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically in the event of a crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers.<ref name="Air Ministry 1945, p. 44. (FB 6 notes)">Air Ministry 1945, p. 44. (FB 6 notes).</ref> The main landing gear, housed in the nacelles behind the engines, were raised and lowered hydraulically. The main landing gear shock absorbers were de Havilland manufactured and used a system of rubber in compression, rather than hydraulic oleos, with twin pneumatic brakes for each wheel.<ref name="Bishop 1995 Appendix 1">Bishop 1995, Appendix 1</ref> The Dunlop-Marstrand [[Speed wobble|anti-shimmy]] tailwheel was also retractable.

''W4064''.<ref>Scott 1999, p. 6.</ref> Throughout 1942, 105 Sdn., based at RAF Horsham St. Faith, then from 29 September, RAF Marham, undertook daylight low-level and shallow dive attacks.  Apart from the famous Oslo raid, these were mainly on industrial targets in occupied Netherlands, plus northern and western Germany.<ref>Scott 1999, p. v – Foreword by [[Ivor Broom|Air Marshal Sir Ivor Broom]]</ref> The crews faced deadly flak and fighters, particularly [[FW 190]]’s, which they called “snappers.”  Germany still controlled Continental airspace, and the FW 190’s were often already airborne and at an advantageous altitude.  It was the Mosquito’s excellent handling capabilities, rather than pure speed, that facilitated those evasions that were successful.<ref>Scott, 1999, pp 25, 32 – 33, 37 – 38</ref> During this daylight-raiding phase, aircrew losses were high – even the losses incurred in the squadron’s dangerous [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim]] era were exceeded in percentage terms.  The Roll of Honour shows 51 aircrew deaths from the end of May 1942 to April 1943.<ref>Scott, 1999, pp 197 – 200</ref>  In the corresponding period, crews gained three Mentions in Despatches, two DFM’s and three DFC’s.

The Mosquito was first announced publicly on 26 September 1942 after the [[Oslo Mosquito raid]] of 25 September.  It was featured in ''[[The Times]]'' on the 28 September, and the next day the newspaper published two captioned photographs illustrating the bomb strikes and damage.<ref>{{cite web

Mosquitos were widely used by the [[Pathfinder (RAF)|RAF Pathfinder Force]], marking targets for the main night-time [[strategic bombing]] force, as well as flying "nuisance raids" in which Mosquitos often dropped 4,000&nbsp;lb "Cookies". Despite an initially high loss rate, the Mosquito ended the war with the lowest losses of any aircraft in [[RAF Bomber Command]] service. Post war, the RAF found that when finally applied to bombing, in terms of useful damage done, the Mosquito had proved 4.95 times cheaper than the [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]].<ref>AVIA 46/116 ''De Havilland Mosquito'' papers, 1939–1945.</ref> In April 1943, in response to "political humiliation" caused by the Mosquito, Hermann Göring ordered the formation of special ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' units (''[[Jagdgeschwader 25]]'', commanded by ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' [[Herbert Ihlefeld]] and ''[[Jagdgeschwader 50]]'', under ''[[Major]]'' [[Hermann Graf]]) to combat the Mosquito attacks, though these units, which were "little more than glorified squadrons", were not very successful against the elusive RAF aircraft.<ref>Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 79.</ref>

In one example of the daylight precision raids carried out by the Mosquito, on 20 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of the [[Nazis]]' seizure of power, a Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station while [[Commander in Chief]] [[Reichsmarschall]] [[Hermann Göring]] was speaking, putting his speech off the air.<ref>Simons 2011, p. 160.</ref> Göring himself had strong views about the Mosquito, lecturing a group of German aircraft manufacturers in 1943 that:

{{quote|In 1940 I could at least fly as far as Glasgow in most of my aircraft, but not now! It makes me furious when I see the Mosquito. I turn green and yellow with envy. The British, who can afford aluminium better than we can, knock together a beautiful wooden aircraft that every piano factory over there is building, and they give it a speed which they have now increased yet again. What do you make of that? There is nothing the British do not have. They have the geniuses and we have the nincompoops. After the war is over I'm going to buy a British radio set – then at least I'll own something that has always worked.<ref>Boog et al. 2006, p. 407.</ref>}}

The Mosquito also proved a very capable [[night fighter]]. Some of the most successful RAF pilots flew the Mosquito. [[Bob Braham]] claimed around a third of his 29 kills in a Mosquito, flying mostly daytime operations, while on night fighters [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Branse Burbridge]] claimed 21 kills, and Wing Commander John Cunningham claimed 19 of his 20 victories at night on Mosquitos. Mosquitos of [[No. 100 Group RAF]] were responsible for the destruction of 257 German aircraft from December 1943 to April 1945. Mosquito fighters from all units accounted for 487 German aircraft during the war, the vast majority of which were night fighters.<ref>Boiten 1997, pp. 188–189.</ref>

One Mosquito is listed as belonging to German secret operations unit ''[[Kampfgeschwader 200]]'', which tested, evaluated and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft during the war. The aircraft was listed on the [[order of battle]] of ''Versuchsverband OKL''{{'}}s, ''2 Staffel'', ''Stab Gruppe'' on 10 November and 31 December 1944. However, on both lists, the Mosquito is listed as unserviceable.<ref>Thomas and Ketley 2003, pp. 178–179.</ref>

The Mosquito flew its last official European war mission on 21 May 1945, when Mosquitos of 143 Squadron and 248 Squadron RAF were ordered to continue to hunt German submarines that might be tempted to continue the fight; instead of submarines all the Mosquitos encountered were passive [[E-boat]]s.<ref>Bowman 2005, p. 119.</ref>

==Variants==
Until the end of 1942 the RAF always used [[Roman numeral]]s (I, II, ...) for mark numbers; 1943–1948 was a transition period during which new aircraft entering service were given [[Arabic numeral]]s (1, 2, ...) for mark numbers, but older aircraft retained their Roman numerals. From 1948 onwards, Arabic numerals were used exclusively.

===Prototypes===
Three prototypes were built, each with a different configuration. The first to fly was ''W4050'' on 25 November 1940, followed by the fighter ''W4052'' on 15 May 1941 and the photo-reconnaissance prototype ''W4051'' on 10 June 1941. ''W4051'' later flew operationally with [[1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit]] (1 PRU).

The Mosquito '''PR Mk VIII''', built as a stopgap pending the introduction of the refined PR Mk IX, was the next photo-reconnaissance version. The five VIIIs were converted from B Mk IVs and became the first operational Mosquito version to be powered by two-stage, two-speed supercharged engines, using {{convert|1565|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Rolls-Royce Merlin 61 engines in place of Merlin 21/22s.

The Mosquito '''PR Mk XVI''' had a pressurised cockpit and, like the Mk IX, was powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 72/73 or 76/77 piston engines. This version was equipped with three overload fuel tanks, totalling {{convert|760|impgal|L}} in the bomb bay, and could also carry two {{convert|50|impgal|L}} or {{convert|100|impgal|L}} drop tanks.<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 274–275.</ref> A total of 435 of the PR Mk XVI were built.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 164."/> The PR Mk XVI had a maximum speed of {{convert|415|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, a cruise speed of {{convert|250|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, ceiling of {{convert|38500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, a range of {{convert|2450|nmi|km|abbr=on}}, and a climb rate of 2,900 feet per minute (884 m).<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 25."/>

The Mosquito '''PR Mk 32''' was a long-range, high-altitude, pressurised photo-reconnaissance version. It was powered by a pair of two-stage supercharged {{convert|1960|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Rolls-Royce Merlin 113 and Merlin 114 piston engines, the Merlin 113 on the starboard side and the Merlin 114 on the port. First flown in August 1944, only five were built and all were conversions from PR.XVIs.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 165.">Bowman 2005, p. 165.</ref>

The Mosquito '''PR Mk 34''' and '''PR Mk 34A''' was a very long-range unarmed high altitude photo-reconnaissance version. The fuel tank and cockpit protection armour were removed. Additional fuel was carried in a bulged bomb bay: 1,192 gallons which was the equivalent of {{convert|5419|mi|km}}. A further two 200-gallon (910-litre) drop tanks under the outer wings gave a range of {{convert|3600|mi|km}} cruising at {{convert|300|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Powered by two {{convert|1690|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Merlin 114s first used in the PR.32. The port Merlin 114 drove a Marshal cabin supercharger. A total of 181 were built, including 50 built by [[Percival Aircraft]] Company at [[Luton]].<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 165."/> The PR.34's maximum speed (TAS) was {{convert|335|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at sea level, {{convert|405|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|17000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|425|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="The latest Mosquitoes.">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%200399.html?tracked=1 "The latest Mosquitoes."] ''Flight,'' 28 February 1946 via ''flightglobal.com''. Retrieved: 17 August 2010.</ref>
All PR.34s were installed with four split F52 vertical cameras, two forward, two aft of the fuselage tank and one F24 oblique camera. Sometimes a K-17 camera was used for air surveys. In August 1945, the PR.34A was the final photo-reconnaissance variant with one Merlin 113A and 114A each delivering {{convert|1710|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 166.">Bowman 2005, p. 166.</ref>

[[Image:De Havilland Mosquito-DK338-1942.jpg|thumb|Mosquito B Mk IV Series 2, ''DK338'', built in September 1942 and delivered to [[No. 105 Squadron RAF|105 Squadron]], becoming GB-O.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 197–198, 423.</ref>]]
On 21 June 1941 the Air Ministry ordered that the last 10 Mosquitoes, ordered as photo-reconnaissance aircraft, should be converted to bombers. These 10 aircraft were part of the original 1 March 1940 production order and became the '''B Mk IV Series 1'''. ''W4052'' was to be the prototype and flew for the first time on 8 September 1941.<ref name="Bowman 2005, pp. 22–23.">Bowman 2005, pp. 22–23.</ref>

The bomber prototype led to the '''B Mk IV''', of which 273 were built: apart from the 10 Series 1s, all of the rest were built as Series 2s with extended nacelles, revised exhaust manifolds, with integrated flame dampers, and larger tailplanes.<ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 15.">Jackson 2003, p. 15.</ref> Series 2 bombers also differed from the Series 1 in having a larger bomb bay to increase the payload to four {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}} bombs, instead of the four {{convert|250|lb|kg}} bombs of Series 1. This was made possible by shortening the tail of the {{convert|500|lb|kg}} bomb so that these four larger weapons could be carried (or a 2,000&nbsp;lb (920;kg) total load).<ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 15."/> The B Mk IV entered service in May 1942 with [[No. 105 Squadron RAF|105 Squadron]].

In April 1943 it was decided to convert a B Mk IV to carry a [[Blockbuster bomb|4,000&nbsp;lb (1,812&nbsp;kg), thin-cased high explosive bomb]] (nicknamed "Cookie"). The conversion, including modified bomb bay suspension arrangements, bulged bomb bay doors and fairings, was relatively straightforward, and 54 B.IVs were subsequently modified and distributed to squadrons of [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s [[Pathfinder (RAF)#Light Night Striking Force|Light Night Striking Force]].<ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 15."/><ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 306–307</ref> 27 B Mk IVs were later converted for special operations with the [[Bouncing bomb|Highball]] anti-shipping weapon, and were used by [[No. 618 Squadron RAF|618 Squadron]], formed in April 1943 specifically to use this weapon.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 74, 76–78.</ref> A B Mk IV, ''DK290'' was initially used as a trials aircraft for the bomb, followed by ''DZ471,530 and 533''.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 74–75.</ref> The B Mk IV had a maximum speed of {{convert|380|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, a cruising speed of {{convert|265|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, ceiling of {{convert|34000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, a range of {{convert|2040|nmi|km|abbr=on}}, and a climb rate of 2,500&nbsp;ft per minute (762 m).<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 25."/>

Other bomber variants of the Mosquito included the Merlin 21 powered '''B Mk V''' high-altitude version. Trials with this configuration were made with ''W4057'' which had the wings strengthened and two additional fuel tanks, or alternatively two {{convert|500|lb|kg}} bombs. This design was not produced in Britain, but formed the basic design of the Canadian-built B.VII. Only ''W4057'' was built in prototype form.<ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 16.">Jackson 2003, p. 16.</ref> The Merlin 31 powered '''B Mk VII''' was built by de Havilland Canada and first flown on 24 September 1942. It only saw service in Canada, 25 were built. Six were handed over to the [[United States Army Air Forces]].

'''B Mk IX''' (54 built) was powered by the Merlin 72,73, 76 or 77. The two-stage Merlin variant was based on the PR.IX. The prototype ''DK 324'' was converted from a PR.VIII and first flew on 24 March 1943.<ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 17.">Jackson 2003, p. 17.</ref> In October 1943 it was decided that all B Mk IVs and all B Mk IXs then in service would be converted to carry the {{convert|4000|lb|kg}} "Cookie", and all B Mk IXs built after that date were designed to allow them to be converted to carry the weapon.<ref name="S&P306">Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 306</ref> The B Mk IX had a maximum speed of {{convert|408|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, an economical cruise speed of {{convert|295|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at 20,000&nbsp;ft, and {{convert|350|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at 30,000&nbsp;ft,<ref name="avialogs.com"/>  ceiling of {{convert|36000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, a range of {{convert|2450|nmi|km|abbr=on}}, and a climb rate of 2,850 feet per minute (869 m). The IX could carry a maximum load of {{convert|2000|-|4000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of bombs.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 25."/> A Mosquito B Mk IX holds the record for the most combat operations flown by an Allied bomber in the Second World War. ''LR503'', known as "F for Freddie" (from its squadron code letters, GB*F), first served with [[No. 109 Squadron RAF|No. 109]] and subsequently, [[No. 105 Squadron RAF|No. 105]] RAF squadrons. It flew 213 sorties during the war, only to crash at Calgary airport during the Eighth Victory Loan Bond Drive on 10 May 1945, two days after [[Victory in Europe Day]], killing both the pilot, Flt. Lt. Maurice Briggs, DSO, DFC, DFM and navigator Fl. Off. John Baker, DFC and Bar.<ref>Bowman 2005, p. 70.</ref>

The '''B Mk XVI''' was powered by the same variations as the B.IX. All B Mk XVIs were capable of being converted to carry the {{convert|4000|lb|kg}} "Cookie".<ref name="S&P306"/> The two-stage powerplants were added along with a pressurised cabin. ''DZ540'' first flew on 1 January 1944. The prototype was converted from a IV (402 built). The next variant, the '''B Mk XX''', was powered by Packard Merlins 31 and 33s. It was the Canadian version of the IV. Altogether, 245 were built. The B Mk XVI had a maximum speed of {{convert|408|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, an economical cruise speed of {{convert|295|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at 20,000&nbsp;ft, and {{convert|350|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at 30,000&nbsp;ft,<ref name="avialogs.com"/> ceiling of {{convert|37000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, a range of {{convert|1485|nmi|km|abbr=on}}, and a climb rate of 2,800&nbsp;ft per minute (853 m).

The '''B.35''' was powered by Merlin 113 and 114As. Some were converted to TT.35s (Target Tugs) and others were used as PR.35s (photo-reconnaissance).<ref name="Jackson 2003, p. 17."/>  The B.35 had a maximum speed of {{convert|422|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, a cruising speed of {{convert|276|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, ceiling of {{convert|42000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, a range of {{convert|1750|nmi|km|abbr=on}}, and a climb rate of 2,700&nbsp;ft per minute (823 m).<ref>Bowman 2005, p. 26.</ref> A total of 174 B.35s were delivered up to the end of 1945. {{refn|RV series 4; TA series 82; TH/TJ series 60; and TK series 19.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, table p. 90.</ref>|group=nb}} A further 100 were delivered from 1946 for a grand total of 274, 65 of which were built by Airspeed Ltd.{{refn|The final 100 were: RS series 25; TK series 35; VP series 25; and VR series 15.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, table p. 94.</ref>|group=nb}}<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 166." />

[[File:Royal Air Force Operations in the Far East, 1941-1945. CI581.jpg|thumb|right|F Mk II in India circa 1943]]
Developed during 1940, the first prototype of the '''Mosquito F Mk II''' was completed on 15 May 1941. These Mosquitos were fitted with four {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano cannon]] in the fuselage belly and four [[.303 British|.303 (7.7 mm)]] [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]] mounted in the nose. On production Mk IIs the machine guns and ammunition tanks were accessed via two centrally hinged, sideways opening doors in the upper nose section. To arm and service the cannon the bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors: the F and NF Mk IIs could not carry bombs.<ref name="Thirsk 2006, pp. 125, 134"/> The type was also fitted with a [[gun camera]] in a compartment above the machine guns in the nose and was fitted with exhaust flame dampers to reduce the glare from the Merlin XXs.<ref>Bowman 2005, p. 13.</ref>

In August 1942 Britain experienced several incursions of high-altitude Luftwaffe bombers, including the [[Junkers Ju 86|Junkers Ju-86P]]. As a result of these raids, starting in September 1942, five Mosquito B Mk IV bombers were quickly converted into '''F Mk XV''' high-altitude, pressurised fighters, powered by two-stage Merlin 73s and 77s fitted with four-bladed propellers.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 62–63.</ref>

The first of these conversions was ''MP469'', which was wheeled into the experimental shop on 7 September and first flew on 14 September. The bomber nose forward of the cockpit was cut off and a standard fighter nose, complete with four .303 Brownings, grafted on in its place. The pressurised crew cabin retained the bomber's canopy structure, with a vee-shaped, two-piece windscreen, while the bomber's control wheel was replaced by the fighter's control stick. Extended, pointed, wingtips increased the wingspan to {{convert|59|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The airframe was lightened by removing all armour plating, bullet-proofing from the fuel and oil tanks, and the outer wing and fuselage tanks (leaving the inner wing tanks with a total capacity of {{convert|287|impgal|L|abbr=on}}). Other ancillary equipment was also removed, and smaller-diameter main wheels were fitted after the first few flights. At a loaded weight of {{convert|16,200|lb|abbr=on}} the Mk XV was {{convert|2,300|lb|abbr=on}} lighter than a standard Mk II, and reached an altitude of {{convert|45,000|ft|m}}. Four more B Mk IVs were converted into F Mk XVs, and, in late 1942, were further modified to become '''NF MK XVs'''.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 63–67.</ref>

All fighters and fighter bombers, apart from the F Mk XV, featured a modified canopy structure incorporating a flat, single piece [[Bulletproof glass|armoured windscreen]], and the crew entry/exit door was moved from the bottom of the forward fuselage to the right side of the nose, just forward of the wing leading edge.<ref>Scutts 1993, pp. 4–5.</ref>

===Night fighters===
{{Commonscat-inline|De Havilland Mosquito NF}}<br>
[[File:De Havilland Mosquitoat NF II at RAF Predannack.jpg|thumb|Mosquito NF Mk II ''W4092'' of [[No. 157 Squadron RAF|157 Squadron]], January 1944. Just visible is part of the aerial array for the A.I. Mk IV near the wingtip.]]
At the end of 1940, the Air Staff's preferred night fighter design was the Gloster F.18/40 (derived from [[Gloster F.9/37|their F.9/37]]). However, although in agreement as to the quality of the Gloster company's design, the Ministry of Aircraft Production was concerned that Gloster would not be able to work on the F.18/40 and also the jet fighter design, considered the greater priority. Consequently, in mid-1941 the Air Staff and MAP agreed that the Gloster aircraft would be dropped and the Mosquito considered for the night fighter requirement instead.<ref>Buttler pp. 61–62</ref>

The first production [[night fighter]] Mosquitos were designated '''NF Mk II'''. A total of 466 were built with the first entering service with [[No. 157 Squadron RAF|No. 157 Squadron]] in January 1942, replacing the [[A-20 Havoc|Douglas Havoc]]. These aircraft were similar to the F Mk II, but were fitted with the [[AI Mk. IV radar|AI Mk IV]] metric [[wavelength]] [[radar]]. The herring-bone [[transmitter|transmitting]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] was mounted on the nose and the dipole [[receiver (radio)|receiving]] antennae were carried under the outer wings.<ref>Scutts 1993, p. 7.</ref> A number of NF IIs had their radar equipment removed and additional fuel tanks installed in the bay behind the cannon for use as night intruders. These aircraft, designated '''NF II (Special)''' were first used by [[No. 23 Squadron RAF|23 Squadron]] in operations over Europe in 1942.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 338–339.</ref> 23 Squadron was then deployed to Malta on 20 December 1942, and operated against targets in Italy.<ref>Scutts 1993, p. 8.</ref>

Ninety-seven NF Mk IIs were upgraded with centimetric [[AI Mk. VIII radar|AI Mk VIII]] radar and these were designated '''NF Mk XII'''. The '''NF Mk XIII''', of which 270 were built, was the production equivalent of the Mk XII conversions. The centimetric radar sets were mounted in a solid "thimble" (Mk XII / XIII) or universal "bull nose" (Mk XVII / XIX) radome, which required the machine guns to be dispensed with.
[[File:De Havilland Mosquitoat night takeoff.jpg|thumb|NF Mk XIII of [[No. 256 Squadron RAF|256 Squadron]], with the "bull nose", caught in the beam of a Chance light on the main runway at [[Foggia]], Italy, before taking off on a night intruder sortie.]]

Four F Mk XVs were converted to the '''NF Mk XV'''. These were fitted with AI Mk VIII in a "thimble" radome, and the .303 Brownings were moved into a gun pack fitted under the forward fuselage.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 65–67.</ref>

''' NF Mk XVII''' was the designation for 99 NF Mk II conversions, with single-stage Merlin 21, 22, or 23 engines, but British AI.X (US SCR-720) radar.

The '''NF Mk XIX''' was an improved version of the NF XIII. It could be fitted with American or British AI radars; 220 were built.

The '''NF Mk 30''' was the final wartime variant and was a high-altitude version, powered by two {{convert|1710|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Rolls-Royce Merlin 76s. The NF Mk 30 had a maximum speed of {{convert|424|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|26500|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 434.</ref> It also carried early [[electronic countermeasures]] equipment. 526 were built.
[[File:DH.98 Mosquito NFXIX MM638 RSwAF RWY 10.49 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Swedish Air Force NF.XIX operational in 1949.]]
Other Mosquito night fighter variants which were planned for, but never built, included the '''NF Mk X''' and '''NF Mk XIV''' (the latter based on the NF Mk XIII), both of which were to have two-stage Merlins. The '''NF Mk 31''' was a variant of the NF Mk 30, but powered by Packard Merlins.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 396, 398.</ref>

Mosquito night intruders of [[No. 100 Group RAF|100 Group]], Bomber Command, were also fitted with a device called "[[Serrate radar detector|Serrate]]" to allow them to track down German night fighters from their [[Lichtenstein radar|Lichtenstein]] B/C and SN-2 radar emissions, as well as a device named "Perfectos" that tracked German [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] signals.

After the war, two more night fighter versions were developed:
The '''NF Mk 36''' was similar to the Mosquito NF Mk 30, but fitted with the American-built AI.Mk X radar. Powered by two {{convert|1690|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Rolls-Royce Merlin 113/114 piston engines; 266 built. Max level speeds (TAS) with flame dampers fitted were {{convert|305|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at sea level, {{convert|380|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|17000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|405|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="The latest Mosquitoes."/>

The '''NF Mk 38''', 101 of which were built, was also similar to the Mosquito NF Mk 30, but fitted with the British-built AI Mk IX radar. This variant suffered from stability problems and did not enter RAF service: 60 were eventually sold to Yugoslavia.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 61.</ref> According to the Pilot's Notes and Air Ministry 'Special Flying Instruction TF/487', which posted limits on the Mosquito's maximum speeds, the NF Mk 38 had a VNE of 370 knots (425&nbsp;mph), without under-wing stores, and within the altitude range of sea level to {{convert|10000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. However, from 10,000 to {{convert|15000|ft|m|abbr=on}} the maximum speed was 348 knots (400&nbsp;mph). As the height increased other recorded speeds were; 15,000 to {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}} 320 knots (368&nbsp;mph); 20,000 to {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 295 knots (339&nbsp;mph); 25,000 to {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 260 knots (299&nbsp;mph); 30,000 to {{convert|35000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 235 knots (270&nbsp;mph). With two added 100-gallon fuel tanks this performance fell; between sea level and 15,000 feet 330 knots (379&nbsp;mph); between 15,000 to {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}} 320 knots (368&nbsp;mph); 20,000 to {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 295 knots (339&nbsp;mph); 25,000 to {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 260 knots (299&nbsp;mph); 30,000 to {{convert|35000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 235 knots (270&nbsp;mph). Little difference was noted above {{convert|15000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Air Ministry 1945, pp. 38–39. (NF 38 Notes)</ref>

===Fighter-bombers===
{{Commonscat-inline|De Havilland Mosquito FB}}
[[File:Bombing up Mosquito RAF Hunsdon 1944 IWM CH 12407.jpg|thumb|upright|Guns and bombs of an RAAF FB Mk VI]]

The '''FB Mk VI''', which first flew on 1 June 1942, was powered by two {{convert|1460|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Merlin 21s or {{convert|1635|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Merlin 25s, and introduced a re-stressed and reinforced "basic" wing structure capable of carrying single {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} or {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on}} bombs on racks housed in streamlined fairings under each wing, or up to eight [[RP-3|RP-3 25lb or 60 lb rockets]]. In addition fuel lines were added to the wings to enable single {{convert|50|impgal|l|abbr=on}} or {{convert|100|impgal|l|abbr=on}} drop tanks to be carried under each wing.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 164."/><ref name="Stre177">Streetly 1981, p. 177.</ref> The usual fixed armament was four 20&nbsp;mm [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano Mk.II cannon]] and four .303 (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]], while two {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} or {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on}} bombs could be carried in the bomb bay.{{refn|The FB Mk VI was built in two sub-series, differentiated by the weight of offensive stores able to be carried: Series i aircraft could only carry {{convert|250|lb|kg}} bombs, while Series ii could carry the {{convert|500|lb|kg}} bombs.<ref name="Stre177"/>|group=nb}}

Unlike the F Mk II, the ventral bay doors were split into two pairs, with the forward pair being used to access the cannon, while the rear pair acted as bomb bay doors.<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 50, 208, 216.</ref> The maximum fuel load which could be carried was {{convert|719.5|impgal|l}} distributed between {{convert|453|impgal|l}} internal fuel tanks, plus two overload tanks, each of {{convert|66.5|impgal|l}} capacity, which could be fitted in the bomb bay, and two {{convert|100|impgal|l}} drop tanks.<ref name="Stre177"/> All-out level speed is often given as {{convert|368|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, although this speed applies to aircraft fitted with saxophone exhausts. The test aircraft (''HJ679'') fitted with stub exhausts was found to be performing below expectations. It was returned to de Havilland at Hatfield where it was serviced. Its top speed was then tested and found to be {{convert|384|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, in line with expectations.<ref>[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mosquito/hj679-dh.pdf "Mosquito FB. Mk.

The FB Mk VI proved capable of holding its own with single-engine [[fighter aircraft]] in addition to bombing. For example, on 15 January 1945 Mosquito FB Mk VIs of [[No. 143 Squadron RAF|143 Squadron]] were engaged by 30 [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s from ''[[Jagdgeschwader 5]]'': nonetheless, the Mosquitos sank an armed trawler and two merchant ships, losing five Mosquitos (two to flak)<ref>Bird 2003, pp. 94 – 98.</ref> but shooting down five Fw 190s.<ref>Bowman 2005, p. 112.</ref>

[[File:613 Squadron Mosquito FB.VI at RAF Lasham June 1944.jpg|left|thumb|An FB Mk VI ''NS898'' of [[No. 613 Squadron RAF|613 Squadron]], June 1944, shows full [[invasion stripes]] and is well weathered through operational use.]]
Another fighter-bomber variant was the '''Mosquito FB Mk XVIII''' (sometimes known as the ''[[Tsetse fly|Tsetse]]'') of which one was converted from a FB Mk VI to serve as prototype and 17 were purpose-built. The Mk XVIII was armed with a Molins "6-pounder Class M" cannon: this was a modified [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6-pounder (57&nbsp;mm) anti-tank gun]] fitted with an [[auto-loader]] to allow both semi- or fully automatic fire.{{refn|"Molins" refers specifically to the auto-loading mechanism which was added to the ordnance; it was produced by the Molins company.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 165."/>|group=nb}} 25 rounds were carried, with the entire installation weighing {{convert|1580|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 165."/>  In addition, {{convert|900|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of armour was added within the engine cowlings, around the nose and under the cockpit floor to protect the engines and crew from heavily armed U-boats, the intended primary target of the Mk XVIII.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 271.</ref> Two or four .303 (7.7&nbsp;mm) Browning machine guns were retained in the nose and were used to "sight" the main weapon onto the target.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 165."/>

The [[Air Ministry]] initially suspected that this variant would not work, but tests proved otherwise. Although the gun provided the Mosquito with yet more anti-shipping firepower for use against U-boats, it required a steady approach run to aim and fire the gun, making it vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. The gun had a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2950|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 165."/> and an excellent range of some 1,800 – 1,500 yards (1,650 – 1,370 m). It was sensitive to sidewards movement; an attack required a dive from {{convert|5000|ft|m|abbr=on}} at a 30° angle with the [[turn and bank indicator]] on centre. A move during the dive could jam the gun.<ref>Bowman 2005, p. 105.</ref> The prototype ''HJ732'' was converted from a FB.VI and was first flown on 8 June 1943.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 165."/>

The effect of the new weapon was demonstrated on 10 March 1944 when Mk XVIIIs from 248 Squadron (escorted by four Mk VIs) engaged a German convoy of one U-boat and four destroyers, protected by 10 [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88s]]. Three of the Ju 88s were shot down. Pilot Tony Phillips destroyed one Ju 88 with four shells, one of which tore an engine off the Ju 88. The U-boat was damaged. On 25 March, ''[[German submarine U-976|U-976]]'' was sunk by Molins-equipped Mosquitos.<ref>Bowman 2005, pp. 106–106.</ref> On 10 June, ''[[German submarine U-821|U-821]]'' was abandoned in the face of intense air attack from No. 248 Squadron, and was later sunk by a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberator]] of No. 206 Squadron.<ref>Bowman 2005, p. 108.</ref> On 5 April 1945 Mosquitos with Molins attacked five German surface ships in the [[Kattegat]] and again demonstrated their value by setting them all on fire and sinking them.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 115.">Bowman 2005, p. 115.</ref><ref>Bowman 1997, p. 77.</ref> A German ''[[Sperrbrecher]]'' ("minefield breaker") was lost with all hands, with some 200 bodies being recovered by [[Sweden|Swedish]] vessels.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 115."/> Some 900 German soldiers died in total.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 115."/> On 9 April, German U-boats ''[[German submarine U-804|U-804]]'', ''[[German submarine U-843|U-843]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-1065|U-1065]]'' were spotted in formation heading for [[Norway]].

Despite the preference for rockets, a further development of the large gun idea was carried out using the even larger [[Ordnance QF 32 pounder|QF 32-pounder]], a gun based on the [[QF 3.7 inch AA gun]] designed for tank use, the airborne version using a novel form of [[muzzle brake]]. Developed to prove the feasibility of using such a large weapon in the Mosquito, this installation was not completed until after the war, when it was flown and fired in a single aircraft without problems, then scrapped.

Designs based on the Mk VI were the '''FB Mk 26''', built in Canada, and the '''FB Mk 40''', built in Australia, powered by [[Packard V-1650|Packard Merlins]]. The FB.26 improved from the FB.21 using {{convert|1620|hp|kW|abbr=on}} single stage Packard Merlin 225s. Some 300 were built and another 37 converted to T.29 standard.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 165."/> 212 FB.40s were built by de Havilland Australia. Six were converted to PR.40; 28 to PR.41s, one to FB.42 and 22 to T.43s tactical assault aircraft. Most were powered by Packard-built Merlin 31 or 33s.<ref name="Bowman 2005, p. 166."/>

===Trainers===
The Mosquito was also built as the '''Mosquito T Mk III''' two-seat [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]]. This version, powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 21s, was unarmed and had a modified cockpit fitted with dual control arrangements. A total of 348 of the '''T Mk III''' were built for the RAF and [[Fleet Air Arm]]. [[de Havilland Australia]] built 11 '''T Mk 43''' trainers, similar to the Mk III.

===Torpedo-bombers===
To meet specification [[N.15/44]] for a navalised Mosquito for [[Royal Navy]] use as a torpedo bomber, de Havilland produced a [[aircraft carrier|carrier-borne]] variant. A Mosquito FB.VI was modified as a prototype designated '''Sea Mosquito TR Mk 33''' with folding wings, arrester hook, thimble nose radome, Merlin 25 engines with four-bladed propellers and a new oleo-pneumatic landing gear rather than the standard rubber-in-compression gear. Initial carrier tests of the Sea Mosquito were carried out by [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric "Winkle" Brown]] aboard [[HMS Indefatigable (R10)|HMS ''Indefatigable'']], the first landing-on taking place on 25 March 1944. An order for 100 TR.33s was placed although only 50 were built at Leavesden. Armament was four 20&nbsp;mm cannon, two 500&nbsp;lb bombs in the bomb bay (another two could be fitted under the wings), eight 60&nbsp;lb rockets (four under each wing) and a standard torpedo under the fuselage. The first production TR.33 flew on 10 November 1945. This series was followed by six '''Sea Mosquito TR Mk 37'''s, which differed in having ASV Mk XIII radar instead of the TR.33's AN/APS-6.

===Target tugs===

The RAF's target tug version was the '''Mosquito TT Mk 35''', which were the last aircraft to remain in operational service with No 3 CAACU at Exeter, being finally retired in 1963. These aircraft were then featured in the film [[633 Squadron]]. 
A number of B Mk XVIs bombers were converted into TT Mk 39 target tug aircraft. The Royal Navy also operated the '''Mosquito TT Mk 39''' for target towing. 
Two ex-RAF FB.6s were converted to TT.6 standard at [[Manchester Airport|Manchester (Ringway) Airport]] by [[Fairey Aviation]] in 1953–1954, and delivered to the [[Belgian Air Force]] for use as towing aircraft from the [[Sylt]] firing ranges.

===Details===
[[File:MossyPrepare42beautypic.jpg|thumb|B Mk IV ''DK336'' of [[No. 105 Squadron RAF|105 Squadron]] being prepared for [[No. 2 Group RAF#History|Operation Oyster]], December 1942.]]

In England, fuselage shells were mainly made by furniture companies, including Ronson, [[G-Plan|E. Gomme]], [[Parker Knoll]] and Styles & Mealing. Some of the specialised [[wood veneer]] used in the construction of the Mosquito was made by Roddis Manufacturing in [[Marshfield, Wisconsin]], United States. Hamilton Roddis had teams of young women ironing the (unusually thin) strong wood veneer before shipping to the UK.<ref name="Cole">Cole 2001{{page needed|date=January 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.foresthistory.org/publications/fht/fhtspringfall2005/fht05_hotr_wisconsin.pdf Forest History, Fall 2005, pp. 65–66] Retrieved: 30 July 2013.</ref><ref>[http://www.marshfieldnewsherald.com/article/20131023/MNH01/310230453/Marshfield-women-recall-building-engineering-marvels-skies "Marshfield women recall building engineering marvels of the skies"], Marshfield News Herald, Oct. 23, 2013.</ref> Wing spars were made by J.B. Heath and Dancer & Hearne. Many of the other parts, including flaps, flap shrouds, fins, leading edge assemblies and bomb doors were also produced in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, which was well suited to these tasks because of a well-established furniture manufacturing industry. Dancer & Hearne processed much of the wood from start to finish, receiving timber and transforming it into finished wing spars at their [[High Wycombe]] factory.

About 5,000 of the 7,781 Mosquitos made contained parts made in High Wycombe.<ref name="Cole"/> In Canada, fuselages were built in the [[Oshawa]], [[Ontario]] plant of [[General Motors]] of Canada Limited. These were shipped to [[De Havilland]] Canada in Toronto for mating to fuselages and completion. As a secondary manufacturer, de Havilland Australia started construction in Sydney. These production lines added 1,133<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 52.</ref> from Canada and 212 from Australia.

Total Mosquito production was 7,781 of which 6,710 were built during the war. The ferry operation of the Mosquito from Canada to the war front was problematic, as a small fraction of the aircraft mysteriously disappeared over mid-Atlantic. The theory of "auto-explosion" was offered, and, although a considerable effort by de Havilland Canada to resolve production problems with engine and oil systems reduced the number of aircraft lost, the actual cause of the losses was never established. The company introduced an additional five hours flight testing to clear production aircraft before the ferry flight. By the end of the war, nearly 500 Mosquito bombers and fighter-bombers had been delivered successfully by the Canadian operation.<ref>Hotson 1983, pp. 77–87.</ref>
