<article title='Disk_storage'><paragraph><template><target>Refimprove</target><arg name="date">March 2013</arg></template><bold>Disk storage</bold><space/>is a general category of storage mechanisms where data are recorded by various electronic, magnetic, optical, or mechanical changes to a surface layer of one or more rotating disks. A<space/><bold>disk drive</bold><space/>is a device implementing such a storage mechanism. Notable types are the<space/><link><target>hard disk drive</target></link><space/>(HDD) containing a non-removable disk, the<space/><link><target>floppy disk</target><part>floppy disk drive</part></link><space/>(FDD) and its removable<space/><link><target>floppy disk</target></link>, and various<space/><link><target>optical disc drive</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and associated<space/><link><target>optical disc</target></link><space/>media.</paragraph><paragraph>(The<space/><link><target>Spelling of disc</target><part>spelling '''disk''' and '''disc'''</part></link><space/>are used interchangeably except where trademarks preclude one usage, e.g. the Compact Disc logo.

Each disk is divided into logical<space/><link><target>Block (data storage)</target><part>blocks</part></link><space/>(collection of sectors). Blocks are addressed using their<space/><link><target>Logical block addressing</target><part>logical block addresses</part></link><space/>(LBA). Read from or writing to disk happens at the granularity of blocks.</paragraph><paragraph>Originally the disk capacity was quite low and has been improved in one of several ways. Improvements in mechanical design and manufacture allowed smaller and more precise heads, meaning that more tracks could be stored on each of the disks. Advancements in data compression methods permitted more information to be stored in each of the individual sectors.</paragraph><paragraph>The drive stores data onto<space/><link><target>Cylinder-head-sector</target><part>cylinders, heads, and sectors</part></link>. The sectors unit is the smallest size of data to be stored in a hard disk drive and each file will have many sectors units assigned to it. The smallest entity in a CD is called a frame, which consists of 33 bytes and contains six complete 16-bit stereo samples (two bytes two channels six samples = 24 bytes). The other nine bytes consist of eight CIRC error-correction bytes and one<space/><link><target>Compact disc subcode</target><part>subcode</part></link><space/>byte used for control and display.</paragraph><paragraph>The information is sent from the computer processor to the BIOS into a chip controlling the data transfer. This is then sent out to the hard drive via a multi-wire connector. Once the data are received onto the circuit board of the drive, they are translated and compressed into a format that the individual drive can use to store onto the disk itself. The data are then passed to a chip on the circuit board that controls the access to the drive. The drive is divided into sectors of data stored onto one of the sides of one of the internal disks. An HDD with two disks internally will typically store data on all four surfaces.</paragraph><paragraph>The hardware on the drive tells the actuator arm where it is to go for the relevant track and the compressed information is then sent down to the head which changes the physical properties, optically or magnetically for example, of each byte on the drive, thus storing the information. A file is not stored in a linear manner, rather, it is held in the best way for quickest retrieval.</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>anchor</target><arg>CAV-CLV</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Rotation speed and track layout</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Comparison disk storage.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<xhtml:br></xhtml:br><extension extension_name='nowiki'>*</extension><space/>Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.</part></link>Mechanically there are two different motions occurring inside the drive. One is the rotation of the disks inside the device. The other is the side-to-side motion of the head across the disk as it moves between tracks.</paragraph><paragraph>There are two types of disk rotation methods:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>constant linear velocity</target></link><space/>(used mainly in optical storage) varies the rotational speed of the optical disc depending upon the position of the head, and</listitem><listitem><link><target>constant angular velocity</target></link><space/>(used in HDDs, standard FDDs, a few optical disc systems, and<space/><link><target>Gramophone record</target><part>vinyl audio records</part></link>) spins the media at one constant speed regardless of where the head is positioned.</listitem></list><paragraph>Track positioning also follows two different methods across disk storage devices. Storage devices focused on holding computer data, e.g., HDDs, FDDs, Iomega<space/><link><target>zip drive</target><trail>s</trail></link>, use concentric tracks to store data. During a sequential read or write operation, after the drive accesses all the sectors in a track it repositions the head(s) to the next track. This will cause a momentary delay in the flow of data between the device and the computer. In contrast, optical audio and video discs use a single<space/><link><target>spiral</target></link><space/>track that starts at the inner most point on the disc and flows continuously to the outer edge. When reading or writing data there is no need to stop the flow of data to switch tracks. This is similar to vinyl records except vinyl records started at the outer edge and spiraled in toward the center.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Interfaces</heading><paragraph>The disk drive interface is the mechanism/protocol of communication between the rest of the system and the disk drive itself.
