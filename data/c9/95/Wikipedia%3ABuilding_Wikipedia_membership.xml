We would definitely put up some Wikipedia posters if there were a couple simple advertisements we could print out. This should be done similarly to how the logo contests were. If the contests are run, the purpose should be to get at least four advertisements: fliers for letter/A4 paper in both black &amp; white and color and posters for tabloid/A3 paper in both black &amp; white and color, so that it is easy for people to print them off and put them up on bulletin boards and the like.
