Anarcho-capitalists advocate individual or joint (i.e.<space/><italics>private</italics>) ownership of the means of production and the product of labor regardless of what the individual &quot;needs&quot; or does not &quot;need&quot;. As Rothbard says: &quot;if every man has the right to own his own body and if he must use and transform material natural objects in order to survive, then he has the right to own the product that he has made.&quot; After property is transformed through labor it may then only exchange hands legitimately by trade or gift; forced transfers are considered illegitimate. Original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never-before used resources, including land, and by improving or otherwise using it, own it with the same &quot;absolute right&quot; as his own body. According to Rothbard, property can only come about through labor, therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it; it is only by<space/><italics>using</italics><space/>land&amp;nbsp; by mixing one's labor with it&amp;nbsp; that original appropriation is legitimized: &quot;Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be.&quot; Rothbard argues that the resource need not<space/><italics>continue</italics><space/>to be used in order for it to be the person's property, &quot;for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource, it remains his owned land. His labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land, and the land is therefore his or his assigns' in perpetuity.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Rothbard-1962">Rothbard, Murray N.

If property is held by the state, Rothbard advocates its confiscation and return to the private sector: &quot;any property in the hands of the State is in the hands of thieves, and should be liberated as quickly as possible.&quot; For example, he proposes that<space/><link><target>State university</target><part>State universities</part></link><space/>be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle. Rothbard also supports expropriation of nominally &quot;private property&quot; if it is the result of state-initiated force, such as businesses who receive grants and subsidies. He proposes that businesses who receive at least 50% of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers. He says, &quot;What we libertarians object to, then, is not government per se but crime, what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles; what we are for is not &quot;private&quot; property per se but just, innocent, non-criminal private property.&quot; Likewise, Karl Hess says, &quot;libertarianism wants to advance<space/><italics>principles</italics><space/>of property but that it in no way wishes to defend, willy nilly, all property which now is called private...

That is, it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security, such as a police, judicial, and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors. Anarcho-capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it, but not private individuals, a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors. Also, if competition in security provision were allowed to exist, prices would be lower and services would be better according to anarcho-capitalists.

In order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating private capital, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to, in essence, exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people. This body would thus inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state. The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is precisely the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which would be necessary under a coercively egalitarian-anarchist system.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>However, Rothbard also wrote a piece, published posthumously, entitled 'Are Libertarians &quot;Anarchists&quot;?' where he traced the etymological roots of Anarchist philosophy, ultimately coming to the conclusion that &quot;...we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists, and therefore at opposite poles from our position.

So, Rothbard sought to meld 19th-century American individualists' advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics: &quot;There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="autogenerated3">&quot;<link type='external' href='https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf'>The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View</link>, Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 20, no. 1, p. 7 (1965, 2000)</extension><space/>Rothbard held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts, nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected. Tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it.</paragraph><paragraph>Rothbard disagreed with this, as he explains in<space/><italics>The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View</italics>. He says that first of all Tucker was wrong to think that that would cause the money supply to increase, because he says that the money supply in a free market would be self-regulating. If it were not, then inflation would occur, so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place. Secondly, he says that Tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless, because people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated. Also, Tucker held a labor theory of value. As a result, he thought that in a free market that people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that if they were not then exploitation or &quot;usury&quot; was taking place. As he explains in<space/><italics>State Socialism and Anarchism</italics>, his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses, which would in turn raise demand for labor. This led him to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated, and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay. Again, as a neoclassical economist, Rothbard did not agree with the labor theory. He believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to<space/><link><target>marginal utility</target></link><space/>rather than to labor amounts in free market. And he did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much buyers of their services value their labor or what that labor produces.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Benjamin Tucker</target></link><space/>opposed vast concentrations of wealth, which he believed were made possible by government intervention and state protected monopolies. He believed the most dangerous state intervention was the requirement that individuals obtain charters in order to operate banks and what he believed to be the illegality of issuing private money, which he believed caused capital to concentrate in the hands of a privileged few which he called the &quot;banking monopoly.&quot; He believed anyone should be able to engage in banking that wished, without requiring state permission, and issue private money. Though he was supporter of laissez-faire, late in life he said that State intervention had allowed some extreme concentrations of resources to such a degree that even if laissez-faire were instituted, it would be too late for competition to be able to release those resources (he gave Standard Oil as an example).<extension extension_name='ref'>Tucker, Benjamin.<space/><link type='external' href='http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html'>State Socialism and Anarchism</link></extension><space/>Anarcho-capitalists also oppose governmental restrictions on banking. They, like all<space/><link><target>Austrian School</target><part>Austrian</part></link><space/>economists, believe that monopolization is facilitated and expanded through government intervention. 19th-century American individualist anarchists such as Tucker and Lysander Spooner have long argued that monopoly on credit and land interferes with the functioning of a free market economy.</paragraph><paragraph>Of particular importance to anarcho-capitalists and Tucker and Spooner are the ideas of &quot;sovereignty of the individual&quot;, a market economy, and the opposition to collectivism. A defining point upon which they agree is that defense of liberty and property should be provided in the free market rather than by the State. Tucker said, &quot;[D]efense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Tucker, Benjamin. &quot;Instead of a Book&quot; (1893)</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Historical precedents similar to anarcho-capitalism</heading><preblock><preline></preline></preblock><heading level='3'>Medieval Iceland</heading><paragraph><template><target>one source</target><arg>section</arg><arg name="date">October 2014</arg></template><link><target>File:Law speaker.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>19th century interpretation of the<space/><link><target>Althing</target></link><space/>in the<space/><link><target>Icelandic Commonwealth</target></link>, which authors such as<space/><link><target>David D.
