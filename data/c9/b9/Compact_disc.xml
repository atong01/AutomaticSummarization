Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing. The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to corrode the metal reflective layer and to interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits.<extension extension_name='ref' name="clir">Council on Library and Information Resources:<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html'>Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs</link></extension><space/>The fungus<space/><italics><link><target>Geotrichum candidum</target></link></italics>, found in Belize, has been found to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html</arg><arg name="title"><space/>Fungus eats CD</arg><arg name="year">2001</arg><arg name="journal">Nature</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm</arg><arg name="title">Fungus 'eats' CDs</arg><arg name="date">June 2001</arg><arg name="publisher">BBC</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Disc shapes and diameters</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Comparison disk storage.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<xhtml:br></xhtml:br><extension extension_name='nowiki'>*</extension><space/>Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available.

Small granules of heated raw polycarbonate plastic are fed into the press. A screw forces the liquefied plastic into the mold cavity. The mold closes with a metal stamper in contact with the disc surface. The plastic is allowed to cool and harden. Once opened, the disc substrate is removed from the mold by a robotic arm, and a 15&amp;nbsp;mm diameter center hole (called a stacking ring) is created. The time it takes to &quot;stamp&quot; one CD is usually two to three seconds.</paragraph><paragraph>This method produces the clear plastic blank part of the disc. After a metallic reflecting layer (usually aluminium, but sometimes gold or other metal) is applied to the clear blank substrate, the disc goes under a UV light for curing and it is ready to go to press. To prepare to press a CD, a glass master is made, using a high-powered laser on a device similar to a CD writer. The glass master is a positive image of the desired CD surface (with the desired microscopic pits and lands). After testing, it is used to make a die by pressing it against a metal disc.</paragraph><paragraph>The die is a negative image of the glass master: typically, several are made, depending on the number of pressing mills that are to make the CD. The die then goes into a press, and the physical image is transferred to the blank CD, leaving a final positive image on the disc. A small amount of lacquer is applied as a ring around the center of the disc, and rapid spinning spreads it evenly over the surface. Edge protection lacquer is applied before the disc is finished. The disc can then be printed and packed.</paragraph><paragraph>Manufactured CDs that are sold in stores are sealed via a process called &quot;polywrapping&quot; or shrink wrapping.</paragraph><paragraph>The most expensive part of a CD is the<space/><link><target>jewel case</target></link>.
