{{Optical disc authoring}}
'''Compact disc''' ('''CD''') is a [[digital media|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage device|data storage]] format. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data ([[CD-ROM]]). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage ([[CD-R]]), rewritable media ([[CD-RW]]), Video Compact Disc ([[VCD]]), Super Video Compact Disc ([[SVCD]]), [[Photo CD]], PictureCD, [[Green Book (CD standard)|CD-i]], and [[Enhanced Music CD]]. Audio CDs and audio [[Compact Disc player|CD players]] have been commercially available since October 1982.

Standard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm|in}} and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700&nbsp;[[MiB]] of data. The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm|in}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering [[device driver]]s.

At the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD had greater capacity than a [[personal computer]] [[hard drive]]. By 2010 hard drives commonly had capacities exceeding those of CDs by a factor of several thousand.

In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.<ref name="AutoMR-1" /> CDs are increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that audio CD sales rates in the U.S. have dropped about 50% from their peak; however, they remain one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry.<ref name="AutoMR-2" />

== History ==
American inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T. Russell]] has been credited with inventing the first system to record digital information on an optical [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[foil (metal)|foil]] that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp.<ref>{{US patent|3,501,586}} Analog to digital to optical photographic recording and playback system, March 1970.</ref><ref>{{US patent|3,795,902}} Method and apparatus for synchronizing photographic records of digital information, March 1974.</ref> Russell's patent application was first filed in 1966, and he was granted a patent in 1970. Following litigation, Sony and Philips licensed Russell's patents (then held by a Canadian company, Optical Recording Corp.) in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Seattle Times |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2002103322_cdman29.html |author=Brier Dudley |title=Scientist's invention was let go for a song |date=29 November 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |date=2000 |publisher=Reed College public affairs office |title=Inventor and physicist James Russell '53 will receive Vollum Award at Reed's convocation |accessdate=24 July 2014 |url=http://reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2000-2001/288.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/russell.html |title=Inventor of the Week - James T.

The Compact Disc is an evolution of [[LaserDisc]] technology, where a focused [[laser]] beam
is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals.
Prototypes were developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] independently in the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of the CD|url=http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/|publisher=Philips Research|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref> In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard was published in 1980.

=== Digital audio laser-disc prototypes ===
In 1974, L. Ottens, a director of the audio division of [[Philips]], started a small group with the brief to develop an analog<ref name="Immink"/> optical audio disc with a diameter of 20&nbsp;cm and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record.<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/music/why-cds-may-actually-sound-better-than-vinyl-5352162 Why CDs may actually sound better than vinyl],
Chris Kornelis, 27 January 2015</ref> In March 1974, two engineers of Philips research recommended a digital format, because the analog solution did not work satisfactorily.<ref name="Immink"/> In 1977, Philips established a laboratory with the mission of creating a digital audio disc. The diameter of Philips's prototype compact disc was set at 11.5&nbsp;cm, the diagonal of a [[compact cassette]].<ref name="Immink" /><ref name=peek />

[[Heitaro Nakajima]], who developed an early digital audio recorder within [[NHK]] in 1970, became general manager of [[Sony]]'s audio department in 1971. His team developed a digital [[PCM adaptor]] audio tape recorder using a [[Betamax]] video recorder in 1973. The step to digital audio on an optical disc was easily made in 1974.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kw0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68 | title=Heitaro Nakajima | work=Billboard | date=8 January 2000 | accessdate=4 November 2014 | author=McClure, Steve | pages=68}}</ref> [[Sony]] first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a 30&nbsp;cm disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio (44,100&nbsp;Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using [[Run-length limited|MFM]] modulation.<ref name="SonyHistorical" /> In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056&nbsp;Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|cross-interleaved]] [[error correction]] code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard Compact Disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in [[Brussels]].<ref name="SonyHistorical" /> Sony's AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979. A week later, on 8 March, Philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called "Philips Introduce Compact Disc"<ref name="BBC6950933" /> in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]].<ref name="PhilipsHistorical" />

=== Collaboration and standardization ===
Sony executive [[Norio Ohga]], later CEO and chairman of Sony, and [[Heitaro Nakajima]] were convinced of the format's commercial potential and pushed further development despite widespread skepticism.<ref name="Ohgaobituary" />

As a result, in 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. Led by engineers [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]] and [[Toshitada Doi]], the research pushed forward [[laser]] and [[optical disc]] technology that began independently by the two companies.<ref name="BBC6950933" /> After a year of experimentation and discussion, the task force produced the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard. First published in 1980, the standard was formally adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] as an international standard in 1987, with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996.

Philips coined the term ''compact disc'' in line with another audio product, the [[compact cassette]],<ref name=peek /> and contributed the general [[manufacturing]] [[Industrial process|process]], based on video LaserDisc technology. Philips also contributed [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints, while Sony contributed the [[error-correction]] method, [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]].

The ''Compact Disc Story'',<ref name="Immink" /> told by a former member of the task force, gives background information on the many technical decisions made, including the choice of the sampling frequency, playing time, and disc diameter. The task force consisted of around four to eight persons,<ref name="Immink2" /><ref name="Knopper" /> though according to Philips, the Compact Disc was "invented collectively by a large group of people working as a team."<ref name="PhilDoss" />

=== First ''Red Book'' CDs and players ===
Red Book was the first standard in the [[Rainbow Books]] range.

Philips established the Polydor Pressing Operations plant in [[Langenhagen]] near [[Hannover]], [[Germany]], and quickly passed a series of milestones.

* The first ''test pressing'' was of a recording of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[An Alpine Symphony|Eine Alpensinfonie]]'' (''An Alpine Symphony'') played by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and conducted by [[Herbert von Karajan]], who had been enlisted as an ambassador for the format in 1979.<ref name="AutoMR-3" />
* The first ''public demonstration'' was on the [[BBC]] television program ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' in 1981, when the [[Bee Gees]]' album ''[[Living Eyes (Bee Gees album)|Living Eyes]]'' (1981) was played.<ref name="AutoMR-4" />
* The first ''commercial'' compact disc was produced on 17 August 1982. It was a recording from 1979 of [[Claudio Arrau]] performing Chopin waltzes (Philips 400 025-2). Arrau was invited to the Langenhagen plant to press the start button.
* The first ''popular music'' CD produced at the new factory was ''[[The Visitors (ABBA album)|The Visitors]]'' (1981) by [[ABBA]].<ref name="AutoMR-5" />
* The first 50 titles were ''released'' in Japan on October 1, 1982. <ref name="AutoMR-6"/>
The Japanese launch was followed in March 1983 by the introduction of CD players and discs to Europe<ref>[http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/20070816_25th_anniversary_cd.wpd "Philips celebrates 25th anniversay of the Compact Disc"], Philips Media Release, 16 August 2007.

}}</ref>  This event is often seen as the "Big Bang" of the digital audio revolution. The new audio disc was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[audiophile]] communities, and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets. The first artist to sell a million copies on CD was Dire Straits, with its 1985 album ''[[Brothers in Arms (Dire Straits album)|Brothers in Arms]]''.<ref name="AutoMR-7" /> The first major artist to have his entire catalogue converted to CD was [[David Bowie]], whose 15 studio albums were made available by [[RCA Records]] in February 1985, along with four greatest hits albums.<ref name="AutoMR-8" /> In 1988, 400 million CDs were manufactured by 50 pressing plants around the world.<ref name="AutoMR-9" />

=== Further development and decline ===
The CD was planned to be the successor of the [[gramophone record]] for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium. From its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, in CD's introduction year, [[Kees Schouhamer Immink|Immink]] and Braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention.<ref>{{cite web|title=Experiments Toward an Erasable Compact Disc|url= http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=4492|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> In June 1985, the computer-readable [[CD-ROM]] (read-only memory) and, in 1990, [[CD-R]]ecordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips.<ref name="AutoMR-10" /> Recordable CDs are an alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are [[backward compatible]] with audio CD.

By the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the audio [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the US to have a factory-equipped cassette player.<ref name="nyt20120718" /> With the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players and solid state music storage, CD players are being phased out of automobiles in favour of minijack auxiliary inputs and connections to USB devices.

Meanwhile, with the advent and popularity of [[Digital distribution|Internet-based distribution]] of files in [[Lossy compression|lossily-compressed]] [[audio format]]s such as [[MP3]], sales of CDs began dropping in the 2000s. For example, during the eight-year period ending in 2008, despite overall growth in music sales and one anomalous year of increase, major-label CD sales declined overall by 20%,<ref name="AutoMR-11" /> although independent and DIY music sales may be tracking better according to figures released 30 March 2009, and CDs still continue to sell greatly.<ref name="AutoMR-12" />

=== Awards and accolades ===
Sony and Philips received praise for the development of the Compact Disc from professional organizations. These awards include
* Technical [[Grammy Award]] for Sony and Philips, 1998.<ref name=grammy/>
* [[IEEE]] Milestone award, 2009, for Philips only with the citation: "On 8 March 1979, N.V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken demonstrated for the international press a Compact Disc Audio Player. The demonstration showed that it is possible by using digital optical recording and playback to reproduce audio signals with superb stereo quality. This research at Philips established the technical standard for digital optical recording systems."<ref name="IEEE_CD_Milestone" />

== Physical details ==
[[File:CD layers.svg|thumb|Diagram of CD layers.<br />A. A polycarbonate disc layer has the data encoded by using bumps.<br />B. A shiny layer reflects the laser.<br />C. A layer of lacquer protects the shiny layer.<br />D. Artwork is [[Screen printing|screen printed]] on the top of the disc.<br />E. A laser beam reads the CD and is reflected back to a sensor, which converts it into electronic data]]

A CD is made from {{convert|1.2|mm|in}} thick, [[polycarbonate]] plastic and weighs 15–20&nbsp;grams.<ref name="AutoMR-13" /> From the center outward, components are: the center spindle hole (15&nbsp;mm), the first-transition area (clamping ring), the clamping area (stacking ring), the second-transition area (mirror band), the program (data) area, and the rim. The inner program area occupies a radius from 25 to 58&nbsp;mm.

A thin layer of aluminium or, more rarely, gold is applied to the surface, making it reflective. The metal is protected by a film of lacquer normally [[spin coated]] directly on the reflective layer. The label is printed on the lacquer layer, usually by [[screen printing]] or [[offset printing]].

CD data is represented as tiny indentations known as "pits", encoded in a spiral track moulded into the top of the polycarbonate layer. The areas between pits are known as "lands". Each pit is approximately 100&nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] deep by 500&nbsp;nm wide, and varies from 850&nbsp;nm to 3.5&nbsp;[[Micrometre|µm]] in length. The distance between the tracks, the pitch, is 1.6&nbsp;µm.

Scanning velocity is 1.2–1.4&nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]])&nbsp;– equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.)

[[File:Comparison CD DVD HDDVD BD.svg|thumb|300px|left|Comparison of various optical storage media<!-- parameters: track pitch (p), pit width (w) and minimum length (l), and laser spot size (⌀) and wavelength (λ). -->]]
The program area is 86.05&nbsp;cm<sup>2,</sup> and the length of the recordable spiral is (86.05&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;/&nbsp;1.6&nbsp;µm)&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.38&nbsp;km. With a scanning speed of 1.2&nbsp;m/s, the playing time is 74 minutes, or 650&nbsp;MiB of data on a CD-ROM. A disc with data packed slightly more densely is tolerated by most players (though some old ones fail). Using a linear velocity of 1.2&nbsp;m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5&nbsp;µm increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700&nbsp;MiB.

[[File:CDRomPits.jpg|right|thumb|The pits in a CD are 500 [[nanometre|nm]] wide, between 830 nm and 3,000 nm long and 150 nm deep]]
A CD is read by focusing a 780&nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the intensity change with a [[photodiode]], the data can be read from the disc.

The pits and lands themselves do not directly represent the zeros and ones of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from pit to land or land to pit indicates a one, while no change indicates a series of zeros. There must be at least two and no more than ten zeros between each one, which is defined by the length of the pit. This in turn is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the ''[[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|Red Book]]'') were originally designed for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Digital Audio]], but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as [[CD-ROM]]).

=== Integrity ===
CDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing.  The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to corrode the metal reflective layer and to interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits.<ref name="clir">Council on Library and Information Resources: [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs]</ref> The fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'', found in Belize, has been found to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title= Fungus eats CD|year=2001|journal=Nature}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=June 2001|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

The digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available. Standard CDs are available in two sizes. By far, the most common is {{convert|120|mm|in}} in diameter, with a 74- or 80-minute audio capacity and a 650 or 700&nbsp;MiB (737,280,000-byte) data capacity. This capacity was reportedly specified by Sony executive [[Norio Ohga]] in May 1980 so as to be able to contain the entirety of the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]'s recording of [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] on one disc.<ref name="Ohgaobituary" /> This is a myth according to [[Kees Schouhamer Immink|Kees Immink]], as the code format had not yet been decided in May 1980.<ref name="Immink2" /> The adoption of [[Eight-to-fourteen modulation|EFM]] one month later would have allowed a playing time of 97 minutes for 120 mm diameter or 74 minutes for a disc as small as 100 mm. <ref> Tim Buthe and Walter Mattli, The New Global Rulers: The Privatization of Regulation in the World Economy, Princeton University Press, Feb. 2011.</ref> The 120 mm diameter has been adopted by subsequent formats, including [[Super Audio CD]], [[DVD]], [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]].

== Logical formats ==

=== Audio CD ===
{{Main|Compact Disc Digital Audio}}

The logical format of an audio CD (officially Compact Disc Digital Audio or CD-DA) is described in a document produced in 1980 by the format's joint creators, Sony and Philips. The document is known colloquially as the ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] was to be an allowable option within the ''Red Book'' format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a ''Red Book'' CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard ''Red Book'' stereo track (i.e., [[mono sound#Mirrored mono|mirrored mono]]); an [[MP3 CD]], however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.

[[CD-Text]] is an extension of the ''Red Book'' specification for audio CD that allows for storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[Lead-in (CD)|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available, or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.

[[Compact Disc + Graphics]] is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.

[[CD + Extended Graphics]] (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG utilizes basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.

=== Super Audio CD ===
{{Main|Super Audio CD}}

Super Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that was designed to provide [[high fidelity|higher fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the ''Red Book''. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the ''Red Book''. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the ''Scarlet Book'' standard.

Titles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]].

=== CD-MIDI ===
CD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike the original ''Red Book'' CD-DA, these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings. The CD-MIDI format is defined as an extension to the original ''Red Book''.

=== CD-ROM ===
{{Main|CD-ROM}}

For the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1985, the ''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]] standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.

=== Video CD (VCD) ===
{{Main|Video CD}}

Video CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[Digital data|digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.

The VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the ''White Book'' standard.

Overall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use.

352x240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352x288 is similarly one quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.

=== Super Video CD ===
{{Main|Super Video CD}}

Super Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.

SVCD has two-thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobits]] per second.

=== Photo CD ===
{{Main|Photo CD}}

Photo CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the ''Beige Book'' and conform to the [[CD-ROM XA]] and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with the suitable software irrespective of the [[operating system]]. The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.

=== CD-i ===
{{Main|Philips CD-i}}

The Philips ''[[Green Book (CD standard)|Green Book]]'' specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks which can be played on regular [[CD player]]s, but CD-i discs are not compatible with most [[CD-ROM]] drives and software. The [[CD-i Ready]] specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players, and the [[CD-i Bridge]] specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.

=== CD-i Ready ===
{{Main|CD-i Ready}}
Philips defined a format similar to CD-i called [[CD-i Ready]], which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players.

=== Enhanced Music CD (CD+) ===
{{Main|Blue Book (CD standard)}}

Enhanced Music CD, also known as CD Extra or CD Plus, is a format which combines [[CD-DA|audio tracks]] and [[CD-ROM|data tracks]] on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first [[Session (CD)|session]] and data in a second session. It was developed by Philips and Sony, and it is defined in the ''[[Blue Book (CD standard)|Blue Book]]''.

=== Vinyl Disc ===
{{Main|VinylDisc}}

Vinyl Disc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.

== Manufacture ==
{{Main|CD manufacturing}}
[[File:Compact disk data layer 2d 3d.PNG|thumb|right|Individual pits are visible on the micrometre scale]]
Replicated CDs are mass-produced initially using a hydraulic press. Small granules of heated raw polycarbonate plastic are fed into the press. A screw forces the liquefied plastic into the mold cavity. The mold closes with a metal stamper in contact with the disc surface. The plastic is allowed to cool and harden. Once opened, the disc substrate is removed from the mold by a robotic arm, and a 15&nbsp;mm diameter center hole (called a stacking ring) is created. The time it takes to "stamp" one CD is usually two to three seconds.

This method produces the clear plastic blank part of the disc. After a metallic reflecting layer (usually aluminium, but sometimes gold or other metal) is applied to the clear blank substrate, the disc goes under a UV light for curing and it is ready to go to press. To prepare to press a CD, a glass master is made, using a high-powered laser on a device similar to a CD writer. The glass master is a positive image of the desired CD surface (with the desired microscopic pits and lands). After testing, it is used to make a die by pressing it against a metal disc.

The die is a negative image of the glass master: typically, several are made, depending on the number of pressing mills that are to make the CD. The die then goes into a press, and the physical image is transferred to the blank CD, leaving a final positive image on the disc. A small amount of lacquer is applied as a ring around the center of the disc, and rapid spinning spreads it evenly over the surface. Edge protection lacquer is applied before the disc is finished. The disc can then be printed and packed.

Manufactured CDs that are sold in stores are sealed via a process called "polywrapping" or shrink wrapping.

The most expensive part of a CD is the [[jewel case]]. In 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD. Wholesale cost of CDs was $0.75 to $1.15, which retailed for $16.98.<ref name="cd costs">{{cite news|author=Neil Strauss |date=5 July 1995 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/arts/pennies-that-add-up-to-16.98-why-cd-s-cost-so-much.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=Pennies That Add Up to $16.98: Why CD's Cost So Much – New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref> On average, the store received 35 percent of the retail price, the record company 27 percent, the artist 16 percent, the manufacturer 13 percent, and the distributor 9 percent.<ref name="cd costs" /> When 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs were introduced, each was marketed at a higher price than the format they succeeded, even though the cost to produce the media was reduced. This was done because the apparent value increased. This continued from vinyl to CDs but was broken when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] marketed MP3s for $0.99, and albums for $9.99. The incremental cost, though, to produce an MP3 is very small.<ref>{{cite news|author=Amy HarmonPublished: 12 October 2003 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/music-what-price-music.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=MUSIC; What Price Music? |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=12 October 2003 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref>

== Writable compact discs ==

=== Recordable CD ===
[[File:Compact disc.jpg|thumb|700&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]] CD-R next to a [[mechanical pencil]]]]
{{Main|CD-R}}

Recordable Compact Discs, [[CD-R]]s, are injection-molded with a "blank" data spiral. A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the colour of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.

CD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.<ref name="AutoMR-14" /><ref name="AutoMR-15" /> This failure is known as [[disc rot]], for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.<ref name="clir" />

The recordable audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder. These consumer audio CD recorders use SCMS ([[Serial Copy Management System]]), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]]). The Recordable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-R due to lower production volume and a 3% [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name="McFadden" />

High-capacity recordable CD is a higher-density recording format that can hold 90 or 99 minutes of audio on a {{convert|12|cm|0|abbr=on}} disc (compared to about 80 minutes for ''Red Book'' audio) or 30 minutes of audio on an {{convert|8|cm|0|abbr=on}} disc (compared to about 24 minutes for ''Red Book'' audio).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa7.htm |title=Understanding CD-R & CD-RW |publisher=Osta.org |accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref> The higher capacity is incompatible with some recorders and recording software.<ref name="cdrfaq">{{cite web

 | accessdate=25 November 2013
 | quote=Small quantities of 90-minute and 99-minute blanks have appeared [...] Indications are that many recorders and some software don't really work with the longer discs. }}</ref>

=== ReWritable CD ===
{{Main|CD-RW}}

[[CD-RW]] is a re-recordable medium that uses a metallic alloy instead of a die. The write laser in this case is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.

The ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which will not (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3% [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name="McFadden" />

==== Speed ====
Due to technical limitations, the original ReWritable CD could be written no faster than 4x speed. High Speed ReWritable CD has a different design, which permits writing at speeds ranging from 4x to 12x. Original CD-RW drives can only write to original ReWritable CDs. High Speed CD-RW drives can typically write to both original ReWritable CDs and High Speed ReWritable CDs. Both types of CD-RW discs can be read in most CD drives. Higher speed CD-RW discs, Ultra Speed (16x to 24x write speed) and Ultra Speed+ (32x write speed) are now available.

== Copy protection ==
{{Main|CD/DVD copy protection}}

The ''Red Book'' audio specification, except for a simple "anti-copy" statement in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Known at least as early as 2001,<ref name="BadCDs" /> attempts were made by record companies to market "copy-protected" non-standard compact discs, which cannot be ripped, or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to MP3s. One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the ''Red Book'' specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software.
