Meanwhile, BR was gradually re-organised, with the regional structure finally being abolished and replaced with business-led sectors. This process, known as &quot;sectorisation&quot;, led to far greater customer focus, but was cut short in 1994 with the splitting up of BR for privatisation.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Charing Cross station geograph-3300926-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Network SouthEast</target></link><space/>with a<space/><link><target>Networker (train)</target><part>Networker</part></link><space/>at<space/><link><target>Charing Cross railway station</target><part>Charing Cross</part></link><space/>serving<space/><link><target>Kent</target></link>.</part></link>Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created:<space/><link><target>InterCity (British Rail)</target><part>InterCity</part></link>, operating principal express services; London &amp; South East (renamed<space/><link><target>Network SouthEast</target></link><space/>in 1986) operating commuter services in the London area; and Provincial (renamed<space/><link><target>Regional Railways</target></link><space/>in 1989) responsible for all other passenger services.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Thomas"></extension><space/>In the<space/><link><target>metropolitan county</target><part>metropolitan counties</part></link><space/>local services were managed by the<space/><link><target>Passenger Transport Executive</target><trail>s</trail></link>.
