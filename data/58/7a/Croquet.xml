It is to be observed, that there are two of these arches, that is one at either end of the alley. The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second, and the walk in Saint James's Park, now called the Mall, received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall, where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://books.google.com/?id</arg><arg name="title">Sports and pastimes of the people of England<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Joseph<space/></arg><arg name="last"><space/>Strutt<space/></arg><arg name="pages"><space/>94â€“5<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Google Books</arg><arg name="accessdate">14 September 2010<space/></arg><arg name="year">1810</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'>Cotgrave, 1611</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Whilst the name pall mall and various games bearing this name may have been played elsewhere (France and Italy) the description above suggests that the croquet-like games were certainly popular in England as early as 1611.<template><target>cn</target><arg name="date">August 2014</arg></template><space/>Some early sources refer to pall mall being played over a large distance (as in golf), however an image in Strutt's 1801 book shows a croquet-like ground billiards game (balls on ground, hoop, bats and peg) being played over a<space/><italics>short</italics>, garden-sized distance.

However, purely negative play is rarely a winning strategy: successful players (in all versions other than golf croquet) will use all four balls to set up a break for themselves, rather than simply making the game as difficult as possible for their opponents.

(Four balls are visible on the lawn, showing that two games are in progress (&quot;double-banking&quot;): red and black belong to one game, green and brown to the other)</part></link>Association croquet is the name of an advanced game of croquet, played at international level. It involves four balls teamed in pairs, with both balls going through every hoop for one pair to win. The game's distinguishing feature is the &quot;croquet&quot; shot: when certain balls hit other balls, extra shots are allowed. The six hoops are arranged three at each end of the court, with a centre peg.</paragraph><paragraph>In association croquet one side takes the black and blue balls, the other takes red and yellow.At each turn, players can choose to play with either of their balls for that turn.At the start of a turn, the player plays a stroke. If the player either hits the ball through the correct hoop (&quot;runs&quot; the hoop), or hits another ball (a &quot;roquet&quot;), the turn continues.Following a roquet, the player picks up his or her own ball and puts it down next to the ball that it hit. The next shot is played with the two balls touching: this is the &quot;croquet stroke&quot; from which the game takes its name.</paragraph><paragraph>After the croquet stroke, the player plays a &quot;continuation&quot; stroke, during which the player may again attempt to make a roquet or run a hoop. Each of the other three balls may be roqueted once in a turn before a hoop is run, after which they become available to be roqueted again.The winner of the game is the team who completes the set circuit of six hoops (and then back again the other way), with both balls, and then strikes the centre peg (making a total of 13 points per ball = 26).</paragraph><paragraph>Good players may make &quot;breaks&quot; of several hoops in a single turn. The best players may take a ball round a full circuit in one turn. &quot;Advanced play&quot; (a variant of association play for expert players) gives penalties to a player who runs certain hoops in a turn, to allow the opponent a chance of getting back into the game; feats of skill such as triple peels or better, in which the partner ball (or occasionally an opponent ball) is caused to run a number of hoops in a turn by the striker's ball help avoid these penalties.</paragraph><paragraph>A handicap system ('bisques') provides less experienced players a chance of winning against more formidable opponents.

Its genesis is mostly in association croquet, but it differs in a number of important ways that reflect the home-grown traditions of American &quot;backyard&quot; croquet.</paragraph><paragraph>Two of the most notable differences are that the balls are always played in the same sequence (blue, red, black, yellow) throughout the game, and that a ball's &quot;deadness&quot; on other balls is carried over from turn to turn until the ball has been &quot;cleared&quot; by scoring its next hoop. Tactics are simplified on the one hand by the strict sequence of play, and complicated on the other hand by the continuation of deadness. A further difference is the more restrictive boundary-line rules of American croquet.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Ian Plummer"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.oxfordcroquet.com/laws/usca/index.asp<space/></arg><arg name="title">Association vs US (6-wicket) Rules Croquet<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Ian<space/></arg><arg name="last"><space/>Plummer<space/></arg><arg name="date">1 January 2011<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Oxford Croquet<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">22 February 2011</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In the American game, roqueting a ball out of bounds or running a hoop out of bounds causes the turn to end, and balls that go out of bounds are replaced only<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>9</arg><arg>in</arg><arg name="spell">in</arg></template><space/>from the boundary rather than a yard (<template><target>Convert</target><arg>1</arg><arg>yd</arg><arg>cm</arg><arg name="disp"><space/>out</arg></template>) as in association croquet.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Ian Plummer"></extension><space/>&quot;Attacking&quot; balls on the boundary line to bring them into play is thus far more challenging.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Nine-wicket</heading><paragraph>Nine-wicket croquet, sometimes called &quot;backyard croquet&quot;, is played mainly in Canada and the United States, and is the game most recreational players in those countries call simply &quot;croquet&quot;. This version of croquet varies from six-wicket croquet in that there are nine wickets, two stakes, and players can compete individually with a single ball, or as teams of two or three, with up to six players competing. The course is arranged in a double-diamond pattern, with one stake at each end of the course. Players start at one stake, navigate one side of the double diamond, hit the turning stake, then navigate the opposite side of the double diamond and hit the starting stake to win the game.</paragraph><paragraph>Unlike six-wicket croquet, where each time a ball is roqueted a croquet shot must be taken, players have three options after roqueting another ball. These reflect the more individual aspect of nine-wicket croquet. The options are:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><bold>Nothing:</bold><space/>The player may leave the ball where it came to rest and take two shots.</listitem><listitem><bold>Mallet-head Length:</bold><space/>Players may place their ball a mallet-head's length or less from the ball he hit, and take 2 shots.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.9wicketcroquet.com/rules/26/backyard-croquet-basic-rules</extension></listitem><listitem><bold>Croquet:</bold><space/>As in six-wicket croquet, players may place their ball in contact with the ball they hit and strike their ball in such a way that both balls move. When making this shot, player may place their ball next to the ball they hit, place their hand or foot on top of their ball, then strike their own ball such that their opponent's ball moves while their own ball remains in place. A foot shot is sometimes called a &quot;buggy ride&quot;. They may then take their second shot as a &quot;continuation shot&quot;</listitem></list><paragraph>Ordinarily, the first person to finish the course wins the game. However, some players prefer to use an endgame procedure called &quot;poison&quot;. In poison, once a player has scored the last hoop but has not hit the starting stake, their ball becomes &quot;poison&quot;, which allows them to eliminate other balls from the game by roqueting them. If a non-poison ball roquets a poison ball, the standard roqueting options apply, but if a poison ball travels through a wicket or hits a stake for any reason, it forfeits and is eliminated from the game. The last person remaining is the winner.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.9wicketcroquet.com/rules/28/backyard-croquet-challenging-options#option6</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Ricochet</heading><paragraph>This version of the game was invented by John Riches of Adelaide, Australia with help from Tom Armstrong in the 1980s. The game can be played by up to 6 people and is very easy to learn. For this reason it is often used as a stepping stone to association croquet. Ricochet has similar rules to association and garden croquet, except that when a ball is roqueted, the striker's ball remains live and two free shots are earned. This enables strikers to play their ball near to another opponent ball and ricochet that too thus earning two more free shots. Running a hoop earns one free shot.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Glossary of terms</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:CroquetConverse4037.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>Backyard croquet being played in rough grass with inexpensive equipment, United States, 2009</part></link></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><bold>Backward ball</bold>: The ball of a side that has scored fewer hoops (compare with 'forward ball').<extension extension_name='ref' name="Hawkins"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Complete Croquet: A Guide to Skills, Tactics, and Strategy</arg><arg name="first"><space/>James<space/></arg><arg name="last"><space/>Hawkins</arg><arg name="publisher">Crowood Press</arg><arg name="isbn">978-1-84797-168-5</arg><arg name="year">2010</arg></template></extension></listitem><listitem><bold>Ball-in-hand</bold>: A ball that the striker can pick up to change its position, for example:</listitem></list><list type='ident'><listitem><list type='numbered'><listitem>any ball when it leaves the court has to be replaced on the yard-line</listitem><listitem>the strikers ball after making a roquet must be placed in contact with the roqueted ball</listitem><listitem>the strikers ball when the striker is entitled to a lift.<extension extension_name='ref' name="laws"><italics><link type='external' href='http://www.croquet.org.uk/association/laws/6th/laws_6th.htm'>Laws of Association Croquet</link></italics>, 6th Edition, amended 2008, Croquet Association.</extension></listitem></list></listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem><bold>Ball in play</bold>: A ball after it has been played into the game, which is not a ball in hand or pegged out.<extension extension_name='ref' name="laws"></extension></listitem><listitem><bold>Baulk</bold>: An imaginary line on which a ball is placed for its first shot in the game, or when taking a lift.
