'''Edvard Hagerup Grieg''' ({{IPA-no|ˈɛdʋɑɖ ˈhɑːɡərʉp ˈɡrɪɡ|lang}}; 15 June 1843{{spaced ndash}}4 September 1907) was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[composer]] and [[pianist]]. He is widely considered one of the leading [[Romantic music|Romantic era]] composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide. His use and development of [[Music of Norway|Norwegian folk music]] in his own compositions put the music of Norway in the international spectrum, as well as helping to develop a [[Norwegian romantic nationalism|national identity]], much as [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Antonín Dvořák]] did in [[Finland]] and [[Bohemia]], respectively.<ref name="isbn1-84383-210-0">{{cite book |author=Daniel M.

He is the most celebrated person from the city of Bergen, with numerous statues depicting his image, and many cultural entities named after him: the city's largest building ([[Grieg Hall]]), its most advanced music school ([[Grieg Academy]]), its professional choir (Edvard Grieg Kor), and even some private companies that include its largest hotel (Quality Hotel Edvard Grieg), and a music technology developer (Grieg Music). The Edvard Grieg Museum in Troldhaugen (Grieg's former home in Bergen) is dedicated to his legacy.

Edvard Hagerup Grieg was born in [[Bergen]], Norway, on 15 June 1843. His parents were Alexander Grieg (1806–1875), a merchant and vice-consul in Bergen; and Gesine Judithe Hagerup (1814–1875), a music teacher and daughter of [[Edvard Hagerup]].<ref name=nbl>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Edvard Grieg |first=Finn  |last=Benestad|authorlink=Finn Benestad |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]] |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Edvard_Grieg/utdypning |language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref><ref>Benestad; Schjelderup-Ebbe (1990) [1980]. pp. 25–28</ref> The family name, originally spelled [[Greig (name)|Greig]], has [[Scottish name|Scottish]] origins.

Edvard Grieg was raised in a musical milieu. His mother was his first piano teacher and taught him to play at the age of six. Grieg studied in several schools, including Tanks Upper School, Tanks School and the N.P.S, Norwegian Private School.<ref>Robert Layton. ''Grieg''. (London: Omnibus Press, 1998). 18.</ref>

In the summer of 1858, Grieg met the eminent Norwegian violinist [[Ole Bull]],<ref name="Benestad 1990 pp. 35">Benestad; Schjelderup-Ebbe (1990) [1980]. pp. 35–36</ref> who was a family friend; Bull's brother was married to Grieg's aunt.<ref>Benestad; Schjelderup-Ebbe (1990) [1980]. p. 24</ref>  Bull recognized the 15-year-old boy's talent and persuaded his parents to send him to the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Leipzig Conservatory]],<ref name="Benestad 1990 pp. 35"/> the piano department of which was directed by [[Ignaz Moscheles]].<ref>Jerome Roche and Henry Roche.

Grieg enrolled in the [[music school|conservatory]], concentrating on the piano, and enjoyed the many concerts and recitals given in [[Leipzig]]. He disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study. An exception was the [[organ (music)|organ]], which was mandatory for piano students. In the spring of 1860, he survived a life-threatening [[Respiratory disease|lung disease]], [[pleurisy]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Throughout his life, Grieg's health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine. He suffered from numerous respiratory infections, and ultimately developed combined lung and heart failure. Grieg was admitted many times to spas and sanatoria both in Norway and abroad. Several of his doctors became his personal friends.<ref>Laerum OD. Edvard Grieg's health and his physicians. Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 1993 Dec 10;113(30):3750-3 PMID 8278965</ref>

In 1861, Grieg made his debut as a concert pianist in [[Karlshamn]], Sweden. In 1862, he finished his studies in Leipzig and held his first concert in his home town, where his programme included [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Pathétique]]'' sonata.

[[File:Edvard en Nina Grieg 1899.jpg|right|thumb| Edvard Grieg and [[Nina Grieg|Nina Hagerup]] (Grieg's wife and first cousin) in 1899]]
In 1863, Grieg went to [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, and stayed there for three years. He met the Danish composers [[Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann|J. P. E. Hartmann]] and [[Niels Gade]]. He also met his fellow Norwegian composer [[Rikard Nordraak]] (composer of the [[Ja, vi elsker dette landet|Norwegian national anthem]]), who became a good friend and source of inspiration. Nordraak died in 1866, and Grieg composed a [[Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak|funeral march]] in his honor.

On 11 June 1867, Grieg married his first cousin, [[Nina Grieg|Nina Hagerup]], a lyric soprano. The next year, their only child, Alexandra, was born. Alexandra died in 1869 from [[meningitis]]. In the summer of 1868, Grieg wrote his [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Piano Concerto in A minor]] while on holiday in Denmark. [[Edmund Neupert]] gave the concerto its premiere performance on 3&nbsp;April 1869 in the Casino Theater in Copenhagen. Grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in Christiania (as [[Oslo]] was then named).<ref>[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Nina_Grieg/utdypning ''Nina Grieg – utdypning'' (Store norske leksikon)]</ref>

In 1868, [[Franz Liszt]], who had not yet met Grieg, wrote a testimonial for him to the Norwegian Ministry of Education, which led to Grieg's obtaining a travel grant. The two men met in Rome in 1870. On Grieg's first visit, they went over Grieg's Violin Sonata No. 1, which pleased Liszt greatly. On his second visit, in April, Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto, which Liszt proceeded to sightread (including the orchestral arrangement). Liszt's rendition greatly impressed his audience, although Grieg gently pointed out to him that he played the first movement too quickly. Liszt also gave Grieg some advice on [[orchestration]] (for example, to give the melody of the second theme in the first movement to a solo trumpet).

In 1874–76, Grieg composed [[incidental music]] for the premiere of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', at the request of the author.

Grieg had close ties with the [[Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra]] (Harmonien), and later became Music Director of the orchestra from 1880 to 1882. In 1888, Grieg met [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] in Leipzig. Grieg was struck by the sadness in Tchaikovsky.<ref name = lamb>{{cite web

Grieg was awarded two honorary doctorates, first by Cambridge University in 1894 and the next from Oxford University in 1906.<ref>Carley, Lionel. "Preface." Preface. Edvard Grieg in England. N.p.: Boydell, 2006. Xi. Google Books. Web. 01 June 2014.</ref>

===Later years===
[[File:Troldhaugen in Bergen.jpg|thumb|upright|Edvard Grieg Museum in [[Troldhaugen]]]]
The Norwegian government provided him with a pension. In the spring 1903, Grieg made nine 78-rpm [[gramophone record]]ings of his piano music in Paris; all of these historic discs have been reissued on both LPs and CDs, despite limited fidelity. Grieg also made live-recording [[player piano]] music rolls for the Hupfeld Phonola piano-player system and [[Welte-Mignon]] reproducing system, all of which survive today and can be heard. He also worked with the [[Aeolian Company]] for its 'Autograph Metrostyle' piano roll series wherein he indicated the tempo mapping for many of his pieces.

In 1906, he met the composer and pianist [[Percy Grainger]] in London. Grainger was a great admirer of Grieg's music and a strong empathy was quickly established. In a 1907 interview, Grieg stated: “I have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play, and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played! He is a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love.”<ref>John Bird, ''Percy Grainger '', Oxford University Press, 1999, P. 133-134.</ref>

Edvard Grieg died in Municipal Hospital, in Bergen, Norway, in the late summer of 1907, aged 64, from [[heart failure]]. He had suffered a long period of illness. His final words were "Well, if it must be so."  The funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people out on the streets of his home town to honor him. Following his wish, his own ''[[Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak]]'' was played in an orchestration by his friend [[Johan Halvorsen]], who had married Grieg's niece. In addition, the ''Funeral March'' movement from [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Sonata No. 2]] was played. Grieg was cremated, and his ashes were entombed in a mountain crypt near his house, [[Troldhaugen]]. The ashes of his wife were later placed with his.

Edvard Grieg and his wife considered themselves [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and Nina went to the Unitarian church in Copenhagen after his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uudb.org/articles/edvardgrieg.html|work=Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography|title=Edvard and Nina Grieg|publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|date=November 4, 2004|author=Peter Hughes|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1085&context=honors|title=The Life and Works of Edvard Grieg|author=Leah Kennedy|publisher=Utah State University|date=May 1, 2011|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>

==Music==
Some of Grieg's early works include a [[symphony]] (which he later suppressed) and a [[Piano Sonata (Grieg)|piano sonata]]. He also wrote three [[Violin Sonatas (Grieg)|violin sonatas]] and a [[Cello Sonata (Grieg)|cello sonata]].<ref name=nbl/>

Grieg also composed the incidental music for [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play, [[Peer Gynt]] - which includes the famous excerpt entitled, "[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]". In this piece of music, the adventures of the anti-hero, Peer Gynt, are related, including the episode in which he steals a bride at her wedding. The angry guests chase him, and Peer falls, hitting his head on a rock. He wakes up in a mountain surrounded by trolls. The music of "[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]" represents the angry trolls taunting Peer and gets louder each time the theme repeats. The music ends with Peer escaping from the mountain.

In an 1874 letter to his friend [[Frants Beyer]], Grieg expressed his unhappiness with Dance of the Mountain King's Daughter, one of the movements he composed for [[Peer Gynt]], writing "I have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain King – something that I literally can't bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies, exaggerated Norwegian nationalism, and trollish self-satisfaction! But I have a hunch that the irony will be discernible."<ref>{{cite book

Grieg's ''[[Holberg Suite]]'' was originally written for the piano, and later arranged by the composer for [[string instrument|string]] orchestra. Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Rudyard Kipling]] and others. Russian composer [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]] used a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his Third String Quartet. Norwegian pianist [[Eva Knardahl]] recorded the composer's complete piano music during 1978 and 1980. The recordings were reissued in 2006 on 12 compact discs by [[BIS Records]]. Grieg himself recorded many of these piano works before his death in 1907.
