A '''dragon''' is a [[legendary creature]], typically with [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] or [[reptile|reptilian]] traits, that features in the [[myths]] of many cultures. There are two distinct cultural traditions of dragons: the [[European dragon]], derived from  European folk traditions and ultimately related to Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies, and the [[Chinese dragon]], with counterparts in Japan (namely the [[Japanese dragon]]), Korea and other East Asian countries.<ref>Ingersoll,Ernest, et al.,  (2013). ''The Illustrated Book of Dragons and Dragon Lore''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN B00D959PJ0</ref>

The two traditions may have evolved separately, but have influenced each other to a certain extent, particularly with the cross-cultural contact of recent centuries. The English word ''[[Wikt:dragon|dragon]]'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Wikt:δράκων|δράκων]] (''drákōn''), "dragon, serpent of huge size, water-snake".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddra%2Fkwn2 Δράκων], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus project</ref>

==Name==
[[File:Metal dragon half frontal view.jpg|right|thumb|Dragon]]
The word ''dragon'' entered the English language in the early 13th century from Old French ''dragon'', which in turn comes from Latin ''draconem'' (nominative ''draco'') meaning "huge serpent, dragon", from the Greek word δράκων, ''drakon'' (genitive ''drakontos'', δράκοντος) "serpent, giant seafish". The Greek and Latin term referred to any great serpent, not necessarily mythological, and this usage was also current in English up to the 18th century.

==Morphology==
A dragon is a mythological representation of a [[reptile]]. In antiquity, dragons were mostly envisaged as [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]s, but since the Middle Ages, it has become common to depict them with legs, resembling a [[lizard]].

Dragons are usually shown in modern times with a body like a huge lizard, or a snake with two pairs of lizard-type legs, and able to emit fire from their mouths. The [[European dragon]] has bat-like wings growing from its back. A dragon-like creature with wings but only a single pair of legs is known as a [[wyvern]].

==Comparative mythology==
{{further|Chaoskampf|Sea serpent|Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or Serpent|Serpent (Bible)}}

The association of the serpent with a monstrous opponent overcome by a heroic deity has its roots in the mythology of the Ancient Near East, including [[Canaanite mythology|Canaanite]] ([[Jewish mythology|Hebrew]], [[Ugaritic]]), [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] and [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian]]. [[Humbaba]], the fire-breathing dragon-fanged beast first described in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] is sometimes described as a dragon with Gilgamesh playing the part of dragon-slayer. The legless serpent (''[[Chaoskampf]]'') motif entered [[Greek mythology]] and ultimately [[Christian mythology]], although the serpent motif may already be part of prehistoric [[Indo-European mythology]] as well, based on comparative evidence of [[Rigvedic deities|Indic]] and [[Norse mythology|Germanic]] material.

Although dragons occur in many legends around the world, different cultures have varying stories about monsters that have been grouped together under the dragon label. Some dragons are said to breathe fire or to be poisonous, such as in the [[Old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]''.<ref>"''[[The Dragon (Beowulf)|Beowulf and the Dragon]]''." In: ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', Vol. 1, edited by [[M. H. Abrams]]. (1999), 6th edition. ISBN 0-393-96287-3.</ref> (Dr. Paweł Frelik, one-time Editor-in-Chief of the ''European Journal of American Studies'' and President of the [[Science Fiction Research Association]] (2013-2014), writes, "Dragons emitting fire were traditional elements of folk tales and myths and, as such, later permeated into modern fantasy. They are present, for example, in [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s ''[[Dragonflight]]'' and its sequels."<ref>{{cite book |last= Frelik |first= Frelik |chapter= Fire |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |editor= [[Gary Westfahl]] |location= Westport, CT |publisher= Greenwood Press |year= 2005 |volume= 1 |pages= 294–295 |ISBN=}}</ref>) They are commonly portrayed as serpentine or reptilian, hatching from [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and possessing typically scaly or feathered bodies. They are sometimes portrayed as hoarding treasure. Some myths portray them with a row of dorsal spines. [[European dragon]]s are more often winged, while [[Chinese dragon]]s resemble large snakes. Dragons can have a variable number of legs: none, two, four, or more when it comes to early [[European literature]].

Dragons are often held to have major spiritual significance in various religions and cultures around the world. In many [[Asia]]n cultures dragons were, and in some cultures still are, revered as representative of the primal forces of nature, religion and the universe. They are associated with wisdom&mdash;often said to be wiser than humans&mdash;and longevity. They are commonly said to possess some form of magic or other supernatural power, and are often associated with wells, rain, and rivers. In some cultures, they are also said to be capable of [[Speech|human speech]].  In some traditions dragons are said to have taught humans to talk.

[[File:Dragon order insignia.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Order of the Dragon]] was created to defend Europe against the invading Ottoman Turks in the 15th century.]]
Narratives about dragons often involve them being killed by a hero. This topos can be traced to the ''[[Chaoskampf]]'' of the [[mythology of the Ancient Near East]] (e.g. [[Hadad]] vs. [[Yam (god)|Yam]], [[Marduk]] vs. [[Tiamat]], [[Teshub]] vs. [[Illuyanka]], etc.; the Biblical [[Leviathan]] presumably reflects a corresponding opponent of an early version of [[Yahweh]]). The motif is continued in  Greek [[Apollo]], and the early Christian narratives about [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] and [[Saint George]]. The slaying of [[Vrtra]] by [[Indra]] in the [[Rigveda]] also belongs in this category. The theme survives into medieval legend and folklore, with dragon slayers such as [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], [[Sigurd]], [[Tristan and Iseult|Tristan]], [[Margaret the Virgin]], [[Heinrich von Winkelried]], [[Dobrynya Nikitich]], [[Smok Wawelski|Skuba Dratewka]]/[[Krakus]]. In the Bible, the archetype is alluded to in the descendants of [[Adam]] crushing the head of the [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]], and in Christian mythology, this was interpreted as corresponding to [[Christ]] as the [[Last Adam]] crushing the [[devil]].

{{anchor|Blood}}
The [[Blood#Cultural and religious beliefs|blood]] of a slain dragon is depicted as either beneficent or as poisonous in medieval legend and literary fiction. In German legend, dragon blood has the power to render invincible skin or armor bathed in it, as is the case with [[Sigurd|Siegfried]]'s skin or [[Ortnit]]'s armor. In the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic myth]], the Earth refuses it as it is so vile that [[Mother Earth (deity)|Mother Earth]] wishes not to have it within her womb, and it remains above ground for all eternity. The blood of the dragon in ''[[Beowulf]]'' has [[acid]]ic qualities, allowing it to seep through iron. [[Heinrich von Winkelried]] dies after the blood of the dragon slain by him accidentally drips on him.

In [[Ancient Greece]] the first mention of a "dragon" is derived from the ''[[Iliad]]'' where [[Agamemnon]] is described as having a blue dragon motif on his sword belt and an emblem of a three-headed dragon on his breast plate.<ref>Drury, Nevill, ''The Dictionary of the Esoteric'', Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2003 ISBN 81-208-1989-6, [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=k-tVr09oq3IC&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=earliest+mention+of+dragon&source=web&ots=fxq_n3SLTa&sig=zKfmIXx1BT3nQAZq3I0vkx9akhM&hl=en p.79], , books.google.com</ref> However, the Greek word used (δράκων ''drákōn'', [[genitive]] δράκοντοϛ ''drákontos'') could also mean "snake".

European dragons exist in folklore and mythology among the overlapping [[Culture of Europe|cultures of Europe]]. Dragons are generally depicted as living in rivers or having an underground lair or cave.<ref name=Ormen/> They are commonly described as having hard or armoured hide, and are rarely described as flying, despite often being depicted with wings.

European dragons are usually depicted as malevolent under Christianity; pre-Christian dragons, such as [[Y Ddraig Goch]], the Red Dragon of Wales, are seen as benevolent

{{main|Slavic dragon}}
In [[Slavic mythology]], the words ''"zmey"'', ''"zmiy"'' or ''"zmaj"'' are used to describe dragons. These words are masculine forms of the Slavic word for "snake", which are normally feminine (like Russian ''zmeya''). In [[Romania]], there is a similar figure, derived from the Slavic dragon and named ''[[zmeu]]''. Exclusively in Polish and Belarusian folklore, as well as in the other Slavic folklores, a dragon is also called (variously) ''смок'', ''цмок'', or ''smok''. In South Slavic folklores, the same thing is also called ''lamya'' (ламйа, ламjа, lamja). Although quite similar to other [[European dragon]]s, Slavic dragons have their peculiarities.

[[Russia]]n dragons usually have heads in multiples of three. Some have heads that grow back if every single head isn't cut off. In  [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]], a particular dragon-like creature, ''[[Zmey Gorynych]]'', has [[Multi-headed animal|three heads]] and spits fire. According to one [[bylina]], Zmey Gorynych was killed by [[bogatyr]] [[Dobrynya Nikitich]].

Other Russian dragons (such as [[Tugarin Zmeyevich]]) have [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] names, probably symbolizing the [[Mongols]] and other [[nomadic]] [[steppe]] peoples. Accordingly, [[St George]] (symbolizing [[Christianity]]) killing the Dragon (symbolizing [[Satan]]) is represented on the [[coat of arms of Moscow]]. Some prehistoric structures, notably the [[Serpent's Wall]] near [[Kiev]], have been associated with dragons.

===Ancient India===
In the [[Historical Vedic religion|early Vedic religion]], '''[[Vritra]]''' ([[Sanskrit]]: वृत्र ([[Devanāgarī]]) or {{IAST|Vṛtra}} ([[IAST]])) "the enveloper", was a dragon or a "[[naga (mythology)|naga]]" (serpent) ({{lang-sa|नाग}})<ref>naga का मतलब हिंदी में.

In later Puranic mythology he came to be identified with an [[Asura]].

The ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'' by [[Flavius Philostratus]]:<ref>Flavius Philostratus, ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', translated by F. C. Conybeare, volume I, book III. chapters VI, VII, VIII, 1921, pp. 243–247.</ref> contains a long detailed description of India heavily infested with dragons, but this does not correspond with modern Indian belief, and likely not with Indian belief as it was in his time, whether Apollonius invented this story, or whether he believed someone else who told him it.

===Assam, India===
In Assam, dragon symbols are used in the Assamese Culture. Generally, dragons motifs are made for religious purposes. Such motifs are placed along the ''mukut'' in Naamghars. Dragons with lion body are placed on the top of the gates of these ''Naamghars'', which symbolises that they guard the ''ghar''. Dragon Symbols are also used in clothes.

===Persian===
[[File:Al-Soltani, Rostam and the Dragon.jpg|thumb|right|15th-century Persian miniature of [[Rostam]] slaying a dragon]]
Aži Dahāka is the source of the [[Persian language|modern Persian]] word azhdahā or ezhdehā اژدها (Middle Persian azdahāg) meaning "dragon", often used of a dragon depicted upon a banner of war. The Persians believed that the baby of a dragon will be the same color as the mother's eyes. In [[Middle Persian]] he is called Dahāg or Bēvar-Asp, the latter meaning "[he who has] 10,000 horses."
Several other dragons and dragon-like creatures, all of them malevolent, are mentioned in [[Zoroastrian]] scripture. (See [[Zahhāk]]).

===Jewish===
In Jewish religious texts, the first mention of a dragon-like creature is in the [[Tanakh|Biblical]] works of [[Book of Job|Job]] (26:13), and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] (27:1) where it is called ''Nachash Bare'ach'', or a "[[Geographical pole|Pole]] Serpent".<ref name = "oalkvs">p. 233, Kaplan</ref> This is identified in the [[Midrash Rabba]] to Genesis 1:21 as [[Leviathan]] from  the word ''Taninim'' (תנינים) "and God created the great sea-monsters."<ref>[[Harry Freedman (rabbi)|Freedman, Rabbi Dr. H.]] (translation), Maurice Simon, editor, ''Midrash Rabbah: Genesis'', Volume 1, The Soncino Press, London, 1983, p. 51.</ref> In [[Hebrew language|modern Hebrew]] the word ''Taninim'' is used for [[Crocodile]]s but this is a 20th-century usage unconnected with the original Biblical meaning.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In later Biblical texts, the [[Book of Isaiah]], the [[Book of Job]], and [[Psalm 89]] refer to a sea-demon called [[Rahab (demon)|Rahab]] (not to be confused with [[Rahab]], the woman of [[Jericho]] mentioned in the [[Book of Joshua]]). {{bibleverse||Isaiah|51:9|AB}} equates this Rahab with a dragon or monster. "Rahab" is the English transliteration of רהב (''reb'') with the several meanings: pride, a mythical sea-monster, or Egypt (as an emblematic name).<ref>{{cite book |url= http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/hebrew/nas/rahab-2.html |author= Brown, Driver, Briggs and Gesenius |chapter= Rahab (lexicon entry) |title= The NAS Old Testament Hebrew Lexicon |accessdate= 2011-08-01 }}</ref> In the [[Douay-Rheims]] version, translated via [[Medieval Latin]] from the [[Vulgate]], the word ''reb'' is rendered "the proud one" in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|51:9|DRA}} and {{bibleverse||Job|26:12|DRA}} and "the power of the sea" in {{bibleverse||Psalm|88:10|DRA}} (Psalm 88 is equivalent to Psalm 89 in other versions due to different verse numbering in the Vulgate).

In Jewish astronomy this is also identified with the [[North Pole]], the star [[Thuban]] which, around 4,500 years ago, was the star in the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco constellation's]] "tail".<ref name = "oalkvs"/> However this can also have been either the [[celestial pole]] or the [[ecliptic pole]]. The ancient observers noted that Draco was at the top of the celestial pole, giving the appearance that stars were "hanging" from it, and in Hebrew it is referred to as ''Teli'', from talah (תלה) – to hang.<ref>p. 1670, Jastrow ref to Genesis 38:14, Y.Sot.I 16d (bot.)</ref> Hebrew writers from Arabic-speaking locations identified the ''Teli'' as ''Al Jaz'har'', which is a Persian word for a "knot" or a "node" because of the intersection of the inclination of the orbit of a planet from the elliptic that forms two such nodes. In modern astronomy these are called the [[ascending node]] and the [[descending node]], but in [[History of astronomy#Western European Astronomy in the Middle Ages|medieval astronomy]] they were referred to as "dragon's head" and "dragon's tail".<ref>p. 235, Kaplan</ref>

In East Asia, the concept of dragon appears largely in a form of a ''Long'', a beneficent dragon-like creature from Chinese folklore. Another dragon-like creature is a [[Nāga|Naga]], which is prevalent in some Southeast Asian countries with more direct influence from Vedic religion.

Vietnamese dragons ({{lang|vi|''rồng''}} or {{lang|vi|''long''}}) are symbolic creatures in the folklore and mythology of Vietnam. According to an ancient creation myth, the Vietnamese people are descended from a dragon and a fairy.
To Vietnamese people, the dragon brings rain, essential for agriculture. It represents the emperor, the prosperity and power of the nation. Like the Chinese dragon, the Vietnamese dragon is the symbol of [[Yin and yang|yang]], representing the universe, life, existence, and growth.
Extant references to the Vietnamese Dragon are rare now, due to the fierce changes in history that accompanied the sinicization of the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]].

Sandra Martina Schwab writes, "With a few exceptions, including McCaffrey's Pern novels and the 2002 film ''Reign of Fire'', dragons seem to fit more into the medievalized setting of fantasy literature than into the more technological world of science fiction. Indeed, they have been called the emblem of fantasy. The hero's fight against the dragon emphasizes and celebrates his masculinity, whereas revisionist fantasies of dragons and dragon-slaying often undermine traditional gender roles. In children's literature the friendly dragon becomes a powerful ally in battling the child's fears."<ref>{{cite book |author= Schwab, Sandra Martina |chapter= Dragons |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |editor= [[Gary Westfahl]] |location= Westport, CT |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |year= 2005 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 216 |ISBN= 0-313-32951-6}}</ref>

In the early 20th century sculpture of the Norwegian artist [[Gustav Vigeland]], inspired by [[Medieval art]], dragons are a frequent theme—as symbols of [[sin]] but also as a natural force, fighting against man.

Dragons and dragon motifs are featured in many works of modern literature, particularly within the [[fantasy]] genre. Prominent works depicting dragons include [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels, [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s ''[[Dragonriders of Pern]]'', [[George R. R. Martin]]'s series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', and [[Christopher Paolini]]'s tetralogy ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]''.  Even by the 18th century, critical thinkers like Diderot were asserting that too much literature had been published on dragons: "There are already in books all too many fabulous stories of dragons".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Dragons|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.976|website=The Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>

The popular [[role playing game]] system ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (D&D) makes heavy use of [[Dragons (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragons]], and has served as inspiration for many other games' dragons. Though dragons usually serve as adversaries, they can be either good or evil, with their [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]] being determined by their species. For example, a [[Red Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|red dragon]] is evil and breathes fire while a [[Silver Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|silver dragon]] is good and breathes cold.

In Australia, stories of such creatures may have referred to the land crocodiles, ''[[Quinkana]]'' sp., a terrestrial crocodile which grew to 5 to possibly 7 metres long, or the monitor lizard ''[[Varanus priscus]]'' (formerly ''Megalania prisca'') a giant carnivorous [[goanna]] that might have grown to {{convert|7|m|ft}}, and weighed up to {{convert|1,940|kg|lb}}, or rainbow serpents (possibly ''[[Wonambi naracoortensis]]'') that were part of the extinct [[megafauna]] of Australia.<ref>Mackness, B.S. 2009.

In the book ''[[An Instinct for Dragons]]''<ref>{{cite book|author= David E. Jones |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=P1uBUZupE9gC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title= An Instinct for Dragons |location= New York |publisher= Routledge |year=2000 |ISBN=0-415-92721-8}}</ref> [[anthropologist]] [[David E. Jones]] suggests a hypothesis that humans just like monkeys have inherited instinctive reactions to snakes, large cats and birds of prey. Dragons have features that are combinations of these three. An instinctive fear for these three would explain why dragons with similar features occur in stories from independent cultures on all continents.

In Slovenia, [[Johann Weikhard von Valvasor]] compiled folk stories on the [[Olm]], a subterranean salamander, in ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]''. It is mentioned as a baby dragon. Heavy rains of Slovenia would wash the olms up from their subterranean habitat, giving rise to the folk belief that great dragons lived beneath the Earth's crust, and the olms were the undeveloped offspring of these mythical beasts.<ref name="Nick Baker: Naturalist">{{cite web | url=http://www.nickbaker.tv/feature-creature/ | title=The Dragon of Vrhnika&nbsp;– The Olm | last=Baker | first=Nick | authorlink=Nick Baker (naturalist) | work=Nickbaker.tv | accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref>

==Cartography==
There is a widespread belief that earlier [[cartographer]]s used the [[Latin]] phrase ''hic sunt dracones'', ''i.e.'', "the dragons are here", or "[[here be dragons]]", to denote dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of the infrequent medieval practice of putting [[sea serpent]]s and other mythological creatures in the blank areas of maps.  However, the only known use of this exact phrase is in the [[Latin]] form "HC SVNT DRACONES" on the [[Lenox Globe]] (ca. 1503–07).<ref>{{cite web | author = Erin C.

Another map that contains dragons is the one of Bishop Olaus Magnus's. The [[Carta Marina|Carta Marina map of Scandinavia (1539)]] has many monsters in the northern sea, as well as a winged, bipedal, predatory land animal resembling a dragon in northern [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]].
