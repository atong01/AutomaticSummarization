The bond has strength because the adhesive is hard enough to resist flow when stress is applied to the bond.

The individual components react with each other after being mixed and show full adhesion only on curing. The multi-component resins can be either solvent-based or solvent-less. The solvents present in the adhesives are a medium for the polyester or the polyurethane resin. The solvent is dried during the curing process.</paragraph><heading level='5'>One-part adhesives</heading><paragraph><italics>One-part adhesives</italics><space/>harden via a chemical reaction with an external energy source, such as<space/><link><target>radiation</target></link>,<space/><link><target>heat</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>moisture</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph><italics>Ultraviolet</italics><space/>(UV)<space/><italics>light curing adhesives</italics>, also known as<space/><italics>light curing materials</italics><space/>(LCM), have become popular within the manufacturing sector due to their rapid curing time and strong bond strength.

Sunlight and heat may weaken the adhesive. Solvents can deteriorate or dissolve adhesive. Physical stresses may also cause the separation of surfaces. When subjected to loading, debonding may occur at different locations in the adhesive joint. The major fracture types are the following:</paragraph><heading level='3'>Cohesive fracture</heading><paragraph><italics>Cohesive fracture</italics><space/>is obtained if a crack propagates in the bulk polymer which constitutes the adhesive. In this case the surfaces of both adherends after debonding will be covered by fractured adhesive. The crack may propagate in the center of the layer or near an interface. For this last case, the cohesive fracture can be said to be cohesive near the interface.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Adhesive fracture</heading><paragraph><italics>Adhesive fracture</italics><space/>(sometimes referred to as<space/><italics>interfacial fracture</italics>) is when debonding occurs between the adhesive and the adherend. In most cases, the occurrence of adhesive fracture for a given adhesive goes along with smaller fracture toughness.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Other types of fracture</heading><paragraph>Other types of fracture include:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>The<space/><italics>mixed</italics><space/>type, which occurs if the crack propagates at some spots in a cohesive and in others in an interfacial manner. Mixed fracture surfaces can be characterised by a certain percentage of adhesive and cohesive areas.</listitem><listitem>The<space/><italics>alternating crack path</italics><space/>type which occurs if the cracks jump from one interface to the other. This type of fracture appears in the presence of tensile pre-stresses in the adhesive layer.</listitem><listitem>Fracture can also occur in the adherend if the adhesive is tougher than the adherend. In this case, the adhesive remains intact and is still bonded to one substrate and remnants of the other. For example, when one removes a price label, the adhesive usually remains on the label and the surface. This is cohesive failure. If, however, a layer of paper remains stuck to the surface, the adhesive has not failed. Another example is when someone tries to pull apart<space/><link><target>Oreo</target></link><space/>cookies and all the filling remains on one side; this is an adhesive failure, rather than a cohesive failure.</listitem></list><heading level='2'>Design of adhesive joints</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:fracture modes v2.svg</target><part>thumbnail</part><part>350px</part><part>Modes of failure</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>As a general design rule, the material properties of the object need to be greater than the forces anticipated during its use. (i.e. geometry, loads, etc.). The engineering work will consist of having a good model to evaluate the function.

Concepts such as the<space/><link><target>stress concentration</target></link><space/>factor and the<space/><link><target>strain energy release rate</target></link><space/>can be used to predict failure. In such models, the behavior of the adhesive layer itself is neglected and only the adherents are considered.</paragraph><paragraph>Failure will also very much depend on the opening<space/><italics>mode</italics><space/>of the joint.</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><italics>Mode I</italics><space/>is an opening or tensile mode where the loadings are normal to the crack.</listitem><listitem><italics>Mode II</italics><space/>is a sliding or in-plane shear mode where the crack surfaces slide over one another in direction perpendicular to the leading edge of the crack.
