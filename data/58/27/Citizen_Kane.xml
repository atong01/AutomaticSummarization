Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through<space/><link><target>Flashback (narrative)</target><part>flashbacks</part></link>, the story is told through the research of a<space/><link><target>newsreel</target></link><space/>reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: &quot;Rosebud&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>After the<space/><link><target>Broadway theatre</target><part>Broadway</part></link><space/>successes of Welles's<space/><link><target>Mercury Theatre</target></link><space/>and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast &quot;<link><target>The War of the Worlds (radio drama)</target><part>The War of the Worlds</part></link>&quot; on<space/><italics><link><target>The Mercury Theatre on the Air</target></link></italics>, Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with<space/><link><target>RKO Pictures</target></link><space/>in 1939. Unusual for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have<space/><link><target>final cut privilege</target></link>. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the screenplay for<space/><italics>Citizen Kane</italics>, collaborating on the effort with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film received its American release in 1941.</paragraph><paragraph>While a critical success,<space/><italics>Citizen Kane</italics><space/>failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as<space/><link><target>Andr Bazin</target></link><space/>and given an American revival in 1956.

Holding a<space/><link><target>snow globe</target></link>, he utters a word, &quot;Rosebud&quot;, and dies; the globe slips from his hand and smashes on the floor. A<space/><link><target>newsreel</target></link><space/>obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher. Kane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of &quot;rosebud&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Thompson sets out to interview Kane's friends and associates. He approaches Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an<space/><link><target>alcoholic</target></link><space/>who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher's written memoirs, Thompson learns that Kane's childhood began in poverty in Colorado.</paragraph><paragraph>After a gold mine was discovered on her property, Kane's mother Mary Kane sends Charles away to live with Thatcher so that he may be properly educated. The young Kane plays happily with a sled in the snow at his parents' boarding-house and protests being sent to live with Thatcher. After gaining full control over his trust fund at the age of 25, Kane enters the newspaper business and embarks on a career of<space/><link><target>yellow journalism</target></link>. He takes control of the<space/><italics>New York Inquirer</italics><space/>and begins publishing scandalous articles that attack Thatcher's business interests. After the stock market crash in 1929, Kane is forced to sell controlling interest of his newspaper empire to Thatcher.</paragraph><paragraph>In the present, Thompson interviews Kane's personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls how Kane hired the best journalists available to build the<space/><italics>Inquirer</italics>'s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the<space/><link><target>Spanish American War</target></link><space/>and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of a President of the United States.</paragraph><paragraph>Thompson interviews Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a<space/><link><target>retirement home</target></link>. Leland recalls Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrates over the years, and he begins an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while he is running for Governor of<space/><link><target>New York</target></link>. Both his wife and his political opponent discover the affair and the<space/><link><target>Political scandal</target><part>public scandal</part></link><space/>ends his political career. Kane marries Susan and forces her into a humiliating operatic career for which she has neither the talent nor the ambition. Susan consents to an interview with Thompson, and recalls her failed opera career. Kane finally allows her to abandon her singing career after she attempts suicide. After years spent dominated by Kane and living in isolation at Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane. Kane's butler Raymond recounts that after Susan left him Kane began violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. He suddenly calms down when he sees a snow globe and says &quot;Rosebud&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Back at Xanadu, Kane's belongings are being cataloged or discarded. Thompson concludes that he is unable to solve the mystery and that the meaning of &quot;Rosebud&quot; will forever remain an enigma. As the film ends, the camera reveals that Rosebud was the name of the<space/><link><target>sled</target></link><space/>from Kane's childhood in Colorado a time when he was happy. Thought to be junk by Xanadu's staff, the sled is burned in a furnace.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Cast</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Orson Welles</target></link><space/>as<space/><link><target>#Charles Foster Kane</target><part>Charles Foster Kane</part></link>, a wealthy newspaper publisher.<extension extension_name='ref' name="AFIcat"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s</arg><arg name="title">Citizen Kane Movie Detail<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films|The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States: Feature Films, 1941&nbsp;â 1950]]<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">April 14, 2014</arg></template></extension></listitem><listitem><link><target>Joseph Cotten</target></link><space/>as<space/><link><target>#Jedediah Leland</target><part>Jedediah Leland</part></link>, Kane's best friend and a reporter for<space/><italics>The Inquirer</italics>.

Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Wellesnet Toland"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.wellesnet.com/?p</arg><arg name="last">Toland<space/></arg><arg name="first">Gregg<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink">Gregg Toland<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Motion Picture Cameraman<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">''Theatre Arts'', Wellesnet: The Orson Welles Web Resource<space/></arg><arg name="date">September 1941<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">September 21, 2013<space/></arg><arg name="pages">646â654</arg></template></extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Both this article and a May 1941<space/><italics>Life</italics><space/>magazine article with illustrated examples<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="author"><space/></arg><arg name="date">May 26, 1941<space/></arg><arg name="title">Orson Welles: Once a Child Prodigy, He Has Never Quite Grown Up<space/></arg><arg name="url">https://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="journal">[[Life (magazine)|Life]]<space/></arg><arg name="pages">108â116<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">December 18, 2014</arg></template></extension><space/>helped popularize deep focus cinematography and Toland's achievements on the film.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Minding"></extension><template><target>Rp</target><arg>73</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Another unorthodox method used in the film was the way<space/><link><target>low-angle shot</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>were used to display a point of view facing upwards, thus allowing ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes.
