'''''Citizen Kane''''' is a 1941 American [[drama film]] by [[Orson Welles]], its producer, co-author, director and star. The picture was Welles's [[List of directorial debuts|first feature film]]. Nominated for [[14th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] in nine categories, it won an [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]] by [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and Welles. Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the [[List of films considered the best|greatest film ever made]], ''Citizen Kane'' was voted the greatest film of all time in five consecutive ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' polls of critics, until it was displaced by ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' in the 2012 poll. It topped the [[American Film Institute]]'s  [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies]] list in 1998, as well as AFI's [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|2007 update]]. ''Citizen Kane'' is particularly praised for its cinematography, music, and narrative structure, which were innovative for its time.

The story is a ''[[film à clef]]'' that examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, a character based in part upon the American newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]], Chicago tycoons [[Samuel Insull]] and [[Harold Fowler McCormick|Harold McCormick]], and aspects of Welles's own life. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], the story is told through the research of a [[newsreel]] reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: "Rosebud".

After the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] successes of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]] and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast "[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]" on ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'', Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with [[RKO Pictures]] in 1939. Unusual for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have [[final cut privilege]]. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the screenplay for ''Citizen Kane'', collaborating on the effort with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film received its American release in 1941.

While a critical success, ''Citizen Kane'' failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as [[André Bazin]] and given an American revival in 1956. The film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th anniversary edition.

==Plot==

[[File:Orson Welles-Citizen Kane1.jpg|alt=A mustachioed man in a suit leans on a lectern and points to his left. Behind him to the left is a large picture of himself wearing a hat.|thumb|right|Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane]]

In a mansion in [[Xanadu (Citizen Kane)|Xanadu]], a vast palatial estate in Florida, the elderly [[Charles Foster Kane]] is on his deathbed. Holding a [[snow globe]], he utters a word, "Rosebud", and dies; the globe slips from his hand and smashes on the floor. A [[newsreel]] obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher. Kane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of "rosebud".

Thompson sets out to interview Kane's friends and associates. He approaches Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an [[alcoholic]] who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher's written memoirs, Thompson learns that Kane's childhood began in poverty in Colorado.

After a gold mine was discovered on her property, Kane's mother Mary Kane sends Charles away to live with Thatcher so that he may be properly educated. The young Kane plays happily with a sled in the snow at his parents' boarding-house and protests being sent to live with Thatcher. After gaining full control over his trust fund at the age of 25, Kane enters the newspaper business and embarks on a career of [[yellow journalism]]. He takes control of the ''New York Inquirer'' and begins publishing scandalous articles that attack Thatcher's business interests. After the stock market crash in 1929, Kane is forced to sell controlling interest of his newspaper empire to Thatcher.

In the present, Thompson interviews Kane's personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls how Kane hired the best journalists available to build the ''Inquirer'''s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the [[Spanish American War]] and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of a President of the United States.

Thompson interviews Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a [[retirement home]]. Leland recalls Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrates over the years, and he begins an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while he is running for Governor of [[New York]]. Both his wife and his political opponent discover the affair and the [[Political scandal|public scandal]] ends his political career. Kane marries Susan and forces her into a humiliating operatic career for which she has neither the talent nor the ambition. Susan consents to an interview with Thompson, and recalls her failed opera career. Kane finally allows her to abandon her singing career after she attempts suicide. After years spent dominated by Kane and living in isolation at Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane. Kane's butler Raymond recounts that after Susan left him Kane began violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. He suddenly calms down when he sees a snow globe and says "Rosebud".

Back at Xanadu, Kane's belongings are being cataloged or discarded. Thompson concludes that he is unable to solve the mystery and that the meaning of "Rosebud" will forever remain an enigma. As the film ends, the camera reveals that Rosebud was the name of the [[sled]] from Kane's childhood in Colorado — a time when he was happy. Thought to be junk by Xanadu's staff, the sled is burned in a furnace.

[[File:Orson-Welles-Show-1941.jpg|thumb|left|Welles's radio broadcast of "[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]" in 1938 caught the attention of [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] studio head [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George J. Schaefer]].]]

Hollywood had shown interest in Welles as early as 1936.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnston |first=Alva |last2=Smith |first2=Fred |date=February 3, 1940 |title=How to Raise a Child (part 3)  |url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/flbk/How_to_Raise_a_Child_part_iii/#/1/ |journal=[[The Saturday Evening Post]] |pages=27, 28, 40, 45 |doi= |accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref>{{Rp|40}} He turned down three scripts sent to him by [[Warner Bros.]] In 1937, he declined offers from [[David O.

"Although the possibility of making huge amounts of money in Hollywood greatly attracted him," wrote biographer Frank Brady, "he was still totally, hopelessly, insanely in love with the theater, and it is there that he had every intention of remaining to make his mark."<ref name="Brady">{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Brady (writer) |title=Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York |date=1989 |isbn=0-385-26759-2}}</ref>{{Rp|118–119, 130}}

Following "[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]" broadcast of his CBS radio series ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'', Welles was lured to Hollywood with a remarkable contract.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK">{{cite book |last=Carringer |first=Robert L. |title=The Making of Citizen Kane |publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |date=1985 |isbn=978-0-520-20567-3}}</ref>{{Rp|1–2, 153}} [[RKO Pictures]] studio head [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George J.

At first he simply wanted to spend three months in Hollywood and earn enough money to pay his debts and fund his next theatrical season.<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|170|December 2014}} Welles first arrived on July 20, 1939<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|168|December 2014}} and on his first tour, he called the movie studio "the greatest electric train set a boy ever had".<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|174}}

Welles signed his contract with RKO on August 21. This legendary contract stipulated that Welles would act in, direct, produce and write two films. Mercury would get $100,000 for first film by January 1, 1940, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000, and $125,000 for second film by January 1, 1941, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000. The most controversial aspect of the contract was granting Welles complete artistic control of the two films so long as RKO approved both project's stories<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|169|December 2014}} and so long so the budget did not exceed $500,000.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|1–2, 153}} RKO executives would not be allowed to see any footage until Welles chose to show it to them, and no cuts could be made to either film without Welles’s approval.<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|169|December 2014}} Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, select his own cast and crew, and have the [[final cut privilege|right of final cut]]. Granting final cut privilege was unprecedented for a studio since it placed artistic considerations over financial investment. The contract was deeply resented in the film industry, and the Hollywood press took every opportunity to mock RKO and Welles. Schaefer remained a great supporter<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|1–2, 153}} and saw the unprecedented contract as good publicity.<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|170|December 2014}} Film scholar Robert L. Carringer wrote: "The simple fact seems to be that Schaefer believed Welles was going to pull off something really big almost as much as Welles did himself."<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|1–2, 153}}

Welles spent the first five months of his RKO contract trying to get his first project going, without success. "They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there," wrote ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|15}} It was agreed that Welles would film ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', previously adapted for ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'', which would be presented entirely through a [[Point of view shot|first-person camera]]. After elaborate pre-production and a day of test shooting with a hand-held camera — unheard of at the time — the project never reached production because Welles was unable to trim $50,000 from its budget.{{efn|"I did a very elaborate production for [''Heart of Darkness''], such as I've never done again — never could," Welles said. "I shot my bolt on preproduction on that picture.

"''Heart of Darkness'' is one of the few stories that it's very well adapted to, because it relies so heavily on narration," Welles said. "The camera was going to be Marlow … He's in the pilot house and he can see himself reflected in the glass through which you see the jungle. So it isn't that business of a hand-held camera mooching around pretending to walk like a man."<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|31}}}}<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|30–31}} Schaefer told Welles that the $500,000 budget could not be exceeded; revenue was declining sharply in Europe by the fall of 1939.<ref name="Brady"/>{{Rp|215–216}}

He then started work on the idea that became ''Citizen Kane''. Knowing the script would take time to prepare, Welles suggested to RKO that while that was being done — "so the year wouldn't be lost" — he make a humorous political thriller. Welles proposed ''The Smiler with a Knife'', from a novel by [[Cecil Day-Lewis]].<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|33–34}} When that project stalled in December 1939, Welles began brainstorming other story ideas with screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], who had been writing Mercury radio scripts. "Arguing, inventing, discarding, these two powerful, headstrong, dazzlingly articulate personalities thrashed toward ''Kane''", wrote biographer [[Richard Meryman]].<ref name=Meryman/>{{Rp|245–246}}

Welles admired Mankiewicz, and had met him in New York in 1938<ref name="Brady"/>{{Rp|234}} at the time of the [[Mercury Theatre]]'s Broadway successes. In September 1939<ref name="Meryman"/>{{Rp|244}} Welles visited Mankiewicz while he was hospitalized in Los Angeles after a car accident, and offered him a job writing scripts for the Mercury Theatre's show on CBS radio, ''[[The Campbell Playhouse]]''. "I felt it would be useless," Welles said later, "because of Mank's general uselessness many times in the studios. But I thought, 'We'll see what he comes up with.'" Mankiewicz proved very useful, particularly working with Houseman as editor,<ref name="Meryman"/>{{Rp|240–242}} and wrote five scripts for ''Campbell Playhouse'' shows broadcast between November 12, 1939, and March 17, 1940.{{efn|Only four of the five scripts reached the air: "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd", "Dodsworth", "Vanity Fair" and "Huckleberry Finn".<ref name=Meryman/>{{Rp|242}}}}<ref name="Whaley">[http://www.lybrary.com/barton-whaley-m-191.html Whaley, Barton], ''Orson Welles: The Man Who Was Magic''.

For some time, Mankiewicz had wanted to write a screenplay about a public figure&nbsp;– perhaps a gangster&nbsp;– whose story would be told by the people that knew him.<ref name="Callow">{{cite book |last=Callow |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Callow |title=Orson Welles: The Road to Xanadu |publisher=[[Viking]] |location=New York |date=1996 |isbn=9780670867226 }}</ref>{{Rp|484}} In the mid-1930s Mankiewicz had written the first act of an unproduced play about [[John Dillinger]], titled ''The Tree Will Grow''.<ref name="Whaley"/>{{Rp|132}} "It was something [Mankiewicz] had been thinking about for years," Houseman wrote, “the idea of telling a man’s private life (preferably one that suggested a recognizable American figure), immediately following his death, through the intimate and often incompatible testimony of those who had known him at different times and in different circumstances.”<ref name="Houseman RT"/>{{Rp|448–449|date=January 2013}}

Welles himself had worked with the concept. As a teenager in 1932 he wrote a play about the life of abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] called ''Marching Song''. Like that of ''Citizen Kane'', the play’s plot is structured around a journalist attempting to understand Brown by interviewing people who knew him and have different perspectives on him.

"There is a quality in the film — much more than a vague perfume — that was Mank and that I treasured," Welles said.

He also transformed Kane from a cardboard fictionalization of Hearst into a figure of mystery and epic magnificence.

Mankiewicz had seen rushes of the film shortly before this and said he was unhappy with the footage. However, Mankiewicz's assessment of the footage was full of contradictions. He told Welles that there were "not enough standard movie conventions being observed" and that he disliked the theatricality and lack of close-ups in the film. But Mankiewicz also called the footage "magnificent" and said he like it "from an ascetical point of view." He also said that he thought the audience would not understand the film.<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|204|December 2014}}

Mankiewicz began threatening Welles to get credit for the film. This included threatening to post full-page ads in trade papers and getting his friend [[Ben Hecht]] to write an exposé about their collaboration in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''. Mankiewicz also threatened to go to the [[Screen Writers Guild]] and claim full credit for writing the entire script by himself. Welles biographer Barbara Leaming believes that Mankiewicz reacted this way out of fear of getting no credit at all.<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|204|December 2014}}

After lodging a protest with the Screen Writers Guild, Mankiewicz withdrew it, then vacillated. The question was resolved in January 1941 when RKO awarded Mankiewicz credit. The guild credit form listed Welles first, Mankiewicz second. Welles's assistant Richard Wilson said that the person who circled Mankiewicz's name in pencil, then drew an arrow that put it in first place, was Welles. The official credit reads, "Screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles".<ref name=Meryman/>{{Rp|264–265}}

Mankiewicz's rancor toward Welles grew over the remaining 12 years of his life. Welles's irritation with Mankiewicz passed quickly, and he spoke of him with fondness.<ref name="Whaley"/>{{Rp|498}}

"One of the things that bound his friends to him was his extraordinary vulnerability," Welles told Mankiewicz's biographer. "He liked the attention he got as a great, monumental self-destructing machine. That was his role, and he played it to the hilt. He was a performer, as I think all very successful personalities are. He couldn’t be affectionate or loving outside his family. You never felt you were basking in the warmth of his friendship. So it was his vulnerability that brought the warmth out from the friends. And people loved him. ''Loved'' him. That terrible vulnerability. That terrible wreck."<ref name=Meryman/>{{Rp|168}}

Welles further said this to Mankiewicz's biographer: "I have only one real enemy in my life that I know about, and that is John Houseman. Everything begins and ends with that hostility behind the mandarin benevolence."<ref name=Meryman/>{{Rp|255}}

In the end of July RKO approved the film and Welles was allowed to officially begin shooting, despite having already been filming “tests” for several weeks. Welles leaked stories to newspaper reporters that the tests had been so good that there was no need to re-shoot them.

Welles usually worked 16 to 18 hours a day on the film. He often began work at 4 a.m. since the special effects make-up used to age him for certain scenes took up to four hours to apply. Welles used this time to discuss the day's shooting with Toland and other crew members. The special contact lenses used to make Welles look elderly proved very painful, and a doctor was employed to place them into Welles's eyes. Welles had difficulty seeing clearly while wearing them, which caused him to badly cut his wrist when shooting the scene in which Kane breaks up the furniture in Susan's bedroom.

Welles hired Bernard Herrmann to compose the film's score. Where most Hollywood film scores were written quickly, in as few as two or three weeks after filming was completed, Herrmann was given 12 weeks to write the music. He had sufficient time to do his own orchestrations and conducting, and worked on the film reel by reel as it was shot and cut. He wrote complete musical pieces for some of the montages, and Welles edited many of the scenes to match their length.<ref name="NYT Herrmann">{{cite news |last=Herrmann |first=Bernard |authorlink=Bernard Herrmann |title=Score for a Film |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=May 25, 1941}}</ref>

==Style==

Film scholars and historians view ''Citizen Kane'' as Welles's attempt to create a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of film making, and combining them all into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started the work on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, "Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance — you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when you know something about a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful."<ref name="Estrin"/>{{Rp|80}}

[[David Bordwell]] wrote that "The best way to understand ''Citizen Kane'' is to stop worshiping it as a triumph of technique." Bordwell argues that the film did not invent any of its famous techniques such as deep focus cinematography, shots of the ceilings, chiaroscuro lighting and temporal jump-cuts, and many of these stylistics had been used in German Expressionist films of the 1920s, such as ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari''. But Bordwell asserts that the film did put them all together for the first time and perfected the medium in one single film.<ref name="Wakeman"/>{{Rp|1171}} In a 1948 interview [[D. W. Griffith]] said "I loved ''Citizen Kane'' and particularly loved the ideas he took from me."<ref>{{cite news |last=Goodman |first=Ezra |title=Flash-Back to Griffith |publisher=''PM'' |date=May 19, 1948}}</ref>

Arguments against the film's cinematic innovations were made as early as 1946 when French historian [[Georges Sadoul]] wrote that "the film is an encyclopedia of old techniques." Sadoul pointed out such examples as compositions that used both the foreground and the background in the films of [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]], special effects used in the films of [[Georges Méliès]], shots of the ceiling in Erich von Stroheim's ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'' and newsreel montages in the films of [[Dziga Vertov]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Sadoul |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Sadoul |title=Le Cinéma: Hypertrophie ducerveau ̄ Review of ''Citizen Kane'' |publisher=[[Les Lettres Françaises]], number 115 |location=Paris, France |date=July 5, 1946 |page=9}}</ref>

French film critic André Bazin defended the film and wrote that "In this respect, the accusation of plagiarism could very well be extended to the film's use of panchromatic film or its exploitation of the properties of gelatinous silver halide." Bazin disagreed with Sadoul's comparison to Lumière's cinematography since ''Citizen Kane'' used more sophisticated lenses,<ref name=BazinatWork>{{cite book |last1=Bazin |first1=André |last2=Cardullo |first2=Bert (editor) |authorlink1=André Bazin |title=Bazin at Work: Major Essays & Reviews From the Forties & Fifties |publisher=Rutledge |location=New York & London |date=1997 |isbn= 978-0-415-90018-8}}</ref>{{Rp|232}} but acknowledged that the film had similarities to such previous works as ''[[49th Parallel (film)|The 49th Parallel]]'' and ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]''. Bazin stated that "even if Welles did not invent the cinematic devices employed in ''Citizen Kane'', one should nevertheless credit him with the invention of their ''meaning''."<ref name=BazinatWork/>{{Rp|233}} Bazin championed the techniques in the film for its depiction of heightened reality, but Bordwell believes that the film's use of special effects contradict some of Bazin's theories.<ref name="Minding">{{cite book |last1=Bordwell |first1=David |last2=Thompson |first2=Kristin |title=Minding Movies.

===Storytelling techniques===
''Citizen Kane'' eschews the traditional linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using different points of view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the [[unreliable narrator]] in literature.<ref name="watched">{{cite book |last=Fabe |first=Marilyn |title=Closely Watched Films: an introduction to the art of narrative film technique |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, CA |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-520-23891-6}}</ref>{{Rp|83}} Welles also dispenses with the idea of a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films.<ref name="watched"/>{{Rp|81}} Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping.<ref name="politics">{{cite book |last=Gianos |first=Phillip |title=Politics and politicians in American film |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=Santa Barbara, California |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-275-96766-6 |pages=170–184}}</ref> The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.<ref name="watched"/>{{Rp|82–84}}

The technique of using flashbacks had been used in earlier films such as ''Wuthering Heights'' in 1939 and ''The Power and the Glory'' in 1933, but no film was as immersed in this technique as ''Citizen Kane''. The use of the reporter Thompson acts as a surrogate for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.<ref name="politics"/>

At that time films typically had an "omniscient perspective", which Marilyn Fabe says give the audience the "illusion that we are looking with impunity into a world which is unaware of our gaze, Hollywood movies give us a feeling of power." The film begins in this fashion up until the "News on the March" sequence, after which we the audience see the film through the perspectives of others.<ref name="watched"/>{{Rp|81}} The "News on the March" sequence gives an overview of Kane's entire life (and the film's entire story) at the beginning of the film, leaving the audience without the typical suspense of wondering how it will end. Instead the film's repetitions of events compels the audience to analyze and wonder why Kane's life happened the way that it did, under the pretext of finding out what "Rosebud" means. The film then returns to the omniscient perspective in the final scene, when only the audience discovers what "Rosebud" is.<ref name="watched"/>{{Rp|82–83}}

===Cinematography===
[[File:Citizen Kane deep focus.jpg|alt=A stern looking man and a woman sit on the right side of a table with documents on the table. A top hat is on the table.

In the background a boy can be seen through a window playing in the snow.|thumb|right|A deep focus shot: everything, including the hat in the foreground and the boy (young Kane) in the distance, is in sharp focus.]]

The most innovative technical aspect of ''Citizen Kane'' is the extended use of [[deep focus]].<ref name="Ogle">{{cite news |last1=Ogle |first1=Patrick L. |last2=Nichols |first2=Bill |authorlink2=Bill Nichols |title=Technological and Aesthetic Influences Upon the Development of Deep Focus Cinematography in the United States |publisher=[[University of California]] Press |date=1985 |page=73}}</ref> In nearly every scene in the film, the foreground, background and everything in between are all in sharp focus. Cinematographer Toland did this through his experimentation with lenses and lighting. Toland described the achievement, made possible by the sensitivity of modern speed film, in an article for ''[[Theatre Arts (magazine)|Theatre Arts]]'' magazine:

<blockquote>New developments in the science of motion picture photography are not abundant at this advanced stage of the game but periodically one is perfected to make this a greater art. Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed “Pan-focus”, as I have been active for two years in its development and used it for the first time in ''Citizen Kane''. Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.<ref name="Wellesnet Toland">{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=178 |last=Toland |first=Gregg |authorlink=Gregg Toland |title=The Motion Picture Cameraman |publisher=''Theatre Arts'', Wellesnet: The Orson Welles Web Resource |date=September 1941 |accessdate=September 21, 2013 |pages=646–654}}</ref></blockquote>

Another unorthodox method used in the film was the way [[low-angle shot]]s were used to display a point of view facing upwards, thus allowing ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes. Breaking with studio convention, every set was built with a ceiling<ref name="Wellesnet Toland"/> — many constructed of fabric that ingeniously concealed microphones.<ref name="Ebert Viewer's Companion">{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/a-viewers-companion-to-citizen-kane |title=A Viewer's Companion to Citizen Kane |last=Ebert |first=Roger |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=January 1, 2004 |website=Roger Ebert's Journal |accessdate=December 1, 2014}}</ref> Welles felt that the camera should show what the eyes see, and that it was a bad theatrical convention to pretend there was no ceiling — "a big lie in order to get all those terrible lights up there," he said. He became fascinated with the look of low angles, which made even dull interiors look interesting. One extremely low angle is used to photograph the encounter between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. A hole was dug for the camera, which required drilling into the concrete floor.<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|61–62}}

Welles credited Toland on the same card as himself and said "It's impossible to say how much I owe to Gregg. He was superb."{{efn|Speaking of the credit given Toland, Welles said, "Nobody in those days&nbsp;– only the stars, the director, and the producer&nbsp;– got separate cards.

===Sound===

''Citizen Kane'''s sound was recorded by Bailey Fesler and re-recorded in post-production by audio engineer [[James G. Stewart]],<ref name="Mulvey"/>{{Rp|85}} both of whom had worked in radio.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|102}} Stewart said that Hollywood films never deviated from a basic pattern of how sound could be recorded or used, but with Welles "deviation from the pattern was possible because he demanded it."<ref name="BBC Complete"/> Although the film is known for its complex soundtrack, much of the audio is heard as it was recorded by Fesler and without manipulation.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|102}}

Welles used techniques from radio like overlapping dialogue. The scene in which characters sing "Oh, Mr. Kane" was especially complicated and required mixing several soundtracks together.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|104}} He also used different "sound perspectives" to create the illusion of distances,<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|101}} such as in scenes at Xanadu where characters speak to each other at far distances.<ref name="BBC Complete"/> Welles experimented with sound in post-production, creating audio montages,<ref name="Schatz">{{cite book |last1=Schatz |first1=Thomas |last2=Harpole |first2=Charles (editor) |title=History of the American Cinema, volume 6: Boom and bust, the American cinema in the 1940s |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London |date=1997 |isbn=0-520-22130-3}}</ref>{{Rp|94}} and chose to create all of the sound effects for the film instead of using RKO's library of sound effects.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|100}}

Welles used an aural technique from radio called the "lightning-mix". Welles used this technique to link complex [[film editing|montage]] sequences via a series of related sounds or phrases. For example, Kane grows from a child into a young man in just two shots. As Thatcher hands eight-year-old Kane a sled and wishes him a Merry Christmas, the sequence suddenly jumps to a shot of Thatcher fifteen years later, completing the sentence he began in both the previous shot and the chronological past. Other radio techniques include using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, such as the projection room scene.<ref name="Cook">{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David A. |title=A History of Narrative Film |publisher=[[W.

Film critic and director [[François Truffaut]] wrote that "Before ''Kane'', nobody in Hollywood knew how to set music properly in movies.

===Make-up===
The make-up for ''Citizen Kane'' was created and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907–1989), a junior member of the RKO make-up department.<ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/>{{Rp|19}} Seiderman's family came to the United States from Russia in 1920, escaping persecution.<ref name="Citizen Seiderman">{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Dick  |authorlink=Dick Smith (make-up artist) |date=October–November 1999 |title=Citizen Seiderman |url=http://mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?i=211197&p=18# |journal=Make-Up Artist Magazine | issue=21 |pages=18–25 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref>{{Rp|18}} As a child Seiderman had won a drawing competition and received an apprenticeship at the [[Moscow Art Theatre]],<ref name="Higham"/>{{Rp|157}} where his father was a wigmaker and make-up artist.<ref name="Gambill">{{cite journal |last=Gambill |first=Norman |date=November–December 1978 |title=Making Up Kane |journal=[[Film Comment]] |volume= 14| issue = 6 |pages=42–48}}</ref>{{Rp|42}} In New York his uncle was a theatrical scenic painter, and he helped Seiderman get into the union.<ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/>{{Rp|18}} He worked on [[Max Reinhardt]]'s 1924 production of ''[[The Miracle (play)|The Miracle]]'' and with the Yiddish Art Theatre,<ref name="Higham"/>{{Rp|157}} and he studied the human figure at the [[Art Students League of New York]].<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|42}} After he moved to Los Angeles he was hired first by [[Max Factor, Sr.|Max Factor]] and then by RKO.<ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/>{{Rp|19}} Seiderman had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors.<ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/>{{Rp|19}}

"Apprentices were not supposed to make up any principals, only extras, and an apprentice could not be on a set without a journeyman present," wrote make-up artist [[Dick Smith (make-up artist)|Dick Smith]], who became friends with Seiderman in 1979. "During his years at RKO I suspect these rules were probably overlooked often."<ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/>{{Rp|19}} By 1940 Seiderman's uncredited film work included ''[[Winterset (film)|Winterset]]'', ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1940 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'' and ''[[Abe Lincoln in Illinois (film)|Abe Lincoln in Illinois]]''.<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|48}} "Seiderman had gained a reputation as one of the most inventive and creatively precise up-and-coming makeup men in Hollywood," wrote biographer Frank Brady.<ref name="Brady"/>{{Rp|253}}

On an early tour of RKO, Welles met Seiderman in the small make-up lab he created for himself in an unused dressing room.<ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/>{{Rp|19}} "Welles fastened on to him at once," wrote biographer Charles Higham. "With his great knowledge of makeup — indeed, his obsession with it, for he hated his flat nose — Welles was fascinated … Seiderman had an intimate knowledge of anatomy and the process of aging and was acquainted with every line, wrinkle and accretion of fat in aging men and women. Impatient with most makeup methods of his era, he used casts of his subjects in order to develop makeup methods that ensured complete naturalness of expression — a naturalness unrivaled in Hollywood."<ref name="Higham"/>{{Rp|157}}

"When ''Kane'' came out in script form, Orson told all of us about the picture and said that the most important aspect was the makeup," Seiderman recalled. "I felt that I was being given an assignment that was unique — so I worked accordingly. And there was a lot of work to do. Straight makeups were done in the makeup department by staff, but all the trick stuff and the principal characters were my personal work; nobody else ever touched them. They could not have handled it."<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|46}}

Seiderman developed a thorough plan for aging the principal characters, first making a plaster cast of the face of each of the actors who aged, except Joseph Cotten who was unavailable at that time. He made a plaster mold of Welles's body down to the hips.<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|46}}

"My sculptural techniques for the characters' aging were handled by adding pieces of white modeling clay, which matched the plaster, onto the surface of each bust," Seiderman told visual arts historian Norman Gambill. When Seiderman achieved the desired effect he cast the clay pieces in a soft plastic material<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|46}} that he formulated himself.<ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/>{{Rp|20}} These appliances were then placed onto the plaster bust and a four-piece mold was made for each phase of aging. The castings were then fully painted and paired with the appropriate wig for evaluation.<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|46–47}}

Before the actors went before the cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied directly to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. Welles was allergic to Max Factor's gum, so Seiderman invented an alternative that also photographed more realistically.<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|46}} The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible red plastic compound;<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|43}} Cotten recalled being instructed to puff out his cheeks during this process. Later, seeing the results in the mirror, Cotten told Seiderman, "I am acting the part of a nice old gentleman, not a relief map of the Rocky Mountains." Seiderman replied, "You'd be surprised at what the camera doesn't see unless we place it within its view. How about some more coffee?"<ref name=Cotten>{{cite book |last=Cotten |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Cotten |title=Vanity Will Get You Somewhere |publisher=[[Mercury House (publishers)|Mercury House]] |location=San Francisco, CA |date=1987 |isbn=978-0-916-51517-1 }}</ref>{{Rp|43}}

The red ground resulted in a warmth of tone that was picked up by the sensitive [[panchromatic film]]. Over that was applied liquid greasepaint, and then finally a colorless translucent talcum.<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|42–43}} Seiderman created the effect of skin pores on Kane's face by stippling the surface with a negative cast he made from an orange peel.<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|42, 47}}

Welles was just as heavily made up as young Kane as he was for old Kane, and he often arrived on the set at 2:30&nbsp;a.m.<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|69}} Application of the sculptural make-up for the oldest incarnation of the character took three-and-a-half hours. The make-up included appliances to age Welles's shoulders, breast and stomach.<ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/>{{Rp|19–20}} "In the film and production photographs, you can see that Kane had a belly that overhung," Seiderman said. "That was not a costume, it was the rubber sculpture that created the image. You could see how Kane's silk shirt clung wetly to the character's body. It could not have been done any other way."<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|46}}

Seiderman worked with Charles Wright on the wigs. These went over a flexible skull cover that Seiderman created and sewed into place with elastic thread. When he found the wigs too full he untied one hair at a time to alter their shape. Kane's mustache was inserted into the makeup surface a few hairs at a time, to realistically vary the color and texture.<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|43, 47}}

Seiderman made [[scleral lens]]es for Welles, Dorothy Comingore, George Coulouris and Everett Sloane, to dull the brightness of their young eyes. The lenses took a long time to fit properly, and Seiderman began work on them before devising any of the other makeup.

"Cotten was the only principal for whom I had not made any sculptural casts, wigs or lenses," Seiderman said. When Cotten's old-age scenes needed to be shot out of sequence due to Welles's injured ankle, Seiderman improvised with appliances made for Kane's make-up. A sun visor was chosen to conceal Cotten's low hairline<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|47–48}} and the lenses he wore — hastily supplied by a Beverly Hills ophthalmologist — were uncomfortable.<ref name=Cotten/>{{Rp|44–45}}

Seiderman's tour de force, the breakfast montage, was shot all in one day. "Twelve years, two years shot at each scene," he said. "Please realize, by the way, that a two-year jump in age is a bit harder to accomplish visually than one of twenty years."<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|47}}

As they did with art direction, the major studios gave screen credit for make-up to only the department head. When RKO make-up department head [[Mel Berns]] refused to share credit with Seiderman, who was only an apprentice, Welles told Berns that there would be no make-up credit. Welles signed a large advertisement in the Los Angeles newspaper:<ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/>{{Rp|22}}<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|48}}

<blockquote>THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO GETS SCREEN CREDIT FOR "CITIZEN KANE"<br>AND THANKS TO THOSE WHO DON'T<br>TO ALL THE ACTORS, THE CREW, THE OFFICE, THE MUSICIANS, EVERYBODY<br>AND PARTICULARLY TO MAURICE SEIDERMAN, THE BEST MAKE-UP MAN IN THE WORLD<ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/>{{Rp|20}}</blockquote>

"To put this event in context, remember that I was a very low man," Seiderman recalled. "I wasn't even called a make-up man. I had started their laboratory and developed their plastic appliances for make-up. But my salary was $25 a week. And I had no union card."<ref name="Gambill"/>{{Rp|48}}

Seiderman told Gambill that after ''Citizen Kane'' was released, Welles was invited to a White House dinner where [[Frances Perkins]] was among the guests.

===Sets===

Although credited as an assistant, the film's art direction was done by [[Perry Ferguson]].<ref name="Mulvey"/>{{Rp|85}} Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|37}} In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, set design and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a [[periscope]] in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design was an integral part of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|42}}

===Special effects===

The film's special effects were supervised by RKO department head [[Vernon L. Walker]].<ref name="Mulvey"/>{{Rp|85}} Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, the scene in which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera [[Crane shot|craning]] upwards over the performance scene, then a [[wipe (transition)|curtain wipe]] to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with the scene of the workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=François |last2=Naremore |first2=James (Editor) |title=Orson Welles's Citizen Kane: A Casebook |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK and New York |date=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzCH4UgSUr8C&pg=PA173 |isbn=978-0-19-515891-5 |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |page=173}}</ref>

Some shots included [[Rear projection effect|rear screen projection]] in the background, such as Thompson's interview of Leland and some of the ocean backgrounds at Xanadu.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|88}} Bordwell claims that the scene where Thatcher agrees to be Kane's guardian used rear screen projection to depict young Kane in the background, despite this scene being cited as a prime example of Toland's deep focus cinematography.<ref name="Minding"/>{{Rp|74}} A special effects camera crew from Walker's department was required for the [[Close-up#Types of close-up|extreme close-up]] shots such as Kane's lips when he says "Rosebud" and the shot of the typewriter typing Susan's bad review.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|88}}

Optical effects artist Dunn claimed that “up to 80 percent of some reels was optically printed.” These shots were traditionally attributed to Toland for years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jewell |first=Richard B. |title=The Golden Age of Cinema. Hollywood 1929-1945 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford, UK |date=2007 |isbn=978-1-405-16373-6}}</ref>{{Rp|110}} The optical printer improved some of the deep focus shots.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|92}} One problem with the optical printer was that it sometimes created excessive [[graininess]], such as the optical zoom out of the snow globe. Welles decided to superimpose snow falling to mask the graininess in these shots.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|94}} Toland said that he disliked the results of the optical printer,<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|92}} but acknowledged that "RKO special effects expert Vernon Walker, ASC, and his staff handled their part of the production — a by no means inconsiderable assignment — with ability and fine understanding."<ref name="Minding"/>{{Rp|74–75}}

Any time deep focus was impossible&nbsp;– as in the scene in which Kane finishes a negative review of Susan's opera while at the same time firing the person who began writing the review&nbsp;– an [[optical printer]] was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|92}} However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of [[in-camera effect]]s, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|82}}

===Music===

The film's music was composed by Bernard Herrmann.<ref name="stephensmith">{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Steven C. |title=A Heart at Fire's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, California |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-520-22939-6}}</ref>{{Rp|72}} Herrmann had composed for Welles for his Mercury Theatre radio broadcasts.<ref name="stephensmith"/>{{Rp|63}} Because it was Herrmann's first motion picture score, RKO wanted to pay him only a small fee, but Welles insisted he be paid at the same rate as [[Max Steiner]].<ref name="stephensmith"/>{{Rp|72}}

The score established Herrmann as an important new composer of film soundtracks<ref name="americancomposers">{{cite web |url=http://www.americancomposers.org/raksin_herrmann.htm |title=American Composers Orchestra&nbsp;– David Raksin remembers his colleagues |publisher=Americancomposers.org |accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> and eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '"radio scoring", musical cues typically 5–15 seconds in length that bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response.<ref name="stephensmith"/>{{Rp|77–78}} The breakfast montage sequence begins with a graceful waltz theme and gets darker with each variation on that theme as the passage of time leads to the hardening of Kane's personality and the breakdown of his first marriage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/CitizenKanefilmscore.htm |title=70th anniversary of Citizen Kane and Bernard Herrmann's film score |accessdate=April 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/citi4.html |last=Dirks |first=Tim |title=Citizen Kane, page 4 |publisher=filmsite.org |accessdate=November 29, 2014}}</ref>

Herrmann realized that musicians slated to play his music were hired for individual unique sessions; there was no need to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring [[leitmotiv]] played by low woodwinds, including a quartet of [[alto flute]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmscorerundowns.net/herrmann/citizenkane.pdf |last=Wrobel |first=Bill |title=Herrmann's "Citizen Kane" |format=PDF |date=November 4, 2001  | accessdate=July 31, 2013|page=2}}</ref>

For Susan Alexander Kane's operatic sequence, Welles suggested that Herrmann compose a witty parody of a [[Mary Garden]] vehicle, an aria from ''[[Salammbô]]''.<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|57}} "Our problem was to create something that would give the audience the feeling of the quicksand into which this simple little girl, having a charming but small voice, is suddenly thrown," Herrmann said.<ref name="stephensmith"/>{{Rp|79}} Writing in the style of a 19th-century French Oriental opera,<ref name="NYT Herrmann"/> Herrmann put the aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes, culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Susan Alexander.<ref name="stephensmith"/>{{Rp|79–80}} Soprano Jean Forward dubbed the vocal part for Comingore.<ref name="americancomposers"/> Houseman claimed to have written the libretto, based on [[Jean Racine]]’s ''[[Athalie]]'' and ''[[Phedre]]'',<ref name="Houseman RT"/>{{Rp|460–461}} although some confusion remains since [[Lucille Fletcher]] remembered preparing the lyrics.<ref name="stephensmith"/>{{Rp|80}} Fletcher, then Herrmann's wife, wrote the libretto for his opera ''[[Wuthering Heights (Herrmann)|Wuthering Heights]]''.<ref name="stephensmith"/>{{Rp|11}}

Music enthusiasts consider the scene in which Susan Alexander Kane attempts to sing the famous cavatina "Una voce poco fa" from ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]] with vocal coach Signor Matiste as especially memorable for depicting the horrors of learning music through mistakes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.concertonet.com/scripts/review.php?ID_review=2748 |last=Kirshnit |first=Frederick L. |title=Champagne and Pomade |publisher=ConcertoNet.com |location=Paris, France |date=December 31, 2004 |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>

In 1972 Herrmann said, "I was fortunate to start my career with a film like ''Citizen Kane'', it's been a downhill run ever since!" Welles loved Herrmann's score and told director [[Henry Jaglom]] that it was 50 percent responsible for the film's artistic success.<ref name="stephensmith"/>{{Rp|84}}

Some incidental music came from other sources. Welles heard the tune used for the publisher's theme, "Oh, Mr. Kane", in Mexico.<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|57}} Called "A Poco No", the song was written by [[Pepe Guízar]] and special lyrics were written by Herman Ruby.<ref name="Herrmann Cues">{{cite web |url=http://folk.uib.no/smkgg/midi/soundtrackweb/herrmann/db/cuesheets/film_citizenkane.html |title=Cue Sheet: Citizen Kane |date=April 22, 1941 |publisher=The Bernard Herrmann Society |accessdate=December 26, 2014}}</ref>

All of the music used in the newsreel came from the RKO music library, edited at Welles's request by the newsreel department to achieve what Herrmann called "their own crazy way of cutting". The ''News on the March'' theme that accompanies the newsreel titles is "Belgian March" by [[Anthony Vincent Collins|Anthony Collins]], from the film ''[[Nurse Edith Cavell]]''. Other examples are an excerpt from [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]'s score for ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' (the exploration of Xanadu), [[Roy Webb]]'s theme for the film ''[[Reno (1939 film)|Reno]]'' (the growth of Kane's empire), and bits of Webb's score for ''[[Five Came Back]]'' (introducing Walter Parks Thatcher).<ref name="stephensmith"/>{{Rp|79}}<ref name="Herrmann Cues"/>

===Editing===

One of the editing techniques used in ''Citizen Kane'' was the use of montage to collapse time and space, using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in five vignettes that condense 16 years of story time into two minutes of screen time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Costanzo Cahir |first=Linda |title=Literature into film: theory and practical approaches |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-7864-2597-6 |pages=59–60}}</ref> Welles said that the idea for the breakfast scene "... was stolen from ''[[The Long Christmas Dinner]]'' of [[Thornton Wilder]] ... a one-act play, which is a long Christmas dinner that takes you through something like 60 years of a family's life."<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|51|date=June 2012}} The film often used long dissolves to signify the passage of time and its psychological effect of the characters, such as the scene where the abandoned sled gets covered with snow after the young Kane is sent away with Thatcher.<ref name="watched"/>{{Rp|90–91}}

Welles was influenced by the editing theories of [[Sergei Eisenstein]] by using jarring cuts that caused "sudden graphic or associative contrasts", such as the cut from Kane's deathbed to the beginning of the "News on the March" sequence and a sudden shot of a shrieking bird at the beginning of Raymond's flashback.<ref name="watched"/>{{Rp|88–89}} Although the film typically favors mise-en-scène over montage, the scene where Kane goes to Susan Alexander's apartment after first meeting her is the only one that is primarily cut as close-ups with shots and counter shots between Kane and Susan.<ref name="Mulvey"/>{{Rp|68}} Fabe says that "by using a standard Hollywood technique sparingly, [Welles] revitalizes its psychological expressiveness."<ref name="watched"/>{{Rp|88}}

==Themes==

===Political themes===
In her 1992 monograph for the [[British Film Institute]], critic Laura Mulvey explored the anti-fascist themes of ''Citizen Kane''. The ''News on the March'' newsreel presents Kane keeping company with Hitler and other dictators while he smugly assures the public there will be no war.<ref name="McBride">{{cite book |last=McBride |first=Joseph |date=2006 |title=What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? A Portrait of an Independent Career |url= |location=Lexington, Kentucky |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |isbn=0-8131-2410-7}}</ref>{{Rp|44}} Mulvey wrote that the film reflects "the battle between intervention and isolationism" then being waged in the United States; the film was released six months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, while President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was laboring to win public opinion for entering World War II. "Not only was the war in Europe the burning public issue of the time," Mulvey wrote, "it was of passionate personal importance to Orson Welles … In the rhetoric of ''Citizen Kane'', the destiny of isolationism is realised in metaphor: in Kane's own fate, dying wealthy and lonely, surrounded by the detritus of European culture and history."<ref name="Mulvey"/>{{Rp|15}}

Journalist [[Ignacio Ramonet]] has cited the film as an early example of [[mass media]] [[Crowd manipulation|manipulation]] of [[public opinion]] and the power that [[media conglomerate]]s have on influencing the democratic process. Ramonet believes that this early example of a media mogul influencing politics is outdated and that "today Citizen Kane would be a dwarf. He owned a few papers in one country.

To ensure that ''Citizen Kane'''s influence from Hearst's life was a secret, Welles limited access to [[dailies]] and managed the film's publicity.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} Publicity materials in the December 1940 issue of ''Stage'' stated the film's inspiration was ''[[Faust]]'',<ref name=empire>{{cite news |last1=Newman |first1=Kim |authorlink1=Kim Newman |last2=Freer |first2=Ian |authorlink2=Ian Freer |last3=Fraser |first3=Rob |title=Citizen Kane |publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' |date=July 2003 |accessdate= |pages=146–156}}</ref> but made no mention of Hearst.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|111}}

The film was scheduled to premiere at RKO's flagship theater Radio City Music Hall on February 14, but in early January 1941 Welles was not finished with post-production work and told RKO that it still needed its musical score.<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|205|December 2014}} Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} for such magazines as ''Life'', ''Look'' and ''Redbook''. Gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] (and Parsons' arch rival) showed up to the screening uninvited. Most of the critics at the preview said that they liked the film and gave it good advanced reviews. Hopper wrote negatively about it, calling the film a “viscous and irresponsible attack on a great man” and criticizing its corny writing and old fashioned photography.<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|205|December 2014}} ''Friday'' magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on Parsons, Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} Up until this Welles had been friendly with Parsons. The magazine quoted Welles as saying that he couldn’t understand why she was so nice to him and that she should “wait until the woman finds out that the picture’s about her boss.” Welles immediately denied making the statement and the editor of ''Friday'' admitted that it may be false. Welles apologized to Parsons and assured her that he had never made that remark.<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|205|December 2014}}

[[File:LouellaParsons.jpg|thumb|right|Film columnist and Hearst employee [[Louella Parsons]] was humiliated by ''Citizen Kane'' and began making numerous threats to prevent the film from being released.]]

Shortly after ''Friday'''s article Hearst sent Parsons an angry letter complaining that he had learned about ''Citizen Kane'' from Hopper and not her. The incident made a fool of Parsons and compelled her to start attacking Welles and the film. 
Parsons demanded a private screening of the film and personally threatened Schaffer on Hearst’s behalf, first with a lawsuit and then with a vague threat of consequences for everyone in Hollywood.

''The Hollywood Reporter'' ran a front-page story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's practice of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs that could be done by Americans.

===Hearst's response===

Hearing about ''Citizen Kane'' enraged Hearst so much that he banned any advertising, reviewing, or mentioning of it in his papers, and had his journalists [[libel]] Welles.<ref name="thomson2001"/> Welles used Hearst's opposition as a pretext for previewing the film in several opinion-making screenings in Los Angeles, lobbying for its artistic worth against the hostile campaign that Hearst was waging.<ref name="thomson2001"/> A special press screening took place in early March. Henry Luce was in attendance and reportedly wanted to buy the film from RKO for $1 million to distribute it himself. The reviews for this screening were positive. A ''Hollywood Review'' headline read, "Mr. Genius Comes Through; 'Kane' Astonishing Picture". The ''Motion Picture Herald'' reported about the screening and Welles's intention to sue RKO. ''Time'' magazine wrote that "The objection of Mr. Hearst, who founded a publishing empire on sensationalism, is ironic. For to most of the several hundred people who have seen the film at private screenings, ''Citizen Kane'' is the most sensational product of the U.S. movie industry." A second press screening occurred in April.<ref name="Schatz"/>{{Rp|94}}

When Schaefer rejected Hearst's offer to suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] from reviewing&nbsp;– or even mentioning&nbsp;– the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire.<ref name="Street, Sarah 1996">{{cite news |last=Street |first=Sarah |title=Citizen Kane |publisher=''History Today'' |date=March 1996}}</ref> The Oscar-nominated documentary ''[[The Battle Over Citizen Kane]]'' lays the blame for the film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations.<ref name="PBS"/> Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason ''Kane'' failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message at the heart of the film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.<ref name="Nasaw">{{cite book |last=Nasaw |first=David |authorlink=David Nasaw |title=The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |location=Boston,MA |date=2000 |isbn=0-395-82759-0}}</ref>{{Rp|572–573|date=April 2012}}

Hearst's attacks against Welles went beyond attempting to suppress the film. Welles said that while he was on his post-filming lecture tour a police detective approached him at a restaurant and advised him not to go back to his hotel. A 14-year-old girl had reportedly been hidden in the closet of his room, and two photographers were waiting for him to walk in. Knowing he would be jailed after the resulting publicity, Welles did not return to the hotel but waited until the train left town the following morning. "But that wasn't Hearst," Welles said, "that was a hatchet man from the local Hearst paper who thought he would advance himself by doing it."<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|85–86}}

In March 1941 Welles directed a Broadway version of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s ''[[Native Son]]'' (and, for luck, used a "Rosebud" sled as a prop). ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' received positive reviews, but Hearst-owned papers used the opportunity to attack Welles as a communist.<ref name="Leaming OW"/>{{Rp|213|December 2014}} The Hearst papers vociferously attacked Welles after his April 1941 radio play, "His Honor, the Mayor", produced for The Free Company radio series on CBS.<ref name="Bret Wood">{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Bret  |authorlink=Bret Wood |title=Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |date=1990 |isbn=0-313-26538-0}}</ref>{{Rp|113}}<ref name="Wellesnet His Honor">{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=186 |title=Orson Welles defends American civil liberties in His Honor the Mayor |publisher=Wellesnet.com |date=August 4, 2007 |accessdate=December 26, 2014}}</ref>

Welles described his chance encounter with Hearst in an elevator at the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]] on the night ''Citizen Kane'' opened in San Francisco. Hearst and Welles's father were acquaintances, so Welles introduced himself and asked Hearst if he would like to come to the opening. Hearst did not respond.

That was his style — just as he finished Jed Leland's bad review of Susan as an opera singer."<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|49–50}}

In 1945 Hearst journalist Robert Shaw wrote that the film got "a full tide of insensate fury" from Hearst papers, "then it ebbed suddenly.

The day following the premiere of ''Citizen Kane,'' ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote that "... it comes close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood."

<blockquote>Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't do things by halves. ... Upon the screen he discovered an area large enough for his expansive whims to have free play.

==Legacy==

''Citizen Kane'' marked a decline in Welles's success. Author Joseph McBride said the problems in making the film caused damage to his career. This started in 1942 when RKO violated its contract with Welles by re-editing ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' against his will.<ref name=empire/> That June, Schaefer resigned from RKO and Welles's contract was promptly terminated.<ref name="Wellesnet Memos"/>

Welles himself has been retroactively compared to Charles Foster Kane. Wise believed that Kane resembled Welles's life story more than Hearst's and said "Orson was doing an autobiographical film and didn't realize it, because it's rather much the same, you know. You start here, and you have a big rise and tremendous prominence and fame and success and whatnot, and then tail off and tail off and tail off. And at least the arc of the two lives were very much the same."<ref name="PBS"/> Bogdanovich disagreed with this and said that Kane "had none of the qualities of an artist, Orson had all the qualities of an artist." Bogdanovich also noted that Welles was never bitter "about all the bad things that happened to him" and enjoyed life in his final years.<ref>{{cite video |last=Welles |first=Orson |title=Citizen Kane, ''Peter Bogdanovich audio commentary'' |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Home Video |date=2001}}</ref>

The 1999 [[HBO]] [[Television film|film]] ''[[RKO 281]]'' depicted the making of the film and Hearst's attempts to prevent its release. It was based on the documentary ''The Battle over Citizen Kane'', but differed from its source by "downplaying [Mankiewicz's] role in bringing the idea of a Hearst-based movie"<ref>{{cite news |last=Fries |first=Laura |title=Review: ‘RKO 281’ |publisher=''Variety'' |url=http://variety.com/1999/tv/reviews/rko-281-1200459734/ |date=November 14, 1999 |accessdate=December 10, 2014}}</ref> and inventing such historically inaccurate incidents as Welles visiting Hearst Castle and meeting Hearst before writing the film's script.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nitrateonline.com/1999/rrko281.html |last=Axmaker |first=Sean |title=RKO 281 |publisher=Nitrate Productions, Inc. |date=November 19, 1999 |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>

===Re-evaluation===

By 1942 ''Citizen Kane'' had run its course theatrically and, apart from a few showings at big city arthouse cinemas, it largely vanished and both the film's and Welles's reputation fell among American critics. In 1949 critic Richard Griffith in his overview of cinema, ''The Film Till Now'', dismissed ''Citizen Kane'' as "... tinpot if not crackpot [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]."<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|117–118|date=April 2012}}

''Citizen Kane'' was re-released in 1952 after gaining popularity on TV. A journalist from the ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|London Evening News]]'' wrote that after seeing the film for the first time he “came away marveling.”<ref name="Howard"/>{{Rp|49}}

In the United States, it was neglected and forgotten until its revival on television in the mid-1950s. Three key events in 1956 led to its re-evaluation in the United States: first, RKO was one of the first studios to sell its library to television, and early that year ''Citizen Kane'' started to appear on television; second, the film was re-released theatrically to coincide with Welles's return to the New York stage, where he played ''[[King Lear]]''; and third, American film critic Andrew Sarris wrote "Citizen Kane: The American Baroque" for ''[[Film Culture]]'', and described it as "the great American film" and "the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since ''[[Birth of a Nation]]''."<ref name="Sarris">{{cite news |last=Sarris |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sarris |title=Citizen Kane: The American Baroque |publisher=''[[Film Culture]]'', number 9 |year=1956 |accessdate=}}</ref> Carringer considers Sarris's essay as the most important influence on the film's reputation in the US.<ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/>{{Rp|119}}

During [[Expo 58]], a poll of over 100 film historians named ''Kane'' one of the top ten greatest films ever made (the group gave first-place honors to ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''). When a group of young film directors announced their vote for the top six, they were booed for not including the film.<ref name=empire/>

The cinematography influenced [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. Cinematographer [[Arthur Edeson]] used a wider-angle lens than Toland and the film includes many long takes, low angles and shots of the ceiling, but it did not use deep focus shots on large sets to the extent that ''Citizen Kane'' did.

Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced [[Warren Beatty]]'s ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews.

===Colorization controversy===

In the 1980s, ''Citizen Kane'' became a catalyst in the controversy over the [[film colorization|colorization]] of [[black-and-white]] films. One proponent of film colorization was [[Ted Turner]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/movies/council-opposes-coloring-old-films.html |last=Molotsky |first=Irwin |title=Council Opposes Coloring Old Films |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=November 4, 1986 |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}</ref> whose Turner Entertainment Company owned the RKO library.<ref>{{cite news |title=TBS acquires rights to RKO film and television library |publisher=''[[Business Wire]]'' |date=December 9, 1987}}</ref> A Turner Entertainment spokesperson initially stated that ''Citizen Kane'' would not be colorized,<ref>{{cite news |last=O'Toole |first=Lawrence |title=No computer coloring for 'Kane' |publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' |date=December 18, 1987}}</ref> but in July 1988 Turner said, "''Citizen Kane?'' I'm thinking of colorizing it."<ref>{{cite news |last=Bawden |first=James |title=Colorful Turner sees ''Citizen Kane'' in a different light |publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' |date=July 28, 1988}}</ref> In early 1989 it was reported that two companies were producing color tests for Turner Entertainment. Criticism increased when filmmaker Henry Jaglom stated that shortly before his death Welles had implored him "don't let Ted Turner deface my movie with his crayons."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Turner-Says-It-s-Testing-To-Colorize-Citizen-Kane-/id-4c23402df90437fb0816882f7e22ff27 |title=Turner Says It's Testing To Colorize 'Citizen Kane' |publisher=''Associated Press'' |date=January 30, 1989 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>

In February 1989 Turner Entertainment president Roger Mayer announced that work to colorize the film had been stopped due to provisions in Welles's 1939 contract with RKO that "could be read to prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/We-ll-Never-Know-If-Rosebud-Was-Red/id-3da27b3969212eb7885db3dbd81b597e |last=Antczyk |first=John |title=We'll Never Know If Rosebud Was Red |publisher=''Associated Press'' |date=February 14, 1989 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref> Mayer added that Welles's contract was "quite unusual" and "other contracts we have checked out are not like this at all."<ref>{{cite news |title=Turner won't colorize 'Kane' |publisher=''[[United Press International]]'' |date=February 14, 1989 |accessdate=}}</ref> Turner had only colorized the final [[Reel#Motion picture terminology|reel]] of the film before abandoning the project. In 1991 one minute of the colorized test footage was included in the BBC ''[[Arena (TV series)|Arena]]'' documentary ''The Complete Citizen Kane''.{{efn| The colorized ''Citizen Kane'' footage appears at approximately 1:17:00.}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/the-complete-citizen-kane-is-now-online/ |title=The Complete Citizen Kane’ documentary is now online |publisher=Wellesnet |date=May 13, 2013 |accessdate=January 1, 2015}}</ref>

The colorization controversy was a factor in the passage of the [[National Film Preservation Act]] in 1988 which created the National Film Registry the following year. [[ABC News]] anchor [[Peter Jennings]] reported that "one major reason for doing this is to require people like the broadcaster Ted Turner, who's been adding color to some movies and re-editing others for television, to put notices on those versions saying that the movies have been altered".<ref>{{cite news |last=Jennings |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Jennings |title=[[ABC World News|World News Tonight]] |publisher=''[[ABC News]]'' Transcripts, ''[[American Broadcasting Company]]'' |date=September 19, 1989 |accessdate=}}</ref>
