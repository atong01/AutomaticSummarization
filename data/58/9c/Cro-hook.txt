The '''cro-hook''', is a special double-ended [[crochet hook]] used to make double-sided [[crochet]]. 
It employs the use of a long double-ended hook, which permits the maker to work stitches on or off from either end.<ref name="BrittainManthey2011">{{cite book|last1=Brittain|first1=Susan|last2=Manthey|first2=Karen|title=Crocheting For Dummies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2GVj4hg7um0C&pg=SA21-PA7|date=8 March 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-05334-8|page=21}}</ref> Because the hook has two ends, two alternating colors of thread can be used simultaneously and freely interchanged, working loops over the hook.<ref name="BrittainManthey2011"/><ref name="Milne2011">{{cite book|last=Milne|first=Stephanie J.|title=Handmade Style Crochet|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q9ffROIf2W4C&pg=PT10|year=2011|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-1-74266-598-6|page=10}}</ref> Crafts using a double-ended hook are commercially marketed as Cro-hook and Crochenit. Cro-hook is a variation of [[Tunisian crochet]] and also shows similarities with the Afghan stitch used to make Afghan scarves, but the fabric is typically softer with greater elasticity.<ref name="Sims2000">{{cite book|last=Sims|first=Darla|title=Crocheting for Fun and Profit|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=e29eKfYEh_IC|year=2000|publisher=Prima Pub.|isbn=978-0-7615-2161-7|page=18}}</ref><ref name="BrittainManthey2011"/>
