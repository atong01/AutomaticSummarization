These American clippers were larger vessels designed to sacrifice cargo capacity for speed. They had a bow lengthened above the water, a drawing out and sharpening of the forward body, and the greatest breadth further aft. Extreme clippers were built in the period 1845 to 1855. From 1851 or earlier another type of clipper ship was also being built in American shipyards, the<space/><link><target>medium clipper</target></link>. The medium clipper, though still very fast, had comparatively more allowance for cargo. After 1854 extreme clippers were replaced in American shipbuilding yards by medium clippers.<extension extension_name='ref' name="clark"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The Flying Cloud was a clipper ship that set the world's sailing record for the fastest passage between New York and San Francisco, 89 days 8 hours.

Earlier British clipper ships had become known as extreme clippers, and were considered to be &quot;as sharp as the American&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="index"></extension><space/>built ships. From 1859 a new design was developed for British clipper ships that was nothing like the American clippers. These ships built from 1859 continued to be called extreme clippers. The new design had a sleek graceful appearance, less sheer, less freeboard, lower bulwarks, and smaller breadth. They were built for the China tea trade and began with<space/><italics>Falcon</italics><space/>in 1859, and finished with the last ships built in 1870. It is estimated that 25 to 30 of these ships were built, and no more than 45 per year. The earlier ships were made from wood, though some were made from iron, just as some British clippers had been made from iron prior to 1859. In 1863 the first tea clippers of composite construction were brought out, combining the best of both worlds. Composite clippers had the strength of iron spars with wooden hulls, and<space/><link><target>copper sheathing</target></link><space/>could be added to prevent the fouling that occurred on iron hulls.<extension extension_name='ref' name="clark"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>After 1869 with the opening of the<space/><link><target>Suez Canal</target></link><space/>that allowed competition with steam vessels, the tea trade then collapsed for clippers. From 1870 the clipper trade increasingly focused on trade and the carrying of immigrants between England and Australia and New Zealand, a trade that had begun earlier with the Australian Gold Rush in the 1850s. British-built clipper ships were used for this trade, as were many American-built ships which were sold to British owners. Even in the 1880s, sailing ships were still the main carriers of cargoes to and from Australia and New Zealand. Eventually, however, even this trade became unprofitable, and the aging clipper fleet became unseaworthy.<extension extension_name='ref' name="clark"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>China clippers and the apogee of sail<template><target>anchor</target><arg>Opium_clipper</arg><arg>Tea_clipper</arg><arg>China clipper</arg></template></heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Buttersworth - flying cloud.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>''The Clipper Ship &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; off the Needles, Isle of Wight'', by<space/><link><target>James E.

The<space/><link><target>East India Company</target></link><space/>began to manufacture a product that was desired by the Chinese as much as tea was by the British: opium.

There is a limit to the use of steam, and it is reached when the distance to be travelled makes the cost of coal and the space it occupies greater than the value of the cargo will warrant.

Until some new motive power replaces steam, or steam is replaced by the use of petroleum or other concentrated fuel, the clipper still has an occupation, and the hearts of all old-time skippers will be gladdened by the sight of her white wings upon the seas.”

Most clipper cards were printed in the 1850s and 1860s, and represented the first pronounced use of color in American advertising art.</paragraph><paragraph>Relatively few (perhaps 3,500) cards survive today. With their stunning appearance, rarity, and importance as artifacts of nautical, Western, and printing history, clipper cards are highly prized by both private collectors and institutions.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.americanantiquarian.org/clippershipcards.htm
