The first pharmaceutical amphetamine was [[Benzedrine]], a brand of inhalers used to treat a variety of conditions.  Currently, pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, [[Adderall]],{{#tag:ref|"Adderall" is a [[brand name]] as opposed to a nonproprietary name; because the latter ("''dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine aspartate''"<ref name="NDCD">{{cite web | title = National Drug Code Amphetamine Search Results | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/results.cfm?beginrow=1&numberperpage=160&searchfield=amphetamine&searchtype=ActiveIngredient&OrderBy=ProprietaryName | work = National Drug Code Directory|publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration | accessdate = 16 December 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131216080856/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/results.cfm?beginrow=1&numberperpage=160&searchfield=amphetamine&searchtype=ActiveIngredient&OrderBy=ProprietaryName | archivedate = 7 February 2014}}</ref>) is excessively long, this article exclusively refers to this amphetamine mixture by the brand name.|name="Adderall"| group="note"}} dextroamphetamine, or the inactive [[prodrug]] [[lisdexamfetamine]]. Amphetamine, through activation of a [[TAAR1|trace amine receptor]], increases [[biogenic amine]] and [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory neurotransmitter]] activity in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the [[catecholamine]] neurotransmitters [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]. At therapeutic doses, this causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in [[libido]], increased [[wakefulness]], and improved [[cognitive control]]. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength.{{#tag:ref|<ref name="Adderall IR" /><ref name="Amph Uses" /><ref name="Malenka_2009" /><ref name="Ergogenics" /><ref name="Benzedrine" /><ref name="Libido" /><ref name="FDA Effects" /><ref name="Miller" />|group="sources"}}

Much larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. [[Addiction|Drug addiction]] is a serious risk with large recreational doses, but rarely arises from medical use. Very high doses can result in [[Stimulant psychosis#Amphetamines|psychosis]] (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.{{#tag:ref|<ref name="Malenka_2009" /><ref name="FDA Abuse & OD" /><ref name="Westfall" /><ref name="Cochrane" /><ref name="Stimulant Misuse" /><ref name="Addiction risk" /><ref name="EncycOfPsychopharm" />|group="sources"}}

Amphetamine belongs to the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine class]]. It is also the parent compound of its own structural class, the [[substituted amphetamine]]s,{{#tag:ref|Due to confusion that may arise from use of the plural form, this article will only use the terms "amphetamine" and "amphetamines" to refer to racemic amphetamine, levoamphetamine, and dextroamphetamine and reserve the term "substituted amphetamines" for the class.|group="note"}} which includes prominent substances such as [[bupropion]], [[cathinone]], [[MDMA]] (ecstasy), and [[methamphetamine]]. As a member of the phenethylamine class, amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring [[trace amine]] neuromodulators, specifically [[phenethylamine]]{{#tag:ref|Again, due to confusion that may arise from use of the plural form, this article will only use "phenethylamine" and "phenethylamines" to refer to the compound itself and reserve the term "substituted phenethylamines" for the class.|group="note"}} and {{nowrap|[[N-methylphenethylamine|''N''-methylphenethylamine]]}}, both of which are produced within the human body. Phenethylamine is the parent compound of amphetamine, while {{nowrap|''N''-methylphenethylamine}} is a [[constitutional isomer]] that differs only in the placement of the methyl group.{{#tag:ref|<ref name="Trace Amines" /><ref name="EMC">{{cite web | title = Amphetamine | url = http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/amphetamine | work = European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}</ref>|group="sources"}}

In 2015, a [[systematic review]] and a [[meta-analysis]] of high quality [[clinical trial]]s found that, when used at low (therapeutic) doses, amphetamine produces unambiguous improvements in cognition, including [[working memory]], [[episodic memory]], and [[inhibitory control test|inhibitory control]], in normal healthy adults;<ref name="Unambiguous PFC D1 A2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer RC, Devilbiss DM, Berridge CW | title = The Cognition-Enhancing Effects of Psychostimulants Involve Direct Action in the Prefrontal Cortex | journal = Biol.

Surprisingly, despite nearly 80 years of clinical use, the neurobiology of the procognitive actions of psychostimulants has only recently been systematically investigated. Findings from this research unambiguously demonstrate that the cognition-enhancing effects of psychostimulants involve the preferential elevation of catecholamines in the PFC and the subsequent activation of norepinephrine α2 and dopamine D1 receptors.&nbsp;... This differential modulation of PFC-dependent processes across dose appears to be associated with the differential involvement of noradrenergic α2 versus α1 receptors. Collectively, this evidence indicates that at low, clinically relevant doses, psychostimulants are devoid of the behavioral and neurochemical actions that define this class of drugs and instead act largely as cognitive enhancers (improving PFC-dependent function). This information has potentially important clinical implications as well as relevance for public health policy regarding the widespread clinical use of psychostimulants and for the development of novel pharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and other conditions associated with PFC dysregulation.}}</ref><ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilieva IP, Hook CJ, Farah MJ | title = Prescription Stimulants' Effects on Healthy Inhibitory Control, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory: A Meta-analysis | journal = J.

Studies with juvenile rats have also indicated that repeated exposure to methylphenidate does not necessarily lead to enhanced drug-seeking behavior in adulthood (38). However, the recent increase of methylphenidate use as a cognitive enhancer by the general public has again raised concerns because of its potential for abuse and addiction (3, 6–10).

[[ΔJunD]], a transcription factor, and [[EHMT2|G9a]], a [[histone methyltransferase]] enzyme, both directly oppose the induction of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens (i.e., they oppose increases in its expression).<ref name="Cellular basis" /><ref name="Nestler" /><ref name="Nestler 2014 epigenetics">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nestler EJ | title = Epigenetic mechanisms of drug addiction | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 76 Pt B | issue = | pages = 259–268 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 23643695 | pmc = 3766384 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.04.004 | quote = <!-- Short-term increases in histone acetylation generally promote behavioral responses to the drugs, while sustained increases oppose cocaine’s effects, based on the actions of systemic or intra-NAc administration of HDAC inhibitors.&nbsp;...  Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of ΔFosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while ΔFosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine’s behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation. -->}}</ref> Sufficiently overexpressing ΔJunD in the nucleus accumbens with [[viral vector]]s can completely block many of the neural and behavioral alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ΔFosB).<ref name="Nestler" /> ΔFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to [[natural reward]]s, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise.<ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /><ref name="Nestler" /><ref name="ΔFosB reward">{{cite journal | author = Blum K, Werner T, Carnes S, Carnes P, Bowirrat A, Giordano J, Oscar-Berman M, Gold M | title = Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll: hypothesizing common mesolimbic activation as a function of reward gene polymorphisms | journal = J.

====Dopamine====

In certain brain regions, amphetamine increases the concentration of dopamine in the [[synaptic cleft]].<ref name="Miller" /> Amphetamine can enter the [[presynaptic neuron]] either through {{abbr|DAT|dopamine transporter}} or by diffusing across the neuronal membrane directly.<ref name="Miller" /> As a consequence of DAT uptake, amphetamine produces competitive reuptake inhibition at the transporter.<ref name="Miller" /> Upon entering the presynaptic neuron, amphetamine activates {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} which, through [[protein kinase A]] (PKA) and [[protein kinase C]] (PKC) signaling, causes DAT [[phosphorylation]].<ref name="Miller" /> Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT [[endocytosis|internalization]] ({{nowrap|non-competitive}} reuptake inhibition), but {{nowrap|PKC-mediated}} phosphorylation alone induces reverse transporter function (dopamine [[wikt:efflux|efflux]]).<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="TAAR1 Review">{{cite journal | author = Maguire JJ, Parker WA, Foord SM, Bonner TI, Neubig RR, Davenport AP | title = International Union of Pharmacology.

Amphetamine is also a substrate for the presynaptic vesicular monoamine transporter, {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}}.<ref name="E Weihe" /> Following amphetamine uptake at VMAT2, the [[synaptic vesicle]] releases dopamine molecules into the [[cytosol]] in exchange.<ref name="E Weihe" /> Subsequently, the cytosolic dopamine molecules exit the presynaptic neuron via reverse transport at {{abbr|DAT|dopamine transporter}}.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="E Weihe" />

====Norepinephrine====

Similar to dopamine, amphetamine dose-dependently increases the level of synaptic norepinephrine, the direct precursor of [[epinephrine]].<ref name="Trace Amines" /><ref name="cognition enhancers" /> Based upon neuronal {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} {{abbr|mRNA|messenger RNA}} expression, amphetamine is thought to affect norepinephrine analogously to dopamine.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="E Weihe" /><ref name="TAAR1 Review" /> In other words, amphetamine induces TAAR1-mediated efflux and {{nowrap|non-competitive}} reuptake inhibition at phosphorylated {{abbr|NET|norepinephrine transporter}}, competitive NET reuptake inhibition, and norepinephrine release from {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}}.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="E Weihe" />

====Serotonin====

Amphetamine exerts analogous, yet less pronounced, effects on serotonin as on dopamine and norepinephrine.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="cognition enhancers" /> Amphetamine affects serotonin via {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}} and, like norepinephrine, is thought to phosphorylate {{abbr|SERT|serotonin transporter}} via {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}}.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="E Weihe" />  Like dopamine, amphetamine has low, micromolar affinity at the human [[5-HT1A receptor]].<ref name="5HT1A secondary">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Amphetamine | url=http://www.t3db.ca/toxins/T3D2706 | website=T3DB | publisher=University of Alberta | accessdate=24 February 2015 | section=Targets}}</ref><ref name="5HT1A Primary">{{cite journal | vauthors = Toll L, Berzetei-Gurske IP, Polgar WE, Brandt SR, Adapa ID, Rodriguez L, Schwartz RW, Haggart D, O'Brien A, White A, Kennedy JM, Craymer K, Farrington L, Auh JS | title = Standard binding and functional assays related to medications development division testing for potential cocaine and opiate narcotic treatment medications | journal = NIDA Res.

====Other neurotransmitters and peptides====

Amphetamine has no direct effect on [[acetylcholine]] neurotransmission, but several studies have noted that acetylcholine release increases after its use.<ref name="Acetylcholine" /><ref name="MEDRS-Cholinergic" /> In lab animals, amphetamine increases acetylcholine levels in certain brain regions as a downstream effect.<ref name="Acetylcholine" />  In humans, a similar phenomenon occurs via the [[ghrelin]]-mediated [[cholinergic–dopaminergic reward link]] in the [[ventral tegmental area]].<ref name="MEDRS-Cholinergic" /> Acute amphetamine administration in humans also increases [[endogenous opioid]] release in several brain structures in the [[reward system]].<ref name="Opioids" /><ref name="Opioids cited primary source" />

Extracellular levels of [[glutamate]], the primary [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory neurotransmitter]] in the brain, have been shown to increase upon exposure to amphetamine.<ref name="Glutamate-dopamine cotransmission review" /><ref name="glutamate1" />  This [[cotransmission]] effect was found in the mesolimbic pathway, an area of the brain implicated in reward, where amphetamine is known to affect dopamine neurotransmission.<ref name="Glutamate-dopamine cotransmission review" /><ref name="glutamate1" />  Amphetamine also induces the selective release of [[histamine]] from vesicles in {{abbr|CNS|central nervous system}} [[mast cell]]s and efflux from histaminergic neurons through {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}}.<ref name="E Weihe" />

Since the first preparation was reported in 1887,<ref name="Vermont"/> numerous synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed.<ref name="Allen_Ely_2009">{{cite journal | url = http://www.nwafs.org/newsletters/2011_Spring.pdf | title = Review: Synthetic Methods for Amphetamine | author = Allen A, Ely R | format = PDF | work = | publisher = Northwest Association of Forensic Scientists | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | date = April 2009 | pages = 15–25 | journal = Crime Scene | accessdate = 6 December 2014}}</ref><ref name="Allen_Cantrell_1989">{{cite journal | author = Allen A, Cantrell TS | title = Synthetic reductions in clandestine amphetamine and methamphetamine laboratories: A review | journal = Forensic Science International | date = August 1989 | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–199 | doi = 10.1016/0379-0738(89)90086-8 }}</ref>  The most common route of both legal and illicit amphetamine synthesis employs a non-metal reduction known as the [[Leuckart reaction]] (method 1).<ref name="EMC"/><ref name="Amph Synth" />  In the first step, a reaction between phenylacetone and [[formamide]], either using additional [[formic acid]] or formamide itself as a reducing agent, yields {{nowrap|[[N-formylamphetamine|''N''-formylamphetamine]]}}.  This intermediate is then hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid, and subsequently basified, extracted with organic solvent, concentrated, and distilled to yield the free base. The free base is then dissolved in an organic solvent, sulfuric acid added, and amphetamine precipitates out as the sulfate salt.<ref name="Amph Synth" /><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jo01145a001 | title = The Mechanism of the Leuckart Reaction |date=May 1951 | author = Pollard CB, Young DC | journal = J.

A number of [[chiral resolution]]s have been developed to separate the two enantiomers of amphetamine.<ref name = "Allen_Ely_2009"/> For example, racemic amphetamine can be treated with {{nowrap|d-[[tartaric acid]]}} to form a [[diastereoisomer]]ic salt which is [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractionally]] crystallized to yield dextroamphetamine.<ref name = "US2276508">{{ cite patent  | country = US  | number = 2276508  | status = patent  | title = Method for the separation of optically active alpha-methylphenethylamine  | pubdate = 17 March 1942  | fdate = 3 November 1939  | pridate = 3 November 1939  | inventor = Nabenhauer FP  | assign1 = Smith Kline French }}</ref> Chiral resolution remains the most economical method for obtaining optically pure amphetamine on a large scale.<ref name = "Gray_2007"/> In addition, several [[enantioselective synthesis|enantioselective]] syntheses of amphetamine have been developed. In one example, [[optically pure]] {{nowrap|(''R'')-1-phenyl-ethanamine}} is condensed with phenylacetone to yield a chiral [[Schiff base]].  In the key step, this intermediate is reduced by [[catalytic hydrogenation]] with a transfer of chirality to the carbon atom alpha to the amino group.

A large number of alternative synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed based on classic organic reactions.<ref name="Allen_Ely_2009"/><ref name="Allen_Cantrell_1989"/> One example is the [[Friedel–Crafts reaction#Friedel–Crafts alkylation|Friedel–Crafts]] alkylation of [[chlorobenzene]] by [[allyl chloride]] to yield beta chloropropylbenzene which is then reacted with ammonia to produce racemic amphetamine (method 2).<ref name="pmid20985610">{{cite journal | author = Patrick TM, McBee ET, Hass HB | title = Synthesis of arylpropylamines; from allyl chloride | journal = J.

A significant number of amphetamine syntheses feature a [[Organic redox reaction#Organic reductions|reduction]] of a [[nitro group|nitro]], [[imine]], [[oxime]] or other nitrogen-containing [[functional group]]s.<ref name = "Allen_Cantrell_1989"/>  In one such example, a [[Knoevenagel condensation]] of [[benzaldehyde]] with [[nitroethane]] yields {{nowrap|[[phenyl-2-nitropropene]]}}.

===Pharmaceutical products===

Two currently prescribed amphetamine formulations that contain both enantiomers are Adderall and Evekeo, the latter of which is racemic amphetamine sulfate.<ref name="Amph Uses" /><ref name="Evekeo" /><ref name="Racemic amph - FDA Evekeo status" /> Amphetamine is also prescribed in [[Enantiopure drug|enantiopure]] and [[prodrug]] form as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine respectively.<ref name="NDCD" /><ref name="Vyvanse" /> Lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from amphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine.<ref name="Vyvanse" /> The free base of racemic amphetamine was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine.<ref name="Amph Uses" /> Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril.<ref name="Amph Uses" /> All current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base.<ref name="Amph Uses" /><ref name="NDCD" /><ref name="EMC" /> Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below.
