The Serbian government was fairly well informed of Black Hand activities.Friendly relations had fairly well cooled by 1914. The Black Hand was displeased with Prime Minister<space/><link><target>Nikola Pai</target></link>. They thought he did not act aggressively enough towards the Pan-Serb cause. They engaged in a bitter power struggle over several issues, such as who would control territories Serbia annexed in the<space/><link><target>Balkan Wars</target></link>. By this point, disagreeing with the Black Hand was dangerous, as political murder was one of their tools.</paragraph><paragraph>It was also in 1914 that Apis allegedly decided that Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir-apparent of Austria, should be assassinated. Towards that end it is claimed that three young Bosnian Serbs were recruited to kill the Archduke. They were definitely trained in bomb throwing and marksmanship by current and former members of the Serbian military.<space/><link><target>Gavrilo Princip</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Nedeljko abrinovi</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Trifko Grabe</target></link><space/>were smuggled across the border back into Bosnia via a chain of<space/><link><target>Underground Railroad</target><part>underground-railroad</part></link><space/>style contacts.The decision to kill the Archduke was apparently initiated by Apis, and not sanctioned by the full Executive Committee (assuming Apis was involved at all, a question that remains in dispute<extension extension_name='ref'>Vladimer Dedijer,<space/><italics>The Road to Sarajevo</italics></extension>). Those involved probably realized that their plot would result in war between Austria and Serbia, and had every reason to expect that Russia would side with Serbia. They likely did not, however, anticipate that the assassination would start a chain of events leading to world war.Others in the government and some of the Black Hand Executive Council were not as confident of Russian aid. Russia had let them down recently. When word of the plot allegedly percolated through Black Hand leadership and the Serbian government (the Prime Minister Pai was definitely informed of two armed men being smuggled across the border; it is not clear if Pai knew the planned assassination), Apis was supposedly told not to proceed. He may have made a half-hearted attempt to intercept the young assassins at the border, but they had already crossed. Other sources say the attempted 'recall' was only begun after the assassins had reached Sarajevo. This 'recall' appears to make Apis look like a loose cannon, and the young assassins as independent zealots. In fact, the 'recall' took place a full two weeks before the Archduke's visit. The assassins idled around in<space/><link><target>Sarajevo</target></link><space/>for a month. Nothing more was done to stop them.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</arg></template><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">March 2015</arg></template>The<space/><link><target>Young Bosnia</target></link><space/>organization carried out the<space/><link><target>Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</target><part>assassination</part></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</target><part>Archduke Franz Ferdinand</part></link>.

Until a few weeks later, the guilt for the crime had settled loosely on Serbia in general. Long-existing tensions between Serbia and Austria-Hungary eventually drew in the other European powers and escalated into the beginning of First World War. The Serbians prevented Austria-Hungary from investigating in the assassination of the Archduke.</paragraph><heading level='2'>World War I</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Serbian Campaign (World War I)</arg></template></paragraph><preblock><preline><link><target>File:Apis and two Black Hand associates.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part><link><target>Dragutin Dimitrijevi</target></link><space/>&quot;Apis&quot; (right) and his associates.</part></link></preline></preblock><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">March 2015</arg></template>Just prior to World War I, under the orders of the Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence, Serbian Military Officers and remnants of the by then moribund Black Hand organized and facilitated the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria on occasion of his visit to Sarajevo, Bosnia. The Austro-Hungarian investigation of the assassination rounded up all but one of the assassins and also much of the underground railroad that had been used to transport the assassins and their weapons from Serbia to Sarajevo. Within two days following the assassination, Austria-Hungary and Germany advised Serbia that they should open an investigation, but Serbian Foreign Minister Gruic, speaking for Serbia replied, &quot;Nothing had been done so far, and the matter did not concern the Serbian Government,&quot; after which &quot;high words&quot; were spoken on both sides. Entreaties by Germany asking Russia to intercede with Serbia were ignored. On 23 July Austria-Hungary delivered a toughly worded letter to Serbia with ten enumerated demands and additional demands in the preamble aimed at the destruction of the anti-Austrian terrorist and propaganda network in Serbia. Austria called attention to Serbia's March 1909 declaration committing to the Great Powers to respect Austria-Hungary's sovereignty over Bosnia-Herzegovina and committing Serbia to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. If the ten enumerated demands and demands in the preamble were not agreed to within 48 hours, Austria-Hungary would recall its ambassador from Serbia. The letter became known as the July Ultimatum. Serbia accepted all but one of the demands, to let the Austrian officers conduct an investigation on Serbian soil, which would have compromised its sovereignty. In response, Austria-Hungary recalled its ambassador.</paragraph><paragraph>Austria-Hungary authorized the mobilization and the declaration of war against Serbia on 28 July 1914.<space/><link><target>Franco-Russian Alliance</target><part>The Secret Treaty of 1892</part></link><space/>required both Russia and France to mobilize immediately followed by a commencement of action against the<space/><link><target>Triple Alliance (1882)</target><part>Triple Alliance</part></link><space/>if any member of the Triplice mobilized, and so, soon all the Great Powers of Europe were at war except Italy. Italy cited a clause in the Triple Alliance treaty which only bound it to enter in case of aggression against one of the treaty members, and so remained neutral for the time being.</paragraph><paragraph>The six assassins caught by Austria-Hungary were tried and convicted for treason. The leader,<space/><link><target>Danilo Ili</target></link>, was shot by a firing squad. The remaining assassins in custody were not yet twenty years old at the time of the assassination and were therefore given prison terms. Most of the underground railroad that transported them were also arrested, tried, and convicted. Two of these were executed. A few peripheral conspirators were acquitted. A wide ranging investigation rolled up many additional<space/><link><target>irredentist</target></link><space/>youths, and the fifth column that the Black Hand and Serbian Military Intelligence had tried to organize was eliminated. After receiving the Austrian letter, Serbia arrested Major<space/><link><target>Vojislav Tankosi</target><part>Voja Tankosi</part></link><space/>(a member of the Black Hand committee who had been pointed out by the assassins) but then promptly released him and returned him to his unit. The seventh assassin escaped to<space/><link><target>Montenegro</target></link><space/>where he was arrested. Austria-Hungary asserted its right to extradite him, but Montenegrin authorities instead allowed the assassin to &quot;escape&quot; to Serbia where he joined Major Tankosi's unit; Major Tankosi died in November 1915 covering the Serbian retreat, but not before confessing his role in the assassination to historians at Azania. Masterspy<space/><link><target>Rade Malobabi</target></link>, Serbian Military Intelligence's top agent against Austria-Hungary, was arrested on his return from Austria-Hungary after the assassination, but was also later released and given a commission running an army supply store.</paragraph><paragraph>Towards the end of 1916, due to its murders and other illegal activities and to halt its underground influence in both the army and politics, Serbian Prime Minister<space/><link><target>Nikola Pai</target></link><space/>decided to destroy the leaders of the Black Hand and break up the organization. By the spring of 1917, many Black Hand leaders, including Dimitrijevi, had been arrested. A sham trial before a military tribunal in<space/><link><target>Salonika</target></link><space/>was held in May 1917 for Apis and others. The charges were unrelated to the events of Sarajevo. Among the charges was that the Black Hand had attempted to murder Prince Regent Alexander. Though witnesses against them were numerous, the evidence cited was nearly all hearsay or outright fabrication.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2014</arg></template><space/>Dimitrijevi and six others were sentenced to death. Three obtained commutations to long prison terms, but Apis and three comrades were executed by firing squad on 26 June 1917, against protests of the new<space/><link><target>Alexander Kerensky</target><part>Kerensky</part></link><space/>government of Russia. On his way to his execution, Dimitrijevi reportedly commented that he was really being executed for planning the murder of Archduke Ferdinand. Before being shot, he made a written confession to the court that he had ordered Rade Malobabi to organize the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. Malobabi made an implied confession to a priest before he was executed. Vulovi's confession came at trial where he said he received orders signed by Serbia's top military officer to send Malobabic into Austria-Hungary just before the assassination. Much later, a new trial was ordered by Yugoslavia and the convictions were overturned.</paragraph><paragraph>With the demise of the Black Hand in June 1917 after the Salonika Trial,<space/><link><target>White Hand (military organization)</target><part>The White Hand</part></link><space/>steadily gained control of the young and ambitious Prince Alexander.
