[[File:J. Reynolds, A discourse upon prodigious abstinence... Wellcome L0022587.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1669 report that claims a woman fasted for 12 months]]
'''Inedia''' (Latin for "[[fasting]]") or '''breatharianism''' {{IPAc-en|b|r|ɛ|θ|ˈ|ɛər|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}} is the belief that it is possible for a person to live without consuming [[food]].   Breatharians claim that food, and in some cases [[water]], are not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by ''[[prana]]'', the vital life force in [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Ayurveda]], [[sunlight]] is one of the main sources of ''prana'', and some practitioners believe that it is possible for a person to survive on sunlight alone. The terms ''breatharianism'' or ''inedia'' may also refer to this philosophy when it is practiced as a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] in place of the usual [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].

Breatharianism is considered a lethal [[pseudoscience]] by scientists and medical professionals, and several adherents of these practices have died from starvation and dehydration.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news

==Scientific assessment==
[[Nutrition]]al science proves that [[fasting]] for extended periods leads to [[starvation]], [[dehydration]], and eventual death. In the absence of calorie intake, the body normally burns its own reserves of glycogen, body fat, and muscle. Breatharians claim that their bodies do not consume these reserves while fasting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/breatharian1.htm |title=Can humans survive on air alone? | publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc. |accessdate=2009-07-30 |first=Katie|last=Lambert|archiveurl=http://archive.is/MK2o |archivedate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Practitioners==

===Rosicrucianism===
The 1670 [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] text ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'' attributed the practice to the physician and occultist [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541) who was described as having lived "several years by taking only one half scrupule of Solar Quintessence". In this book, it is also stated that, "Paracelsus affirms that He has seen many of the Sages fast twenty years without eating anything whatsoever."<ref>{{cite book|last1=abbé de Nicolas-Pierre-Henri|first1=Villars|title=Comte de Gabalis|publisher=The Brothers|pages=63–64|edition=1914|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028957467}}</ref>

===Jasmuheen===
[[Jasmuheen]] (born Ellen Greve) was a prominent advocate of breatharianism in the 1990s. She claimed, "I can go for months and months without having anything at all other than a cup of tea. My body runs on a different kind of nourishment."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Vegetarian Myth: Food, Justice, and Sustainability,|author=Keith, L.|isbn=9781604861822|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=\_KGWcPH41qYC|year=2009|publisher=PM Press}}</ref> Interviewers found her house stocked with food; Jasmuheen claimed the food was for her husband and daughter. In 1999, she volunteered to be monitored closely by the [[Australia]]n television program ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' for one week without eating to demonstrate her methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp|title=Living on air: Breatharian put to the test|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051102085047/http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp|archivedate=2 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/jasmuheen.htm |title = Jasmuheen |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/jc2J |archivedate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Jasmuheen stated that she found it difficult on the third day of the test because the hotel room in which she was confined was located near a busy road, causing [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[pollution]] that prevented absorption of required nutrients from the air. "I asked for fresh air. Seventy percent of my nutrients come from fresh air. I couldn’t even breathe," she said. The third day the test was moved to a mountainside retreat where her condition continued to deteriorate. After Jasmuheen had fasted for four days, Dr. Berris Wink, president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association, urged her to stop the test.<ref name="Yahoo 1999">{{cite news | url=http://www.caic.org.au/miscult/breatharians/Fresh-air%20dietician%20fails%20TV%20show%27s%20challenge.htm | title=Fresh-air dietician fails TV show's challenge | publisher=[[Yahoo News]] | date=25 October 1999 | accessdate =7 April 2015}}</ref>

According to Dr. Wink, Jasmuheen’s pupils were dilated, her speech was slow, and she was "quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%". Towards the end of the test, she said, "Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risks if she goes any further are kidney failure. ''60 Minutes'' would be culpable if they encouraged her to continue. She should stop now." The test was stopped. Dr. Wink said, "Unfortunately there are a few people who may believe what she says, and I'm sure it's only a few, but I think it's quite irresponsible for somebody to be trying to encourage others to do something that is so detrimental to their health."<ref name="Yahoo 1999"/> Jasmuheen challenged the results of the program, saying, "Look, 6,000 people have done this around the world without any problem."<ref name="Bergman2006">{{cite book|last=Bergman|first=Gregory|title=Isms: From Autoeroticism to Zoroastrianism – an Irreverent Reference|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QUVuSNM5QUQC&pg=PA32|year=2006|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-4405-1788-6|page=32}}</ref> Though she claims thousands of people are tuned to this,<ref>{{cite web |last = Harris | first = Gillian | date = 6 April 2000 | title = Starvation guru given hostile reception | work = The Times }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://liberatapublishers.com/mysticism.htm |title = Mysticism |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/Wxr5 |archivedate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=no}}</ref> mostly in Germany,<ref>{{cite web | last = Steiner | first = Susie | date = 21 September 1999

In the documentary ''[[No Way to Heaven]]'' the Swiss chemist Michael Werner claims to have followed the directions appearing on Jasmuheen's books, living for several years without food.

Hindu religious texts contain account of saints and hermits practicing what would be called inedia, breatharianism or Sustenance through Light in modern terms. In Valmiki's [[Ramayana]], Book III, Canto VI, an account of anchorites and holy men is given, who flocked around [[Rama]] when he came to [[Śarabhanga]]'s hermitage. These included, among others, the "...saints who live on rays which moon and daystar give" and "those ... whose food the wave of air supplies". In Canto XI of the same book a hermit named [[Māṇḍakarṇi]] is mentioned: "For he, great votarist, intent – On strictest rule his stern life spent – ... – Ten thousand years on air he fed..."  (English quotations are from Ralph T. H. Griffith's translation).

[[Paramahansa Yogananda]]'s ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' details two alleged historical examples of breatharianism, [[Giri Bala]] and [[Therese Neumann]].

There are claims that [[Devraha Baba]] lived without food.
