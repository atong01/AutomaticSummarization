Some previously popular shows (such as<space/><italics><link><target>Sailor Moon</target></link></italics>) lost their appeal completely after the practice of dubbing began, and the dubbing was eventually removed from the programs.

However, in some of Switzerland's towns and cities (particularly along the language-borders), subtitled versions are common.

Republic</target></link><space/>generally all foreign films released on home media are provided with Czech dubbing. All television channels (both free and paid) broadcast foreign films and series dubbed - with only very rare exceptions. Films in cinemas are usually provided only with subtitles, but some films like family films, children films and major film series (especially those in 3D) are also dubbed, and subtitled version is available only in a few cinemas. There is also common that well known foreign actors are usually dubbed by one individual Czech voice actor; for instance<space/><link><target>Clint Eastwood</target></link><space/>has been dubbed by Ladislav upani in 39 of 42 films distributed in the Czech Republic.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Slovakia</target></link><space/>home media market, Czech dubbed versions are widely used, with only children's films that were dubbed for cinema are released with Slovak dubbing. Czech dubbing was also extensively used in broadcast of Slovak television channels, but since 2007 Slovak language law require any newer shows to be provided with Slovak localization (dubbing or subtitles), so since then televisions broadcast newer films and shows with Slovak dubbing. Older material still their Czech dubbing, as most audiences were used to it than adjusting to a newer, lesser quality Slovak dubbing.</paragraph><heading level='5'>Poland</heading><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Poland</target></link>, cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called &quot;juxtareading,&quot; is similar to the so-called<space/><link><target>Gavrilov translation</target></link><space/>in Russia, with one differenceall dialogues are translated with only one acute, and usually male voice, preferably deep and neutral, that does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified lectors are traditionally assigned to a particular kind of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.</paragraph><paragraph>Poland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were<space/><italics><link><target>Dangerous Curves (1929 film)</target><part>Dangerous Curves</part></link></italics><space/>(1929),<space/><italics><link><target>The Dance of Life</target></link></italics><space/>(1929),<space/><italics><link><target>Paramount on Parade</target></link></italics><space/>(1930), and<space/><italics><link><target>Darling of the Gods</target></link></italics><space/>(1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in<space/><link><target>d</target></link>. The first film dubbed that year was<space/><italics>Russkiy Vopros</italics><space/>(filmed 1948).</paragraph><paragraph>The Polish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronization. The Polish dialogues were unclear, so people could not understand them. Cinemas had an old aperture that sometimes made a film more unclear than it was. In the 1950s, the Polish publicist discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.</paragraph><paragraph>The number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age in the 1960s-1980s. Approximately one-third of foreign movies were dubbed in the cinemas. The &quot;Polish dubbing school&quot; was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The most important person who initiated high quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. Her works were as good as the originals and sometimes even better. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. The Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as<space/><italics><link><target>Rich Man, Poor Man</target></link></italics>;<space/><italics><link><target>Fawlty Towers</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Forsyte Saga</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Elizabeth R</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>I, Claudius</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)</target><part>I'll Take Manhattan</part></link></italics>, and<space/><italics><link><target>Peter the Great (TV series)</target><part>Peter the Great</part></link></italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 1980s, due to budget cuts, television did not have money for tapes, so they used the actual recordings. After the first emission, dubbing was cancelled. In the era of<space/><link><target>communism</target></link>, almost 1,000 films were dubbed. In the 1990s, after capitalist transformation, Polish television TVP was still dubbing films and TV series. Unfortunately, as in the 1980s, it was a dubbing only for one emission.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1995,<space/><link><target>Canal+</target></link><space/>was launched. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of the schedule. They dubbed very ambitious films and popular TV series. One of the most well-known and popular dubbings was the Polish dub of<space/><italics><link><target>Friends (TV series)</target><part>Friends</part></link></italics>. Unfortunately, they stopped dubbing<space/><italics>Friends</italics><space/>in 2001, and stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as<space/><link><target>Wizja Jeden</target></link>. They mainly dubbed<space/><link><target>BBC</target></link><space/>productions such as<space/><italics><link><target>The League of Gentlemen</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Absolutely Fabulous</target></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>Men Behaving Badly</target></link></italics>. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series<space/><italics><link><target>Frasier</target></link></italics>, although that dubbing was very popular.</paragraph><paragraph>Currently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of<space/><italics>Shrek</italics>, which contained many references to local culture and Polish humor. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2010</arg></template><space/>However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of<space/><link><target>DVD</target><part>DVD releases</part></link>, most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either lector or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.</paragraph><paragraph>Since theatrical release of<space/><italics>The Avengers</italics><space/>in May 2012, The Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for theater releases.

In the<space/><link><target>Soviet Union</target></link>, most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed. Voice-over dub was inveted in the<space/><link><target>Soviet Union</target></link><space/>in 1980's when with the fall of the regime, many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden, or at least questionable under communist rule, started to flood in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way. For example, the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being copied, using primitive equipment. The quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfering with the original voices, background sounds leaked into the track, translation was inaccurate and, most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person who usually lacked the intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. This method of translation exerted a strong influence on Russian pop culture. Voices of translators became recognizable for generations.</paragraph><paragraph>In modern Russia, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality, and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices.</paragraph><paragraph>Video games are generally either dubbed into Russian (for instance The Legend of Spyro trilogy, Skylanders series, Assassin's Creed saga, Halo or Harry Potter series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Russian language.</paragraph><heading level='5'>Ukraine</heading><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Ukraine</target></link>, television and cinema is usually dubbed with the overdubbing technique, with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices.

Almost all shows are voice-over dubbed. This dubbing method is similar to the Polish methodone person reads the whole translated text, while the original sound plays at a low volume in the background. In cinemas, only children's animated films (such as<space/><italics><link><target>The Tale of Despereaux (film)</target><part>The Tale of Despereaux</part></link></italics>) and children's live-action films (such as<space/><italics><link><target>Charlotte's Web (2006 film)</target><part>Charlotte's Web</part></link></italics>) are dubbed in<space/><link><target>Latvian language</target><part>Latvian</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Lithuanian language</target><part>Lithuanian</part></link><space/>languages.

In addition, British children's shows (such as<space/><italics><link><target>Bob the Builder</target></link></italics>) are re-dubbed with American voice actors, making the series more understandable for American children.

into<space/><link><target>Standard French</target></link>, occasionally with<space/><link><target>Qubec French</target></link><space/>idiosyncrasies. Occasionally, the dubbing of a series or a movie, such as<space/><italics>The Simpsons</italics>, is made using the more widely spoken<space/><italics><link><target>joual</target></link></italics><space/>variety of Qubec French. Dubbing has the advantage of making children's films and TV series more comprehensible to younger audiences. However, many<space/><link><target>bilingual</target></link><space/>Qubcois prefer subtitling, since they would understand some or all of the original audio. In addition, all films are shown in English, as well in certain theaters (especially in major cities and English-speaking areas such as the<space/><link><target>West Island</target></link>), and some theatres, such as the Scotiabank Cinema<space/><link><target>Montreal</target></link>, show only movies in English. Most American television series are only available in English on<space/><link><target>DVD</target></link>, or on English-language channels, but some of the more popular ones have French dubs shown on mainstream networks, and are released in French on DVD as well, sometimes separately from an English-only version.</paragraph><paragraph>Formerly, all French-language dubbed films in Qubec were imported from France and some still are. Such a practice was criticized by former politician<space/><link><target>Mario Dumont</target></link><space/>after he took his children to see the<space/><link><target>Standard French</target><part>Parisian French</part></link><space/>dub of<space/><italics>Shrek the Third</italics>, which Dumont found incomprehensible. After his complaints and a proposed bill,<space/><italics><link><target>Bee Movie</target></link></italics>, the film from<space/><link><target>DreamWorks Animation</target></link>, was dubbed in Qubec, making it the studio's first animated film to have a Qubec French dub, as all DreamWorks Animation films had previously been dubbed in France. In terms of Disney, the first Disney animated movie to be dubbed in Qubec was<space/><italics>Oliver and Company.</italics><space/>The Disney Renaissance films were also dubbed in Qubec except for<space/><italics>The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King.</italics><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">Drôle d'abeille (v.o.a) Bee Movie</arg><arg name="url">http://doublage.qc.ca/showMovie.php?id</arg><arg name="work">Doublage.qc.ca</arg><arg name="publisher">idgrafix</arg><arg name="accessdate">30 July 2012</arg><arg name="author">Doublage.qc.ca</arg><arg name="language">French</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In addition, because Canadian viewers usually find Qubec French more comprehensible than other dialects of the language, some older film series that had the French-language versions of previous installments dubbed in France have had later ones dubbed in Qubec, often creating inconsistencies within the French version of the series' canon.<space/><link><target>Lucasfilm</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>Star Wars</target></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>Indiana Jones</target></link></italics><space/>series are examples.

However, later films in both series released 1999 and later were dubbed in Qubec, using different voice actors and &quot;reversing&quot; name changes made in France's dubbings due to the change in studio.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Asia</heading><paragraph><template><target>refimprove section</target><arg name="date">August 2013</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='4'>China</heading><paragraph><link><target>China</target></link><space/>has a long tradition of dubbing foreign films into<space/><link><target>Standard Chinese</target><part>Mandarin Chinese</part></link>, starting in the 1930s.

The<space/><link><target>Shanghai</target></link><space/>Film Dubbing Studio has been the most well-known studio in the film dubbing industry in China. In order to generate high-quality products, they divide each film into short segments, each one lasting only a few minutes, and then work on the segments one-by-one. In addition to the correct meaning in translation, they make tremendous effort to match the lips of the actors to the dialogue. As a result, the dubbing in these films generally is not readily detected. The cast of dubbers is acknowledged at the end of a dubbed film. Several dubbing actors and actresses of the Shanghai Film Dubbing Studio have become well-known celebrities, such as Qiu Yuefeng, Bi Ke, Li Zi, and Liu Guangning. In recent years, however, especially in the larger cities on the east and south coasts, it has become increasingly common for movie theaters to show subtitled versions with the original soundtracks intact.</paragraph><paragraph>Motion pictures are also dubbed into the languages of some of China's<space/><link><target>Autonomous administrative divisions of China</target><part>autonomous regions</part></link>.

In programs aimed at teenagers and adults, dubbing is rarely considered for translation, not only because of its high costs, but also because the audience is mainly multi-lingual. Most viewers in Israel speak at least one European language in addition to Hebrew, and a large part of the audience also speaks<space/><link><target>Arabic language</target><part>Arabic</part></link>. Therefore, most viewers prefer to hear the original soundtrack, aided by Hebrew subtitles. Another problem is that dubbing does not allow for translation into two different languages simultaneously, as is often the case of Israeli television channels that use subtitles in Hebrew and another language (like<space/><link><target>Russian language</target><part>Russian</part></link>) simultaneously.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Japan</heading><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Japan</target></link>, many television programs appear on Japanese television subtitled or dubbed if they are intended for children. When the American film<space/><italics><link><target>Morocco (film)</target><part>Morocco</part></link></italics><space/>was released in Japan in 1931, subtitles became the mainstream method of translating TV programs and films in Japan. Later, around the 1950s, foreign television programs and films began to be shown dubbed in<space/><link><target>Japanese language</target><part>Japanese</part></link><space/>on television.

When the television program was shown on television, it was mostly dubbed. There was a character limit for a small TV screen at a lower resolution, and this method was not suitable for the poor elderly and illiterate eye, as was audio dubbing.

The same situation is encountered for films. Sometimes foreign programs and films receive more than one dub, such as for example,<space/><link><target>Jumanji</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Dragonheart</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Van Helsing (film)</target><part>Van Helsing</part></link><space/>having two Hindi dubs. Information for the Hindi, Tamil and Telugu voice actors who have done the voices for specific actors and for their roles on foreign films and television programs are published in local Indian data magazines, for those that are involved in the dubbing industry in India. But on a few occasions, there are some foreign productions that do credit the dubbing cast, such as animated films like the<space/><italics><link><target>Barbie (film series)</target><part>Barbie</part></link></italics><space/>films, and some Disney films.<space/><link><target>Disney Channel</target></link><space/>original series released on DVD with their Hindi dubs show a list of the artists in the Hindi dub credits, after the original ending credits. Theatrical releases and VCD releases of foreign films do not credit the dubbing cast or staff. The DVD releases, however, do have credits for the dubbing staff, if they are released multilingual.

Dubbing began in 1946 with the advent of movies and cinemas in the country. Since then, foreign movies have always been dubbed for the cinema and TV. Using various voice actors and adding local hints and witticisms to the original contents, dubbing played a major role in attracting people to the cinemas and developing an interest in other cultures. The dubbing art in Iran reached its apex during the 1960s and 1970s with the inflow of American, European and Hindi movies.</paragraph><paragraph>The most famous musicals of the time, such as<space/><italics><link><target>My Fair Lady (film)</target><part>My Fair Lady</part></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>The Sound of Music</target></link></italics>, were translated, adjusted and performed in Persian by the voice artists. Since the 1990s, for political reasons and under pressure from the state, the dubbing industry has declined, with movies dubbed only for the state TV channels. During recent years, DVDs with Persian subtitles have found a market among viewers for the same reason, but most people still prefer the Persian-speaking dubbed versions. Recently, privately operated companies started dubbing TV series by hiring famous dubbers.</paragraph><paragraph>A List of Persian voice actors that associate with their actor counterparts are listed here.</paragraph><table class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"><tablerow><tablehead>Persian dubbing artists</tablehead><tablehead>Actor(s)/Actress(es)</tablehead><tablehead>Notes</tablehead></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell><link><target>Afshin Zinoori</target></link></tablecell><tablecell><link><target>Elijah Wood</target></link><space/><xhtml:br></xhtml:br><space/><link><target>Daniel Radcliffe</target></link><space/><xhtml:br></xhtml:br><space/><link><target>Leonardo DiCaprio</target></link></tablecell><tablecell>Dubbed for Wood as<space/><link><target>Frodo Baggins</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>The Lord of the Rings (film series)</target><part>The Lord of the Rings</part></link><space/>and dubbed for Radcliffe as<space/><link><target>Harry Potter (character)</target><part>Harry Potter</part></link><space/>in the<space/><link><target>Harry Potter (film series)</target><part>titular film series</part></link><space/>from 3 to 5.</tablecell></tablerow></table><heading level='3'>Africa</heading><heading level='4'>The Maghreb</heading><paragraph><template><target>refimprove section</target><arg name="date">August 2013</arg></template>In<space/><link><target>Algeria</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Morocco</target></link>, most foreign movies (especially Hollywood productions) are shown dubbed in French. These movies are usually imported directly from French film distributors. The choice of movies dubbed into French can be explained by the history of colonization of these countries by France and the widespread use of the French language (among the intellectual elite), in addition to the marginalization of one national language. Another important factor is that local theaters and private media companies do not dub in local languages in order to avoid high costs, but also because of the lack of both expertise and demand.</paragraph><paragraph>Beginning in the 1980s, dubbed series and movies for children in<space/><link><target>Modern Standard Arabic</target></link><space/>became a popular choice among most TV channels, cinemas and VHS/DVD stores. However, dubbed films are still imported, and dubbing is performed in Arab countries with a strong tradition of dubbing and subtitling (mainly<space/><link><target>Syria</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Lebanon</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Jordan</target></link>). The evolution of movies targeting the adult audience was different. After the satellite boom in the<space/><link><target>Arab world</target></link><space/>and the emergence of Pan-Arab channels, the use of subtitles, which was already popular in the<space/><link><target>Middle East</target></link>, was highly popular among local viewers in Algeria and Morocco.</paragraph><paragraph>In the Arab world (member states in<space/><link><target>North Africa</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Western Asia</target></link><space/>and others), only children's films and TV series were dubbed in<space/><link><target>Arabic language</target><part>Arabic</part></link>. Many different anime titles are dubbed in the Arabic language, as well. Everything else is usually shown in its original language with Arabic subtitles. Recently, The Arabic dubbing industry has boomed, and channels such as<space/><link><target>MBC Max</target></link>, are now offering famous older action films aimed at an older audience dubbed in Arabic to be broadcast on television. Action movies such as<space/><italics><link><target>Braveheart (film)</target><part>Braveheart</part></link></italics>,<space/><italics>The Lord of the Rings</italics><space/>film trilogy and<space/><italics><link><target>Troy (film)</target><part>Troy</part></link></italics><space/>have become some of the first foreign action titles to be dubbed in Arabic, rather than using subtitles, on the<space/><link><target>MBC Max</target></link><space/>channel.

This decline can be traced to the huge popularity of free-to-air<space/><link><target>Pan-Arabism</target><part>Pan-Arab</part></link><space/>movie channels offering primarily subtitled content, and the government's reduced efforts to limit piracy. Tunisia National Television (TNT), the public broadcaster of Tunisia, is not allowed to show any content in any language other than Arabic, which forces it to broadcast only dubbed content (this restriction was recently removed for commercials). During the 1970s and 1980s, TNT (known as ERTT at the time) started dubbing famous cartoons in Tunisian and Standard Arabic. This move was highly successful locally, but was not able to compete with mainstream dubbing companies (especially in the Middle East). In the private sector, television channels are not subject to the language rule and sometimes broadcast foreign content dubbed into French (excluding children content), although some of them, such as<space/><link><target>Hannibal TV</target></link>, started adopting subtitling in Arabic instead, which proved to be more popular than simply importing French-dubbed content.</paragraph><heading level='4'>South Africa</heading><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>South Africa</target></link>, many television programmes were dubbed in<space/><link><target>Afrikaans</target></link>, with the original soundtrack (usually in English, but sometimes Dutch or German) &quot;<link><target>simulcast</target></link>&quot; in<space/><link><target>FM stereo#Stereo FM</target><part>FM stereo</part></link><space/>on Radio 2000.

For small markets (small language area or films for a select audience), subtitling is more suitable, because it is cheaper. In the case of films for small children who cannot yet read, or do not read fast enough, dubbing is necessary.</paragraph><paragraph>In most<space/><link><target>English language</target><part>English-speaking</part></link><space/>countries, dubbing is comparatively rare.

However, those same series can be seen on cable channels at more accessible time-slots in their subtitled version, and usually before they are shown on open TV. In contrast, the series<space/><italics>The Simpsons</italics><space/>is aired in its Mexican-dubbed version both on terrestrial television and on the cable station Fox, which broadcasts the series for the area.

Only<space/><link><target>Diema</target></link><space/>channels dub all programs. Movies in theaters, with the exception of films for children, use subtitles. Dubbing of television programs is usually done using voiceovers, but usually with at least four or five actors reading the lines, while trying to give each character a different voice by using appropriate intonations. Dubbing with synchronized voices is rarely used, mostly for animated films.<space/><italics><link><target>Mrs. Doubtfire</target></link></italics><space/>is a rare example of a feature film dubbed this way on<space/><link><target>BNT Channel 1</target></link>, though a subtitled version is currently shown on other channels.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Walt Disney Television</target></link>'s animated series (such as<space/><italics><link><target>DuckTales</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Darkwing Duck</target></link></italics>, and<space/><italics><link><target>Timon &amp; Pumbaa (TV series)</target><part>Timon &amp; Pumbaa</part></link></italics>) were only aired with synchronized Bulgarian voices on<space/><link><target>BNT Channel 1</target></link><space/>until 2005, but then the Disney shows were canceled.

Now, the show is airing on Disney Channel, also in a synchronized form.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Hungary</target></link>, practically all television programs are dubbed, as are about 50 percent of movies in theaters. In the<space/><link><target>Socialism</target><part>socialist</part></link><space/>era, every film was dubbed with professional and mostly popular actors. Care was taken to make sure the same voice actor would lend his voice to the same original actor. In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in the cinema. This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dubbed soundtracks for the movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading of dubbing quality. Once this became customary, cinema distributors resumed the habit of dubbing for popular productions, presenting them in a quality varying from very poor to average. However, every feature is presented with the original soundtrack in at least one cinema in large towns and cities.</paragraph><paragraph>However, in Hungary, most documentary films and series (for example, those on<space/><link><target>Discovery Channel</target></link>,<space/><link><target>National Geographic Channel</target></link>) are made with voiceover. Some old movies and series, or ones that provide non-translatable jokes and conversations (for example, the<space/><italics><link><target>Mr. Bean</target></link></italics><space/>television series), are shown only with subtitles.</paragraph><paragraph>There is a more recent problem arising from dubbing included on DVD releases. Many generations have grown up with an original (and, by current technological standards, outdated) soundtrack, which is either technologically (mono or bad quality stereo sound) or legally (expired soundtrack license) unsuitable for a DVD release. Many original features are released on DVD with a new soundtrack, which in some cases proves to be extremely unpopular, thus forcing DVD producers to include the original soundtrack. In some rare cases, the Hungarian soundtrack is left out altogether. This happens notably with Warner Home Video Hungary, which ignored the existence of Hungarian soundtracks completely, as they did not want to pay the licensees for the soundtracks to be included on their new DVD releases, which appear with improved picture quality, but very poor subtitling.</paragraph><heading level='2'>General use</heading><paragraph>Dubbing is also used in applications and genres other than traditional film, including video games, television, and pornographic films.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Video games</heading><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">August 2013</arg></template>Many<space/><link><target>video game</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>originally produced in<space/><link><target>North America</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Japan</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>PAL</target></link><space/>countries are dubbed into foreign languages for release in areas such as<space/><link><target>Europe</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Australia</target></link>, especially for video games that place a heavy emphasis on dialogue. Because characters' mouth movements can be part of the game's code,<space/><link><target>lip sync</target></link><space/>is sometimes achieved by re-coding the mouth movements to match the dialogue in the new language. The<space/><link><target>Source engine</target></link><space/>automatically generates lip-sync data, making it easier for games to be localized.</paragraph><paragraph>To achieve synchronization when animations are intended only for the source language, localized content is mostly recorded using techniques borrowed from movie dubbing (such as rythmo band) or, when images are not available, localized dubbing is done using source audios as a reference. Sound-synch is a method where localized audios are recorded matching the length and internal pauses of the source content.</paragraph><paragraph>For the European version of a video game, the on-screen text of the game is available in various languages and, in many cases, the dialogue is dubbed into each respective language, as well.</paragraph><paragraph>The North American version of any game is always available in<space/><link><target>English language</target><part>English</part></link>, with translated text and dubbed dialogue, if necessary, in other languages, especially if the North American version of the game contains the same data as the European version.

This is usually done to remove<space/><link><target>profanity</target></link>. In most cases, the original actor does not perform this duty, but an actor with a similar voice reads the changes. The results are sometimes seamless, but, in many cases, the voice of the replacement actor sounds nothing like the original performer, which becomes particularly noticeable when extensive dialogue must be replaced. Also, often easy to notice, is the sudden absence of background sounds in the movie during the dubbed dialogue. Among the films considered notorious for using substitute actors that sound very different from their theatrical counterparts are the<space/><italics><link><target>Smokey and the Bandit</target></link></italics><space/>and the<space/><italics><link><target>Die Hard series</target><part>Die Hard</part></link></italics><space/>film series, as shown on broadcasters such as<space/><link><target>TBS (TV network)</target><part>TBS</part></link>. In the case of<space/><italics>Smokey and the Bandit</italics>, extensive dubbing was done for the first network airing on<space/><link><target>ABC Television</target></link><space/>in 1978, especially for<space/><link><target>Jackie Gleason</target></link>'s character,<space/><link><target>Buford T. Justice</target></link>. The dubbing of his phrase &quot;sombitch&quot; (son of a bitch) became the more palatable (and memorable) &quot;scum bum,&quot; which became a catchphrase of the time.</paragraph><paragraph>Dubbing is commonly used in<space/><link><target>science fiction television</target></link>, as well. Sound generated by effects equipment such as<space/><link><target>Animatronics</target><part>animatronic</part></link><space/>puppets or by actors' movements on elaborate multi-level plywood sets (for example, starship bridges or other command centers) will quite often make the original character dialogue unusable.<space/><italics><link><target>Stargate</target></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>Farscape</target></link></italics><space/>are two prime examples where ADR is used heavily to produce usable audio.</paragraph><paragraph>Since some anime series contain profanity, the studios recording the English dubs often re-record certain lines if a series or movie is going to be broadcast on<space/><link><target>Cartoon Network</target></link>, removing references to<space/><link><target>death</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>hell</target></link><space/>as well. Some companies will offer both an edited and an uncut version of the series on DVD, so that there is an edited script available in case the series is broadcast. Other companies also edit the full-length version of a series, meaning that even on the uncut DVD characters say things like &quot;Blast!&quot; and &quot;Darn!&quot; in place of the original dialogue's profanity.<space/><link><target>Bandai</target><part>Bandai Entertainment's</part></link><space/>English dub of<space/><italics><link><target>G Gundam</target></link></italics><space/>is infamous for this, among many other things, with such lines as &quot;Bartender, more milk&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Dubbing has also been used for comedic purposes, replacing lines of dialogue to create comedies from footage that was originally another genre. Examples include the Australian shows<space/><italics><link><target>The Late Show (Australian TV series)#The Olden Days</target><part>The Olden Days</part></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>Bargearse</target></link></italics>, re-dubbed from 1970s Australian drama and action series, respectively, and the Irish show<space/><italics><link><target>Soupy Norman</target></link></italics>, re-dubbed from<space/><italics><link><target>:pl:Pierwsza mio</target><part>Pierwsza mio</part></link></italics>, a Polish soap opera.</paragraph><paragraph>Dubbing into a foreign language does not always entail the deletion of the original language. In some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a voice-over. This often occurs in<space/><link><target>Russia</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Poland</target></link>, where &quot;lektories&quot; or &quot;lektors&quot; read the translated dialogue into<space/><link><target>Russian language</target><part>Russian</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Polish language</target><part>Polish</part></link>. In Poland, a single person reads all parts of the performance, both male and female. However, this is done almost exclusively for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled. Recently, however, the number of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for children's movies. If a quality dubbed version exists for a film, it is shown in theaters. However, some films, such as<space/><italics><link><target>Harry Potter</target></link></italics><space/>or<space/><italics><link><target>Star Wars</target></link></italics>, are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions, varying with the time of the show. Such films are also shown on TV (although some channels drop them and do standard one-narrator translation) and VHS/DVD. In other countries, like<space/><link><target>Vietnam</target></link>, the voice-over technique is also used for theatrical releases.</paragraph><paragraph>In Russia, the reading of all lines by a single person is referred to as a<space/><link><target>Gavrilov translation</target></link>, and is generally found only in<space/><link><target>Copyright infringement</target><part>illegal copies</part></link><space/>of films and on<space/><link><target>cable television</target></link>. Professional copies always include at least two actors of opposite gender translating the dialogue. Some titles in Poland have been dubbed this way, too, but this method lacks public appeal, so it is very rare now.</paragraph><paragraph>On special occasions, such as<space/><link><target>film festival</target><trail>s</trail></link>, live<space/><link><target>interpreting</target></link><space/>is often done by professionals.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Pornography</heading><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">August 2013</arg></template>As budgets for<space/><link><target>pornographic film</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are often small, compared to films made by major studios, and there is an inherent need to film without interrupting filming, it is common for sex scenes to be over-dubbed.

Therefore, a film may be translated into a dialect of a certain language. For example, the animated movie<space/><italics><link><target>The Incredibles</target></link></italics><space/>was translated to European Spanish,<space/><link><target>Mexican Spanish</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Neutral Spanish</target></link><space/>(which used the Mexican voice cast), and<space/><link><target>Rioplatense Spanish</target></link><space/>(although people from<space/><link><target>Chile</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Uruguay</target></link><space/>noticed a strong<space/><italics><link><target>porteo</target></link></italics><space/>accent from most of the characters of the Rioplatense Spanish translation). In Spanish-speaking regions, most media is dubbed only twice into Spanish (Spain) and Neutral Spanish (which is Mexican Spanish but avoids colloquialisms).</paragraph><paragraph>Another example is the French dialect dubbing of<space/><italics>The Simpsons</italics>, which is entirely different in<space/><link><target>Quebec</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>France</target></link>, the humor being very different for each audience (see<space/><link><target>Non-English versions of The Simpsons</target><part>Non-English versions of ''The Simpsons''</part></link>). Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France's dubbing of<space/><italics>The Simpsons</italics>, which they often do not find amusing. The French-language<space/><link><target>Tltoon (Canada)</target><part>Tltoon</part></link><space/>network once aired the Quebec dub for<space/><italics>The Simpsons</italics>, as well as Parisian French dubs of<space/><italics><link><target>Futurama</target></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>Family Guy</target></link></italics>, which were both similar to the Parisian dub for<space/><italics>The Simpsons</italics>. The two latter shows have since been taken off the network, while<space/><italics>The Simpsons</italics><space/>continues its run on Tltoon.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Quebec French</target></link><space/>dubbing of films, while generally made in accent-free<space/><link><target>Standard French</target></link>, may sound peculiar to audiences in France because of the persistence of some regionally neutral expression and because Quebec French performers pronounce Anglo-Saxon names with an American accent, while French performers do not. Occasionally, for reasons of cost, American<space/><link><target>direct-to-video</target></link><space/>films, such as the 1995 film<space/><italics>When the Bullet Hits the Bone</italics>, are released in France with a Quebec French dubbing, sometimes resulting in what some members of French audiences perceive as unintentional humor.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Portugal</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Brazil</target></link><space/>also use different versions of dubbed films and series. Because dubbing has never been very popular in<space/><link><target>Portugal</target></link>, for decades, children's films and television series were distributed using the higher-quality Brazilian dub. Only in the 1990s did dubbing begin to gain importance in Portugal, thanks to the popularity of dubbed series like<space/><italics><link><target>Dragon Ball</target></link></italics>.<space/><italics><link><target>The Lion King</target></link></italics><space/>became the first Disney feature film to be completely dubbed into<space/><link><target>European Portuguese</target></link><space/>and, subsequently, all major animation films and series gained European Portuguese versions.

Dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are natural to the language but would appear awkward if translated literally. English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly and follows the natural pattern of English speech. Voice actors in a dubbing capacity typically do not have the luxury of viewing the original film with the original voice actor and thus have little idea regarding how to perform the role.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg></arg><arg name="date">August 2015</arg></template><space/>On some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue separately, which can lack the dynamics gained from performing as a group.</paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Further reading</heading><paragraph><template><target>commons category</target><arg>Dubbing (filmmaking)</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last1">Maluf<space/></arg><arg name="first1">Ramez<space/></arg><arg name="title">Dubbing into Arabic: A Trojan Horse at the Gates?<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://inhouse.lau.edu.lb/bima/papers/Dubbing.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="format">[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2011-04-10<space/></arg><arg name="date">19 December 2003<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">[[Lebanese American University]]</arg></template></listitem><listitem>Di Fortunato E. e Paolinelli M.
