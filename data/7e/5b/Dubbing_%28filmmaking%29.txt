[[File:Cabin dubbing.jpg|thumb|Dubbing studio]]
'''Dubbing,''' '''mixing,''' or '''re-recording''' is a [[post-production]] process used in [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]] in which additional or supplementary recordings are "mixed" with original production sound to create the finished soundtrack.

The process usually takes place on a dub stage. After sound editors edit and prepare all necessary tracks (dialogue, automated dialogue replacement (ADR), effects, [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]], and music), the dubbing mixer or mixers proceed to balance all of the elements and record the finished soundtrack. Dubbing is sometimes confused with ADR, also known as "additional dialogue replacement",<ref name="plexoft.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.plexoft.com/SBF/A03.html#AccidDR|title=SBF Glossary: AD to adzy|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref><ref>http://www.fia-actors.com/uploads/Equity%20PACTCinema2003.pdf p. 48</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rane.com/par-a.html#ADPCM|title=Pro Audio Reference A|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref> "additional dialogue recording", and "looping",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.routledge.com/cw/butler-9780415883283/s1/glossary/|title=Glossary - Television|author=Website|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is ADR?|url=http://www.filmmaking.net/faq/answers/faq154.asp?catid=10| work=filmmaking.net| publisher=Cinemagine Media Limited|accessdate=27 December 2013|author=Benjamin Craig|date=21 February 2005}}</ref> in which the original [[actor]]s re-record and synchronize audio segments.

Outside the film industry, the term "dubbing" most commonly refers to the replacement of the voices of the actors shown on the screen with those of different performers speaking another language, which is called "revoicing" in the film industry.<ref name="plexoft.com"/>

==Origins==
In the past, dubbing was practiced primarily in [[Musical theatre|musicals]] when the actor had an unsatisfactory singing voice. Today, dubbing enables the screening of [[audiovisual]] material to a mass audience in countries where viewers do not speak the same language as the performers in the original production.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Films, [[video]]s, and sometimes [[video game]]s are often dubbed into the local [[language]] of a foreign market.  In foreign distribution, dubbing is common in theatrically released films, [[television films]], [[television series]], [[cartoon]]s, and [[anime]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Methods==

===ADR/post-sync===
Automated dialogue replacement (ADR) is the process of re-recording dialogue by the original actor after the filming process to improve audio quality or reflect dialogue changes (also known as "looping" or a "looping session").<ref>{{cite web|title=ADR: Hollywood Dialogue Recording Secrets|url=http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/adr-hollywood-dialogue-recording-secrets|work=Creative COW Magazine|publisher=Creative COW|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Cowdog|year=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Dark Knight Without Heath Ledger: How will Warner Bros. sell a summer blockbuster marked by tragedy?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/hollywoodland/2008/01/the_dark_knight_without_heath_ledger.html|work=Slate|publisher=The Slate Group, LLC|accessdate=30 July 2012|first=Kim|last=Masters|date=31 January 2008}}</ref> ADR is also used to change original lines recorded on set to clarify context, improve [[diction]] or [[Synchronization|timing]], or to replace an accented vocal performance. In [[India]] the process is simply known as 'dubbing', while in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is also called "post-synchronisation" or "post-sync".

In conventional film production, a [[production sound mixer]] records dialogue during filming.  Accompanying noise from the set, equipment, traffic, wind, and the surrounding environment often results in unusable production sound.  During post-production, a supervising [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], or ADR supervisor, reviews all of the dialogue in the film and decides which lines must be re-recorded.

For [[animation]], such as [[computer-generated imagery]] or [[animated cartoons]], dialogue is recorded to match a pre-edited version of the show.  Although the characters' voices are recorded in a studio, ADR is necessary whenever members of the cast cannot all be present at once.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

ADR is recorded during an ADR session, which takes place in a specialized [[Recording studio|sound studio]].  The actor, usually the original actor from the set, views the scene with the original sound, then attempts to recreate the performance. Over the course of multiple [[take]]s, the actor performs the lines while watching the scene; the most suitable take becomes the final version.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Sometimes, a different actor than the original actor on set is used during ADR.  Two famous examples are the ''[[Star Wars]]'' characters [[Darth Vader]] (portrayed by [[David Prowse]]) and [[Beru Lars#Beru Lars|Beru Lars]], portrayed by Scottish actress [[Shelagh Fraser]].  In post-production, [[James Earl Jones]] dubbed the voice of Vader and an unknown actress dubbed for Fraser to replace her heavy Scottish accent.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Other examples include:
* Frenchmen [[Philippe Noiret]] and [[Jacques Perrin]], who were dubbed into Italian for ''[[Cinema Paradiso]]''
* Austrian bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], dubbed for ''[[Hercules in New York]]''
* Argentine boxer [[Carlos Monzón]], dubbed by a professional actor for the lead in the drama ''[[La Mary]]''
* [[Gert Frobe]], who played Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film [[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]], dubbed by Michael Collins
* [[Andie MacDowell]]'s Jane, in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'', who was dubbed by [[Glenn Close]]
* [[Tom Hardy]], who portrayed [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', re-dubbed half of his own lines for ease of viewer comprehension

ADR can also be used to re-dub singing. This technique was used by [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]] and [[Viggo Mortensen]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

The ADR process does not always take place in a post-production studio.  The process may be recorded on location, with mobile equipment.  ADR can also be recorded without showing the actor the image they must match, but by having them listen to the performance.

===Rythmo band===
An alternative method to dubbing, called "rythmo band" (or "[[Lip sync|lip-sync]] band"), has historically been used in [[Canada]] and [[France]].  It provides a more precise guide for the actors, [[Film director|directors]], and technicians, and can be used to complement the traditional ADR method.  The "band" is actually a clear 35&nbsp;mm [[film leader]] on which the dialogue is hand-written in [[India ink]], together with numerous additional indications for the actor—including laughs, cries, length of syllables, mouth sounds, breaths, and mouth openings and closings.  The rythmo band is projected in the studio and scrolls in perfect synchronization with the picture.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Studio time is used more efficiently, since with the aid of scrolling text, picture, and audio cues, actors can read more lines per hour than with ADR alone (only picture and audio).  With ADR, actors can average 10–12 lines per hour, while rythmo band can facilitate the reading of 35-50 lines per hour.<ref>{{cite web|title=U of U Sound Final|url=http://quizlet.com/8640541/u-of-u-sound-final-flash-cards/|work=Quizlet|publisher=Quizlet LLC|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Quizlet|year=2012}}</ref>

The preparation of a rythmo band is a time-consuming process involving a series of specialists organized in a production line. This has prevented the technique from being more widely adopted, but software emulations of rythmo band technology overcome the disadvantages of the traditional rythmo band process and significantly reduce the time needed to prepare a dubbing session.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===New technology===
Technicians have overcome some of the problems associated with dubbing using new technology.  An application developed at [[New York University]], known as Video Rewrite, uses [[computer animation]] to match lip movements with the new voice track. In a video clip made using this technology, [[John F. Kennedy]] appears to be saying "Video Rewrite gives lip-synced movies".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mrl.nyu.edu/~bregler/videorewrite/ |title=Video Rewrite |publisher=Mrl.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}</ref>

Media Movers, Inc., a dubbing company, has developed a piece of [[proprietary software]] that can automatically sync ADR/dubbed tracks with pre-defined [[algorithms]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.media-movers.com |title=Media Movers, Inc. |publisher= prweb.com |date=2006-04-28 | accessdate=2010-11-30}}</ref>

{{See also|Dub localization}}

Dubbing is often used to [[language localization|localize]] a foreign movie.  The new voice track is usually spoken by a [[voice artist]], or voice actor. In many countries, actors who regularly perform this duty remain little-known, with the exception of particular circles (such as anime [[fandom]]) or when their voices have become synonymous with roles or actors whose voices they usually dub.  In the United States, many of these voice artists may employ pseudonyms or go uncredited due to [[Screen Actors Guild]] regulations or the desire to dissociate themselves from the role.

Especially in comedies and animated movies, famous local actors may be hired to perform the dubbing, as their names are intended to attract a local audience; the entire cast may be dubbed by a local cast of similar familiarity.

===Europe===

====Kids/Family films and programming====

In [[North-West Europe]] (the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], the Dutch-speaking part of [[Belgium]] and the [[Nordic countries]]), [[Portugal]] and [[Balkans|Balkan countries]], generally only movies and TV shows intended for children are dubbed, while TV shows and movies for older audiences are subtitled (although animated productions have a tradition of being dubbed).  For movies in cinemas with clear target audiences (both below and above 10–11 years of age), both a dubbed and a subtitled version are usually available.

=====Netherlands=====
In the Netherlands, for the most part, Dutch versions are only made for children's and family films.  Animated movies are shown in theaters with Dutch dubbing, but usually those cinemas with more screening rooms also provide the original subtitled version, such as movies like ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''.

=====Belgium=====

In the Dutch speaking part of Belgium ([[Flanders]]), movies and TV series are shown in their original language with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], with the exception of most movies made for a young audience. In the latter case, sometimes separate versions are recorded in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Flanders]] (for instance, several [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Walt Disney films]] and [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]]).  These dubbed versions only differ from each other in their use of different voice actors and different pronunciation, while the text is almost the same.

In the French speaking part of Belgium, the range of French-dubbed versions is approximately as wide as the [[German language|German]] range, where nearly all movies and TV series are dubbed.

=====United Kingdom=====
In the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of foreign language films are subtitled, although mostly animated films and TV programmes are dubbed in English.  These usually originate from [[North America]], as opposed to being dubbed locally.  There have, however, been notable examples of films and TV programmes successfully dubbed in the UK, such as the Japanese ''[[Monkey (TV series)|Monkey]]'' and French ''[[The Magic Roundabout|Magic Roundabout]]'' series.  When airing films on television, channels in the UK often choose subtitling over dubbing, even if a dubbing in English exists.  It is also a fairly common practice for animation aimed at [[Preschool education|preschool]] children to be re-dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original voices, although this is not done with shows aimed at older audiences.

Some animated films and TV programmes are also dubbed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].

=====Romania=====
In [[Romania]], virtually all programmes intended for children are dubbed in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], including cartoons, live-action movies and TV series on [[Disney Channel Romania|Disney Channel]], [[Cartoon Network (Europe)|Cartoon Network]], [[Minimax tv|Minimax]], and [[Nickelodeon]], as well as those shown on general television networks, children-focused series (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[The New Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Planet's Funniest Animals]]'') or movies screened on children's television.  Animated movies are shown in theaters with Romanian dubbing.  However, those cinemas with more screening rooms usually also provide the original subtitled version.  Such was the case for movies like ''[[Babe (movie)|Babe]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (movie)|Cars]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''.  Other foreign TV shows and movies are shown in the original language with Romanian subtitles.  Subtitles are usually preferred in the Romanian market, except for programmes intended for children.  According to "Special Eurobarometer 243" of the [[European Commission]] (research carried out in November and December 2005), 62% of Romanians prefer to watch foreign films and programmes with subtitles (rather than dubbed), 22% prefer dubbing, and 16% declined to answer.<ref name="eurobarometer">[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 243] of the European Commission with the title "Europeans and their Languages", published on February 2006 with research carried out in November and December 2005. Barely 2% of Romanians consider watching original-language versions most effective into learning a new language (Table QA7b).</ref> This is led by the assumption that watching movies in their original versions is very useful for learning foreign languages.  However, according to the same Eurobarometer, virtually no Romanian found this method—watching movies in their original version—to be the most efficient way to learn foreign languages, compared to 53 percent who preferred language lessons at school.<ref name="eurobarometer" />

=====Nordic countries=====
In the [[Nordic countries]], dubbing is used only in animated features and other films for young audiences.  Some theaters in the major cities may also screen the original version, usually as the last showing of the day, or in a smaller auditorium in a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]].

In television programs with off-screen narration, the original audio dubbed in their native language, while on-screen voices are usually subtitled.

The Nordic countries are often treated as a common market issuing [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases with original audio and user choosable subtitle options in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The covers often have text in all four languages as well, but sometimes its unique for each country. Some releases may include other European language audio and/or subtitles (i.e. German, Greek, Hungarian or Italian). Children's films typically have Nordic audio tracks in all four languages, as well as original audio in most cases.

Out of the four types of Nordic dubbing, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] dubs are usually of higher quality. Most dubbing productions of children's films, such as on several Disney movies, have native voice actors match the tone and depth of the original English speakers and singing voices. While some of the voice artists are not big name actors, several have their names be known so audiences could identify the voice actor for every Swedish dub.

In [[Finland]], the dubbed version from [[Sweden]] may also be available at certain cinemas for children of the 5% Swedish-speaking minority, but only in cities or towns with a significant percentage of Swedish speakers.  Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually only have the original audio, except for children's films, which have both Finnish and Swedish language tracks, in addition to the original audio and subtitles in both languages.

In movie theaters, films for adult audiences have both Finnish and Swedish subtitles, the Finnish printed in basic font and the Swedish printed below the Finnish in a cursive font. In the early ages of television, foreign TV shows and movies were dubbed by one actor in Finland, as in Russian [[Gavrilov translation]].  Later, subtitles became a practice on Finnish television.  Dubbing of films other than children's films is unpopular in Finland, as in many other countries.  A good example is ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.  While the original version was well-received, the Finnish-dubbed version received poor reviews, with some critics even calling it a disaster.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} On the other hand, many dubs of [[Disney]] animated features have been well-received, both critically and by the public.

=====Albania=====
In [[Albania]], foreign films and TV series contain subtitles, while animated movies and children's programs are all dubbed into [[Albanian language]]. Besides that, there are a lot of live-action movies dubbed in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], like (''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)]]'', ''[[Harry Potter (film series)]]'', ''[[Tekken (2010 film)|Tekken]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'' etc.) including religious films and some [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[Brazil]]ian soap operas, like (''[[Por ti (telenovela)|Por Ti]]'', ''[[Celebridade]]'' and ''[[A Casa das Sete Mulheres]]''). Even that they had a huge success, they returned into subtitling them. Albania also uses voice-over, which is used only for documentaries.

=====Greece=====
In [[Greece]], all films are released theatrically in their original versions and contain subtitles.  Only cartoon films (for example, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'' and others) are released in both original and [[Greek language|Greek]]-dubbed versions, for children who cannot yet read quickly or at all.  Foreign TV shows are also shown in their original versions, except for most cartoons.  For example, ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]'' were always dubbed, while ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' are always subtitled and contain the original English dialogue, since they are mostly for adults rather than children. The only television programmes dubbed in Greek includes [[Mexico|Mexican]] TV series (like ''[[Rubí]]'' and ''[[La usurpadora]]'') and teen series (like ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''). However, when [[Skai TV]] was re-launched in April 2006, the network opted for dubbing almost all foreign shows in Greek, unlike other Greek channels which had always broadcast most of the programs in their original language with subtitles, but pressure from viewers and the Greek government forced them to revert to the traditional subtitle methods.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=====Serbia=====
In [[Serbia]] and most other [[Serbian language|Serbian]]-speaking parts of former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], foreign films, TV series and TV news broadcasts are always subtitled, while children's movies and cartoons are dubbed into Serbian.  The dubbing of cartoon series during the 1980s had a twist of its own: famous [[Belgrade]] actors provided the voices for characters of [[Disney]], [[Warner Brothers]], [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]] and other companies, frequently using region-specific phrases and sentences and, thus, adding a dose of local humor to the translation of the original lines.  These phrases became immensely popular and are still being used for [[tongue-in-cheek]] comments in specific situations.

=====Croatia=====
In [[Croatia]], foreign films and TV series are always subtitled, while most children's programs and animated movies are dubbed into [[Croatian language|Croatian]].  Recently, more efforts have been made to introduce dubbing, but public reception has been poor.  Regardless of language, Croatian audiences prefer subtitling to dubbing.  Some previously popular shows (such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'') lost their appeal completely after the practice of dubbing began, and the dubbing was eventually removed from the programs.  This situation is similar with theater movies, with only those intended for children being dubbed (such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[Shark Tale]]''), but they are also regularly shown subtitled as well.  Recently, there has been an effort to impose dubbing by [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]], with ''[[La Fea Más Bella]]'' translated as ''Ružna ljepotica'' (literally, "The Ugly Beauty"), a Mexican telenovela, but it failed.

=====Slovenia=====
In [[Slovenia]], all foreign films and television programmes are subtitled without exception.  Traditionally, children's movies and animated cartoons used to be dubbed.  However, subtitling has gradually spread into that genre, as well.  Currently, only movies for pre-school children remain dubbed. Documentaries with off-screen narrator usually uses dub for narration, on-screen voices are subtitled.

=====Estonia=====
[[Estonian film]]s are shown in the original language with subtitles at cinemas.  Subtitles are usually presented in both Estonian and [[Russian language]]s.  Animated films are commonly shown in both the original language and dubbed into Estonian (or Russian in many cinemas).  Most Estonian-language television channels use subtitles for foreign-language films and TV channels.  However, Russian language channels tend to use dubbing more often, especially for Russian channels broadcast from [[Russia]] (as opposed to Russian channels broadcast from Estonia).

=====Portugal=====
In [[Portugal]], dubbing was banned under a 1948 law as a way of protecting the domestic film industry{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}.  Until 1994, animated movies, as well as other TV series for children shown in Portugal, have imported [[Brazilian Portuguese]] dubs due to the lack of interest from Portuguese companies in the dubbing industry.  This lack of interest was justified, since there were already quality dubbed copies of shows and movies in Portuguese made by [[Brazil]]ians. ''[[The Lion King]]'' was the first feature film to be dubbed in [[European Portuguese]] rather than strictly Brazilian Portuguese. Currently, all movies for children are dubbed in European Portuguese. Subtitles are preferred in Portugal,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} used in every foreign-language [[Documentary film|documentary]], TV series and film.  The exception to this preference is when children are the target audience.

While on TV, children's shows and movies are always dubbed, in cinemas, films with a clear juvenile target can be found in two versions, one dubbed (identified by the letters V.P. for ''versão portuguesa'' - "Portuguese version") and another subtitled version (V.O. for ''versão original'' - "original version").  This duality applies only to juvenile films.  Others use subtitles only.  While the quality of these dubs is recognized (some have already received international recognition and prizes), original versions with subtitles are usually preferred by the adults (''[[Bee Movie]]'', for example).  Dubbing cartoons aimed at adults (such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' or ''[[South Park]]'') is less common.  When ''The Simpsons Movie'' debuted in Portugal, most cinemas showed both versions (V.O. and V.P.), but in some small cities, cinemas decided to offer only the Portuguese version, a decision that led to public protest. Presently, [[live action]] series and movies are always shown in their original language format with Portuguese subtitles. Television programs for young children (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'', etc.) are dubbed into European Portuguese.Some video games aimed at adults (such as [[God of War III]], [[Halo 3]], [[Assassin's Creed III]] and [[inFamous 2]]) are dubbed in European Portuguese, although there they provide an option to select the original language.

====General films and programming====

In the [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language-speaking markets of [[Europe]], almost all foreign films and television shows are dubbed (the exception being the majority of theatrical releases of adult-audience movies in [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], and high-profile videos in Russia).  There are few opportunities to watch foreign movies in their original versions.  In [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], even in the largest cities, there are few cinemas that screen original versions with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], or without any translation.  However, digital [[pay-TV]] programming is often available in the original language, including the latest movies.  Prior to the rise of DVDs, which in these countries are mostly issued with multi-language audio tracks, original-language films (those in languages other than the country's official language) were rare, whether in theaters, on TV, or on home video, and subtitled versions were considered a product for small [[niche market]]s such as intellectual or [[art film]]s.

=====France=====
In [[France]], movies and TV series are always released dubbed in French for TV airing, although they are increasingly also available in their original language with French subtitles.  Films are usually released theatrically in both dubbed and original versions in large cities' main street theaters (except in [[Paris]], where the vast majority of foreign films are shown with subtitles).  A theater showing a subtitled movie typically has a sign on the poster advising moviegoers that the film is an original-language version (usually abbreviated VO [''version originale''] or VOST [''version originale sous-titrée''], as opposed to VF [''version française'']). Normally, the availability of films dubbed or subtitled depends on the characteristics of the films.  American [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] with mainly mixed or negative reviews by critics tend to be only released in dubbed versions, while foreign films with mainly positive reviews are usually available in their original versions. [[Art film|Art house movies]] are often only available in their original version, due to limited distribution.  Some voice talents, such as [[Alexandre Gillet]], [[Roger Carel]], [[Claire Guyot]], [[Céline Monsarrat]], [[Richard Darbois]], [[Jacques Balutin]] and [[Marc Alfos]], have achieved significant popularity.

=====Germany, Austria, and Switzerland=====
The [[German language|Germanophone]] dubbing market is the largest in Europe. Germany has the most foreign-movie-dubbing studios per capita and per given area in the world. In Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], practically all films, shows, television series and foreign [[soap opera]]s are shown in dubbed versions created for the German market.  However, in some of Switzerland's towns and cities (particularly along the language-borders), subtitled versions are common.  Dubbing films is a traditional and common practice in German-speaking Europe, since subtitles are not accepted and used as much as in other European countries.  According to a European study, Austria is the country with the highest rejection rate (more than 70 percent) of subtitles, followed by Italy, Spain and Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
In German-speaking markets, [[PC game|computer]] and video games feature German text menus and are dubbed into the German language if speaking parts exist.

In recent years, Swiss and Austrian television stations have been showing increasing numbers of movies, series and TV-programmes in "dual sound," which means the viewer can choose between the original language (e.g. English) and the language of the channel (German, French or Italian, according to the location).

Although German-speaking [[voice actor]]s play only a secondary role, they are still notable for providing familiar voices to well-known actors.  Famous foreign actors are known and recognized for their [[German language|German]] voice, and the German audience is used to them, so dubbing is also a matter of authenticity. However, in larger cities, there are theaters where movies can be seen in their original versions, as [[English language|English]] has become somewhat more popular among young educated viewers. On German [[mainstream]] television, films are never broadcast with subtitles, but pay-per-view programming is often available in the original language. Subtitled niche and [[art film]]s are sometimes aired on smaller networks.

German-dubbed versions sometimes diverge greatly from the original, especially in adding humorous elements to the original. In extreme cases, such as ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', the dubbed version was more successful than the English original. Often, translation adds [[sexually explicit]] gags the U.S. versions might not be allowed to use.  For example, in ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', the translators changed ''"The [[Door hanger|Do Not Disturb sign]] will hang on the door tonight"'' to ''"The only hanging thing tonight will be the Do Not Disturb sign"''.

Some movies dubbed in Austria diverge from the German Standard version in addressing other people but only when the movies are dubbed into certain Austrian dialect versions. (Mr. and Mrs. are translated into Herr and Frau which is usually not translated in order to be in lip-sync).
Sometimes even English pronounced first names are translated and are pronounced into the correct German equivalent (English name "Bert" became Southern German pronounced name "Bertl" which is an abbreviation of "Berthold".)

Some movies dubbed before [[German reunification|reunification]] exist in different versions for the [[East Germany|east]] and the [[West Germany|west]].  They use different translations, and often differ in the style of dubbing.

=====Italy=====
In [[Italy]], dubbing is systematic, with a tradition going back to the 1930s in [[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Florence]] and [[Turin]]. In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] fascist Italy, release of foreign languages movies was banned for political reasons. Rome is the principal base of the dubbing industry, where major productions such as movies, drama, documentaries and some cartoons are dubbed. However, dubbing in Milan is mostly of cartoons and some minor productions. Practically every foreign film (mostly American ones) of every genre, for children or adults, as well as TV shows, are dubbed into Italian. In big cities, original-version movies can also be seen in some theaters. Subtitles may be available on [[Late night television|late-night programs]] on mainstream TV channels, and on pay-TV all movies are available in the original language with Italian subtitles, many shows featuring their original [[soundtrack]]s.

Early in their careers, actors such as [[Alberto Sordi]] or [[Nino Manfredi]] worked extensively as dubbing actors. At one point, common practice in Italian cinema was to shoot scenes [[MOS (filmmaking)|MOS]] (motor only sync or motor only shot) and dub the dialogue in post-production. A notable example of this practice is ''[[The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]]'', in which all actors had to dub in their own voices.

Video games are generally either dubbed into Italian (for instance [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]] saga, [[Halo (series)|Halo]] or [[Harry Potter (video games)|Harry Potter]] series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Italian language.

A list of the voice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in Italian can be enlisted here.

=====Czech Republic and Slovakia=====
In the [[Czech Republic]] generally all foreign films released on home media are provided with Czech dubbing. All television channels (both free and paid) broadcast foreign films and series dubbed - with only very rare exceptions. Films in cinemas are usually provided only with subtitles, but some films like family films, children films and major film series (especially those in 3D) are also dubbed, and subtitled version is available only in a few cinemas.  There is also common that well known foreign actors are usually dubbed by one individual Czech voice actor; for instance [[Clint Eastwood]] has been dubbed by Ladislav Županič in 39 of 42 films distributed in the Czech Republic.

In [[Slovakia]] home media market, Czech dubbed versions are widely used, with only children's films that were dubbed for cinema are released with Slovak dubbing. Czech dubbing was also extensively used in broadcast of Slovak television channels, but since 2007 Slovak language law require any newer shows to be provided with Slovak localization (dubbing or subtitles), so since then televisions broadcast newer films and shows with Slovak dubbing. Older material still their Czech dubbing, as most audiences were used to it than adjusting to a newer, lesser quality Slovak dubbing.

=====Poland=====
In [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows.  These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack.  This method, called "juxtareading," is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference—all dialogues are translated with only one acute, and usually male voice, preferably deep and neutral, that does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background.  To some extent, it resembles live translation.  Certain highly qualified lectors are traditionally assigned to a particular kind of production, such as action or drama.  Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.

Poland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars.  In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930).  In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[Łódź]].  The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).

The Polish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronization.  The Polish dialogues were unclear, so people could not understand them.  Cinemas had an old aperture that sometimes made a film more unclear than it was.  In the 1950s, the Polish publicist discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.

The number of dubbed movies and the quality improved.  Polish dubbing had a golden age in the 1960s-1980s.  Approximately one-third of foreign movies were dubbed in the cinemas.  The "Polish dubbing school" was known for its high quality.  In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world.  The most important person who initiated high quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz.  Her works were as good as the originals and sometimes even better.  In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular.  The Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.

In the 1980s, due to budget cuts, television did not have money for tapes, so they used the actual recordings.  After the first emission, dubbing was cancelled.  In the era of [[communism]], almost 1,000 films were dubbed.  In the 1990s, after capitalist transformation, Polish television TVP was still dubbing films and TV series.  Unfortunately, as in the 1980s, it was a dubbing only for one emission.

In 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched.  In its first years, it dubbed 30% of the schedule.  They dubbed very ambitious films and popular TV series.  One of the most well-known and popular dubbings was the Polish dub of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]''. Unfortunately, they stopped dubbing ''Friends'' in 2001, and stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions.  In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]].  They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''.  Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001.  In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.

Currently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humor.  Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice.  In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either lector or dubbed Polish track.  The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.

Since theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, The Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for theater releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska – former distributor of Disney’s films – decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]].

=====Georgia=====
In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], original soundtracks are kept in TV series and films, and Georgian voice-over translation is spoken by a [[lector]].

=====Russia=====
[[Russian language|Russian]] television is generally dubbed, but in the cases using voice-over dub technique with only a couple of voice actors, with the original speech still audible underneath. In the [[Soviet Union]], most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed. Voice-over dub was inveted in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1980's when with the fall of the regime, many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden, or at least questionable under communist rule, started to flood in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way.  For example, the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being copied, using primitive equipment.  The quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfering with the original voices, background sounds leaked into the track, translation was inaccurate and, most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person who usually lacked the intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. This method of translation exerted a strong influence on Russian pop culture.  Voices of translators became recognizable for generations.

In modern Russia, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality, and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices.

Video games are generally either dubbed into Russian (for instance The Legend of Spyro trilogy, Skylanders series, Assassin's Creed saga, Halo or Harry Potter series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Russian language.

=====Ukraine=====
In [[Ukraine]], television and cinema is usually dubbed with the overdubbing technique, with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices.  But for Russian films, subtitles are possible.  Russian-language TV programs are usually not dubbed.

=====Latvia and Lithuania=====
In [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], voice-over dubbing is hugely popular on television.  Almost all shows are voice-over dubbed. This dubbing method is similar to the Polish method—one person reads the whole translated text, while the original sound plays at a low volume in the background.  In cinemas, only children's animated films (such as ''[[The Tale of Despereaux (film)|The Tale of Despereaux]]'') and children's live-action films (such as ''[[Charlotte's Web (2006 film)|Charlotte's Web]]'') are dubbed in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] languages. But some other kids shows, like [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], use the voiceover dub.

=====Spain=====
In [[Spain]], practically all foreign television programs are shown dubbed in [[Spanish language|European Spanish]], as are most films.  Some dubbing actors have achieved popularity for their voices, such as [[Constantino Romero]] (who dubs [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s [[The Terminator|Terminator]], among others) and [[Óscar Muñoz (filmmaking)|Óscar Muñoz]] (the official European Spanish dub-over voice artist for [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Hayden Christensen]]).

In [[Catalonia]], the [[Valencian Community]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, many or most foreign programs are also dubbed into their own languages, different from European Spanish.  Currently, with the spread of [[digital terrestrial television]], viewers can choose between the original and the dubbed soundtracks for most movies and television.
Films from Spanish-speaking America are shown in their original language, while strong regional accents (from the Americas or from Spain) may be subtitled in news and documentaries.

===Americas===

====United States and English-speaking Canada====
In the [[United States]] and most of [[Canada]] outside [[Quebec]], foreign films shown in theaters (such as ''[[Metropolis (anime)|Metropolis]]'' and ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur 2006]]'') are usually subtitled.  The exceptions are [[tokusatsu]] and [[daikaiju]] films, which are dubbed when imported into the U.S.  However, the poor quality of the dubbing of these films has become the subject of mockery.  A small number of British films have been dubbed when released in America due to dialects used with which Americans are not familiar (for example, ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' and ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'').  In addition, British children's shows (such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'') are re-dubbed with American voice actors, making the series more understandable for American children. Conversely, British programs shown in Canada are not re-dubbed.

Televised Japanese [[anime]] is almost always aired in its dubbed format, regardless of its content or target age group.  The exceptions to this practice are either when an English dub has not been produced for the program (usually in the case of feature films) or when the program is being presented by a network that places importance on presenting it in its original format (as was the case when [[Turner Classic Movies]] aired several of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s works, which were presented both dubbed and subtitled).  Most [[anime]] DVDs contain options for original Japanese, Japanese with subtitles, and English-dubbed, except for a handful of series that have been heavily edited or [[Americanized]].  In addition, Disney has a policy that makes its directors undergo stages to perfect alignment of certain lip movements so the movie looks believable.

====Spanish-speaking countries====
For Spanish-speaking countries, all foreign-language programs, films, cartoons and documentaries shown in free aired TV channels are dubbed into [[Standard Spanish|Neutral Spanish]], while on [[Cable television|cable]] and [[Satellite television|satellite]] pan-regional channels, films are either dubbed or subtitled. In theaters, only films made for children are dubbed into [[Standard Spanish|Neutral Spanish]] (sometimes with Mexican pronunciation) and sometimes dubbed into local Spanish.

====Mexico====
In [[Mexico]], by law, films shown in theaters must be shown in their original version. Films in languages other than Spanish are usually subtitled. Only educational documentaries and movies rated for children, as well as some movies that are expected to have a wide audience (for example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' or ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'') may be dubbed, but this is not compulsory, and some animated films are shown in theaters in both dubbed and subtitled versions (for instance, some [[DreamWorks]] productions).

Dubbing must be made in Mexico by Mexican nationals or foreigners residing in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ley Federal de Cinematografía|language=Spanish|trans_title=Federal Law of Filmmaking|publisher=Cámara de Diputados|date=2010-04-28|accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref> However, several programs that are shown on pay TV are dubbed in other countries like [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]] or [[Colombia]].

Most movies released on DVD feature [[Standard Spanish|neutral Spanish]] as a language option, and sometimes feature a specific dub for Mexican audiences (for example, ''Rio'').  Foreign programs are dubbed on [[broadcast television systems|broadcast TV]], while on [[pay TV]] most shows and movies are subtitled.

Dubbing became very popular in the 1990s with the rise in popularity of anime in Mexico.  Some voice actors have become celebrities and are always identified with specific characters, such as [[Mario Castañeda]] (who became popular by dubbing [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'') or [[Humberto Vélez]] (who dubbed [[Homer Simpson]] in the first 15 seasons of ''[[The Simpsons]]'').

The popularity of pay TV has allowed people to view several series in their original language rather than dubbed. Dubbing has been criticized for the use of TV or movie stars as voice actors (such as [[Ricky Martin]] on Disney’s ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', or [[Eugenio Derbez]] on DreamWorks' ''Shrek''), or for the incorrect use of local popular culture that sometimes creates unintentional jokes or breaks the feeling of the original work (such as translating [[Sheldon Cooper]]'s "Bazinga!" to "¡Vacilón!").

Several video games have been dubbed into neutral Spanish, rather than European Spanish, in Mexico (such as the ''Gears of War'' series, ''Halo 3'', ''Infamous 2'' and others). [[Sony]] recently announced that more games (such as ''God of War: Ascension'') will be dubbed into neutral Spanish.

====Peru====

In [[Peru]], on broadcast TV, all foreign series, movies, and cartoons, are shown dubbed in Spanish normally from Mexico, but also from Colombia and Venezuela. In cinemas, all movies for children are shown dubbed, while movies aimed at older audiences have both dubbed and subtitled versions. Pay TV stations show both dubbed and subtitled version on some films (mainly older adult films). Peru does have not their own dubbing studios, therefore Mexican dubbing is widely used, and some of the words or phrases in the dialogues are based on this variety, like on [[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]], which used the words "rola" instead "canción", "loser" instead of "perdedor", "platicar" rather than "conversar" or "hablar", etc.

====Brazil====
In [[Brazil]], foreign programs are invariably dubbed into [[Brazilian Portuguese]] on broadcast TV, with only a few exceptions. Films shown at cinemas are generally offered with both subtitled and dubbed versions, with dubbing frequently being the only choice for children's movies.  Subtitling was primarily for adult audience movies until 2012.  Since then, dubbed versions also became available for all ages. As a result, in recent years, more cinemas have opened in Brazil, attracting new audiences to the cinema who prefer dubbing.<ref>[http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cultura/noticia/2012/05/27/cresce-preferencia-por-filmes-dublados-nos-cinemas-brasileiros-344927.php Cresce preferência por filmes dublados nos cinemas brasileiros (in Portuguese)] Ne10, May 27, 2012. Retrieved August 17, 2012.</ref> Pay TV commonly offers both dubbed and subtitled movies, with statistics showing that dubbed versions are becoming predominant.<ref>[http://oglobo.globo.com/revista-da-tv/dublagem-em-canais-de-tv-paga-provoca-polemica-3262532 Dublagem em canais de TV paga provoca polêmica (in Portuguese)] O Globo, November 20, 2011. Retrieved August 17, 2012.</ref> Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually feature Portuguese, Spanish, and the original audio along with subtitles in native languages. Most video games are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese rather than having European Portuguese dubs alone. Games such as ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[God of War: Ascension]]'', ''[[inFamous 2]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and others are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese. This is because despite the dropping of the dubbing law in Portugal in 1994, most companies in that country use the Brazilian Portuguese because of traditional usage during the days of the dubbing rule, along with these dubbings being more marketable than European Portuguese.

A list that showcases Brazilian Portuguese voice artists that dub for actors and actresses are displayed here. However, there can also be different official dub artists for certain regions within Brazil.

====French-speaking Canada====
In [[Quebec|Québec]], [[Canada]], most films and TV programs in English are dubbed into [[Standard French]], occasionally with [[Québec French]] idiosyncrasies.  Occasionally, the dubbing of a series or a movie, such as ''The Simpsons'', is made using the more widely spoken ''[[joual]]'' variety of Québec French. Dubbing has the advantage of making children's films and TV series more comprehensible to younger audiences.  However, many [[bilingual]] Québécois prefer subtitling, since they would understand some or all of the original audio.  In addition, all films are shown in English, as well in certain theaters (especially in major cities and English-speaking areas such as the [[West Island]]), and some theatres, such as the Scotiabank Cinema [[Montreal]], show only movies in English.  Most American television series are only available in English on [[DVD]], or on English-language channels, but some of the more popular ones have French dubs shown on mainstream networks, and are released in French on DVD as well, sometimes separately from an English-only version.

Formerly, all French-language dubbed films in Québec were imported from France and some still are.  Such a practice was criticized by former politician [[Mario Dumont]] after he took his children to see the [[Standard French|Parisian French]] dub of ''Shrek the Third'', which Dumont found incomprehensible.  After his complaints and a proposed bill, ''[[Bee Movie]]'', the film from [[DreamWorks Animation]], was dubbed in Québec, making it the studio's first animated film to have a Québec French dub, as all DreamWorks Animation films had previously been dubbed in France. In terms of Disney, the first Disney animated movie to be dubbed in Québec was ''Oliver and Company.'' The Disney Renaissance films were also dubbed in Québec except for ''The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King.''<ref>{{cite web|title=Drôle d'abeille (v.o.a) Bee Movie|url=http://doublage.qc.ca/showMovie.php?id=1981|work=Doublage.qc.ca|publisher=idgrafix|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Doublage.qc.ca|language=French}}</ref>

In addition, because Canadian viewers usually find Québec French more comprehensible than other dialects of the language, some older film series that had the French-language versions of previous installments dubbed in France have had later ones dubbed in Québec, often creating inconsistencies within the French version of the series' canon. [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series are examples. Both series had films released in the 1970s and 1980s, with no Québécois French dubbed versions; instead, the Parisian French versions, with altered character and object names and terms, were distributed in the province.  However, later films in both series released 1999 and later were dubbed in Québec, using different voice actors and "reversing" name changes made in France's dubbings due to the change in studio.

====China====
[[China]] has a long tradition of dubbing foreign films into [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], starting in the 1930s. While during the [[Republic of China]] era Western motion pictures may have been imported and dubbed into Chinese, since 1950 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet movies]], dubbed primarily in Shanghai, became the main import.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1987|p=40}}</ref> Beginning in the late 1970s, in addition to films, popular TV series from the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[Brazil]], and [[Mexico]] were also dubbed.  The [[Shanghai]] Film Dubbing Studio has been the most well-known studio in the film dubbing industry in China. In order to generate high-quality products, they divide each film into short segments, each one lasting only a few minutes, and then work on the segments one-by-one. In addition to the correct meaning in translation, they make tremendous effort to match the lips of the actors to the dialogue.  As a result, the dubbing in these films generally is not readily detected.  The cast of dubbers is acknowledged at the end of a dubbed film.  Several dubbing actors and actresses of the Shanghai Film Dubbing Studio have become well-known celebrities, such as Qiu Yuefeng, Bi Ke, Li Zi, and Liu Guangning. In recent years, however, especially in the larger cities on the east and south coasts, it has become increasingly common for movie theaters to show subtitled versions with the original soundtracks intact.

Motion pictures are also dubbed into the languages of some of China's [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous regions]].

In the early decades, it would dub 25 to 30 movies each year, the number rising to 60-75 by the early 2010s.<ref name=humes20131122/><ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2013-02/24/content_28045511.htm China Focus: Dubbed movies spice up life for Tibetans], ''Xinhua'', 2013-02-24.</ref>

====Taiwan====
[[Taiwan]] dubs some foreign films and TV series in Mandarin Chinese. Until the mid-1990s, the major national [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial channels]] both dubbed and subtitled all foreign programs and films and, for some popular programs, the original voices were offered in [[Second audio program]].  Gradually, however, both terrestrial and cable channels stopped dubbing for [[prime time]] U.S. shows and films, while subtitling continued.

In the 2000s, the dubbing practice has differed depending on the nature and origin of the program. Animations, children's shows and some educational programs on PTS are mostly dubbed.  English live-action movies and shows are not dubbed in theaters or on television. Japanese TV dramas are no longer dubbed, while [[Korean language|Korean]] dramas, [[Hong Kong]] dramas and dramas from other Asian countries are still often dubbed. Korean variety shows are not dubbed.  Japanese and Korean films on Asian movie channels are still dubbed.  In theaters, most foreign films are not dubbed, while animated films and some films meant for children offer a dubbed version.  Hong Kong live-action films have a long tradition of being dubbed into Mandarin, while more famous films offer a [[Cantonese]] version.

====Hong Kong====
In [[Hong Kong]], foreign television programmes, except for English-language and Mandarin television programmes, are dubbed in Cantonese. English-language and Mandarin programmes are generally shown in their original with subtitles. Foreign films, such as most live-action and animated films (such as anime and Disney), are usually dubbed in Cantonese.

For the most part, foreign films and TV programmes, both live-action and animated, are generally dubbed in both Mandarin and Cantonese. For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film series, Elijah Wood's character [[Frodo Baggins]] was dubbed into Mandarin by [[Jiang Guangtao]] for China and Taiwan.  For the Cantonese localization, there were actually two dubs for Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. The first Cantonese dub, he was voiced by Leung Wai Tak, with a second Cantonese dub released, he was voiced by Bosco Tang.

A list for Mandarin and Cantonese voice artists that dub for actors are shown here.

====Israel====
In [[Israel]], only children's movies and TV programming are dubbed in [[Hebrew]].  In programs aimed at teenagers and adults, dubbing is rarely considered for translation, not only because of its high costs, but also because the audience is mainly multi-lingual. Most viewers in Israel speak at least one European language in addition to Hebrew, and a large part of the audience also speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Therefore, most viewers prefer to hear the original soundtrack, aided by Hebrew subtitles. Another problem is that dubbing does not allow for translation into two different languages simultaneously, as is often the case of Israeli television channels that use subtitles in Hebrew and another language (like [[Russian language|Russian]]) simultaneously.

====Japan====
In [[Japan]], many television programs appear on Japanese television subtitled or dubbed if they are intended for children. When the American film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' was released in Japan in 1931, subtitles became the mainstream method of translating TV programs and films in Japan.  Later, around the 1950s, foreign television programs and films began to be shown dubbed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] on television. The first foreign cartoon to be dubbed into Japanese, was [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|the 1940s Superman cartoons]] in 1955.

Due to the lack of video software for domestic television, video software was imported from abroad.  When the television program was shown on television, it was mostly dubbed.  There was a character limit for a small TV screen at a lower resolution, and this method was not suitable for the poor elderly and illiterate eye, as was audio dubbing.  Presently, TV shows and movies (both those aimed at all ages and adults-only) are shown dubbed with the original language and Japanese subtitles, while providing the original language option when the same film is released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]].

Adult cartoons such as ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[South Park]]'' are shown dubbed in Japanese on the [[WOWOW]] TV channel. ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' was dubbed in Japanese by different actors instead of the same Japanese dubbing-actors from the cartoon because it was handled by a different Japanese dubbing studio, and it was marketed for the [[Kansai region|Kansai]] market. In Japanese theaters, foreign-language movies, except those intended for children, are usually shown in their original version with Japanese subtitles.  Foreign films usually contain multiple Japanese-dubbing versions, but with several different original Japanese-dubbing voice actors, depending upon which TV station they are aired. [[NHK]], [[Nippon TV]], [[Fuji TV]], [[TV Asahi]], and [[TBS (TV Channel)|TBS]] usually follow this practice, as do software releases on [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]].  There are some film theaters in Japan that show both dubbed and subtitled editions of foreign films.

On June 22, 2009, [[20th Century Fox]]'s Japanese division has opened up a [[Blu-Ray]] lineup known as: "Emperor of Dubbing", a line dedicated by having multiple Japanese dubs of popular English-language films (mostly Hollywood films) as well as retaining the original scripts, and would release them altogether in special Blu-Ray releases. These also feature a new dub created exclusively for that release as a director's cut, or a new dub made with a better surround sound mix to match that of the original English mix (as most older Japanese dubbings were made on mono mixes to be aired on TV). Other companies like Universal Pictures's Japanese division [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]] opened up: "Reprint of Memories" along with [[:ja:ワーナー エンターテイメント ジャパン|Warner Bros Japan]] having "Power of Dubbing" which act similar by re-packaging all the multiple Japanese dubs of popular films and put them out as Special Blu-ray releases.

====South Korea====
In [[South Korea]], anime that are imported from Japan are generally shown dubbed in Korean on television.  However, some anime is censored, such as Japanese letters or content being edited for a suitable Korean audience.  Western cartoons are dubbed in Korean as well, such as [[Nickelodeon]] cartoons like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Danny Phantom]]''.  Several English-language (mostly [[United States|American]]) live-action films are dubbed in [[Korean language|Korean]], but they are not shown in theaters.  Instead they are only broadcast on South Korean television networks ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]], [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]]), while DVD import releases of these films are shown with Korean subtitles.  This may be due to the fact that the six American [[major film studio]]s may not own any rights to the Korean dubs of their live-action films that the Korean television networks have dubbed and aired.  Even if they don't own the rights, Korean or non-Korean viewers can record from Korean-dubbed live-action films from television broadcasting onto DVDs with [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]].

Sometimes, video games are dubbed in Korean.  Examples would be the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]''series, the ''[[Jak & Daxter (series)|Jak & Daxter]]'' series, and the ''[[God of War (series)|God of War]]'' series. For the ''Halo'' games, Lee Jeong Gu provides his Korean voice to the main protagonist [[Characters of Halo|Master Chief]] (replacing [[Steve Downes]]'s voice), while [[Kim So Hyeong (voice actor)|Kim So Hyeong]] voices [[Characters of Halo|Chieftain Tartarus]], one of the main antagonists (replacing [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]'s voice).

The following South Korean voice-over artists are usually identified with the following actors:

====Thailand====
In [[Thailand]], foreign television programs are dubbed in [[Thai Language|Thai]], but the original soundtrack is often simultaneously carried on a [[NICAM]] audio track on terrestrial broadcast, and alternate audio tracks on satellite broadcast. Previously, terrestrial stations simulcasted the original soundtrack on the radio.  On pay-TV, many channels carry foreign-language movies and television programs with subtitles.  Movie theaters in [[Bangkok]] and some larger cities show both the subtitled version and the dubbed version of English-language movies. In big cities like Bangkok, Thai-language movies have English subtitles. <!-- For English-language animated movies, Disney films like ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Tangled]]'' are dubbed entirely in Thai.

Chonnai Sukawat has provided the Thai-dubbing voice for the heroine Rapunzel in the film ''Tangled''.  In the Thai version of ''Harry Potter'', [[Hermione Granger]] was dubbed by Thai singer and actress Bismillah Nana.  Many English-language movies are sold on [[VCD]]s in Thailand, with the original English language and Thai subtitles, while also available with the Thai-language-dubbed version, such as ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', the ''Harry Potter'' film series, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series.  Thai [[Thai television soap opera|lakorns]] have English subtitles if broadcast on international television channels or are sold as DVD abroad. -->

This list features a collection of Thai voice actors and actresses that have dubbed for these featured performers.

====Indonesia====
Unlike movie theaters in most Asian countries, those in Indonesia show foreign movies with subtitles. Then a few years or months later, those movies appear on tv either dubbed in Indonesian or subtitled. Kids shows are mostly dubbed, even though in cartoon series, songs aren't dubbed, but in big movies such as Disney movies, both speaking and singing voice were cast for the new Indonesian dub even though it took maybe a few months or even years for the movie to come out, they mostly come out in middle-quality dub because it only appeared on TV, not on cinemas. Adult films was mostly subtitled, but sometimes they can be dubbed as well, because there aren't many Indonesian voices, mostly in dubbed movies, three character can have exactly the same voice.

Reality shows never dubbed in Indonesian, because it was not a planned-interaction such as in movies, so if they appear in TV, it will be appear with subtitles on it.

====Philippines====
In the [[Philippines]], Japanese anime are usually dubbing in [[Filipino language|Tagalog]] or another Philippine regional language.  The channel [[Hero (TV channel)|HERO TV]], which focuses on anime and [[tokusatsu]] shows, dubs all its foreign programs into Tagalog. [[Animax]], meanwhile, has their anime programs dubbing in English.  Also popular in the Philippines are Chinese, Korean, and Mexican dramas, which are called ''Chinovelas'', ''Koreanovelas'', and ''Mexicanovelas'', respectively.  All of these dramas are dubbing in Tagalog or another Philippine regional language, with its unique set of Filipino-speaking voice actors.

The prevalence of media needing to be dubbing has resulted in a talent pool that is very capable of syncing voice to lip, especially for shows broadcast by the country's three largest networks.  It is not uncommon in the Filipino dub industry to have most of the voices in a series dubbing by only a handful of voice talents.  Normally, English-language programs are usually not dubbing, because most Filipinos can understand English.  Notable exceptions are a number of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Disney Channel]] cartoons shown on [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]], which are dubbing in Tagalog or another Philippine regional language. Also [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|animated Disney films]] are often dubbing in Tagalog, except for the singing parts, which retains its original language. TV5, [[ABS-CBN]], and [[GMA Network]] are the three largest networks in the country that air English-language movies dubbing in Tagalog. [[Cinema One]], ABS-CBN's cable movie channel, shows movies mostly in [[Korea]] and [[Thailand]] dubbing in Tagalog. [[Nat Geo Wild]] airs most programs dubbing in Tagalog for Philippine audiences, one of the few cable channels to do so. [[Tagalized Movie Channel]] airs Hollywood and Asian movies dubbing in Tagalog. [[Fox Filipino]] airs some English, Latin, and Asian series dubbing in Tagalog such as [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]], La Teniente, Kdabra, and some selected programs from [[Channel M (Southeast Asia)|Channel M]]. [[GMA News TV]] airs some English-language documentaries, movies, and reality series dubbing in Tagalog.

A list of voice actors with their associates that they dub into Tagalog are listed here.

====Mongolia====
In [[Mongolia]], most television dubbing uses the Russian method, with only a few voice actors and the original language audible underneath. In movie theaters, foreign films are shown in their original language with [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] subtitles.

====India====
In [[India]], where "foreign films" are synonymous with "[[Hollywood]] films", dubbing is done mostly in three Indian languages, including [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]].  Dubbing of foreign languages is rarely done with the other major Indian languages, namely [[Malayalam]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], due to the high literacy rate among the population who speak the languages. The finished works are released into the towns and lower tier settlements of the respective states (where English penetration is low), often with the English-language originals released in the metropolitan areas. In all other states, the English originals are released along with the dubbed versions, where often the dubbed version collections are more outstanding than the originals. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' was also done in the [[Bhojpuri language]], a language popular in [[East India|eastern India]] in addition to Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'', the most recent installment in the ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, was the first ever Hollywood film to receive a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi language dub]] as well.

Most TV channels mention neither the Indian-language dubbing credits, nor its staff, at the end of the original ending credits, since changing the credits casting for the original actors or voice actors involves a huge budget for modifying, making it somewhat difficult to find information for the dubbed versions.  The same situation is encountered for films. Sometimes foreign programs and films receive more than one dub, such as for example, [[Jumanji]], [[Dragonheart]] and [[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]] having two Hindi dubs. Information for the Hindi, Tamil and Telugu voice actors who have done the voices for specific actors and for their roles on foreign films and television programs are published in local Indian data magazines, for those that are involved in the dubbing industry in India.  But on a few occasions, there are some foreign productions that do credit the dubbing cast, such as animated films like the ''[[Barbie (film series)|Barbie]]'' films, and some Disney films. [[Disney Channel]] original series released on DVD with their Hindi dubs show a list of the artists in the Hindi dub credits, after the original ending credits. Theatrical releases and VCD releases of foreign films do not credit the dubbing cast or staff.  The DVD releases, however, do have credits for the dubbing staff, if they are released multilingual. As of recently, information for the dubbing staff of foreign productions have been slowly been posted online for people to see, as it continues to expand more. For a list of Indian voice-dubbing artists, click [[List of Indian dubbing artists|here]]. A few Indian dubbing artists are listed in the table below.

====Pakistan====

In [[Pakistan]] "foreign films", and cartoons are not dubbed however [[Hindi]] dubbed foreign films, anime and cartoons from India are exclusively used as Hindi is [[Mutually Intelligible]] with [[Urdu]], the national language of Pakistan. Channels for kids in Pakistan like [[Nickelodeon Pakistan]] and [[Cartoon Network Pakistan]] air their shows in Hindi that are dubbed in India.
In Pakistan dubbing is only done for foreign language soap operas (mostly Turkish) in Urdu by some TV channels although the dubbing quality is medium because these are dubbed for TV not for cinemas.

====Vietnam====
In [[Vietnam]], foreign-language films and programs are subtitled on television in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].  They were not dubbed until 1985, but are briefly translated with a speaker before commercial breaks. ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' was considered to be the very first American Hollywood film to be entirely dubbed in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].  Since then, children's films that came out afterwards have been released dubbed in theaters. [[HTV3]] has dubbed television programs for children, including ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'',  and ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]'', by using various voice actors to dub over the character roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsKD5PrgSEA |title=Ben 10 Vietnamese Trailer (Trailer Ben 10 - HTV3) |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbgyJP5-TA |title=HTV3 - Cẩm Nang Của Ned - Trailer |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2012-08-10 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref>

Sooner afterwards, more programs started to get dubbed. HTV3 also offers anime dubbed into Vietnamese. [[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]] got a Vietnamese dub in early 2014 on HTV3 starting with the Best Wishes series. But due to a controversy regarding Pokémon's cries being re-dubbed despite that all characters had their Japanese names, it was switched to [[VTV2]] on September 2015 when the XY series debut. [[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]] also recently has been dubbed for HTV3 in Early 2015.

====Singapore====
In multilingual [[Singapore]], English-language programmes on the free-to-air terrestrial channels are usually subtitled in Chinese or Malay, while Chinese, Malay and Tamil programmes (except for news bulletins), especially during the prime time hours are almost always subtitled in English. [[Dual sound]] programs, such as Korean and Japanese dramas, offer sound in the original languages with subtitles, Mandarin-dubbed and subtitled, or English-dubbed.  The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign|deliberate policy to encourage Mandarin]] among citizens made it required by law for programs in other Chinese dialects ([[Min Nan|Hokkien]], Cantonese and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]) to be dubbed into Mandarin, with the exception of traditional [[opera]]s.  Cantonese and Hokkien shows from Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively, are available on VCD and DVD.  In a recent development, news bulletins are subtitled.

====Iran====
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}

In [[Iran]], foreign films and television programs are dubbed in [[Persian language|Persian]].  Dubbing began in 1946 with the advent of movies and cinemas in the country.  Since then, foreign movies have always been dubbed for the cinema and TV.  Using various voice actors and adding local hints and witticisms to the original contents, dubbing played a major role in attracting people to the cinemas and developing an interest in other cultures.  The dubbing art in Iran reached its apex during the 1960s and 1970s with the inflow of American, European and Hindi movies.

The most famous musicals of the time, such as ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', were translated, adjusted and performed in Persian by the voice artists.  Since the 1990s, for political reasons and under pressure from the state, the dubbing industry has declined, with movies dubbed only for the state TV channels.  During recent years, DVDs with Persian subtitles have found a market among viewers for the same reason, but most people still prefer the Persian-speaking dubbed versions.  Recently, privately operated companies started dubbing TV series by hiring famous dubbers.

A List of Persian voice actors that associate with their actor counterparts are listed here.

===Africa===

====The Maghreb====
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
In [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]], most foreign movies (especially Hollywood productions) are shown dubbed in French.  These movies are usually imported directly from French film distributors.  The choice of movies dubbed into French can be explained by the history of colonization of these countries by France and the widespread use of the French language (among the intellectual elite), in addition to the marginalization of one national language.  Another important factor is that local theaters and private media companies do not dub in local languages in order to avoid high costs, but also because of the lack of both expertise and demand.

Beginning in the 1980s, dubbed series and movies for children in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] became a popular choice among most TV channels, cinemas and VHS/DVD stores.  However, dubbed films are still imported, and dubbing is performed in Arab countries with a strong tradition of dubbing and subtitling (mainly [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]]).  The evolution of movies targeting the adult audience was different.  After the satellite boom in the [[Arab world]] and the emergence of Pan-Arab channels, the use of subtitles, which was already popular in the [[Middle East]], was highly popular among local viewers in Algeria and Morocco.

In the Arab world (member states in [[North Africa]], [[Western Asia]] and others), only children's films and TV series were dubbed in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].  Many different anime titles are dubbed in the Arabic language, as well.  Everything else is usually shown in its original language with Arabic subtitles.  Recently, The Arabic dubbing industry has boomed, and channels such as [[MBC Max]], are now offering famous older action films aimed at an older audience dubbed in Arabic to be broadcast on television.  Action movies such as ''[[Braveheart (film)|Braveheart]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy and ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' have become some of the first foreign action titles to be dubbed in Arabic, rather than using subtitles, on the [[MBC Max]] channel.  However, they can still be watched in their original language with subtitles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waleg.com/archives/017759.html |title=Blockbuster Movies in Arabic on MBC |publisher=Waleg.com |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>

There's even a list that showcases Arabic voice actors that dub for certain performers that associate with them.

In [[Tunisia]], theaters usually show French-dubbed movies, but cinema attendance in the country for such movies is in continuous decline compared to Tunisian and Arab movies.  This decline can be traced to the huge popularity of free-to-air [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arab]] movie channels offering primarily subtitled content, and the government's reduced efforts to limit piracy.  Tunisia National Television (TNT), the public broadcaster of Tunisia, is not allowed to show any content in any language other than Arabic, which forces it to broadcast only dubbed content (this restriction was recently removed for commercials).  During the 1970s and 1980s, TNT (known as ERTT at the time) started dubbing famous cartoons in Tunisian and Standard Arabic.  This move was highly successful locally, but was not able to compete with mainstream dubbing companies (especially in the Middle East).  In the private sector, television channels are not subject to the language rule and sometimes broadcast foreign content dubbed into French (excluding children content), although some of them, such as [[Hannibal TV]], started adopting subtitling in Arabic instead, which proved to be more popular than simply importing French-dubbed content.

====South Africa====
In [[South Africa]], many television programmes were dubbed in [[Afrikaans]], with the original soundtrack (usually in English, but sometimes Dutch or German) "[[simulcast]]" in [[FM stereo#Stereo FM|FM stereo]] on Radio 2000.  These included US series such as ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''(Steve Austin: Die Man van Staal)''<ref>[http://www.tvsa.co.za/mastershowinfo.asp?mastershowid=2293 The Six Million Dollar Man], TVSA - The South African TV Authority</ref> ''[[Miami Vice]]'' ''(Misdaad in Miami)'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Shows Allow Blacks, Whites to Share Cultural Experiences : South African Viewers Get a Mixed TV Message From U.S. Programs|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-25/news/mn-7271_1_south-african|accessdate=14 August 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=25 May 1986|author=GLENN FRANKEL (from ''The Washington Post'')}}</ref> ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]''.,<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/1996-02-09-the-critics-thumbs-up/ The critics' thumbs-up], ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'', 9 February 1996</ref> and the German detective series ''[[Derrick (TV series)|Derrick]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=BfdyVOHALcLbO4nNgMgD&id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&dq=derrick+tv+series+afrikaans&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=derrick+|title=Mass Media, Towards the Millennium|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref>

This practice has declined as a result of the reduction of airtime for the language on [[SABC]] TV, and the increase of locally produced material in Afrikaans on other channels like [[KykNet]].

Similarly, many programmes, such as ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', were dubbed into [[Zulu language|Zulu]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Lelyveld |first=Joseph |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/magazine/22SAFR.html?&pagewanted=all |title=South Africa: Dream and Reality |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=1985-09-22 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}</ref> but this has also declined as local drama production has increased.

As a result of the [[boycott]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] actors' union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], which banned the sale of most British television programmes, the [[puppet]] series ''[[The Adventures of Rupert Bear]]'' was dubbed into [[South African English]], as the original voices had been recorded by Equity voice artists.<ref>[http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf Bevan, C 2008, Putting up screens : a history of television in South Africa, 1929-1976, MHCS dissertation, University of Pretoria, Pretoria]</ref>

====Uganda====
Uganda's [[Cinema of Uganda|own film industry]] is fairly small, and foreign movies are commonly watched. The English sound track is often accompanied by the [[Luganda]] translation and comments, provided by an Ugandan "video jockey" (VJ). VJ's interpreting and narration may be available in a recorded form or live.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2012/11/cinema-uganda |title=Coming to you live

===Oceania===
In common with other English-speaking countries, there has traditionally been little dubbing in [[Australia]], with foreign-language television programmes and films being shown (usually on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]) with subtitles.  This has also been the case in [[New Zealand]], but the [[Maori Television Service]], launched in 2004, has dubbed animated films into [[Maori language|Maori]].<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10117134 Maori TV broadens horizons], ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'', March 26, 2005</ref>  However, some TV commercials from foreign countries are dubbed, even if the original commercial came from another English-speaking country.

==Alternatives==

===Subtitles===
{{Main|Subtitle (captioning)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitles]] can be used instead of dubbing, as different countries have different traditions regarding the choice between dubbing and subtitling.  On [[DVD]]s with higher translation budgets, the option for both types will often be provided to account for individual preferences; [[purist]]s often demand subtitles.  For small markets (small language area or films for a select audience), subtitling is more suitable, because it is cheaper.  In the case of films for small children who cannot yet read, or do not read fast enough, dubbing is necessary.

In most [[English language|English-speaking]] countries, dubbing is comparatively rare.  In [[Israel]], some programmes need to be comprehensible to speakers of both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].  This cannot be accomplished with dubbing, so subtitling is much more commonplace—sometimes even with subtitles in multiple languages, with the soundtrack remaining in the original language, usually English.  The same applies to certain television shows in [[Finland]], where [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are both official languages.

In the [[Netherlands]], [[Flanders]], [[Nordic countries]] and [[Estonia]], films and television programmes are shown in the original language (usually English) with subtitles, and only cartoons and children's movies and programs are dubbed, such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', and others.  Cinemas usually show both a dubbed version and one with subtitles for this kind of movie, with the subtitled version shown later in the evening.

In [[Portugal]], this has traditionally been the case (at least for live-action material), but one terrestrial channel, [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]], dubs U.S. series like ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].  RTP also transmitted ''[[Friends]]'' in a dubbed version, but it was poorly received and later re-aired in a subtitled version.  Cartoons, on the other hand, are usually dubbed, sometimes by well-known actors, even on TV.  Animated movies are usually released to the cinemas in both subtitled and dubbed versions.

In [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]], terrestrial channels air films and TV series in a dubbed version, as demanded by law. However, those same series can be seen on cable channels at more accessible time-slots in their subtitled version, and usually before they are shown on open TV.  In contrast, the series ''The Simpsons'' is aired in its Mexican-dubbed version both on terrestrial television and on the cable station Fox, which broadcasts the series for the area.  Although the first season of the series appeared with subtitles, this was not continued for the following seasons.

Apart from airing dubbed TV series (for example, ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' and ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''), the Argentinian open TV station [[Canal 13 (Argentina)]] has bought the rights to produce and air a "ported version" of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' in Argentina, with local actors and actresses.

===Dubbing and subtitling===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
In [[Bulgaria]], television series are dubbed, but most television channels use subtitles for action and drama movies. [[AXN]] uses subtitles for its series, but as of 2008 emphasizes dubbing.  Only [[Diema]] channels dub all programs.  Movies in theaters, with the exception of films for children, use subtitles.  Dubbing of television programs is usually done using voiceovers, but usually with at least four or five actors reading the lines, while trying to give each character a different voice by using appropriate intonations.  Dubbing with synchronized voices is rarely used, mostly for animated films.  ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' is a rare example of a feature film dubbed this way on [[BNT Channel 1]], though a subtitled version is currently shown on other channels.

[[Walt Disney Television]]'s animated series (such as ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'') were only aired with synchronized Bulgarian voices on [[BNT Channel 1]] until 2005, but then the Disney shows were canceled. When airing of Disney series resumed on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] and [[Jetix]] in 2008, voiceovers were used, but Disney animated-movie translations still use synchronized voices.  Voiceover dubbing is not used in theatrical releases.  The Bulgarian film industry law requires all children's films to be dubbed, not subtitled. [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] dubbed and aired the ''Pokémon'' anime with synchronized voices.  Now, the show is airing on Disney Channel, also in a synchronized form.

In [[Hungary]], practically all television programs are dubbed, as are about 50 percent of movies in theaters.  In the [[Socialism|socialist]] era, every film was dubbed with professional and mostly popular actors.  Care was taken to make sure the same voice actor would lend his voice to the same original actor.  In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in the cinema.  This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dubbed soundtracks for the movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading of dubbing quality. Once this became customary, cinema distributors resumed the habit of dubbing for popular productions, presenting them in a quality varying from very poor to average.  However, every feature is presented with the original soundtrack in at least one cinema in large towns and cities.

However, in Hungary, most documentary films and series (for example, those on [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic Channel]]) are made with voiceover.  Some old movies and series, or ones that provide non-translatable jokes and conversations (for example, the ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' television series), are shown only with subtitles.

There is a more recent problem arising from dubbing included on DVD releases.  Many generations have grown up with an original (and, by current technological standards, outdated) soundtrack, which is either technologically (mono or bad quality stereo sound) or legally (expired soundtrack license) unsuitable for a DVD release.  Many original features are released on DVD with a new soundtrack, which in some cases proves to be extremely unpopular, thus forcing DVD producers to include the original soundtrack.  In some rare cases, the Hungarian soundtrack is left out altogether. This happens notably with Warner Home Video Hungary, which ignored the existence of Hungarian soundtracks completely, as they did not want to pay the licensees for the soundtracks to be included on their new DVD releases, which appear with improved picture quality, but very poor subtitling.

==General use==
Dubbing is also used in applications and genres other than traditional film, including video games, television, and pornographic films.

===Video games===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Many [[video game]]s originally produced in [[North America]], [[Japan]], and [[PAL]] countries are dubbed into foreign languages for release in areas such as [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], especially for video games that place a heavy emphasis on dialogue.  Because characters' mouth movements can be part of the game's code, [[lip sync]] is sometimes achieved by re-coding the mouth movements to match the dialogue in the new language.  The [[Source engine]] automatically generates lip-sync data, making it easier for games to be localized.

To achieve synchronization when animations are intended only for the source language, localized content is mostly recorded using techniques borrowed from movie dubbing (such as rythmo band) or, when images are not available, localized dubbing is done using source audios as a reference.  Sound-synch is a method where localized audios are recorded matching the length and internal pauses of the source content.<!-- What does this last sentence mean? -->

For the European version of a video game, the on-screen text of the game is available in various languages and, in many cases, the dialogue is dubbed into each respective language, as well.

The North American version of any game is always available in [[English language|English]], with translated text and dubbed dialogue, if necessary, in other languages, especially if the North American version of the game contains the same data as the European version. Several Japanese games, such as those in the ''[[Sonic (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Dynasty Warriors (series)|Dynasty Warriors]]'', and ''[[Soul (series)|Soul Calibur]]'' series, are released with both the original Japanese audio and the American English dub included.

===Television===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Dubbing is occasionally used on [[network television]] broadcasts of films that contain dialogue that the network executives or [[Censorship|censors]] have decided to replace.  This is usually done to remove [[profanity]].  In most cases, the original actor does not perform this duty, but an actor with a similar voice reads the changes.  The results are sometimes seamless, but, in many cases, the voice of the replacement actor sounds nothing like the original performer, which becomes particularly noticeable when extensive dialogue must be replaced.  Also, often easy to notice, is the sudden absence of background sounds in the movie during the dubbed dialogue.  Among the films considered notorious for using substitute actors that sound very different from their theatrical counterparts are the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and the ''[[Die Hard series|Die Hard]]'' film series, as shown on broadcasters such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]].  In the case of ''Smokey and the Bandit'', extensive dubbing was done for the first network airing on [[ABC Television]] in 1978, especially for [[Jackie Gleason]]'s character, [[Buford T. Justice]].  The dubbing of his phrase "sombitch" (son of a bitch) became the more palatable (and memorable) "scum bum," which became a catchphrase of the time.

Dubbing is commonly used in [[science fiction television]], as well.  Sound generated by effects equipment such as [[Animatronics|animatronic]] puppets or by actors' movements on elaborate multi-level plywood sets (for example, starship bridges or other command centers) will quite often make the original character dialogue unusable.  ''[[Stargate]]'' and ''[[Farscape]]'' are two prime examples where ADR is used heavily to produce usable audio.

Since some anime series contain profanity, the studios recording the English dubs often re-record certain lines if a series or movie is going to be broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]], removing references to [[death]] and [[hell]] as well.  Some companies will offer both an edited and an uncut version of the series on DVD, so that there is an edited script available in case the series is broadcast.  Other companies also edit the full-length version of a series, meaning that even on the uncut DVD characters say things like "Blast!" and "Darn!" in place of the original dialogue's profanity. [[Bandai|Bandai Entertainment's]] English dub of ''[[G Gundam]]'' is infamous for this, among many other things, with such lines as "Bartender, more milk".

Dubbing has also been used for comedic purposes, replacing lines of dialogue to create comedies from footage that was originally another genre.  Examples include the Australian shows ''[[The Late Show (Australian TV series)#The Olden Days|The Olden Days]]'' and ''[[Bargearse]]'', re-dubbed from 1970s Australian drama and action series, respectively, and the Irish show ''[[Soupy Norman]]'', re-dubbed from ''[[:pl:Pierwsza miłość|Pierwsza miłość]]'', a Polish soap opera.

Dubbing into a foreign language does not always entail the deletion of the original language.  In some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a voice-over.  This often occurs in [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], where "lektories" or "lektors" read the translated dialogue into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]].  In Poland, a single person reads all parts of the performance, both male and female.  However, this is done almost exclusively for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled.  Recently, however, the number of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for children's movies.  If a quality dubbed version exists for a film, it is shown in theaters.  However, some films, such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' or ''[[Star Wars]]'', are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions, varying with the time of the show.  Such films are also shown on TV (although some channels drop them and do standard one-narrator translation) and VHS/DVD.  In other countries, like [[Vietnam]], the voice-over technique is also used for theatrical releases.<!-- This section and the next one are redundant. This material has already been covered and should be merged above. -->

In Russia, the reading of all lines by a single person is referred to as a [[Gavrilov translation]], and is generally found only in [[Copyright infringement|illegal copies]] of films and on [[cable television]].  Professional copies always include at least two actors of opposite gender translating the dialogue.  Some titles in Poland have been dubbed this way, too, but this method lacks public appeal, so it is very rare now.

On special occasions, such as [[film festival]]s, live [[interpreting]] is often done by professionals.

===Pornography===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
As budgets for [[pornographic film]]s are often small, compared to films made by major studios, and there is an inherent need to film without interrupting filming, it is common for sex scenes to be over-dubbed.  The audio for such over-dubbing is generally referred to as ''the Ms and Gs'', or ''the moans and groans.''

==Dubbing into dialects==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
In the case of languages with large communities (such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[French language|French]]), a single translation may sound foreign to native speakers in a given region.  Therefore, a film may be translated into a dialect of a certain language.  For example, the animated movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'' was translated to European Spanish, [[Mexican Spanish]], [[Neutral Spanish]] (which used the Mexican voice cast), and [[Rioplatense Spanish]] (although people from [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]] noticed a strong ''[[porteño]]'' accent from most of the characters of the Rioplatense Spanish translation).  In Spanish-speaking regions, most media is dubbed only twice into Spanish (Spain) and Neutral Spanish (which is Mexican Spanish but avoids colloquialisms).

Another example is the French dialect dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which is entirely different in [[Quebec]] and [[France]], the humor being very different for each audience (see [[Non-English versions of The Simpsons|Non-English versions of ''The Simpsons'']]).  Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France's dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which they often do not find amusing.  The French-language [[Télétoon (Canada)|Télétoon]] network once aired the Quebec dub for ''The Simpsons'', as well as Parisian French dubs of ''[[Futurama]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', which were both similar to the Parisian dub for ''The Simpsons''.  The two latter shows have since been taken off the network, while ''The Simpsons'' continues its run on Télétoon.

The [[Quebec French]] dubbing of films, while generally made in accent-free [[Standard French]], may sound peculiar to audiences in France because of the persistence of some regionally neutral expression and because Quebec French performers pronounce Anglo-Saxon names with an American accent, while French performers do not.  Occasionally, for reasons of cost, American [[direct-to-video]] films, such as the 1995 film ''When the Bullet Hits the Bone'', are released in France with a Quebec French dubbing, sometimes resulting in what some members of French audiences perceive as unintentional humor.

[[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] also use different versions of dubbed films and series.  Because dubbing has never been very popular in [[Portugal]], for decades, children's films and television series were distributed using the higher-quality Brazilian dub.  Only in the 1990s did dubbing begin to gain importance in Portugal, thanks to the popularity of dubbed series like ''[[Dragon Ball]]''.  ''[[The Lion King]]'' became the first Disney feature film to be completely dubbed into [[European Portuguese]] and, subsequently, all major animation films and series gained European Portuguese versions.  In recent [[DVD]] releases, most of these Brazilian-dubbed classics were released with new Portuguese dubs, eliminating the predominance of Brazilian Portuguese dubs in Portugal.

Similarly, in the [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] region of [[Flanders]] in [[Belgium]], cartoons are often dubbed locally by [[Flemish]] artists{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}, rather than using soundtracks produced in the [[Netherlands]].

The [[German language|German]]-speaking region, which includes [[Germany]], [[Austria]], the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]] share a common German-dubbed version.  Although there are some differences in German dialects, all films, shows, and series are dubbed into a single standard [[German language|German]] version that avoids regional variations in the German-speaking audience.  Most voice actors are primarily [[Germans]] and [[Austrians]], since there has been a long tradition of dubbing films. [[Switzerland]], which has four official languages ([[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romansh language|Romansh]]), generally uses dubbed versions made in each respective country (except for [[Romansh language|Romansh]]). [[Liechtenstein]] uses German-dubbed versions only.

Sometimes, films are also dubbed into several [[German dialects]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ([[Berlinerisch]], [[Colognian language|Kölsch]], [[Saxonian]], [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Swiss German]]), which especially concerns animated films and Disney films.  These are made for amusement and as an additional "special feature" to entice the audience into buying it.  Popular animated films dubbed into German dialects include ''[[Asterix]]'' films (in addition to its standard German version, every film has a particular dialect version), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Shrek 2]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', (+ [[Austrian German]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OBS_20090810_OBS0008 |title=Österreich-Version von Disney/Pixars "Oben" mit Otto Schenk und Karlheinz Böhm - BILD |language=de |publisher=ots.at |date=2009-08-10 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}</ref> (+ [[Austrian German]]).

Some live-action films or TV-series have an additional German dialect dubbing: ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]''{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and its sequel, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' ([[German language|Germany German]], [[Austrian German]], [[Swiss German]]); and ''[[Rehearsal for Murder]]'', ''[[Framed (TV series)|Framed]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776730&threaded=1&id=506508&message=6643629 |title=Allgemeines » ORF-Synchronisationen - Wer weiß was? |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}</ref> (+ [[Austrian German]]); ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'', ''[[Rumpole]]'' (+ [[Austrian German]]), and ''[[The Thorn Birds]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776728&threaded=1&id=506269&message=7100872 |title=Serien » 24 |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}</ref>
(only [[Austrian German]] dubbing).

Before [[German reunification]], [[East Germany]] also made its own particular German version.  For example, ''[[Olsen Gang]]'' and the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] animated series ''[[The Mézga Family]]'' were dubbed in [[West Germany]] as well as East Germany.

==Criticism==
The many [[martial arts]] movies from [[Hong Kong]] that were imported under the unofficial banner [[Kung Fu Theater]] were notorious for seemingly careless dubbing that included poor lip sync and awkward dialogue.  Since the results were frequently unintentionally hilarious, this has become one of the hallmarks that endear these films to part of the 1980s culture.

While the voice actors involved usually bear the brunt of criticisms towards poor dubbing, other factors may include inaccurate script translation and poor [[Audio mixing (television and film)|audio mixing]].  Dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are natural to the language but would appear awkward if translated literally.  English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly and follows the natural pattern of English speech.  Voice actors in a dubbing capacity typically do not have the luxury of viewing the original film with the original voice actor and thus have little idea regarding how to perform the role.{{Citation needed||date=August 2015}}  On some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue separately, which can lack the dynamics gained from performing as a group.
