<article title='Chain_reaction'><paragraph><template><target>About</target><arg>chain reactions in chemistry and physics</arg></template>A<space/><bold>chain reaction</bold><space/>is a sequence of reactions where a reactive product or by-product causes additional reactions to take place. In a chain reaction,<space/><link><target>positive feedback</target></link><space/>leads to a self-amplifying<space/><link><target>chain of events</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Chain reactions are one way in which systems which are in<space/><link><target>thermodynamic</target></link><space/><link><target>non-equilibrium</target></link><space/>can release energy or increase entropy in order to reach a state of higher entropy. For example, a system may not be able to reach a lower energy state by releasing energy into the environment, because it is hindered or prevented in some way from taking the path that will result in the energy release. If a reaction results in a small energy release making way for more energy releases in an expanding chain, then the system will typically collapse explosively until much or all of the stored energy has been released.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>A macroscopic metaphor for chain reactions is thus a snowball causing a larger snowball until finally an avalanche results (&quot;<link><target>snowball effect</target></link>&quot;). This is a result of stored gravitational potential energy seeking a path of release over friction. Chemically, the equivalent to a snow avalanche is a spark causing a forest fire. In nuclear physics, a single stray neutron can result in a<space/><link><target>prompt critical</target></link><space/>event, which may be finally be energetic enough for a nuclear reactor meltdown or (in a bomb) a nuclear explosion.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Chemical chain reactions</heading><heading level='3'>History</heading><paragraph>In 1913 the German chemist<space/><link><target>Max Bodenstein</target></link><space/>first put forth the idea of<space/><link><target>chemical</target></link><space/>chain reactions. If two molecules react, not only molecules of the final reaction products are formed, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the parent molecules with a far larger probability than the initial reactants. In the new reaction, further unstable molecules are formed besides the stable products, and so on.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1918,<space/><link><target>Walther Nernst</target></link><space/>proposed that the<space/><link><target>photochemistry</target><part>photochemical</part></link><space/>reaction of hydrogen and chlorine is a chain reaction in order to explain the large<space/><link><target>quantum yield</target></link>, meaning that one<space/><link><target>photon</target></link><space/>of light is responsible for the formation of as many as 10<xhtml:sup>6</xhtml:sup><space/>molecules of the product HCl. He suggested that the photon dissociates a Cl<xhtml:sub>2</xhtml:sub><space/>molecule into two Cl atoms which each initiate a long chain of reaction steps forming HCl.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Laidler288">Laidler K.J.,<space/><italics>Chemical Kinetics</italics><space/>(3rd ed., Harper &amp; Row 1987) p.288-290 ISBN 0-06-043862-2</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 1923, Danish and Dutch scientists<space/><link><target>Christian Christiansen</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Hendrik Anthony Kramers</target></link>, in an analysis of the formation of polymers, pointed out that such a chain reaction need not start with a molecule excited by light, but could also start with two molecules colliding violently due to thermal energy as previously proposed for initiation of chemical reactions by<space/><link><target>Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff</target><part>van' t Hoff</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Nobel1956"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Christiansen and Kramers also noted that if, in one link of the reaction chain, two or more unstable<space/><link><target>molecules</target></link><space/>are produced, the reaction chain would branch and grow.

Szilrd knew of<space/><italics>chemical</italics><space/>chain reactions, and he had been reading about an energy-producing<space/><link><target>nuclear reaction</target></link><space/>involving high-energy protons bombarding lithium, demonstrated by<space/><link><target>John Cockcroft</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Ernest Walton</target></link>, in 1932. Now, Szilrd proposed to use neutrons theoretically produced from certain nuclear reactions in lighter isotopes, to induce further reactions in light isotopes that produced more neutrons. This would in theory produce a chain reaction at the level of the nucleus. He did not envision fission as one of these neutron-producing reactions, since this reaction was not known at the time. Experiments he proposed using<space/><link><target>beryllium</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>indium</target></link><space/>failed.</paragraph><paragraph>Later, after fission was discovered in 1938, Szilrd immediately realized the possibility of using neutron-induced fission as the particular nuclear reaction necessary to create a chain-reaction, so long as fission also produced neutrons. In 1939, with Enrico Fermi, Szilrd proved this neutron-multiplying reaction in uranium. In this reaction, a<space/><link><target>neutron</target></link><space/>plus a fissionable<space/><link><target>atom</target></link><space/>causes a fission resulting in a larger number of neutrons than the single one that was consumed in the initial reaction. Thus was born the practical<space/><link><target>nuclear chain reaction</target></link><space/>by the mechanism of neutron-induced nuclear fission.</paragraph><paragraph>Specifically, if one or more of the produced neutrons themselves interact with other fissionable nuclei, and these also undergo fission, then there is a possibility that the macroscopic overall fission reaction will not stop, but continue throughout the reaction material. This is then a self-propagating and thus self-sustaining chain reaction. This is the principle for<space/><link><target>nuclear reactor</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>atomic bomb</target><trail>s</trail></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Demonstration of a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was accomplished by<space/><link><target>Enrico Fermi</target></link><space/>and others, in the successful operation of<space/><link><target>Chicago Pile-1</target></link>, the first artificial nuclear reactor, in late 1942.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Electron avalanche in gases</heading><paragraph>An<space/><link><target>electron avalanche</target></link><space/>happens between two unconnected electrodes in a gas when an electric field exceeds a certain threshold. Random thermal collisions of gas atoms may result in a few free electrons and positively charged gas ions, in a process called<space/><link><target>impact ionization</target></link>. Acceleration of these<space/><link><target>free electron</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>in a strong<space/><link><target>electric field</target></link><space/>causes them to gain energy, and when they impact other atoms, the energy causes release of new free electrons and ions (ionization), which fuels the same process. If this process happens faster than it is naturally quenched by ions recombining, the new ions multiply in successive cycles until the gas breaks down into a plasma and current flows freely in a discharge.</paragraph><paragraph>Electron avalanches are essential to the<space/><link><target>dielectric breakdown</target></link><space/>process within gases.

The process may extends to huge sparks streamers in<space/><link><target>lightning</target></link><space/>discharges propagate by formation of electron avalanches created in the high potential gradient ahead of the streamers' advancing tips. Once begun, avalanches are often intensified by the creation of<space/><link><target>photoelectron</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>as a result of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the excited medium's atoms in the aft-tip region. The extremely high temperature of the resulting plasma cracks the surrounding gas molecules and the free ions recombine to create new chemical compounds.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title"><space/>Lab Note #106 ''Environmental Impact of Arc Suppression''<space/></arg><arg name="author"><space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Arc Suppression Technologies<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/>April 2011<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/</arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/>March 15, 2012</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The process can also be used to detect radiation that initiates the process, as the passage of a single particles can amplified to large discharges.

Semiconductors rely on free electrons knocked out of the crystal by thermal vibration for conduction. Thus, unlike metals, semiconductors become better conductors the higher the temperature. This sets up conditions for the same type of positive feedbackheat from current flow causes temperature to rise, which increases charge carriers, lowering resistance, and causing more current to flow. This can continue to the point of complete breakdown of normal resistance at a semiconductor junction, and failure of the device (this may be temporary or permanent depending on whether there is physical damage to the crystal).
