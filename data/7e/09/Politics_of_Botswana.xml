Each of the elections since independence in September 1966 has been freely and fairly contested and has been held on schedule. The country's small white minority and other minorities participate freely in the political process. There are two main rival parties and a number of smaller parties. General elections are held at least every 5 years.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1830.htm'>Background Note: Botswana</link></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Legislative branch</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:BotswanaParliament.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part><link><target>National Assembly of Botswana</target></link>.</part></link>The National Assembly has 57 elected and 4 appointed members<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.bartleby.com/151/fields/59.html'></link>; it is expanded following each census (every 10 years).
