'''Bauxite''', an [[aluminium]] [[ore]], is the world's main source of aluminium.  It consists mostly of the [[mineral]]s [[gibbsite]] Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, [[boehmite]] γ-AlO(OH) and [[diaspore]] α-AlO(OH), [[Mixture|mixed]] with the two [[iron oxide]]s [[goethite]] and [[haematite]], the [[Clay minerals|clay mineral]] [[kaolinite]] and small amounts of [[anatase]] TiO<sub>2</sub>.  In 1821 the [[French people|French]] [[Geology|geologist]] [[Pierre Berthier]] discovered bauxite near the village of [[Les Baux-de-Provence|Les Baux]] in [[Provence]], southern [[France]].<ref>P. Berthier (1821) [https://books.google.com/books?id=53wkLqfF6tQC&pg=PA531#v=onepage&q&f=false "Analyse de l'alumine hydratée des Beaux, département des Bouches-du-Rhóne"] (Analysis of hydrated alumina from Les Beaux, department of the Mouths-of-the-Rhone), ''Annales des mines'', 1st series,  '''6''' :  531-534.</ref>  In 1861, French chemist [[Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville|Henri Sainte-Claire Deville]] named the mineral "bauxite".<ref>Notes:
*  In 1847, in the cumulative index of volume 3 of his series, ''Traité de minéralogie'', French mineralogist [[Ours-Pierre-Armand Petit-Dufrénoy|Armand Dufrénoy]] listed the hydrated alumina from Les Beaux as "beauxite".  (See:  A. Dufrénoy, ''Traité de minéralogie'', volume 3 (Paris, France:  Carilian-Goeury et Vor Dalmont, 1847), [https://books.google.be/books?hl=en&id=XxwOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA799#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 799.])

== Formation ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Lateritic bauxites (silicate bauxites) are distinguished from [[karst]] bauxite ores (carbonate bauxites).  The carbonate bauxites occur predominantly in [[Europe]] and [[Jamaica]] above [[carbonate rock]]s ([[limestone]] and [[dolomite]]), where they were formed by lateritic [[weathering]] and residual accumulation of intercalated [[clay]] layers – dispersed clays which were concentrated as the enclosing limestones gradually dissolved during [[chemical weathering]].

The lateritic bauxites are found mostly in the countries of the [[tropics]].  They were formed by [[Laterite|lateritization]] of various [[Silicate#Silicate rock|silicate rocks]] such as [[granite]], [[gneiss]], [[basalt]], [[syenite]], and [[shale]].  In comparison with the iron-rich laterites, the formation of bauxites depends even more on intense weathering conditions in a location with very good drainage.  This enables the dissolution of the kaolinite and the precipitation of the gibbsite.  Zones with highest aluminium content are frequently located below a [[Iron oxide|ferruginous]] surface layer.  The [[aluminium hydroxide]] in the lateritic bauxite deposits is almost exclusively gibbsite.

In the case of Jamaica, recent analysis of the soils showed elevated levels of [[cadmium]], suggesting that the bauxite originates from recent [[Miocene]] [[Volcanic ash|ash]] deposits from episodes of significant volcanism in Central America.

==Production trends==
In 2009, [[Australia]] was the top producer of bauxite with almost one-third of the world's production, followed by China, Brazil, India, and Guinea. Although aluminium demand is rapidly increasing, known reserves of its bauxite ore are sufficient to meet the worldwide demands for aluminium for many centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bauxite/mcs-2012-bauxi.pdf| title=Bauxite and Alumina |format=PDF | publisher=U.S. Geological Survey | page=2 | accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref>  Increased [[aluminium recycling]], which has the advantage of lowering the cost in [[electric power]] in producing aluminium, will considerably extend the world's bauxite reserves.

In November 2010, [[Nguyen Tan Dung]], the prime minister of [[Vietnam]], announced that Vietnam's bauxite reserves might total 11000 Mt; this would be the largest in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mining-journal.com/exploration--and--development/vietnams-bauxite-reserves-may-total-11-billion-tonnes|accessdate=2010-11-28|title=Mining Journal - Vietnam’s bauxite reserves may total 11 billion tonnes}}</ref>

==Processing==

Bauxite is usually [[surface mining|strip mined]] because it is almost always found near the surface of the terrain, with little or no [[overburden]]. Approximately 70% to 80% of the world's dry bauxite production is processed first into [[alumina]], and then into aluminium by [[electrolysis]] as of 2010. Bauxite rocks are typically classified according to their intended commercial application: metallurgical, abrasive, cement, chemical, and refractory.

Usually, bauxite ore is heated in a pressure vessel along with a [[sodium hydroxide]] solution at a temperature of 150 to 200&nbsp;°C. At these temperatures, the [[aluminium]] is dissolved as an aluminate (the [[Bayer process]]). After separation of ferruginous residue ([[red mud]]) by filtering, pure gibbsite is precipitated when the liquid is cooled, and then seeded with fine-grained aluminium hydroxide. The gibbsite is usually converted into [[aluminium oxide]], Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, by heating. This mineral is dissolved at a temperature of about 960&nbsp;°C in molten [[cryolite]]. Next, this molten substance can yield metallic aluminium by passing an [[electric current]] through it in the process of electrolysis, which is called the [[Hall–Héroult process]], named after its American and French discoverers.

Prior to the invention of this process in 1886, elemental aluminium was made by heating ore along with elemental [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] in a [[vacuum]]. The method was complicated and consumed materials that were themselves expensive at that time. This made early elemental aluminium more expensive than [[gold]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/aluminium.htm |title=Aluminium versus aluminum Author: Michael Quinion, 1996–2011 |publisher=Worldwidewords.org |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2011-12-19}}</ref>
