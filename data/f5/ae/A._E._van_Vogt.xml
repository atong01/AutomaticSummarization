About van Vogt's writing, Knight said:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>In general van Vogt seems to me to fail consistently as a writer in these elementary ways: 1.

But there's no doubt who got me off originally and that was A.E. van Vogt. There was in van Vogt's writing a mysterious quality, and this was especially true in [[The World of Null-A|The World of Null A]]. All the parts of that book did not add up; all the ingredients did not make a coherency. Now some people are put off by that. They think that's sloppy and wrong, but the thing that fascinated me so much was that this resembled reality more than anybody else's writing inside or outside science fiction.</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Dick also defended van Vogt against Damon Knights criticisms:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>Damon feels that it's bad artistry when you build those funky universes where people fall through the floor. It's like he's viewing a story the way a building inspector would when he's building your house. But reality really is a mess, and yet it's exciting. The basic thing is, how frightened are you of chaos? And how happy are you with order?

I'm tougher than you. I’ve got a ''billion'' spaceships! They’re brand-new. They only took 800 years to develop.

And this is a story in which most of the cast either have two brains or are really robots...and even the emotions of the human characters are programmed or deprogrammed as part of plots within counter plots. Next to this, Doc Smith was an icy realist. There is ''no'' intersection with adult reality at any point, for all van Vogt was able to write was that small boy's sandbox game with an adult level of intensity. This is, I think, the secret of van Vogt's bizarre fascination, as awful as his actual writing might be, and why he appealed so strongly to Philip K. Dick, who managed to put more adult characters and emotions into equally crazy situations. It's ultimately very strange to find this sort of writing so prominently sponsored by supposedly rational and scientifically minded John W. Campbell, when it seems to contravene everything the Golden Age stood for.</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Recognition</heading><paragraph>In 1946, van Vogt and his first wife,<space/><link><target>Edna Mayne Hull</target></link>, were Guests of Honor at the fourth<space/><link><target>World Science Fiction Convention</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="first">Kirk H.<space/></arg><arg name="last">Beetz<space/></arg><arg name="year">1996<space/></arg><arg name="title">Beacham's Encyclopedia of Popular Fiction<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Beacham Publishing<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">978-0-933833-38-8<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 1980, van Vogt received a &quot;Casper Award&quot; (precursor to the Canadian<space/><link><target>Prix Aurora Awards</target></link>) for Lifetime Achievement.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Mullin<space/></arg><arg name="first">Dennis<space/></arg><arg name="date">October 27, 2007<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.sentex.net/~dmullin/aurora/hist_dat.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Prix AURORA Awards<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Association<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">May 2, 2008<space/></arg><arg name="archiveurl"><space/>http://web.archive.org/web/20080509122152/http://www.sentex.net/~dmullin/aurora/hist_dat.html</arg><arg name="archivedate"><space/>May 9, 2008<space/></arg><arg name="deadurl"><space/>no</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="SFAwards"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Science Fiction Writers of America</target></link><space/>named him its 14th<space/><link><target>SFWA Grand Master</target><part>Grand Master</part></link><space/>in 1995 (presented 1996).<extension extension_name='ref' name="SFWA"></extension>There had been great controversy within SFWA regarding its long wait in bestowing its highest honor (limited to living writers, no more than one annually<extension extension_name='ref' name="SFWA"></extension>).
