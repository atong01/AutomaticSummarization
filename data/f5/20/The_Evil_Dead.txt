'''''The Evil Dead''''' is a 1981 American [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Sam Raimi]] and executive produced by Raimi and [[Bruce Campbell]], who also stars alongside [[Ellen Sandweiss]] and [[Betsy Baker]]. ''The Evil Dead'' focuses on five college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a remote wooded area. After they find an audiotape that releases a legion of [[demon]]s and [[spirit]]s, members of the group suffer from [[demonic possession]], leading to increasingly gory mayhem.  Raimi and the cast produced the short film ''[[Within the Woods]]'' as a "prototype" to build the interest of potential investors, which secured Raimi US$90,000 to produce ''The Evil Dead''. The film was shot on location in a remote cabin located in [[Morristown, Tennessee]], in a difficult filming process that proved extremely uncomfortable for the majority of the cast and crew.

The low-budget horror film attracted the interest of producer [[Irvin Shapiro]], who helped screen the film at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]]. Horror author [[Stephen King]] gave a rave review of the film, which helped convince [[New Line Cinema]] to serve as its distributor. Though a meager commercial success in the United States, the film made its budget back through worldwide distribution, and grossed $2.4 million during its theatrical run. Both early and later critical reception were both universally positive and in the years since its release, ''The Evil Dead'' has developed a reputation as one of the largest [[cult film]]s and has been cited among the greatest horror films of all time. ''The Evil Dead'' launched the careers of Campbell and Raimi, who would collaborate on several films together throughout the years, including Raimi's [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]].

The film has spawned a [[Evil Dead (franchise)|media franchise]], beginning with two sequels written and directed by Raimi, ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' (1987) and ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' (1992), as well as video games and [[Army of Darkness (comics)|comic books]]. The film's protagonist [[Ash Williams]] (Campbell) is regarded as a cult icon. The fourth film, serving as both a reboot and a remake, was titled ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'' and was released in 2013.  Raimi co-produced the film alongside Campbell and the franchise producer, [[Robert Tapert]].

==Plot==
Five [[Michigan State University]] students, [[Ash Williams]] ([[Bruce Campbell]]) and his girlfriend Linda ([[Betsy Baker]]), accompanied by Ash's sister Cheryl ([[Ellen Sandweiss]]), their friend Scotty, and his girlfriend Shelly , venture into the [[Tennessee]] hills to vacation in an isolated cabin for their [[spring break]].  They soon run into trouble, first narrowly avoiding another motorist, then having a sudden scare as the bridge near the cabin begins to collapse as they cross.  That night, while Cheryl is making a drawing of a clock, her hand becomes violently possessed by a mysterious entity, causing her to draw a picture that looks like a deformed, evil face.  She fails to mention the incident to the others, dismissing it as her imagination.

When the trapdoor to the cellar mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty go down to investigate and find the ''[[Necronomicon#In popular culture|Naturom Demonto]]'', a [[Sumer]]ian version of the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', along with a [[Tape recorder|tape recording]] of [[incantation]]s, which, when played, unleashes evil [[demon]]s and [[spirit]]s.  The group is unaware of this, but Cheryl becomes hysterical when a tree crashes through the window, and she retires to her room.  Later, hearing voices, she goes outside to investigate.  Alone and far from the safety of the cabin, she is attacked and raped by [[Demonic possession|demonically possessed]] trees but manages to escape.  The others do not believe her story, but Ash agrees to drive her to town where she can find a place to stay for the night. However, they find that the only bridge connecting the cabin to the rest of the world has been destroyed.  Back at the cabin, while the girls play cards, Cheryl becomes demonically possessed, telling them that the demons will kill them.  She then stabs Linda in the ankle with a pencil, and Scotty locks her in the cellar.

Shelly is the next to become possessed; she attacks Scotty, who eventually dismembers her with an axe.  They bury her, and Scotty, emotionally shaken by her death, leaves to find an alternate trail through the woods.

Checking on Linda, Ash discovers that she, too, has become possessed, although she makes no attempt to attack him.  Scotty returns, suffering from grave injuries caused by the possessed trees. Before losing consciousness, he tells Ash that an alternate trail does exist.  Linda and Cheryl unsuccessfully attempt to deceive Ash into believing they are no longer possessed, only to attack him again.  He locks Linda outside the cabin and tends to Scotty's injuries, but she sneaks in through the back-door and attacks Ash with a dagger, which he uses to impale her.  Taking her body to the woodshed, Ash tries to force himself to dismember her with a chainsaw, but finds himself unable to do it and buries her instead.  She rises from the grave and attacks him, forcing him to decapitate her with a shovel.

Returning to the cabin, Ash finds that Cheryl has escaped from the cellar.  Arming himself with a shotgun, he finds her hiding outside and shoots her in the shoulder.  He then descends into the cellar to search for more shotgun shells after barricading the doors.  While there, he hears voices and sees blood seeping from numerous crevices and openings in the walls.

A demonically possessed Scotty tries to kill Ash as Cheryl breaks through the door.  During their fight, Ash sees that the ''Book of the Dead'' has fallen near the fireplace and is starting to burn, as are Cheryl and Scotty.  As Cheryl raises a fireplace poker to impale him, Ash snatches the book and throws it into the fire.  With the book burnt, Cheryl and Scotty fall apart and die as the sun rises.

As Ash heads outside, an unseen evil speeds through the forest, breaks through the doors of the cabin and descends upon him.  He turns around and screams in terror before the film cuts to the end credits.

==Production==
[[File:Sam Raimi by Gage Skidmore.jpg|alt=A man sitting next to a microphone placed on a table.|[[Sam Raimi]] directed the short film ''[[Within the Woods]]'' to generate the interest of investors for ''The Evil Dead''. |thumb|right|upright]]

===Background and writing===
Director Raimi had grown up with Campbell, and the two formed a friendship at a very young age.<ref name="early2">[[#Winston Dixon|Winston Dixon (2010)]], p. 161</ref> The duo directed several low-budget [[Super 8 mm film]] projects together.<ref name="early">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 65</ref> Several were comedies, including ''[[Clockwork (film)|Clockwork]]'' and ''[[It's Murder!]]''.<ref name="def">[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 16</ref><ref name="writing"/> Shooting a suspense scene in ''It's Murder!'' inspired Raimi to approach a career in the horror genre, and after researching horror cinema at [[drive-in theater]]s, Raimi was set on directing a horror film. The idea was to shoot a short film first, which would attract the interest of producers, and then use the money gained from that to shoot a full-length project.<ref name="writing">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 66</ref><ref name="becker">[[#Becker|Becker (2002)]], p. 64</ref> The [[short film]] that Raimi created was called ''[[Within the Woods]]''.<ref name="proto">[[#Lamberson|Lamberson (2008)]], p. 84</ref> It was produced for $1,600, but for ''The Evil Dead'', Raimi needed over $100,000.<ref name="money">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;85â€“88</ref>

To generate funds for the film, Raimi approached Phil Gillis, a lawyer to one of his friends.<ref name="money"/><ref name="reinforced"/> Raimi showed him ''Within the Woods'', and although Gillis was not impressed by the short film, he offered Raimi legal advice on how to produce ''The Evil Dead''. With his advice in mind, Raimi asked a variety of people for donations, and even eventually "begged" some.<ref name="money"/> Campbell had to ask several of his own family members, and Raimi asked every individual he thought could be interested.<ref name="money"/> He eventually raised enough money to produce a full-length film, though not the full amount he originally wanted.<ref name="money"/>

With enough money to produce the film, Raimi and Campbell set out to make what was then titled ''Book of the Dead'', a name inspired by Raimi's interest in the writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]].<ref name="writing"/><ref name="thingstoknow"/> The film was supposed to be a remake of ''Within the Woods'', with higher production values and a full-length running time. Raimi turned twenty just before shooting began, and he considered the project his "[[rite of passage]]".<ref name="ninety five">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 95</ref>

Raimi asked for help and assistance from several of his friends and past collaborators to make ''The Evil Dead''.<ref name="ninety five"/> Campbell was cast as [[Ash Williams]], the main character.<ref name="EVIL2">[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;23â€“24</ref> To acquire more actors for the project, an ad in ''[[The Detroit News]]'' was placed. [[Betsy Baker]] was one of the actresses who responded, and [[Ellen Sandweiss]], who appeared in ''Within the Woods'', was also cast.<ref name="ninety five"/> The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family. The make-up adviser for ''Within the Woods'', Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction to working with Raimi.<ref name="EVIL2"/>

Without any formal assistance from location scouts, the cast had to find filming locations on their own. The crew initially attempted to shoot the film in Raimi's hometown of [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], but instead chose [[Morristown, Tennessee]], as Tennessee was the only state that expressed enthusiasm for the project. The crew quickly found a remote cabin located several miles away from any other buildings.  During pre-production, the thirteen crew members had to stay at the cabin, leading to several people sleeping in the same room. The living conditions were notoriously difficult, with several arguments breaking out between crew members.<ref name="cabin"/>

Steve Frankel was the only carpenter on set, which made him the art direction's sole contributor.<ref name="weird">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;93â€“94</ref> For exterior shots, Frankel had to produce several elaborate props with a circular saw. Otherwise, the cabin mostly remained the way it was found during production. The cabin had no plumbing, but phone lines were connected to it.<ref name="cabin">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;96â€“98</ref><ref>[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 14</ref>

===Filming===
Because of the crew's inexperience, filming was a "comedy of errors".<ref name="errors"/> The first day of filming led to the crew getting lost in the woods during a scene shot on a bridge.<ref name="errors">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 101</ref> Several crew members became injured during the shoot, and because of the cabin's remoteness, securing medical assistance was difficult.<ref name="reinforced2">[[#Konow|Konow (2012)]], pp.&nbsp;419â€“422</ref> One notably gruesome moment on set involved ripping off Baker's eyelashes during removal of her face-mask.<ref name="weird"/> Because of the low budget, contact lenses as thick as glass had to be applied to the actors to achieve the "demonic eyes" effect.<ref name="weird"/> The lenses took ten minutes to apply, and could only be left on for about fifteen minutes because eyes could not "breathe" with them applied.<ref name="weird"/> Campbell later commented that to get the effect of wearing these lenses, they had to put "[[Tupperware]]" over their eyes.<ref name="weird"/>

Raimi developed a sense of ''[[mise en scÃ¨ne]]'', coming up with ideas for scenes at a fast rate.<ref name="reinforced"/> He had drawn several crude illustrations to help him break down the flow of scenes. The crew was surprised when Raimi began using [[dutch angle]]s during shots to build atmosphere during scenes.<ref name="raimi"/> To accommodate Raimi's style of direction, several elaborate, low-budget rigs had to be built, since the crew could not afford a [[camera dolly]]. One involved the "vas-o-cam", which relied on a mounted camera that was slid down long wood platforms to create a more fluid sense of motion.<ref name="raimi"/>

[[File:Ted Raimi by David Shankbone.jpg|alt=A man standing with a woman at a film premiere.|Sam Raimi's brother [[Ted Raimi]] ''(pictured right)'' was the "[[fake shemp]]" in several scenes.|thumb|left|upright]]

A camera trick used to emulate a [[Steadicam]] inexpensively was the "[[shaky camera|shaky cam]]", which involved mounting the camera to a piece of wood and having two camera operators sprint around the swamp.
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tested.com/art/movies/454928-low-budget-camera-tech-sam-raimis-evil-dead/|title=The Low Budget Camera Tech of Sam Raimiâ€™s Evil Dead|author=Konow, David|date=2013-04-18|accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref> During scenes involving the unseen force in the woods watching the characters, Raimi had to run through the woods with the makeshift rig, jumping over logs and stones.<ref name="raimi"/> This often proved difficult due to mist in the swamp.<ref>[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 309</ref> The film's final scene was shot with the camera mounted to a bike, while it was quickly driven through the cabin to create a seamless [[long take]].<ref name="raimi">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p.&nbsp;102â€“103</ref>

Raimi had been a big fan of the ''[[The Three Stooges]]'' franchise during his youth, and it inspired him to use "[[fake shemp]]s" during production.<ref name="def"/><ref name="reinforced">[[#Konow|Konow (2012)]], pp.&nbsp;412â€“413</ref><ref>[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 115</ref> In any scene that required a background shot of a character, he would use another actor as a substitute to save time if the original actor was preoccupied.<ref name="shemp"/> During a [[close-up]] involving Richard DeManicor's hand opening a curtain, Raimi used his own hand in the scene since it was more convenient. His brother [[Ted Raimi]] was used as a substitute in many scenes when the original actor was either busy or preoccupied.<ref name="shemp">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p.&nbsp;111â€“112</ref>

Raimi famously enjoyed "torturing" his actors.<ref name="ouch">{{cite video|title=One by One We Will Take You: The Untold Saga of The Evil Dead|type=documentary|location=''The Evil Dead'' Ultimate Edition DVD|year=2007|publisher=Anchor Bay Entertainment}}</ref><ref>[[#Kenneth Muir2|Kenneth Muir (2007)]], p. 507</ref> Raimi believed that to capture pain and anger in his actors, he had to abuse them a little at times, saying, "if everyone was in extreme pain and misery, that would translate into a horror."<ref name="ouch"/> Producer [[Robert Tapert]] agreed with Raimi, commenting that he "enjoyed when an actor bleeds."<ref name="ouch"/> While shooting a scene with Campbell running down a hill, Campbell tripped and injured his leg.<ref name="torture"/> Raimi enjoyed poking Campbell's injury with a stick he found in the woods. Because of the copious amounts of blood in the film, the crew produced gallons of fake blood with [[Associated British Foods|karo syrup]].<ref name="reinforced2"/><ref name="torture"/> It took Campbell hours to remove the sticky substance from himself.<ref name="torture"/> Several actors had inadvertently been stabbed or thrown into objects during production.<ref name="ouch"/><ref name="torture"/>

On the last few days on set, the conditions had become so poor that the crew began burning furniture to stay warm. Since only exterior shots needed to be filmed at that point, they burned nearly every piece of furniture left.<ref name="furniture">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;116â€“117</ref> Several actors went days without showering, and because of the freezing conditions, several caught colds and other illnesses. Campbell later described the filming process as nearly "twelve weeks of mirthless exercise in agony", though he allowed that he did manage to have fun while on set.<ref name="torture">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;107â€“109</ref> On January 23, 1980, filming was finished and almost every crew member left the set to return home, with Campbell staying with Raimi.<ref name="furniture"/> While looking over the footage that had been shot, Raimi discovered that a few [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups]] were required to fill in missing shots. Four days of re-shoots were then done to complete the film.<ref name="reshot"/> The final moment involved Campbell having "monster-guts" splattered on him in the basement.<ref name="reshot">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 128</ref>

===Editing===
[[File:COEN Brothers (cannesPH).jpg|alt=Two men in button-up shirts smiling.|Joel Coen ''(pictured right'') of the [[Coen brothers]] was one of the staff members who edited the film.|thumb|right]]
After the extensive filming process, Raimi had a "mountain of footage" that he had to put together.<ref name="reinforced2"/><ref name="editing"/> He chose a Detroit editing association, where he met Edna Paul, to cut the film. Paul's assistant was Joel Coen of the [[Coen brothers]], who helped with the film's editing.<ref name="editing">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;129â€“132</ref><ref name="eddie">[[#Eddie|Eddie (2010)]], p. 15</ref> Paul edited a majority of the film, although Coen notably edited the shed sequence. Coen had been inspired by Raimi's ''Within the Woods'' and liked the idea of producing a prototype film to help build the interest of investors.<ref name="eddie"/><ref name="pool"/> Joel used the concept to help make ''[[Blood Simple]]'' with his brother Ethan, and he and Raimi became friends following the editing process.<ref name="thingstoknow">{{cite web|author=AMC staff|date=2008-10-28|url=http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2010/10/evil-dead-facts.php|title=Ten Things You Might Not Know About the Evil Dead Trilogy|publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|Filmcritic.com]]|accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref><ref name="pool">[[#Pooley|Pooley (1987)]], p. 44</ref>

The film's first cut ran at around 117 minutes, which Campbell called an impressive achievement in light of the 65-minute length of the screenplay. It was then edited down to a more marketable 85 minutes.<ref name="editing"/>  Raimi was inspired by the fact that [[Brian De Palma]] was editing his own film ''[[Blow Out]]'' with [[John Travolta]] at the same sound facility.<ref name="editing"/> One of the most intricate moments during editing was the [[stop-motion]] sequence where the corpses "melted", which took hours to cut properly.<ref name="editing"/> The film had unique sounds that required extensive recording from the crew.<ref name="editing"/><ref name="kawin">[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 17</ref> Several sounds were not recorded properly during shooting, which meant the effects had to be redone in the editing rooms. Dead chickens were stabbed to replicate the sounds of mutilated flesh, and Campbell had to scream into a microphone for several hours.<ref name="editing"/>

Much like ''Within the Woods'', ''The Evil Dead'' needed to be blown up to 35mm, then the industry standard, to be played at movie theaters.<ref name="editing"/> The relatively large budget made this a much simpler process with ''The Evil Dead'' than it had been with the short film.<ref name="editing"/>

==Promotion and distribution==
[[File:RedfordTheatreMarquee.jpg|alt=View of a movie theater marquee.|thumb|right|''The Evil Dead'' premiered at the [[Redford Theatre]] because Bruce Campbell watched films there as a child.]]
With the film completed, Raimi and the crew decided to celebrate with a "big premiere".<ref name="premiere"/> They chose to screen the film at Detroit's [[Redford Theatre]], which Campbell had often visited as a child.<ref name="reinforced2"/> Raimi opted to have the most theatrical premiere possible, using custom tickets and wind tracks set in the theater, and ordering ambulances outside the theater to build atmosphere.<ref name="premiere"/><ref>[[#F. Kawin|F. Kawin (2012)]], p. 13</ref> The premiere setup was inspired by horror director [[William Castle]], who would often attempt to scare his audiences by using gimmicks. Local turnout for the premiere exceeded the cast's expectations, with a thousand patrons showing up. The audiences responded enthusiastically to the premiere, which led to Raimi's idea of "touring" the film to build hype.<ref name="premiere">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;125â€“126</ref>

Raimi showed the film to anyone willing to watch it, booking meetings with distribution agents and anyone with experience in the film industry.<ref name="casa">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;136â€“137</ref> Eventually Raimi came across [[Irvin Shapiro]], the man who was responsible for the distribution of [[George A. Romero]]'s ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' and other famous horror films.<ref name="reinforced3">[[#Konow|Konow (2012)]], pp.&nbsp;422â€“425</ref><ref>[[#Warren|Warren (2000)]], pp.&nbsp;125â€“126</ref> Upon first viewing the film, he joked that while it "wasn't ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''", it had commercial potential, and he expressed an interest in distributing it.<ref name="casa"/> It was his idea not to use the then-title ''Book of the Dead'', because it made the film sound boring. Raimi brainstormed several ideas, eventually going with ''The Evil Dead'', deemed the "least worst" title.<ref name="casa"/> Shapiro also advised distributing the film worldwide to garner a larger income, though it required a further financial investment by Raimi, who managed to scrape together what little money he had.<ref name="casa"/>

[[File:Stephen King, Comicon.jpg|alt=Close-up of a man wearing glasses.|thumb|left|upright|[[Stephen King]] cited ''The Evil Dead'' as one of his favorite films, which brought the interest of [[New Line Cinema]].]]
Shapiro was a founder of the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and allowed Raimi to screen the film at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival|1982 festival]] out of competition.<ref name="fuckyeah">[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 24</ref><ref name="cannes"/> [[Stephen King]] was present at its screening and gave the film a rave review. ''[[USA Today]]'' released an article about King's favorite horror films; the author cited ''The Evil Dead'' as his fifth favorite film of the genre.<ref name="cannes">[[#R. Collings|R. Collings (2008)]], p. 26</ref> The film severely affected King, who commented that while watching the film at Cannes, he was "registering things [he] had never seen in a movie before".<ref name="gyu">[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 20</ref> He became one of the film's largest supporters during the early efforts to find a distributor, eventually describing it as the "most ferociously original film of the year", a quote used in the film's promotional pieces.<ref name="thingstoknow"/><ref>[[#R. Collings|R. Collings (2007)]], p. 157</ref> King's comments attracted the interest of critics, who otherwise would likely have dismissed the low-budget thriller.<ref name="gyu"/><ref name="LATIMES">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;151â€“152</ref>

The film's press attracted the attention of British film distribution agent [[Stephen Woolley]].<ref>[[#Finney|Finney (1997)]], p. 58</ref><ref name="bannedyo">[[#Chibnall|Chibnall (2001)]], p. 184</ref> Though he considered the film a big risk, Woolley decided to take on the job of releasing the film in the United Kingdom.<ref>[[#Finney|Finney (1997)]], p. 55</ref> The film was promoted in an unconventional manner for a film of its budget, receiving marketing on par with that of larger budget films.<ref name="LATIMES"/><ref name="charming">[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 19</ref> Dozens of promotional pieces, including film posters and trailers, were showcased in the UK, heavy promotion rarely expended on such a low-budget film.<ref>[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 27</ref> Woolley was impressed by Raimi, whom he called "charming", and was an admirer of the film, which led to his taking more risks with the film's promotion than he normally would have.<ref name="charming"/><ref>[[#Newman|Newman (2011)]], p. 38</ref>

''[[Fangoria]]'' started covering the film in late 1982, writing several articles about the film's long production history.<ref name="twentyone">[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 21</ref> Early critical reception at the time was very positive, and along with ''Fangoria'', King, and Shapiro's approval, the film generated an impressive amount of interest before its commercial premiere.<ref name="LATIMES"/> [[New Line Cinema]], one of the distributors interested in the film, negotiated an agreement to distribute it domestically.<ref name="reinforced3"/> The film had several "sneak previews" before its commercial release, including screenings in New York and Detroit. Audience reception at both screenings was widely enthusiastic, and interest was built for the film to such an extent that wider distribution was planned. New Line Cinema wrote Raimi a check large enough to pay off all the investors, and decided to release the film in a unique manner:<ref name="reinforced3"/> simultaneously into both cinemas and onto [[VHS]], with substantial domestic promotion.<ref name="fuckyeah"/>

Because of its large promotional campaign, the film performed above expectations at the box office.<ref name="fuckyeah"/> It grossed a total of $2,400,000 worldwide, nearly eight times its production budget.<ref name="BOM">{{cite web|title=The Evil Dead|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evildead.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref> The initial domestic gross was described as "disappointing."<ref name="stacks"/> It opened in 15 theaters and grossed $108,000 in its opening weekend.<ref name="stacks"/> Word of mouth later spread, and the film became a "[[sleeper hit]]", making over $600,000 domestically and nearly $2,000,000 overseas.<ref name="stacks"/> In its first week of release in 1983 two years later, the film made Â£100,000 in the UK and quickly became that week's best-selling video release.

The resurgence of ''The Evil Dead'' in the home-video market came through two companies that restored the film from its negatives and issued special editions in 1998: [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] on VHS, and Elite Entertainment on [[laserdisc]]. Anchor Bay was responsible for the film's first [[DVD]] release in 1999, and between them, Elite and Anchor Bay have released six different DVD versions of ''The Evil Dead'', most notably a 2002 "Book Of The Dead" edition, packaged in a latex replica of the ''Necronomicon'' sculpted by Tom Sullivan.<ref>[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 52-3</ref> The film's high-definition debut was in a 2010 [[Blu-ray]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/03/the-evil-dead-blu-ray-review|title=The Evil Dead Blu-ray Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=White, Cindy|date=2010-09-03|accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref>

==Reception==

===Early reception===
Upon its release, contemporary critical opinion was mostly positive.<ref name="reinforced3"/> Bob Martin, editor of ''Fangoria'', reviewed the film before its formal premiere and proclaimed that it "might be the exception to the usual run of low-budget horror films".<ref name="twentyone"/> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film an "instant classic", proclaiming it as "probably the grisliest well-made movie ever."<ref name="LATIMES"/><ref name="bloody"/> In a 1982 review, staff from the [[trade magazine]] ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film "emerges as the nec plus ultra of low-budget gore and shock effect", commenting that the "powerful" and inventive camerawork was key to creating a sense of dread.<ref>{{cite web|author=Variety Staff|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790757?refcatid=31|title=The Evil Dead|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information|RBI]]|date=1982-12-31|accessdate=2012-01-31}}</ref>

British press for the film was positive; Kim Newman of ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'', Richard Cook of ''[[NME]]'', and Julian Petley of ''Film and Filming'' all gave the film good reviews during its early release.<ref name="bloody">[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 22</ref> Petley and Cook compared the film to other contemporary horror films, writing that the film expressed more imagination and "youthful enthusiasm" than an average horror film.<ref name="bloody"/> Cook described the camera work by Raimi as "audacious", stating that the film's visceral nature was greatly helped by the style of direction.<ref name="bloody"/> Woolley, Newman, and several critics complimented the film for its unexpected use of [[black comedy]], which elevated the film above its genre's potential trappings.<ref name="bloody"/> All three critics compared the film to the surrealistic work of [[Georges Franju]] and [[Jean Cocteau]], noting the cinephilic references to Cocteau's film ''[[Orpheus (film)|Orpheus]]''.<ref name="bloody"/> Writer Lynn Schofield Clark in his novel ''From Angels to Aliens'' compared the film to better-known horror films such as ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[The Omen]]'', citing it as a key supernatural thriller.<ref>[[#Schofield Clark|Schofield Clark (2005)]], pp.&nbsp;26â€“28</ref>

===Later reception===
The film continues to receive universal acclaim from modern critics. The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 96% approval rating with an average rating of 8.1/10, based on an aggregation of 53 reviews. It summarized the film: "This classic low budget horror film combines just the right amount of gore and black humor, giving ''The Evil Dead'' an equal amount of thrills and laughs."<ref name="RottenTomatoes">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-evil-dead/ |title=The Evil Dead |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref> ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine stated the film's "reputation was deserved", writing that the film was impressive considering its low budget and the cast's inexperienced nature. He commented that the film successfully blended the "bizarre" combination of ''Night of the Living Dead'', ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' and ''The Three Stooges''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Empire Staff|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=7240|title=The Evil Dead|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|date=2007-09-24|accessdate=2012-01-31}}</ref> A reviewer for [[Film4]] rated ''The Evil Dead'' four-and-a-half stars out of five, musing that the film was "energetic, original and icky" and concluding that Raimi's "splat-stick debut is a tight little horror classic that deserves its cult reputation, despite the best efforts of the censors."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1983/the-evil-dead |title=The Evil Dead review |work=[[Film4]] |publisher=[[Channel Four Television Corporation]] |accessdate=2012-10-11}}</ref>

[[Slant Magazine]]'s Ed Gonzales compared the film to [[Dario Argento]]'s work, citing Raimi's "unnerving wide angle work" as an important factor to the film's atmosphere. He mused that Raimi possessed an "almost unreal ability to suggest the presence of intangible evil", which was what prevented the movie from being "B-movie schlock".<ref>Gonzales, Ed (2002-03-06). [http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-evil-dead/112 Review: ''The Evil Dead'']. [[Slant Magazine]]. Retrieved on 2010-11-20.</ref> [[BBC]] critic Martyn Glanville awarded the film four stars out of five, writing that for Raimi, it served as a better debut film than Tobe Hooper's ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' or [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]''. Glanville noted that other than the "ill-advised trees-that-rape scene", the film is "one of the great modern horror films, an even more impressive when one considers its modest production values."<ref>{{cite web|last=Glanville|first=Martyn|date=2001-03-05|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/02/the_evil_dead_1982_review.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010305142803/http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/02/the_evil_dead_1982_review.shtml|title=The Evil Dead (1982)|publisher=[[BBC]]|archivedate=2001-03-05|accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref>

[[AMC (TV channel)|Filmcritic.com]]'s [[Christopher Null]] gave the film the same rating as Glanville, writing that "Raimi's biggest grossout is schlock horror done the right way" and comparing it to Romero's ''Night of the Living Dead'' in its ability to create stark atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|last=Null|first=Christopher|date=2001-01-01|url=http://movies.amctv.com/movie/1983/The+Evil+Dead|title=The Evil Dead (1983)|publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|Filmcritic.com]]|accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref> ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' writer Pat Graham commented that the film featured several "clever" turns on the standard horror formula, adding that Raimi's "anything-for-an-effect enthusiasm pays off in lots of formally inventive bits."<ref>{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Pat|date=2001-01-01|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-evil-dead/Film?oid=1736507|title=The Evil Dead|publisher=Wrapports|work=[[Chicago Reader]]|accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref> The make-up effects in one of the final scenes was called "amazing" by ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' critic Stephen Garrett, who commented that although the film was light on character development, the "relentless" barrage of violent imagery made for an entertaining film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Pat|date=2005-01-26|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64080/the_evil_dead.html|title=The Evil Dead (1981)|publisher=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]|work=''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref> The same site later cited the film as the 41st greatest horror movie ever made.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2420/100-best-horror-films-the-list/6|title=The 100 best horror films|publisher=Time Out|work=Time Out |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref> Phelim O'Neill of ''[[The Guardian]]'' combined ''The Evil Dead'' and its sequel ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' and listed them as the 23rd best horror film ever made, announcing that the former film "stands above its mostly forgotten peers in the 80s horror boom."<ref>O'Neill, Phelim (2010-10-22).

J.C. MaÃ§ek III of ''[[PopMatters]]'' said, "What is unquestionable is that the Raimis and their pals created a monster in ''The Evil Dead''. It started as a disastrous failure to obtain a big break with a too long, too perilous shoot (note Campbellâ€™s changing hairstyle in the various scenes of the one-day plot). The film went through name changes and bannings only to survive as not only 'the ultimate experience in grueling horror' but as an oft-imitated and cashed-in-on classic, with 30 years of positive reviews to prove it."<ref name="PM"/>
