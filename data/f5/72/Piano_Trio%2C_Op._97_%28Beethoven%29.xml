Rudolf was an amateur pianist and a patron, friend, and composition student of Beethoven. Beethoven dedicated a total of fourteen compositions to the Archduke, who dedicated one of his own to Beethoven in return.</paragraph><paragraph>The trio was written late in the Beethoven's so-called &quot;middle period&quot;.
