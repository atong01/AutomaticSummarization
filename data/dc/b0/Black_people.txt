{{Black People}}
'''Black people''' is a term used in certain countries, often in socially based systems of [[racial classification]] or of ethnicity, to describe persons who are perceived to be [[Dark skin|dark-skinned]] compared to other given populations. As such, the meaning of the expression varies widely both between and within societies, and depends significantly on context. For many other individuals, communities and countries, "black" is also perceived as a derogatory, outdated, reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label, and as a result is neither used nor defined.

Different societies, such as [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]], apply differing criteria regarding who is classified as "black", and these [[Social construction|social constructs]] have also changed over time. In a number of countries, societal variables affect classification as much as skin color, and the social criteria for "blackness" vary. For example, in North America the term ''black people'' is not necessarily an indicator of skin color or ethnic origin but is instead a socially based racial classification related to being [[African American]], with a family history associated with [[Slavery in the United States|institutionalized slavery]]. In South Africa and Latin America, mixed-race people are generally not considered "black", and in other regions, such as Australia and [[Melanesia]], the term "black" has been applied to and/or used by populations with different histories and ancestral backgrounds.

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] interacted with and later conquered parts of [[Mauretania]], an early state that covered modern [[Morocco]], western [[Algeria]], and the Spanish cities [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] during the classical period. The people of the region were noted in [[Classical literature]] as ''[[Mauri (people)|Mauri]]'', which was subsequently rendered as [[Moors]] in English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Moor&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref>

There are a number of black communities in [[North Africa]], some dating from prehistoric communities, others as descendants from the historical [[Trans-Saharan trade]] and after the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century, descendants of slaves from the [[Arab Slave Trade]] in North Africa.<ref>Frigi et al. 2010, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/human_biology/summary/v082/82.4.frigi.html Ancient Local Evolution of African mtDNA Haplogroups in Tunisian Berber Populations], Human Biology, Volume 82, Number 4, August 2010</ref><ref name="biomedcentral.com">Harich et .al 2010, [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/138 The trans-Saharan slave trade – clues from interpolation analyses and high-resolution characterization of mitochondrial DNA lineages]</ref>

In the 18th century, the Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]] "the Bloodthirsty" (1672–1727) raised a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]], who coerced the country into submission.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html Lewis.

According to Dr.&nbsp;[[Carlos Moore (writer)|Carlos Moore]], resident scholar at Brazil's University of the State of Bahia, Afro-multiracials in the Arab world, including Arabs in North Africa, self-identify in ways that resemble [[Latin America]].

[[Anwar Sadat]]'s mother was a dark-skinned Nubian [[Sudan]]ese woman and his father was a lighter-skinned [[Egyptians|Egyptian]]. In response to an advertisement for an acting position, he said, "I am not white but I am not exactly black either. My blackness is tending to reddish".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PoW4pO4q9VwC&printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1 Joseph Finklestone, ''Anwar Sadat: Visionary Who Dared''], pp. 5–7, 31.

[[Fathia Nkrumah]] was another Egyptian with ties to [[West Africa]]. She was the late wife of [[Ghana]]ian revolutionary [[Kwame Nkrumah]], whose marriage was seen as helping plant the seeds of cooperation between Egypt and other African countries as they struggled for independence from European colonization. This helped advance the formation of the [[African Union]].<ref>[http://ausummit-accra.org.gh/index1.php?linkid=289&adate=04%2F07%2F2007&archiveid=140&page=1 African Union Summit]</ref>

Due to the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] nature of Arab society, Arab men, including during the slave trade in North Africa, enslaved more black women than men, and used more black female slaves than males. The men interpreted the [[Qur'an]] to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage (see [[Ma malakat aymanukum and sex]]),<ref>See [[Tahfeem ul Qur'an]] by [[Maududi|Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], Vol. 2, pp. 112–113, footnote 44.

When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master's child, she became ''umm walad'' or "mother of a child", a status that granted her privileged rights. As the child was given rights of inheritance, mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Because the society was [[patrilineal]], the children took their fathers' social status at birth and were born free. Some succeeded their fathers as rulers, as was the case with Sultan [[Ahmad al-Mansur]], who ruled [[Morocco]] from 1578 to 1608, though technically not mixed-race. His mother was a [[Fulani]] [[concubine]] of his father. Such tolerance for black persons, even when technically "free", was not so common in Morocco.<ref>{{cite web| last = Hunwick| first = John| title = Arab Views of Black Africans and Slavery| url=http://www.yale.edu/glc/events/race/Hunwick.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The term ''abd'' ({{lang-ar|عبد}},) (meaning "slave"), is still used as a common term for black people in the Arabic-speaking world.<ref>{{cite news| first = Theola | last = Labbé |author2=Omar Fekeiki | title = A Legacy Hidden in Plain Sight | work = Washington Post | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A6645-2004Jan10 | date = 11 January 2004 | accessdate =29 January 2008 }}</ref>

===South Africa===
[[File:Nelson Mandela-2008 (edit).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Nelson Mandela]] led the [[ANC]] in the battle against South African Apartheid.]]
In [[South Africa]], during the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid era]], beginning in the first half of the twentieth century, the population was classified into four main racial groups: ''Black'', ''White'', ''[[Asia]]n'' (mostly [[India]]n), and ''[[Coloured]]''.<!--These terms are capitalized to denote their legal definitions in South African law.--> The Coloured group included people of mixed [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Khoisan]], and [[European ethnic groups|European]] descent (with some [[Cape Malays|Malay]] ancestry, especially in the [[Western Cape]]). The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa.

The [[apartheid]] bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria in the [[Population Registration Act]] of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group. Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications. When it was unclear from a person's physical appearance whether a person was to be considered Coloured or Black, the "[[Pencil test (South Africa)|pencil test]]" was employed. This involved inserting a pencil in a person's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough for the pencil to get stuck. If so, the person was classified as Black.<ref>{{cite news | last = Nullis| first = Clare | title = Township tourism booming in South Africa| publisher = The Associated Press| year= 2007| url = http://www.canada.com/topics/travel/features/story.html?id=59ec6285-c9fb-41ab-93f9-419f62733f07&k=67896}}</ref> [[Sandra Laing]] is a South African woman who was classified as Coloured by authorities during the apartheid era, due to her [[Human skin colour|skin colour]] and [[hair#hair texture|hair texture]], although she was the child of at least three generations of European ancestors. At age 10, she was expelled from her all-white school, and the authorities' decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life. She was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film ''[[Skin (2008 film)|Skin]]'', which won numerous awards.

During the apartheid era, those classed as "Coloured" were oppressed and discriminated against. But, they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as "Black".

In the post-apartheid era, the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a 'Non-racial democracy". However, the ANC government has introduced laws in support of their [[affirmative action]] policies that define "Black" people to include "Africans", "Coloureds" and "Asians". Their [[affirmative action]] policies have also favored "Africans" over "Coloureds". Some South Africans categorized as "African Black" openly state that "Coloureds" did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid. The popular saying by "Coloured" South Africans to illustrate their dilemma is that "we were not white enough under apartheid, and we are not black enough under the ANC ([[African National Congress]])".

In 2008, the High Court in South Africa ruled that [[Chinese South Africans]] who were residents during the apartheid era (and their descendents) are to be reclassified as "Black people" solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits, because they were also "disadvantaged" by racial discrimination. Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article4168245.ece "We agree that you are black, South African court tells Chinese"], ''The Times''</ref>

Other than by appearance, "Coloureds" can usually be distinguished from "Blacks" by language. Most speak [[Afrikaans]] or English as a [[first language]], as opposed to [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] or [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]. They also tend to have more European-sounding names than [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] names.<ref>{{cite news | last = du Preez| first = Max| title = Coloureds&nbsp;– the most authentic SA citizens| work= The Star|date=13 April 2006| url = http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3201857}}</ref>

[[File:Aborigine.png|thumb|right|134px|Unknown [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] woman in 1911]]
[[Indigenous Australians]] have been referred to as "black people" in Australia since the [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|early days of European settlement]].<ref>http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4219798</ref> While originally related to [[skin colour]], the term is used to today to indicate Aboriginal or [[Torres Strait Islander]] [[ancestry]] in general and can refer to people of any skin pigmentation.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/aboriginal-identity-goes-beyond-skin-colour-20110406-1d40r.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Aboriginal identity goes beyond skin colour}}</ref>

Being identified as either "black" or "white" in [[Australia]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one's employment and social prospects. Various state-based [[Aboriginal Protection Board]]s were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of Indigenous Australians – where they lived, their employment, marriage, education and included the power to separate children from their parents.<ref>{{cite book | last = Broome | first = Richard | title = Aboriginal Victorians: A History Since 1800 | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]] | year = 2005 | pages = 130–131 | isbn = 978-1-74114-569-4}}</ref><ref>[http://aeon.sro.wa.gov.au/Investigator/Details/Agency_Detail.asp?Id=1200 Aboriginal Protection Board at the ''State Records Office of Western Australia'', accessed 20 December 2012]</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-54.html |title=Aboriginal Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 (Qld) |publisher=Museum of Australian Democracy |accessdate=2012-12-19 }}</ref> Aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/whole34.pdf |pages=1–24 |first=Heather |last=Goodall |title=Land In Our Own Country: The Aboriginal Land Rights Movement in South Eastern Australia, 1860 to 1914 |journal=Aboriginal History |volume=14 |year=1990 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/42696/2/Aborigines.pdf |first=Mick |last=Armstrong |title=Aborigines: Problems of Race and Class | year=2004 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> The social position of mixed-race or "[[half-caste]]" individuals varied over time. A 1913 report by Sir [[Walter Baldwin Spencer|Baldwin Spencer]] states that:
{{quote|the half-castes belong neither to the aboriginal nor to the whites, yet, on the whole, they have more leaning towards the former; ... One thing is certain and that is that the white population as a whole will never mix with half-castes... the best and kindest thing is to place them on reserves along with the natives, train them in the same schools and encourage them to marry amongst themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.aus-vn5548412 |title=Preliminary Report on the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory| first=Sir Bernard |last=Spencer |date=20 May 1913 |page=21 }}</ref>}}

After the [[First World War]], however, it became apparent that the number of mixed-race people was growing at a faster rate than the white population, and by 1930 fear of the "half-caste menace" undermining the [[White Australia Policy|White Australia]] ideal from within was being taken as a serious concern.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/funding/awards/pmla/2012/first-chapters/Indifferent-inclusions-%28Chap1%29.pdf |title=Indifferent Inclusion: Aboriginal People and the Australian Nation |first=Russell |last=McGregor |publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press |year=2012 |chapter=1 |pages=1–5}}</ref> Dr. [[Cecil Cook (Australia)|Cecil Cook]], the [[Northern Territory]] [[Protector of Aborigines|Protector of Natives]], noted that:

The second half of the 20th century to the present has seen a gradual shift towards improved human rights for Aboriginal people. In [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|a 1967 referendum]] over 90% of the Australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include Aborigines in the national [[census]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Indigenous-Australia-Timeline-1901-to-1969 |title=Indigenous Australia Timeline – 1901 to 1969 |date=3 November 2011 |publisher=Australian Museum }}</ref> During this period many Aboriginal activists began to embrace the term "black" and use their ancestry as a source of pride.

There were eight principal areas used by Europeans to buy and ship slaves to the Western Hemisphere. The number of enslaved people sold to the New World varied throughout the slave trade. As for the distribution of slaves from regions of activity, certain areas produced far more enslaved people than others. Between 1650 and 1900, 10.24 million enslaved West Africans arrived in the Americas from the following regions in the following proportions:<ref name="Lovejoy">Lovejoy, Paul E.

The variants ''neger'' and ''negar'', derive from the Spanish and Portuguese word {{lang|es|''negro''}} (black), and from the now-pejorative French ''nègre'' (negro). Etymologically, ''negro'', ''noir'', ''nègre'', and ''nigger'' ultimately derive from ''nigrum'', the stem of the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|''niger''}} (black) (pronounced {{IPA|[ˈniɡer]}} which, in every other [[grammatical case]], [[grammatical gender]], and [[grammatical number]] besides [[nominative case|nominative]] masculine singular, is ''nigr-'', the ''r'' is [[Alveolar trill|trilled]]).<!--Romance language nouns (typically) derive from the accusative case, not the nominative case quoted in English. -->

By the 1900s, ''nigger'' had become a pejorative word in the [[United States]]. In its stead, the term ''[[colored]]'' became the mainstream alternative to ''[[negro]]'' and its derived terms. After the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|African-American Civil rights movement]], the terms ''colored'' and ''negro'' gave way to "black".

One well-known example is the identification by Reverend [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] of his own race as "Negro" in his famous speech of 1963, [[I Have a Dream]]. During the American Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, some African-American leaders in the United States, notably [[Malcolm X]], objected to the word ''Negro'' because they associated it with the long history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second class citizens, or worse.<ref>Smith, Tom W.

Since the late 1960s, various other terms for African Americans have been more widespread in popular usage. Aside from ''Black American'', these include ''Afro-American'' (in use from the late 1960s to 1990) and ''African American'' (used in the United States to refer to Black Americans, people often referred to in the past as ''American Negroes'').<ref>Christopher H. Foreman, The African-American predicament, Brookings Institution Press, 1999, p.99.</ref>

In the first 200 years that black people were in the [[United States]], they primarily identified themselves by their specific [[ethnic groups of Africa|ethnic group]] (closely allied to language) and not by skin color. Individuals identified themselves, for example, as [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Kongo people|Bakongo]], or [[Wolof people|Wolof]]. However, when the first captives were brought to [[the Americas]], they were often combined with other groups from West Africa, and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists. In areas of the Upper South, different ethnic groups were brought together. This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region: the West African coastline stretching from [[Senegal]] to [[Angola]] and in some cases from the south-east coast such as [[Mozambique]]. A new ''African American'' identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as the [[Black church]] and [[AAVE|Black English]]. This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} By contrast, slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans, including ethnicities and given tribal names.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Africans_in_Colonial_Louisiana.html?id=Arybfb4UWtwC Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century''], Louisiana State University Press, 1992/1995</ref>

The US racial or ethnic classification "black" refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation, from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors, including [[albinos]], if they are believed by others to have West African ancestry (in any discernible percentage), or to exhibit cultural traits associated with being "[[African American]]". As a result, in the United States the term "black people" is not an indicator of skin color or ethnic origin but is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American, with a family history associated with [[Slavery in the United States|institutionalized slavery]].<ref>{{Cite book |last =Glenn |first =Evelyn Nakano |year = 2009|title =Shades of difference: why skin color matters |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=WewhspE2Q9UC&lpg=PR1&dq=Shades%20of%20difference%3A%20why%20skin%20color%20matters&pg=PA225#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=225 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-5998-4|accessdate = |postscript =<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In March 1807, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], which largely controlled the Atlantic, declared [[Slave Trade Act 1807|the transatlantic slave trade illegal]], as did the United States. (The latter prohibition took effect 1 January 1808, the earliest date on which [[United States Congress|Congress]] had the power to do so after protecting the slave trade under [[wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Section 9|Article I, Section 9]] of the [[United States Constitution]].)

By that time, the majority of black people in the United States were native-born, so the use of the term "African" became problematic. Though initially a source of pride, many blacks feared the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US. They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa. In 1835, black leaders called upon Black Americans to remove the title of "African" from their institutions and replace it with "[[Negro]]" or "Colored American". A few institutions chose to keep their historic names, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]. African Americans popularly used the terms "Negro" or "colored" for themselves until the late 1960s.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1594200831/ ''African American Journeys to Africa''], pp. 63–64</ref>

The term ''black'' was used throughout but not frequently since it carried a certain stigma. In his 1963 "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech,<ref>{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1732754907698549493 | people = Martin Luther King, Jr.| title = I Have a Dream| medium = Google Video| location = Washington, D.C.|date=28 August 1963 }} {{wayback|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1732754907698549493 |date=20100315154454 }}</ref> [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] uses the terms ''negro'' fifteen times and ''black'' four times. Each time he uses ''black'' it is in parallel construction with ''white''; for example, "black men and white men".<ref>{{cite journal| last = Smith|first= Tom W.|title = Changing Racial Labels: From "Colored" to "Negro" to "Black" to "African American"| journal = The Public Opinion Quarterly| volume = 56| issue=4|pages = 496–514|oclc=192150485| url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/soc522a/PDF%20readings/Smith.pdf|date = Winter 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| doi = 10.1086/269339|format=PDF}}</ref>

With the successes of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]], a new term was needed to break from the past and help shed the reminders of legalized discrimination. In place of ''Negro'', activists promoted the use of ''black'' as standing for racial pride, militancy, and power. Some of the turning points included the use of the term "[[Black Power]]" by Kwame Toure ([[Stokely Carmichael]]) and the popular singer [[James Brown]]'s song "[[Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud]]".

In 1988, the civil rights leader [[Jesse Jackson]] urged Americans to use instead the term "African American" because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants, such as German American, Italian American, etc. Since then, African American and black have often had parallel status. However, controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate. [[Maulana Karenga]] argue African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates geographical and historical origin.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Others have argued that "black" is a better term because "African" suggests foreignness, although Black Americans helped found the United States.<ref>{{cite news| last = McWhorter| first = John H.| title = Why I'm Black, Not African American| work= Los Angeles Times|date=8 September 2004| url = http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_latimes-why_im_black.htm| accessdate =26 September 2010}}</ref> Still others believe the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones.<ref name=Relethford2000>{{cite journal |last1=Relethford |first1=JH |title=Human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations |journal=Human Biology; an international record of research |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=773–80 |year=2000 |pmid=11126724}}</ref><ref name="Shriver2003">{{cite journal |pages=387–399 |doi=10.1007/s00439-002-0896-y |url=http://backintyme.com/admixture/shriver01.pdf | pmid=12579416 |volume=112 |issue=4 |title=Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry and admixture mapping |date=April 2003 |author=Shriver M.D., Parra E.J., Dios S. |journal=Human Genetics|author2=and others |displayauthors=1 |doi_brokendate=2015-01-02 }}</ref> Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for "African American" or "Black",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/black-african-american.aspx|title=Black or African American?|first=Frank|last=Newport|publisher=Gallup|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=26 September 2010}}</ref> although they have a slight preference for "black" in personal settings and "African American" in more formal settings.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Miller| first1 = Pepper| last2 = Kemp|first2=Herb | title = What's Black About?

Increases in the number of black immigrants to the United States from parts of [[African immigration to the United States|Africa]], the Caribbean, and Latin America since the late twentieth century have raised questions about who uses the term African American. The more recent immigrants may view themselves, and be viewed, as ethno-culturally distinct from native-born Americans who descend from West African slaves.<ref name="Swarns">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DB1F3EF93AA1575BC0A9629C8B63|title='African American' Becomes a Term for Debate|last=Swarns|first=Rachel L.|date=29 August 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=22 July 2008}}</ref>

The [[Race (United States Census)|U.S. census race definitions]] says a "black" is a person having origins in any of the black (sub-Saharan) racial groups of Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as "Black, African Am., or Negro" or who provide written entries such as African American, Afro-American, [[Kenyan]], [[Nigerian]], or [[Haiti]]an. The [[Census Bureau]] notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/mso/www/c2000basics/00Basics.pdf 2000 US Census basics]</ref> Most African Americans also have [[Europe]]an ancestry in varying amounts; a lesser proportion have some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry. For instance, genetic studies of African Americans show an ancestry that is on average 17–18% European.<ref>[http://www.isteve.com/2002_How_White_Are_Blacks.htm Steve Sailer, "How White Are Blacks?

====One-drop rule====
[[File:Frederick Douglass portrait.jpg|thumb|Multiracial social reformer [[Frederick Douglass]].]]
From the late nineteenth century, the South used a [[colloquial]] term, the ''[[one-drop rule]]'', to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry. This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early twentieth century.<ref name=Davis>{{cite web| last = James| first = F. Davis| title = Who is Black? One Nation's Definition| url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/mixed/onedrop.html| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}</ref> Legally the definition varied from state to state. Racial definition was more flexible in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before the [[American Civil War]]. For instance, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held persons who were legally white (less than 25% black) according to Virginia law at the time, but, because they were born to slave mothers, they were born into slavery, according to the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', which Virginia adopted into law in 1662.

Outside of the US, some other countries have adopted the one-drop rule, but the definition of who is black and the extent to which the one-drop "rule" applies varies greatly from country to country.

The one-drop rule may have originated as a means of increasing the number of black slaves<ref>[[Clarence Page]], [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/page_5-1.html A Credit to His Races], ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'', 1 May 1997.</ref> and was maintained as an attempt to keep the white race pure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://backintyme.com/essays/?p=25|title=Presenting the Triumph of the One-Drop Rule|last=Sweet|first=Frank|date=1 April 2006|work=The One-Drop Rule|accessdate=22 July 2008}}</ref> One of the results of the one-drop rule was the uniting of the African-American community.<ref name=Davis/> Some of the most prominent abolitionists and civil-rights activists of the nineteenth century were multiracial, such as [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Robert Purvis]] and James Mercer Langston. They advocated equality for all.

The concept of blackness in the United States has been described as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream [[African American culture]], politics,<ref name=Eze>Chielozona Eze, Postcolonial Imaginations and Moral Representations (2011), p. 25, books.google.com/books?isbn=0739145088:"For Du Bois, blackness is political, it is existential, but above all, it is moral, for in it values abound; these values spring from the fact of being an oppressed."</ref><ref name=Olson>Barbara Olson, The Final Days (2003), p. 58, books.google.com/books?isbn=0895261251:"In fact, Bill Clinton had promoted an even worse variation, that authentic blackness is political..."</ref> and values.<ref>{{cite book|last=OLATUNDE|first=ALLEN TIMILEHIN|title=MISSIONS IN THE DARK SOIL: Life and Work of Thomas Jefferson Bowen in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnnTBQAAQBAJ|publisher=aiconcept|isbn=978-978-52387-6-1|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=BnnTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA92 92]}}</ref> To a certain extent, this concept is not so much about race but more about political orientation,<ref name=Eze/><ref name=Olson/> culture and behavior. Blackness can be contrasted with "[[acting white]]", where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans with regard to [[fashion]], [[dialect]], taste in [[music]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kent.edu/Magazine/Spring2007/ActingWhite.cfm|title=Acting White|last=Edler|first=Melissa|date=Spring 2007|work=Kent State Magazine|accessdate=22 July 2008}}</ref> and possibly, from the perspective of a significant number of black youth, academic achievement.<ref>Ogbu, J.

Due to the often political<ref name=Eze/><ref name=Olson/> and cultural contours of blackness in the United States, the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people. [[Toni Morrison]] once described [[Bill Clinton]] as the first black [[President of the United States]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/books/int/2002/02/20/clinton/index.html|title=Blacks and Bill Clinton |last=Hansen |first=Suzy |date=20 February 2002 |work=Salon |accessdate=22 July 2008}}</ref> because, as she put it, he displayed "almost every trope of blackness".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/10/05/comment-6543|title=Comment|author=Toni Morrison|authorlink=Toni Morrison|date=October 5, 1998|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> [[Christopher Hitchens]] was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president, noting, "Mr Clinton, according to Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is our first black President, the first to come from the broken home, the alcoholic mother, the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems.

The question of blackness also arose in the Democrat [[Barack Obama]]'s [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]]. Commentators have questioned whether Obama, who was elected the first President with black ancestry, is "black enough", contending that his background is not typical because his mother was [[white American]], and his father was a black [[Kenyan American|Kenyan immigrant]].<ref name=obama-speech/><ref name=obama-time/> Obama chose to identify as black and [[African-American]].<ref name=Kroft>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/11/60minutes/main2458530.shtml|title=A Transcript Excerpt Of Steve Kroft’s Interview With Sen.

In July 2012, Ancestry.com reported on historic and [[DNA]] research by its staff that discovered that Obama is likely a descendant through his mother of [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]], considered by some historians to be the first African slave in the [[Virginia]] colony. An [[indentured servant]], he was "bound for life" in 1640 after trying to escape. The story of him and his descendants is that of multi-racial America since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women, likely indentured servants and working class like them. Their [[multi-racial]] children were free because they were born to free [[English people|English]] women. Over time, Obama's line of the Bunch family (as they became known) were property owners and continued to "marry white"; they became part of white society, likely by the early to mid-eighteenth century.<ref name="Harman">[http://c.mfcreative.com/offer/us/obama_bunch/PDF/main_article_final.pdf Anastasia Harman, Natalie D.

==South America==
Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to [[the Americas]] during the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from 1492 to 1888, with 11.5 million of those shipped to [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]].<ref>United Nations Slavery Memorial, http://www.unslaverymemorial.org/history.html: "Accurate figures are still not available but at a conservative estimate, using the figures that have been generated by the latest Slave Trade Database, of the estimated millions transported, Portugal dominated the trade with 5.8 million or 46%, while Great Britain transported 3.25 million or 26%, France accounted for 1.38 million or 11%, and Spain 1.06 million or 8%. So it is unmistakable, that the 4 leading colonial powers accounted for a combined total of 11.5 million Africans or 92 % of the overall trade. The remainder was transported by the US 305,326, the Netherlands 554,336, and Denmark/Baltic 111,041. There were several stages to the trade. During the first phase between 1501 and1600, an estimated 277,509 Africans or just 2 % of the overall trade, were sent to the Americas and Europe. During the 17th century, some 15 % or 1,875,631 Africans embarked for the Americas. The period from 1701 to the passage of the British Abolition Act in 1807 was the peak of the trade. Here an estimated 7,163,241 or 57% of the trafficking in Africans transpired, with the remaining 26 % or 3,204,935 occurring between 1808 and 1866."</ref> Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas, with 5.5 million African slaves imported, followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million, the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans, and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million.<ref>United Nations Slavery Memorial, http://www.unslaverymemorial.org/history.html:"In the Americas, Brazil was the largest importer of Africans, accounting for 5.5 million or 44%, the British Caribbean with 2.76 million or 22%, the French Caribbean 1.32 million, and the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland accounting for 1.59 million. The relatively high numbers for Brazil and the British Caribbean is largely a reflection of the dominance and continued expansion of the plantation system in those regions.

The concept of race in Brazil is complex. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both of his or her parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Between an individual of unmixed West African descent and a very light [[mulatto]] individual, more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged, based on combinations of [[Human hair color|hair color]], [[Hair#Hair Texture|hair texture]], [[eye color]], and [[Human skin color|skin color]]. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. In Brazil, people are classified by appearance, not heredity.<ref name="skidmore">{{cite journal| first = Thomas E. | last = Skidmore | title = Fact and Myth: Discovering a Racial Problem in Brazil| journal = Working Paper| volume = 173|url=http://www.nd.edu/~kellogg/publications/workingpapers/WPS/173.pdf|date=April 1992|format=PDF}}</ref>

Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil. It is generally believed that achieving [[Social mobility|upward mobility]] and education results in individuals being classified as a category of lighter skin. The popular claim is that in Brazil, poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white. Some scholars disagree, arguing that "[[Racial whitening|whitening]]" of one's social status may be open to people of [[mixed race]], a large part of the population known as ''[[pardo]]'', but a person perceived as ''preto'' (black) will continue to be classified as black regardless of wealth or social status.<ref name=Telles>{{cite book| last = Edward E. | first = Telles| title = Race in Another America: The Significance of Skin Color in Brazil| pages = 95–98| publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| year= 2004| isbn =0-691-11866-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| first = Edward E. | last = Telles| title = Racial Ambiguity Among the Brazilian Population| journal = Ethnic and Racial Studies|url=http://www.ccpr.ucla.edu/ccprwpseries/ccpr_012_01.pdf| volume = 25| pages = 415–441| date= 3 May 2002| publisher = California Center for Population Research| doi = 10.1080/01419870252932133|format=PDF| issue = 3}}</ref>

From the year 1500 to 1850, an estimated 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil; the territory received the highest number of slaves of any country in the Americas.<ref name=Telles/> Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals. Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa. In contrast to the US, during the slavery period and after, the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-[[miscegenation]] or segregation laws. As in other Latin countries, intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward. In addition, people of mixed race (''pardo'') often tended to marry white, and their descendants became accepted as white. As a result, some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood. According to the last census of the twentieth century, in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified, 54% of individuals identified as white, 6.2% identified as black, and 39.5% identified as pardo (brown)&nbsp;— a broad multi-racial category, including tri-racial persons.<ref>{{cite web| title = CIA World Factbook: Brazil| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html}}</ref>

In the nineteenth century, a philosophy of [[racial whitening]] emerged in Brazil, related to the assimilation of mixed-race people into the white population through intermarriage. Until recently the government did not keep data on race. However, statisticians estimate that in 1835, roughly 50% of the population was ''preto'' (black; most were [[Slavery in Latin America|enslaved]]), a further 20% was ''pardo'' (brown), and 25% white, with the remainder [[Amerindian]]. Some classified as pardo were tri-racial.

By the 2000 census, demographic changes including the end to slavery, immigration from Europe and Asia, assimilation of multiracial persons, and other factors resulted in a population in which 6.2% of the population identified as black, 40% as pardo, and 55% as white. Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multi-racial category by intermixing.<ref name="skidmore"/> A 2007 genetic study found that at least 29% of the middle-class, white Brazilian population had some recent (since 1822 and the end of the colonial period) African ancestry.<ref>[http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2007/vol2-6/gmr0330_full_text.htm "Sex-biased gene flow in African Americans but not in American Caucasians"], ''GMR,'' 2007, Vol. 12 No. 6</ref>

====Race relations in Brazil====
[[File:Ogum.JPG|thumb|right|Brazilian [[Candomblé]] ceremony]]
Because of the acceptance of [[miscegenation]], Brazil has avoided the binary polarization of society into black and white. In addition, it abolished slavery without a civil war. The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil. According to the 2010 census, 6.7% of Brazilians said they were black, compared with 6.2% in 2000, and 43.1% said they were mixed race, up from 38.5%. In 2010, Elio Ferreira de Araujo, Brazil's minister for racial equality, attributed the increases to growing pride among his country's black and indigenous communities.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/25/brazil-2010-census-kalunga "Brazil's census offers recognition at last to descendants of runaway slaves"], ''Guardian''</ref>

The philosophy of the racial democracy in Brazil has drawn some criticism, based on economic issues. Brazil has one of the largest gaps in income distribution in the world. The richest 10% of the population earn 28 times the average income of the bottom 40%. The richest 10 percent is almost exclusively white or predominately European in ancestry. One-third of the population lives under the poverty line, with blacks and other [[people of color]] accounting for 70 percent of the poor.<ref>{{cite web| last = Barrolle| first = Melvin Kadiri| title = African 'Americans' in Brazil| publisher =New America Media| url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=5b8d531de860940110af2433244782c6| accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref>

In the US, African Americans, who include multiracial people, earn 75% of what white people earn.<ref name=Phillips>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/17/brazil-census-african-brazilians-majority Tom Phillips, "Brazil census shows African-Brazilians in the majority for the first time"], ''The Guardian'', 17 November 2011</ref> In Brazil, people of color earn less than 50% of what whites earn. Some <!-- who? -->have posited that the facts of lower socioeconomic status for people of color suggest that Brazil practices a kind of [[one-drop rule]], or discrimination against people who are not visibly European in ancestry. The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and all people of color. Other social factors, such as illiteracy and education levels, show the same patterns of disadvantage for people of color.<ref>{{cite web| last = Roland| first = Edna Maria Santos| title = The Economics of Racism: People of African Descent in Brazil| url=http://www.falapreta.org.br/durban/racism.doc}}</ref>
Some commentators observe that the United States practice of [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and [[white supremacy]] in the South, and discrimination in many areas outside that region, forced many African Americans to unite in the civil rights struggle. They suggest that the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African descent, between those with more or less ancestry. As a result, they have not united for a stronger civil rights movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage<ref name=Phillips /> of the population, few blacks have been elected as politicians. The city of [[Salvador, Bahia]], for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color. Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities, such as [[Detroit]] and [[New Orleans]], have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century. New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/><ref>Charles Whitaker, "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n4_v46/ai_9329550/pg_3 Blacks in Brazil: The Myth and the Reality]", ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', February 1991.</ref> New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.

Critics note that people of color have limited media visibility. The Brazilian media has been accused of hiding or overlooking the nation's Black, Indigenous, Multiracial and East Asian populations. For example, the [[telenovelas]] or [[Soap Opera|soaps]] are criticized for featuring actors who resemble [[northern Europe]]ans rather than actors of the more prevalent [[Southern Europe]]an features) and [[White people#Brazil|light-skinned mulatto and mestizo]] appearance. (Pardos may achieve 'white' status if they have attained the middle class or higher social status).

These patterns of discrimination against non-whites have led some academic and other activists to advocate for use of the Portuguese term ''negro'' to encompass all African-descended people, in order to stimulate a "black" consciousness and identity.<ref>[http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2006/brazil_separates_into_a_world_of_black_and_white "Brazil Separates Into a World of Black and White"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 3 September 2006.</ref> This proposal has been criticized since the term [[pardo]] is considered to include a wide range of multiracial people, such as [[caboclo]]s (mestizos), assimilated Amerindians and tri-racials, not only people of partial African and European descent. Trying to identify this entire group as "black" would be a false imposition of a different identity from outside the culture and deny people their other, equally valid, ancestries and cultures. It seems a one-drop rule in reverse.
