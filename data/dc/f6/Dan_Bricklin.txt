Accessed January 3, 2011.</ref> He currently serves as the Chief Technology Officer of [[Alpha Software]].<ref>[https://www.alphasoftware.com/people.asp]</ref>

==Early life==
Bricklin was born in a [[Jewish]] family<ref>{{cite web|title=A list of famous Jewish American Computer Scientists.|url=http://www.jewishsoftware.net/jewish-software/jewish-american-computer-scientists/|publisher=Jewish Software|accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref> in [[Philadelphia]], where he attended [[Akiba Hebrew Academy]] during his high school years. He earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1973, where he was a resident of [[List of MIT dormitories#Bexley Hall|Bexley Hall]]. He began his college career as a [[mathematics]] major, but soon switched to computer science.<ref name="TS"/><ref name="EI"/>

Upon graduating from MIT, Bricklin worked for Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) until 1976, when he began working for FasFax, a cash register manufacturer. In 1977, he decided to return to school, and he earned a [[Master of Business Administration]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1979.<ref name="TS"/><ref name="EI"/>

While a student at Harvard Business School, Bricklin co-developed VisiCalc in 1979, making it the first electronic spreadsheet readily available for home and office use. It ran on an [[Apple II]] computer, and was considered a fourth generation software program. VisiCalc is widely credited for fueling the rapid growth of the personal computer industry. Instead of doing financial projections with manually calculated spreadsheets, and having to recalculate with every single cell in the sheet, VisiCalc allowed the user to change any cell, and have the entire sheet automatically recalculated. This turned 20 hours of work into 15 minutes and allowed for more creativity.<ref name="TS"/><ref name="EI"/><ref name="Inventors">[http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa010199.htm The First Spreadsheet - VisiCalc. [[About.com: Inventors]]. Accessed January 3, 2011.</ref>
