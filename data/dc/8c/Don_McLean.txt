'''Donald "Don" McLean III''' (born October{{nbsp}}2, 1945) is an American singer-songwriter best known for the 1971 album ''[[American Pie (album)|American Pie]]'', containing the songs "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]" and "[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]".

==Musical roots==
McLean's grandfather and father were also named Donald McLean. The Buccis, the family of McLean's mother, Elizabeth, came from [[Abruzzo]] in central [[Italy]]. They left Italy and settled in [[Port Chester]], New York, at the end of the 19th century. He has other extended family in Los Angeles and Boston.<ref name=bio>{{cite book |title=The Don McLean Story: Killing Us Softly With His Songs |last=Howard |first=Alan |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Lulu Press Inc. |location= |isbn=978-1-4303-0682-5 |page=420 }}</ref>

Though some of his early musical influences included Frank Sinatra and Buddy Holly,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url = |title = Bye-Bye, Mr. 'American Pie' -- Don McLean Gives His Pen a Rest|last = Arnold|first = Thomas|date = March 23, 1990|work = Los Angeles Times|access-date = October 4, 2015|via = ProQuest}}</ref> as a teenager, McLean became interested in [[folk music]], particularly the [[The Weavers|Weavers]]' 1955 recording ''[[The Weavers at Carnegie Hall|At Carnegie Hall]]''. Childhood asthma meant that McLean missed long periods of school, particularly music lessons, and although he slipped back in his studies, his love of music was allowed to flourish. He often performed shows for family and friends. By age 16 he had bought his first guitar (a [[Harmony guitars|Harmony]] acoustic [[archtop]] with a sunburst finish) and began making contacts in the music business, becoming friends with folk singer [[Erik Darling]] and [[Fred Hellerman]], both members of the Weavers. Hellerman said, "He called me one day and said, 'I'd like to come and visit you', and that's what he did! We became good friends - he has the most remarkable music memory of anyone I've ever known."<ref name=bio/> McLean recorded his first studio sessions (with singer [[Lisa Kindred]]) while still in [[University-preparatory school|prep school]].

When McLean was 15, his father passed away. Fulfilling his father's request, McLean graduated from [[Iona Preparatory School]] in 1968 with a degree in economics,<ref name=":0" /> and briefly attended [[Villanova University]], dropping out after four months. While at Villanova he became friends with singer/songwriter [[Jim Croce]].

After leaving Villanova, McLean became associated with famed folk music agent [[Harold Leventhal]] for several months before teaming up with personal manager Herb Gart for 18 years. For the next six years he performed at venues and events including [[The Bitter End]] and [[the Gaslight Cafe|Gaslight Cafe]] in New York, the [[Newport Folk Festival]], the [[the Cellar Door|Cellar Door]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[the Troubadour (Los Angeles)|Troubadour]] in Los Angeles.<ref name=bio/> Concurrently, McLean attended night school at [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] and received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[business administration]] in 1968. He turned down a scholarship to [[Columbia University]] Graduate School in favor of pursuing a career as a singer/songwriter, performing at such venues as [[Caffè Lena]] in [[Saratoga Springs]], New York and [[The Main Point]] in Bryn Mawr, PA.

Later that year, with the help of a grant from the [[New York State Council on the Arts]], McLean began reaching a wider public, with visits to towns up and down the [[Hudson River]].<ref name=bio/> He learned the art of performing from his friend and mentor [[Pete Seeger]]. McLean accompanied Seeger on his [[Sloop Clearwater|Clearwater]] boat trip up the [[Hudson River]] in 1969 to raise awareness about environmental pollution in the river. During this time McLean wrote songs that would appear on his first album, ''[[Tapestry (Don McLean album)|Tapestry]].'' McLean co-edited the book ''Songs and Sketches of the First Clearwater Crew'' with sketches by [[Thomas B. Allen]] for which Pete Seeger wrote the foreword.  Seeger and McLean sang "[[Oh Shenandoah|Shenandoah]]" on the 1974 Clearwater album.

==Recording career==

===Early breakthrough===
McLean recorded ''Tapestry'' in 1969 in Berkeley, California, during the student riots.  After being rejected 72 times by labels, the album was released by [[Mediarts]], a label that did not exist when Don first started to look for a label.  It attracted good reviews but little notice outside the folk community, though on the Easy Listening chart "Castles In The Air" was a success, and in 1973 "And I Love You So" became a number 1 Adult Contemporary hit for [[Perry Como]].

McLean's major break came when Mediarts was taken over by [[United Artists Records]], thus securing the promotion of a major label for his second album, ''[[American Pie (album)|American Pie]].''  The album spawned two No. 1 hits in the title song and "[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]". ''American Pie''&#39;s success made McLean an international star and piqued interest in his first album, which charted more than two years after its initial release.

==="American Pie"===
{{Main|American Pie (song)}}

McLean's [[magnum opus]], "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]", is a sprawling, impressionistic ballad inspired partly by the deaths of [[Buddy Holly]], [[Ritchie Valens]] and J. P. Richardson ([[The Big Bopper]]) in a plane crash on February 3, 1959. The song popularized the expression "[[The Day the Music Died]]" in reference to this event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean?from=Main.DonMcLean |title=Don McLean (Music) |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}</ref>

The song was recorded on May 26, 1971, and a month later received its first radio airplay on New York's WNEW-FM and WPLJ-FM to mark the closing of [[Fillmore East]], the famous New York concert hall.  "American Pie" reached number one on the [[Hot 100]] from 15 January - 5 February 1972 and remains McLean's most successful single release.  The single also topped the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Easy Listening]] survey.  With a total running time of 8:36 encompassing both sides of the single, it is also the longest song to reach No. 1.  Some stations played only part one of the original split-sided single release.

[[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] DJ Bob Dearborn unraveled the lyrics and first published his interpretation on January 7, 1972, eight days before the song reached No. 1 nationally (see "Further reading" under [[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]).  Numerous other interpretations, which together largely converged on Dearborn's interpretation, quickly followed.  McLean declined to say anything definitive about the lyrics until 1978.  Since then McLean has stated that the lyrics are also somewhat autobiographical and present an abstract story of his life from the mid-1950s until the time he wrote the song in the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.don-mclean.com/americanpie.asp|title=Don McLean's American Pie|work=Don McLean Online - The Official Website}}</ref>

In 2001 "American Pie" was voted No. 5 in a poll of the 365 [[Songs of the Century]] compiled by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].  The top five:  "[[Over the Rainbow]]", written by [[Harold Arlen]] and [[E.Y. "Yip" Harburg]] (performed by [[Judy Garland]] in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''); "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]", written by [[Irving Berlin]] (best-known performance by [[Bing Crosby]]); "[[This Land Is Your Land]]", written and performed by [[Woody Guthrie]]; "[[Respect (song)|Respect]]", written by [[Otis Redding]] (best-known performance by [[Aretha Franklin]]); and "American Pie".

On April 7, 2015, McLean’s original working manuscript for “American Pie” sold for $1,205,000 (£809,524/€1,109,182) at Christie’s auction rooms, New York, making it the third highest auction price achieved for an American literary manuscript.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/salelanding/index.aspx?intSaleID=25290 |title=Don McLean's "American Pie" : The Original Lyrics |publisher=Christies.com |accessdate=2015-08-25}}</ref>

===Subsequent recordings===
[[File:Don McLean 1976.JPG|thumb|Don McLean publicity photo, 1976]]
Personnel from the ''[[American Pie (album)|American Pie]]'' album sessions were retained for his third album ''[[Don McLean (album)|Don McLean]]'', including producer, Ed Freeman, [[Rob Stoner|Rob Rothstein]] on bass and [[Warren Bernhardt]] on piano. The song "The Pride Parade" provides an insight into McLean's immediate reaction to stardom. McLean told ''[[Melody Maker]]'' magazine in 1973 that ''Tapestry'' was an album by someone previously concerned with external situations. ''[[American Pie (album)|American Pie]]'' combines externals with internals and the resultant success of that album makes the third one (''[[Don McLean (album)|Don McLean]]'') entirely introspective."

Other songs written by McLean for the album included "Dreidel" (number 21 on the Billboard chart) and "If We Try" (number 58), which was subsequently recorded by [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref>[[The Great Olivia Newton-John]], Festival Records, 1999.</ref> "On the Amazon" from the 1920s musical [[Mr Cinders]] was an unusual choice but became an audience favorite in concerts and featured in ''Till Tomorrow'', a documentary film about McLean produced by Bob Elfstrom (Elfstrom held the role of Jesus Christ in Johnny and June Cash's ''Gospel Road)''. The film shows McLean in concert at Columbia University as he was interrupted by a bomb scare. He left the stage while the audience stood up and checked under their seats for anything that resembled a bomb. After the all-clear, McLean re-appeared and sang "On the Amazon" from exactly where he had left off. Don Heckman reported the bomb scare in his review for ''The New York Times'' entitled "Don McLean Survives Two Obstacles."<ref>New York Times, December 12, 1971</ref>

The fourth album, ''[[Playin' Favorites]]'' was a top-40 hit in the UK in 1973 and included the Irish folk classic, "Mountains of Mourne" and [[Buddy Holly]]'s "[[Everyday (Buddy Holly song)|Everyday]]", a live rendition of which returned McLean to the [[UK Singles Chart]]. McLean said, "The last album (''[[Don McLean (album)|Don McLean]]'') was a study in depression whereas the new one (''[[Playin' Favorites]]'') is almost the quintessence of optimism, with a feeling of 'Wow, I just woke up from a bad dream.'"

The 1974 album ''[[Homeless Brother]]'', produced by [[Joel Dorn]], was McLean's final studio collaboration with United Artists. The album featured fine New York session musicians, including Ralph McDonald on percussion, [[Hugh McCracken]] on guitar and a guest appearance by [[Yusef Lateef]] on flute. [[The Persuasions]] sang the background vocals on "Crying in the Chapel" and [[Cissy Houston]] provided a backing vocal on "La La Love You".

The album's title song was inspired by [[Jack Kerouac]]'s book, ''[[Lonesome Traveler]]'' in which Kerouac tells the story of America's "homeless brothers," or hobos. The song features background vocals by [[Pete Seeger]].

The song "The Legend of Andrew McCrew" was based on an article published in ''[[The New York Times]]''<ref name=bio/> concerning a black Dallas hobo named Anderson McCrew who was killed when he leapt from a moving train. No one claimed him, so a carnival took his body, mummified it, and toured all over the South with him, calling him the "The Famous Mummy Man." McLean's song inspired radio station WGN in Chicago to tell the story and give the song airplay in order to raise money for a headstone for Anderson McCrew's grave. Their campaign was successful and McCrew's body was exhumed and buried in the Lincoln Cemetery<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=51299610 |title=Anderson "Andrew" McCrew (1867 - 1913) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}</ref> in Dallas.<ref>''Ellensburg Daily Record'', May 24, 1974</ref> The tombstone had an inscription with words from the fourth verse of McLean's song:

<blockquote>What a way to live a life, and what a way to die<br />
Left to live a living death with no one left to cry<br />
A petrified amazement, a wonder beyond worth<br />
A man who found more life in death than life gave him at birth</blockquote>

[[Joel Dorn]] later collaborated on the Don McLean career retrospective ''[[Rearview Mirror: An American Musical Journey|Rearview Mirror]]'', released in 2005 on Dorn's own label, Hyena Records. In 2006, Dorn reflected on working with McLean:<ref name=bio/>

<blockquote>Of the more than 200 studio albums I've produced in the past forty plus years, there is a handful; maybe fifteen or so that I can actually listen to from top to bottom. ''[[Homeless Brother]]'' is one of them. It accomplished everything I set out to do. And it did so because it was a true collaboration. Don brought so much to the project that all I really had to do was capture what he did, and complement it properly when necessary.</blockquote>

Also from the ''[[Homeless Brother]]'' album, "[[Wonderful Baby]]" was a number 1 on the AOR chart in 1975<ref>{{cite book |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961-2001|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2002 |publisher=Record Research |page=166}}</ref> and was later recorded by [[Fred Astaire]]. The song had been inspired by Joel Dorn's son<ref name=bio/> and reflected McLean's interest in 1930s music.

1977 saw a brief liaison with [[Arista Records]] that yielded the ''[[Prime Time (Don McLean album)|Prime Time]]'' album and, in October 1978, the single "It Doesn't Matter Anymore". This was a track from the ''[[Chain Lightning (album)|Chain Lightning]]'' album that should have been the second of four with Arista.<ref name=bio/> McLean had started recording in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], with [[Elvis Presley]]'s backing singers, [[The Jordanaires]], and many of Elvis's musicians. However the Arista deal broke down following artistic disagreements between McLean and the Arista chief, [[Clive Davis]]. Consequently, McLean was left without a record contract in the USA, but through continuing deals the ''[[Chain Lightning (album)|Chain Lightning]]'' album was released by EMI in Europe and by Festival Records in Australia. In April 1980, the track "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]" from the album began picking up airplay on Dutch radio stations and McLean was called to Europe to appear on several important musical variety shows to plug the song and support its release as a single by EMI. The song achieved number 1 status in the Netherlands first, followed by the UK and then Australia.

McLean's number 1 successes in Europe and Australia led to a new deal in the USA with Millennium Records. They issued the ''[[Chain Lightning (album)|Chain Lightning]]'' album two and a half years after it had been recorded in Nashville, and two years after its release in Europe. It charted on February 14, 1981 and reached number 28 while "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]" climbed to number 5 on the pop singles chart. Roy Orbison himself thought that McLean’s version was the best cover he’d ever heard of one his songs. Orbison thought McLean did a better job than he did and even went so far as to say that the voice of Don McLean is one of the great instruments of 20th Century America.<ref name=skydoc>{{cite AV media | title =Don McLean: An American Troubadour | medium = Television production | publisher = Sky Arts 1 | location = UK | date = 2013}}</ref> According to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, “McLean’s voice could cut through steel - he is a very pure singer and he's up there with the best of them. He's a very talented singer and songwriter and he deserves his success.”<ref name=skydoc/>

The early 1980s saw further chart successes in the U.S. with "[[Since I Don't Have You]]", a new recording of "Castles in the Air" and "It's Just the Sun".

In 1987, the release of the country-based ''[[Love Tracks (Don McLean album)|Love Tracks]]'' album gave rise to the hit singles "Love in My Heart" (a top-10 in Australia), "[[You Can't Blame the Train]]" (U.S. country No. 49), and "Eventually". The latter two songs were written by [[Houston]] native [[Terri Sharp]].

In 1991, [[EMI]] reissued the "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]" single in the United Kingdom and McLean performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.

In 1992, previously unreleased songs became available on ''[[Favorites and Rarities]]'' while ''Don McLean Classics'' featured new studio recordings of "[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]" and "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]".

Don McLean has continued to record new material including ''River of Love'' in 1995 on [[Curb Records]] and, more recently, the albums ''You've Got to Share'', ''Don McLean Sings Marty Robbins'' and ''The Western Album'' on his own Don McLean Music label.

''Addicted to Black'' was released in May 2009.<ref>[http://www.don-mclean.com/?p=320]  {{wayback|url=http://www.don-mclean.com/?p=320 |date=20121123224947 }}</ref>

===Other songs===
McLean's other well-known songs include:
*"[[And I Love You So (song)|And I Love You So]]" was covered by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Howard Keel]], [[Claude François]], and a [[1973 in music|1973 hit]] for [[Perry Como]].
*"[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]", a tribute to the 19th-century Dutch painter, [[Vincent van Gogh]]. Although it only reached No. 12 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, it proved to be a huge hit worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} "You can’t change a note in that song" ([[Mike Mills]], REM).<ref name=skydoc/> It was a No. 1 hit single in the UK Singles Chart.<ref>[http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=5851]  {{wayback|url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=5851 |date=20140113223707 }}</ref> This song was covered by [[NOFX]] on their album titled ''45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records'', and also appears on the [[Fat Wreck Chords]] compilation ''Survival of the Fattest''. "Vincent" was also covered by [[Josh Groban]] on his [[Josh Groban (album)|2001 debut album]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.joshgroban.com/node/78 |title=Chicago - 2007-02-24 &#124; Josh Groban – Official Website For Musician, Actor, and host of Rising Star |publisher=Joshgroban.com |date=2007-02-24 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}</ref>
*"Castles in the Air", which McLean recorded twice. His 1981 re-recording was a top-40 hit, reaching #36 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in late 1981.<ref name="Whitburn">[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2004). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 8th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 416.</ref>
*"Wonderful Baby", a tribute to [[Fred Astaire]] that Astaire himself recorded. Primarily rejected by pop stations, it reached #1 on the ''Billboard'' Easy Listening survey.<ref>Hyatt, Wesley (1999). ''The Billboard Book of #1 Adult Contemporary Hits'' (Billboard Publications), page 166.</ref>
*"Superman's Ghost", a tribute to [[George Reeves]], who portrayed [[Superman]] on television in the 1950s.
*"The Grave", a song that McLean had written about the [[Vietnam War]], was covered by [[George Michael]] in 2003 in protest against the Iraq War.

The ''American Pie'' album features a version of [[Psalm 137]], entitled "Babylon". The song is based on a canon by [[Philip Hayes (composer)|Philip Hayes]]<ref>''The Muses Delight: Catches, Glees, Canzonets and Canons'' by Philip Hayes (London, 1786)</ref> and was arranged by McLean and [[Lee Hays]] (of The Weavers).<ref>American Pie album song credits</ref> 
"Babylon" was performed in the ''[[Mad Men]]'' [[Babylon (Mad Men episode)|episode of the same name]] despite the fact that the song would not be released until 10 years after the time in which the episode is set.

In 1980, McLean had an international number one hit with a cover of the [[Roy Orbison]] classic, "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]". It was only after the record became a success overseas that it was released in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The single hit No. 5 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 1981.<ref name="Whitburn"/> Orbison himself once described McLean as "the voice of the century",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalsearcher.com/artists.aspx?artist_id=Don_McLean |title=Don McLean Live Tour Festivals 2015 |publisher=Festivalsearcher.com |date=1945-10-02 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}</ref> and a subsequent re-recording of the song saw Orbison incorporate elements of McLean's version.

For the 1982 animated cult-movie ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]'', produced by [[Jules Bass]] and [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]], McLean sang the opening theme. However, no soundtrack has ever been released.

Another hit song associated with McLean (though never recorded by him) is "[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]", which was claimed by [[Lori Lieberman]] to have been written ''about'' McLean after she, also a singer/songwriter, saw him singing his composition "Empty Chairs" in concert.<ref>O'Haire, P. A Killer of a Song, ''Daily News'' April 5, 1973. p6</ref> According to her, afterwards, she wrote a poem about the experience and shared it with Norman Gimbel, who had long been searching for a way to use a phrase he had copied from a novel badly translated from Spanish to English, "killing me softly with his blues".<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Davis | first1 = Sheila | title = The Craft of Lyric Writing | publisher = Writers Digest Books | year = 1984 | page = 13 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=uVePZ1Qwtb0C&pg=PA13&dq=%22Killing+Me+Softly+with+His+Song%22+norman+gimbel#v=onepage&q=%22Killing%20Me%20Softly%20with%20His%20Song%22%20norman%20gimbel&f=false | accessdate = September 22, 2010 | isbn = 0-89879-149-9 }}</ref>  Allegedly, Gimbel and Charles Fox reworked the poem and the phrase into the song "Killing Me Softly with His Song",<ref name="Billboard Magazine 1974. Page 53">Billboard Magazine, June 22, 1974. Page 53.</ref> recorded by [[Roberta Flack]] (and later covered by [[The Fugees]]). This claim is disputed, notably by Fox. Subsequently, however, the matter reached an unequivocal conclusion when contemporaneous articles from the early 1970s were exhumed, all of them vindicating Lieberman. In an April 5, 1973 article in the Daily News, Norman Gimbel was quoted as follows: "She [Lori Lieberman] told us about this strong experience she had listening to McLean ("I felt all flushed with fever / Embarrassed by the crowd / I felt he had found my letters / And read each one out loud / I prayed that he would finish / But he just kept right on…"). I had a notion this might make a good song so the three of us discussed it. We talked it over several times, just as we did for the rest of the numbers we wrote for this album and we all felt it had possibilities."<ref>O'Haire, Patricia [http://www.don-mclean.com/i/kill.jpg “A Killer of a Song],” ''Daily News''</ref>

==Concerts==
[[File:Don McLean at the NYCB Theatre at Westbury 2013-07-13 3.jpg|thumb|Don McLean at the [[NYCB Theatre at Westbury]] in July 2013]]

McLean's albums did not match the commercial success of ''[[American Pie (album)|American Pie]]'' but he became a major concert attraction in the U.S. and overseas.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} His repertoire included old concert hall numbers and the catalogues of singers such as [[Buddy Holly]], and another McLean influence, [[Frank Sinatra]]. The years spent playing gigs in small clubs and coffee houses in the 1960s transformed into well-paced performances. McLean's first concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York and the [[Albert Hall]] in London in 1972 were critically acclaimed.

In recent years McLean has continued to tour North America, Europe (2011, 2012) and Australia (2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.don-mclean.com/ |title=Don McLean Online — The Official Website of Don McLean and American Pie |publisher=Don-mclean.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}</ref> In June 2011 McLean appeared at the [[Glastonbury Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/glastonbury/2011/artists/donmclean/ |title=BBC Glastonbury Festival - 2011 - Don McLean |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-06-26 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}</ref> in Pilton, UK and in 2014 at the [[Stagecoach Festival|Stagecoach Country Music Festival]] in California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/events/20140427/stagecoach-2014-don-mclean-performs-emotional-set-for-fans-celebs-ashton-kutcher-and-mila-kunis |title=Stagecoach 2014: Don McLean performs emotional set for fans, celebs Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis |publisher=Dailynews.com |date=2014-04-27 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}</ref> In May 2015, McLean undertook his 20th nationwide tour of the UK and Ireland.

==Later work and honors==
In 1991, Don McLean returned to the UK top 20 with a re-issue of "American Pie".

[[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] conferred an honorary doctorate on McLean in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iona College|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/iona-college-2737|publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> 
In February 2002, "American Pie" was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].

In 2004, McLean was inaugurated into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. Garth Brooks presented the award and said "Don McLean: his work, like the man himself, is very deep and very compassionate. His pop anthem 'American Pie' is a cultural phenomenon".{{Citation needed|date= January 2012}}

Two years later, Brooks repaid the favor by appearing as a special guest (with [[Nanci Griffith]]) on McLean's first American TV special, broadcast as the [[PBS]] special ''Starry Starry Night''.  A month later, McLean wound up the 20th century by performing "American Pie" at the Lincoln Memorial Gala in Washington D.C. Brooks again played "American Pie" during [[We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial]] on January 18, 2009.

In 2007, the biography ''The Don McLean Story: Killing Us Softly With His Songs'' was published.  Biographer Alan Howard conducted extensive interviews for this, the only book-length biography of the often reclusive McLean to date.

In February 2012 McLean won the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Life Time Achievement award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/events/folk-awards-2012/ |title=Radio 2 - Events - Radio 2 Folk Awards 2012 |publisher=BBC |date=February 8, 2012 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref>

In March 2012, the PBS network broadcast a feature-length documentary about the life and music of Don McLean called "Don McLean: American Troubadour" produced by 4-time Emmy Award winning filmmaker [[Jim Brown (director)|Jim Brown]].

McLean is one of UK singer-songwriter [[Jake Bugg]]'s primary influences. Bugg said McLean's song "[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]" was "the first song I liked" after hearing it on an episode of The Simpsons. He devoured McLean's back catalogue and then delved into the artists that inspired McLean - including Buddy Holly and The Weavers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jake Bugg: I have to Pinch Myself|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19923871|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}</ref> [[Tupac Shakur]] also cited McLean's "[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]" as a personal inspiration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tupac Shakur: Biography|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000637/bio|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}</ref>
