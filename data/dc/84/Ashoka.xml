Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia, the model of rulership embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated (in the<space/><link><target>Angkor</target></link><space/>kingdom, for instance). Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimise his rule not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist<space/><italics><link><target>sangha</target></link></italics>. Following Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom. Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign. This development ultimately led to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported<space/><link><target>Buddhism in Thailand</target><part>Buddhism of Thailand</part></link><space/>and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader.

The most startling feature is that Ashokas conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war, which is not even mentioned, nor is there a word about his belonging to the Maurya dynasty. Equally surprising is the record of his use of state power to spread Buddhism in an uncompromising fashion.

Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution. Some scholars have tended to question this assessment. The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time:<space/><link><target>Buddhism</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Vedic Brahmanism</target><part>Brahmanism</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Jainism</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Ajivika</target><trail>ism</trail></link>, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept.</paragraph><paragraph>However, there is strong evidence in the edicts alone that he was a Buddhist. In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance. Furthermore, there are many edicts expressed to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an &quot;<link><target>upasaka</target></link>&quot;, and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts. He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites, but did not do so for the sites of other religions. He also used the word<space/><link><target>Dharma (Buddhism)</target><part>&quot;dhamma&quot;</part></link><space/>to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word. Finally, the ideals he promotes correspond to the first three steps of the Buddha's graduated discourse.<extension extension_name='ref'>Richard Robinson, Willard Johnson, and Thanissaro Bhikkhu,<space/><italics>Buddhist Religions</italics>, fifth ed., Wadsworth 2005, page 59.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Interestingly, the Ashokavadana presents an alternate view of the familiar Ashoka; one in which his conversion does not have anything to do with the Kalinga war or about his descent from the Maurya dynasty. Instead, Ashoka's reason for adopting non-violence appears much more personal. The Ashokavadana shows that the main source of Ashoka's conversion and the acts of welfare that followed are rooted instead in intense personal anguish at its core, from a wellspring inside himself (not so much necessarily spurred by a specific event). It thereby illuminates Ashoka as more humanly ambitious and passionate, with both greatness and flaws.<space/><italics>This</italics><space/>Ashoka is very different from the &quot;shadowy do-gooder&quot; of later Pali chronicles.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Pradip2002"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="author">Pradip Bhattacharya<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Unknown Ashoka<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md</arg><arg name="accessdate">30 November 2012<space/></arg><arg name="year">2002<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Boloji.com</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Much of the knowledge about Ashoka comes from the<space/><link><target>Edicts of Ashoka</target><part>several inscriptions</part></link><space/>that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire. All his inscriptions present him as compassionate and loving. In the Kalinga rock edits, he addresses his people as his &quot;children&quot; and mentions that as a father he desires their good.<extension extension_name='ref' name="VenSDhammika_1993"></extension><space/>These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to<space/><link><target>dharma</target></link><space/>(duty or proper behaviour), and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might. One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga War and Ashoka's allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration. The Ashoka Pillar at<space/><link><target>Sarnath</target></link><space/>is the most notable of the relics left by Ashoka. Made of sandstone, this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath, in the 3rd century BCE. It has a four-lion capital (four lions standing back to back) which was adopted as the emblem of the modern Indian republic. The lion symbolises both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the<space/><link><target>Buddha</target></link>. In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire. It is difficult to determine whether or not some actual events ever happened, but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Focus of debate</heading><paragraph>Recently scholarly analysis determined that the three major foci of debate regarding Ashoka involve the nature of the Maurya empire; the extent and impact of Ashoka's pacifism, and what is referred to in the Inscriptions as<space/><italics>dhamma</italics><space/>or<space/><link><target>dharma</target></link>, which connotes goodness, virtue, and charity. Some historians<template><target>Who</target><arg name="date">February 2013</arg></template><space/>have argued that Ashoka's pacifism undermined the &quot;military backbone&quot; of the Maurya empire, while others have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been &quot;grossly exaggerated&quot;. The<space/><italics>dhamma</italics><space/>of the Edicts has been understood as concurrently a Buddhist lay ethic, a set of politico-moral ideas, a &quot;sort of universal religion&quot;, or as an Ashokan innovation. On the other hand, it has also been interpreted as an<space/><italics>essentially political</italics><space/>ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire. Scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the Edicts (particularly in regard to imperial vision), and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of a &quot;virtually subcontinental, and culturally and economically highly variegated, 3rd century BCE Indian empire. Nonetheless, it remains clear that Ashoka's Inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the Indian subcontinent, and therefore prove to be a very important innovation in royal practices.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="author">Upinder Singh<space/></arg><arg name="title">Governing the State and the Self: Political Philosophy and Practice in the Edicts of As´oka<space/></arg><arg name="journal">South Asian Studies<space/></arg><arg name="issue">28.2<space/></arg><arg name="year">2012<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Routledge<space/></arg><arg name="pages">131–132</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Contributions</heading><heading level='3'>Approach towards religions</heading><paragraph>According to Indian historian Romila Thapar, Ashoka emphasized respect for all religious teachers, harmonious relationship between parents and children, teachers and pupils, and employers and employees.<extension extension_name='ref'>Microsoft Encarta Article on Ashoka</extension><space/>Ashoka's religion contained gleanings from all religions.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">October 2014</arg></template><space/>He emphasized on the virtues of<space/><italics>Ahimsa</italics>, respect to all religious teachers, equal respect for and study of each other's scriptures, and on rational faith.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Global spread of Buddhism</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Sanchi2.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Stupa of<space/><link><target>Sanchi</target></link>.</part></link>As a<space/><link><target>Buddhist</target></link><space/>emperor, Ashoka believed that<space/><link><target>Buddhism</target></link><space/>is beneficial for all human beings as well as animals and plants, so he built a number of<space/><link><target>stupas</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Sangharama</target></link>,<space/><link><target>viharas</target></link>,<space/><link><target>chaitya</target></link>, and residences for Buddhist monks all over South Asia and Central Asia.

Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected. The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi.
