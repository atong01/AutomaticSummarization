Jefferson's two songs released on Okeh have considerably better sound quality than on his Paramount records at the time.

More recently, the book,<space/><italics>Tolbert's Texas,</italics><space/>claimed that he was killed while being robbed of a large royalty payment by a guide escorting him to Union Station to catch a train home to Texas.
