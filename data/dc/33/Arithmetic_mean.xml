In statistics, the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency. The arithmetic mean is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations. Symbolically, if we have a data set containing the values<space/><extension extension_name='math'>a_1,\ldots,a_n.</extension><space/>The arithmetic mean<space/><extension extension_name='math'>A</extension><space/>is defined by the formula</paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem><extension extension_name='math'>A=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i</extension>.</listitem></list><paragraph>(See<space/><link><target>summation</target></link><space/>for an explanation of the summation operator).</paragraph><paragraph>For example, let us consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm: 2500, 2700, 2400, 2300, 2550, 2650, 2750, 2450, 2600, 2400.

These include:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>If numbers<space/><extension extension_name='math'>x_1,\dotsc,x_n</extension><space/>have mean<space/><extension extension_name='math'>\bar{x}</extension>, then<space/><extension extension_name='math'>(x_1-\bar{x}) + \dotsb + (x_n-\bar{x}) = 0</extension>. Since<space/><extension extension_name='math'>x_i-\bar{x}</extension><space/>is the distance from a given number to the mean, one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean. The mean is the only single number for which the<space/><link><target>errors and residuals in statistics</target><part>residuals</part></link><space/>(deviations from the estimate) sum to zero.</listitem><listitem>If it is required to use a single number as a &quot;typical&quot; value for a set of known numbers<space/><extension extension_name='math'>x_1,\dotsc,x_n</extension>, then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best, in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value: the sum of<space/><extension extension_name='math'>(x_i-\bar{x})^2</extension>. (It follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest<space/><link><target>root mean squared error</target></link>.)<extension extension_name='ref' name="JM"></extension><space/>If the arithmetic mean of a population of numbers is desired, then the estimate of it that is<space/><link><target>unbiased estimate</target><part>unbiased</part></link><space/>is the arithmetic mean of a sample drawn from the population.</listitem></list><heading level='2'>Contrast with median</heading><paragraph>The arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median. The median is defined such that half the values are larger than, and half are smaller than, the median. If elements in the sample data<space/><link><target>arithmetic progression</target><part>increase arithmetically</part></link>, when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal. For example, consider the data sample<space/><extension extension_name='math'>{1,2,3,4}</extension>. The average is<space/><extension extension_name='math'>2.5</extension>, as is the median. However, when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically, such as<space/><extension extension_name='math'>{1,2,4,8,16}</extension>, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly. In this case, the arithmetic average is 6.2 and the median is 4. In general, the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample, and can be larger or smaller than most of them.</paragraph><paragraph>There are applications of this phenomenon in many fields. For example, since the 1980s, the median income in the United States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.<extension extension_name='ref'>Paul Krugman,<space/><link type='external' href='http://prospect.org/article/rich-right-and-facts-deconstructing-inequality-debate'>&quot;The Rich, the Right, and the Facts: Deconstructing the Income Distribution Debate&quot;</link>, 'The American Prospect'</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Generalizations</heading><heading level='3'>Weighted average</heading><paragraph>A<space/><link><target>weighted average</target></link>, or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points count more strongly than others, in that they are given more weight in the calculation. For example, the arithmetic mean of<space/><extension extension_name='math'>3</extension><space/>and<space/><extension extension_name='math'>5</extension><space/>is<space/><extension extension_name='math'>\frac{(3+5)}{2} = 4</extension>, or equivalently<space/><extension extension_name='math'>\left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3\right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 5\right) = 4</extension>. In contrast, a<space/><italics>weighted</italics><space/>mean in which the first number receives, for example, twice as much weight as the second (perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled) would be calculated as<space/><extension extension_name='math'>\left( \frac{2}{3} \cdot 3\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} \cdot 5\right) = \frac{11}{3}</extension>. Here the weights, which necessarily sum to the value one, are<space/><extension extension_name='math'>(2/3)</extension><space/>and<space/><extension extension_name='math'>(1/3)</extension>, the former being twice the latter. Note that the arithmetic mean (sometimes called the &quot;unweighted average&quot; or &quot;equally weighted average&quot;) can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other (equal to<space/><extension extension_name='math'>\frac{1}{2}</extension><space/>in the above example, and equal to<space/><extension extension_name='math'>\frac{1}{n}</extension><space/>in a situation with<space/><extension extension_name='math'>n</extension><space/>numbers being averaged).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Continuous probability distributions</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Comparison mean median mode.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>Comparison of mean,<space/><link><target>median</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>mode (statistics)</target><part>mode</part></link><space/>of two<space/><link><target>log-normal distribution</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>with different<space/><link><target>skewness</target></link>.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>When a population of numbers, and any sample of data from it, could take on any of a continuous range of numbers, instead of for example just integers, then the<space/><link><target>probability</target></link><space/>of a number falling into one range of possible values could differ from the probability of falling into a different range of possible values, even if the lengths of both ranges are the same. In such a case, the set of probabilities can be described using a<space/><link><target>continuous probability distribution</target></link>. The analog of a weighted average in this context, in which there are an infinitude of possibilities for the precise value of the variable, is called the<space/><italics>mean of the probability distribution</italics>. The most widely encountered probability distribution is called the<space/><link><target>normal distribution</target></link>; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency, including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the<space/><link><target>Mode (statistics)</target><part>mode</part></link>, are equal to each other.

A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation (<link><target>viz.</target></link>, define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1 and 359 is 2, not 358).</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Average</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Frchet mean</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Generalized mean</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Geometric mean</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Mode (statistics)</target><part>Mode</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Sample mean and covariance</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Summary statistics</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Further reading</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Huff</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Darrell</arg><arg name="title"><space/>How to Lie with Statistics</arg><arg name="year"><space/>1993</arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>W.
