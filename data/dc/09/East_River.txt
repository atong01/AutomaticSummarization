The '''East River''' is a salt water tidal [[strait]] in [[New York City]]. The waterway, which is actually not a [[river]] despite its name, connects [[Upper New York Bay]] on its south end to [[Long Island Sound]] on its north end. It separates [[Long Island]] &ndash; including the boroughs of [[Queens]] and [[Brooklyn]] &ndash;  from [[the Bronx]] on the [[North America]]n mainland, and the island of [[Manhattan]].  Because of its connection to [[Long Island Sound]], it was once also known as the ''Sound River''.<ref>[[John Montresor|Montrésor, John]] (1766). ''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/gmd:@field(NUMBER+@band(g3804n+ar110401)) A plan of the city of New-York & its environs]''. London.</ref> The tidal strait changes its flow direction frequently.

==Formation==
[[File:Manhattan1781.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A map from 1781]]

The strait was formed approximately 11,000 years ago at the end of the [[Last glacial period#Wisconsinan glaciation.2C in North America|Wisconsin glaciation]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The East River Flows From Prehistoric Times To Today |url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2005-07-20/features/049.html |newspaper=The Queens Gazette |date=July 20, 2005 |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> The distinct change in the shape of the strait between the lower and upper portions is evidence of this glacial activity.  The upper portion (from [[Long Island Sound]] to [[Hell Gate]]), running largely perpendicular to the glacial motion, is wide, meandering, and has deep narrow bays on both banks, scoured out by the glacier's movement.  The lower portion (from Hell Gate to [[New York Bay]]) runs north-south, parallel to the glacial motion.  It is much narrower, with straight banks.  The bays that exist (or existed before being filled in by human activity), are largely wide and shallow.

==The channel==
Historically, the lower portion of the strait (separating Manhattan from Brooklyn) was one of the busiest and most important channels in the world, particularly during the first three centuries of New York City's history. The [[Brooklyn Bridge]], opened in 1883, was the first bridge to span the strait, replacing frequent ferry service. Some passenger ferry service remains between Manhattan, and Queens and Brooklyn.

The [[Bronx River]] drains into the East River in the northern section of the strait.

North of [[Randalls and Wards Islands|Randalls Island]], it is joined by the [[Bronx Kill]]. Along the east of Wards Island, at approximately the strait's midpoint, it narrows into a channel called [[Hell Gate]], which is spanned by both the [[Robert F. Kennedy Bridge]] (formerly the Triborough), and the [[Hell Gate Bridge]]. On the south side of Wards Island, it is joined by the [[Harlem River]].

[[Newtown Creek]] on Long Island drains into the East River, forming part of the boundary between Queens and Brooklyn.
The East River contains a number of [[island]]s, including:
*Upper section
**[[Rikers Island]]
**[[North and South Brother Islands, East River|North and South Brother Islands]]
**[[Mill Rock]]
*Lower section
**[[Randalls and Wards Islands|Randalls Island and Wards Island]] (joined by [[land reclamation|landfill]])
**[[Roosevelt Island]]
**[[U Thant Island]] (Belmont Island)
