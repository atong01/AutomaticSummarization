'''Clive Barker''' (born 5 October 1952) is an [[English people|English]] writer, film director, and [[visual artist]] best known for his work in both [[fantasy]] and [[horror fiction]]. Barker came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of [[short stories]] known as the ''Books of Blood'' which established him as a leading young horror writer. He has since written many novels and other works, and his fiction has been adapted into films, notably the ''[[Hellraiser (film series)|Hellraiser]]'' and ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]'' series. He was the Executive Producer of the film ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'', which won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].

Barker's paintings and illustrations have been featured in galleries in the United States, as well as within his own books. He has also created original characters and series for comic books, and some of his more popular horror stories have been adapted to the medium.

His archives have been a source of material for biographies and non-fiction books containing his personal essays, discussions of his fringe theater work, interviews, and other content.

==Early life==

Clive Barker was born in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], the son of Joan Ruby (née Revill), a painter and school welfare officer, and Leonard Barker, a personnel director for an industrial relations firm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/98/Clive-Barker.html|title=Clive Barker Biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022056/bio]  {{wayback|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022056/bio |date=20141031021816 }}</ref> He was educated at [[Dovedale Primary School]], [[Calderstones School|Quarry Bank High School]] and the [[University of Liverpool]], where he studied English and Philosophy.

When he was four years old, Barker witnessed the French skydiver [[Léo Valentin]] plummet to his death during a performance at an air show in Liverpool. Barker would later allude to Valentin in many of his stories.<ref>{{cite book|title=Birdmen, Batmen, and Skyflyers: Wingsuits and the Pioneers Who Flew in Them, Fell in Them, and Perfected Them|first=Michael|last=Abrams|pages=131–132|publisher=[[Harmony Books]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4000-5491-6}}</ref>

==Writing career==
Barker is an author of contemporary [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy fiction|fantasy]]. He began writing in the horror genre early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in ''[[Books of Blood]]'' 1 – 6) and the [[Faustian]] novel ''[[The Damnation Game (novel)|The Damnation Game]]'' (1985). Later he moved towards modern-day [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] and [[urban fantasy]] with horror elements in ''[[Weaveworld]]'' (1987), ''[[The Great and Secret Show]]'' (1989), the world-spanning ''[[Imajica]]'' (1991), and ''[[Sacrament (novel)|Sacrament]]'' (1996), bringing in the deeper, richer concepts of reality, the nature of the mind and dreams, and the power of words and memories.

Barker's distinctive style is characterised by the notion of hidden fantastical worlds coexisting with our own, the role of sexuality in the [[supernatural]], and the construction of coherent, complex and detailed universes. Barker has referred to this style as "[[dark fantasy]]" or the "fantastique". His stories are notable for a deliberate blurring of the distinction between binary opposites such as Hell and Heaven, or pleasure and pain (the latter particularly so in ''The Hellbound Heart'').

When the ''Books of Blood'' were first published in the United States in paperback, [[Stephen King]] was quoted on the book covers: "I have seen the future of horror and his name is Clive Barker."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/newsstephenking.html|title=The Official Clive Barker Resource : Revelations - News Stephen King Award - Speech|publisher=Clivebarker.info|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>  As influences on his writing, Barker lists [[Herman Melville]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[William Blake]] and [[Jean Cocteau]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/influences.html| publisher= Clive Barker Revelations|title=Influences|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>

He is also the writer of the best-selling [[Abarat]] series, and plans on producing two more novels in the series.<ref>[http://www.clivebarker.info/yaabaratunpub.html What's Going To Happen In The Final Two Books Of Abarat?]</ref>

Barker's basic philosophy and approach are revealed in his foreword to H.R. Giger's illustrated work, ''[[Necronomicon (H. R. Giger)|Necronomicon]]'' (1993 edition).

==Film work==

Barker has a keen interest in film production, although his films have received mixed receptions. He wrote the screenplays for ''[[Underworld (1985 film)|Underworld]]'' (a.k.a. ''Transmutations'' – 1985) and ''[[Rawhead Rex (film)|Rawhead Rex]]'' (1986), both directed by [[George Pavlou]].<ref>{{IMDb title|90233|Underworld}}</ref> Displeased by how his material was handled, he moved to directing with ''[[Hellraiser]]'' (1987), based on his novella ''[[The Hellbound Heart]]''. His early films, the shorts ''The Forbidden'' and ''Salome'', are experimental art films with surrealist elements, which have been re-released together to moderate critical acclaim. After his film ''[[Nightbreed]]'' (1990), which was widely considered to be a flop, Barker returned to write and direct ''[[Lord of Illusions]]'' (1995). A short story titled "The Forbidden", from Barker's ''Books of Blood'', provided the basis for the 1992 film ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]'' and its two sequels (whereof he was also producer of the two first). Barker was an executive producer of the film ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'' (1998), which received major critical acclaim. He had been working on a series of film adaptations of his ''The Abarat Quintet'' books under Disney's management, but has admitted that because of creative differences, this project will not go ahead.
In 2005, Barker created the film production company '''Midnight Picture Show''' together with horror film producer Jorge Saralegui, with the intent of producing two horror films per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/entertainment-news/2005/05/26/clive-barker-form-midnight-picture-show-16153|title=Clive Barker to form Midnight Picture Show|work=Advocate.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> Since then, the company has produced four films: ''[[The Plague (2006 film)|The Plague]]'' (2006), ''[[The Midnight Meat Train]]'' (2008), ''[[Book of Blood]]'' (2009) and ''[[Dread (film)|Dread]]'' (2009).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/company/co0165062/|title=Midnight Picture Show [us]|work=IMDb|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>

In October 2006, Barker announced through his official website that he will be writing the script to a forthcoming remake of the original ''Hellraiser'' film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/intsrevel15.html|title=The Official Clive Barker Website - Revelations Interview 15|publisher=Clivebarker.info|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=2994]  {{wayback|url=http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=2994 |date=20120908192540 }}</ref> He is also developing a film based on his ''[[Tortured Souls]]'' line of toys from [[McFarlane Toys]].

==Visual art==
Barker is a prolific visual artist working in a variety of media, often illustrating his own books. His paintings have been seen first on the covers of his official fan club magazine, ''Dread'', published by [[Fantaco]] in the early '90s; on the covers of the collections of his plays, ''Incarnations'' (1995) and ''Forms of Heaven'' (1996); and on the second printing of the original [[UK|British]] publications of his ''Books of Blood'' series. Barker also provided the artwork for his young adult novel ''[[The Thief of Always]]'' and for the ''Abarat'' series. His artwork has been exhibited at Bert Green Fine Art in Los Angeles and Chicago, at the Bess Cutler Gallery in New York and La Luz De Jesus in Los Angeles. Many of his sketches and paintings can be found in the collection ''[[Clive Barker, Illustrator]]'', published in 1990 by Arcane/Eclipse Books, and in ''Visions of Heaven and Hell'', published in 2005 by Rizzoli Books. The most complete selection of Clive Barker's paintings and drawings are available to view in a gallery setting on the website.

He worked on the creative side of a horror video game, ''[[Clive Barker's Undying]]'', providing the voice for the character Ambrose. ''Undying'' was developed by [[DreamWorks Interactive]] and released in 2001. He also worked on ''[[Clive Barker's Jericho]]'' for [[Codemasters]], which was released in late 2007.

Barker created [[Halloween]] costume designs for Disguise Costumes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35356/dress-up-like-clive-barkers-nightmares|title=Dress Up Like Clive Barker's Nightmares|publisher=Dreadcentral.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18723|title=Clive Barkers Enters the 'Dark Bazaar' with JAKKS Pacific|publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>

==Comic books==
A long term comics fan, Barker achieved his dream of publishing his own superhero books when [[Marvel Comics]] launched the [[Razorline]] imprint in 1993. Based on detailed premises, titles and lead characters he created specifically for this, the four interrelated titles&nbsp;— set outside the Marvel universe&nbsp;— were ''[[Ectokid]]'' (written first by [[James Dale Robinson|James Robinson]], then by future ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'' co-creator [[Wachowski brothers|Lana Wachowski]], with art by [[Steve Skroce]]), ''[[Hokum & Hex]]'' (written by [[Frank Lovece]], art by [[Anthony Williams (comics)|Anthony Williams]]), ''[[Hyperkind]]'' (written by Fred Burke, art by [[Paris Cullins]] and Bob Petrecca) and ''[[Saint Sinner (comics)|Saint Sinner]]'' (written by [[Elaine Lee]], art by [[Max Douglas]]). A 2002 Barker telefilm titled ''Saint Sinner'' bore no relation to the comic.

Barker horror adaptations and spinoffs in comics include the Marvel/[[Epic Comics]] series ''[[Hellraiser (comics)|Hellraiser]]'', ''[[Nightbreed (comics)|Nightbreed]]'', ''[[Pinhead (comics)|Pinhead]]'', ''The Harrowers'', ''Book of the Damned'', and ''Jihad''; [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse Books]]' series and [[graphic novels]] ''[[Tapping the Vein (comics)|Tapping The Vein]]'', ''Dread'', ''Son of Celluloid'', ''Revelations'' ''The Life of Death'', ''Rawhead Rex'' and ''The Yattering and Jack'', and [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''Primal'', among others. Barker served as a consultant and wrote issues of the Hellraiser anthology comic book.

In 2005, IDW published a three-issue adaptation of Barker's children's fantasy novel ''[[The Thief of Always (comics)|The Thief of Always]]'', written and painted by Kris Oprisko and Gabriel Hernandez. IDW is publishing a 12 issue adaptation of Barker's novel ''[[The Great and Secret Show (comics)|The Great and Secret Show]]''.

In December 2007, Chris Ryall and Clive Barker announced an upcoming collaboration of an original comic book series, ''Torakator'', to be published by IDW.<ref>[http://www.clivebarker.info/newothersb.html]  {{wayback|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/newothersb.html |date=20120229182233 }}</ref>

In October 2009, IDW published ''Seduth'' (Written by Clive Barker and Chris Monfette; art by [[Gabriel Rodriguez (artist)|Gabriel Rodriguez]]; colours by Jay Fotos; letters by Neil Uyetake; edits by [[Chris Ryall]]; and 3-D conversion by [[Ray Zone]]), the first time Barker has created a world specifically for the comic book medium in two decades. The work was released with three variant covers; cover a featuring art by [[Gabriel Rodriguez (artist)|Gabriel Rodriguez]] and cover b with art by Clive Barker and the third is a "retailer incentive signed edition cover" with art by Clive Barker.<ref>[http://www.idwpublishing.com/catalog/series/833]  {{wayback|url=http://www.idwpublishing.com/catalog/series/833 |date=20140815231723 }}</ref>

In 2011, [[Boom studios|Boom! Studios]] began publishing an original Hellraiser comic book series. The comic book picks up 2 decades after the events of [[Hellbound: Hellraiser II]], and from there, builds its own mythology. The book has several credited writers: Chris Monfette, Anthony Diblasi, Mark Miller and most recently [[Witch Doctor (comics)|Witch Doctor]] creator Brandon Seifert. The series is ongoing and has just celebrated its second anniversary in print.

In 2013, [[Boom studios|Boom! Studios]] announced the first original story by Barker to be published in comic book format: ''Next Testament''. The story concerns a man named Julian Demond who unearths the God of the Old Testament and discovers that he has bitten off more than he can chew. The series is co-written by Seraphim Films Vice President Mark Miller.

==Personal life==
In 2003, Barker received the Davidson/Valentini Award at the [[15th GLAAD Media Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/publications/resource_doc_detail.php?id=3545|title=Publications|work=GLAAD|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> Barker has been critical of organised religion throughout his career, but he has stated that the [[Holy Bible|Bible]] influences his work and spirituality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/religion.html|title=The Official Clive Barker Website - Spirituality|publisher=Clivebarker.info|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> In 2003, Barker remarked "I am, [a Christian]" during an episode of ''[[Real Time With Bill Maher]]'' when [[Ann Coulter]] implied he was not a Christian.<ref name="HBOMaher2003">{{Cite episode

Barker said in a December 2008 online interview (published in March 2009) that he had polyps in his throat which were so severe that a doctor told him he was taking in ten percent of the air he was supposed to have been getting. He has had two surgeries to remove them and believes his resultant voice is an improvement over how it was prior to the surgeries. He said he did not have cancer and has given up [[cigar]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/2009/20090316/snyder-a.shtml |title=Art and the Artist: An Interview with Clive Barker|work= Strange Horizons |date=March 2009}}</ref>

===Relationships===
In a 20 August 1996 appearance on the radio call-in show ''[[Loveline]]'', Barker stated that during his teens he had several relationships with older women, and came to identify himself as homosexual by 18 or 19 years old.<ref>{{cite episode | episodelink = http://podcastone.com/Classic-Loveline?showAllEpisodes=true Clive Barker | series = Classic Loveline | station = KROQ-FM | city = Los Angeles, California USA | airdate = 20 August 1996 | number = 233 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>  Barker has been openly gay since the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Night|first=Bell|title=Clive Barker – Not Just an Author!|date=1 March 2013|url=https://bellnight.wordpress.com/2013/03/01/clive-barker-not-just-an-author/|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> His relationship with John Gregson lasted from 1975 until 1986. It was during this period, with the support that John provided, that Clive was able to write the ''Books of Blood'' series and ''The Damnation Game''.

He later spent thirteen years with photographer (Emilian) David Armstrong, described as his husband in the introduction to [[Coldheart Canyon]]; they separated in 2009.  Three years later, Armstrong sued Barker for giving him [[HIV]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Famous horror writer Clive Barker sued by an ex-boyfriend who says author gave him HIV|date=6 June 2012|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2155190/Famous-horror-writer-sued-ex-boyfriend-says-author-gave-HIV.html|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref>
