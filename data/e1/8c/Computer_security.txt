{{Computer security}}
'''Computer security''', also known as '''cybersecurity''' or '''IT security''', is the protection of [[information system]]s from theft or damage to the [[Computer hardware|hardware]], the [[software]], and to the [[information]] on them, as well as from [[Denial-of-service attack|disruption]] or [[Botnet|misdirection]] of the services they provide.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gasser|first1=Morrie|title=Building a Secure Computer System|date=1988|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|isbn=0-442-23022-2|page=3|url=https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~vganesh/TEACHING/S2014/ECE458/building-secure-systems.pdf|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref> It includes [[Physical security|controlling physical access]] to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via [[computer network|network access]], [[SQL injection|data]] and [[code injection]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of computer security|url=http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/40169/computer-security|website=Encyclopedia|publisher=Ziff Davis, PCMag|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref> and due to malpractice by operators, whether [[Insider threat|intentional]], [[Error-tolerant design|accidental]], or due to them [[Social engineering (security)|being tricked]] into deviating from secure procedures.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Margaret|title=Social engineering definition|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/social-engineering|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref>

The field is of growing importance due to the increasing reliance of computer systems in most societies.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/technology/opinion/reliance-spells-end-of-road-for-ict-amateurs/story-e6frgb0o-1226636267865?nk=34fe4ab684629535daaf6a8fe6e6ef3d "Reliance spells end of road for ICT amateurs"], May 07, 2013, The Australian</ref> Computer systems now include a very wide variety of [[smart devices|"smart" devices]], including [[smartphones]], [[television]]s and tiny devices as part of the [[Internet of Things]] - and networks include not only the [[Internet]] and private data networks, but also [[Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi]] and other [[wireless network]]s.

Computer security covers all the processes and mechanisms by which digital equipment, information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, change or destruction and the process of applying security measures to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data both in transit and at rest.<ref>http://www.evolllution.com/opinions/cybersecurity-understanding-online-threat/</ref>

==Vulnerabilities and attacks==
{{Main|Vulnerability (computing)}}

A vulnerability is a system susceptibility or flaw, and many vulnerabilities are documented in the [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]] (CVE) database and vulnerability management is the cyclical practice of identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating vulnerabilities as they are discovered. An ''exploitable'' vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or "[[Exploit (computer security)|exploit"]] exists.
 
To secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these [[threat (computer)|threats]] can typically be classified into one of the categories below:

===Backdoors===
A [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] in a computer system, a [[cryptosystem]] or an algorithm, is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls. They may exist for a number of reasons, including by original design or from poor configuration. They may also have been added later by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability.

===Denial-of-service attack===
{{main|Denial-of-service attack}}

Denial of service attacks are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of [[Distributed denial of service#Distributed attack|Distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points - and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the [[zombie computer]]s of a [[botnet]], but a range of other techniques are possible including [[Denial-of-service attack#Reflected / spoofed attack|reflection and amplification attacks]], where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.

===Direct-access attacks===
[[Image:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg|thumb|Common consumer devices that can be used to transfer data surreptitiously.]]

An unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is often able to directly download data from it. They may also compromise security by making [[operating system]] modifications, installing software [[computer worm|worms]], [[keystroke logging|keyloggers]], or [[covert listening device]]s. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be able to be by passed by booting another operating system or tool from a [[CD-ROM]] or other bootable media. [[Disk encryption]] and [[Trusted Platform Module]] are designed to prevent these attacks.

===Eavesdropping===
Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation, typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]] and [[Narus (company)|NarusInsight]] have been used by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to eavesdrop on the systems of [[internet service provider]]s. Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint [[electromagnetism|electro-magnetic]] transmissions generated by the hardware; [[TEMPEST]] is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks.

===Spoofing===

[[Spoofing attack|Spoofing]] of user identity describes a situation in which one person or program successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data.

===Tampering===

[[Tampering (crime)|Tampering]] describes a malicious modification of products. So-called [[Rootkit#bootkit|"Evil Maid" attacks]] and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers<ref>{{cite web|last=Gallagher |first=Sean |url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/ |title=Photos of an NSA "upgrade" factory show Cisco router getting implant |publisher=Ars Technica |date=May 14, 2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> are examples.

=== Privilege escalation ===
[[Privilege escalation]] describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level. So for example a standard computer user may be able to fool the system into giving them access to restricted data; or even to "[[superuser|become root]]" and have full unrestricted access to a system.

===Phishing===
[[Phishing]] is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one.

===Clickjacking===
[[Clickjacking]], also known as "UI redress attack or User Interface redress attack", is a malicious technique in which an attacker tricks a user into clicking on a button or link on another webpage while the user intended to click on the top level page. This is done using multiple transparent or opaque layers. The attacker is basically "hijacking" the clicks meant for the top level page and routing them to some other irrelevant page, most likely owned by someone else. A similar technique can be used to hijack keystrokes. Carefully drafting a combination of stylesheets, iframes, buttons and text boxes, a user can be led into believing that they are typing the password or other information on some authentic webpage while it is being channeled into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker.

===Social engineering and trojans===
{{Main|Social engineering (security)}}
{{See also|Category:Cryptographic attacks}}

[[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. by, for example, impersonating a bank, a contractor, or a customer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Arcos Sergio|title=Social Engineering|url=http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/bitstream/2099.1/12289/1/73827.pdf}}</ref>

== Systems at risk ==
Computer security is critical in almost any industry which uses computers.<ref name="FAA Computer Security">J. C. Willemssen, "FAA Computer Security". GAO/T-AIMD-00-330. Presented at Committee on Science, House of Representatives, 2000.</ref>

===Financial systems===

Web sites that accept or store [[credit card number]]s and [[bank account]] information are prominent hacking targets, because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money, making purchases, or selling the information on the [[black market]].  In-store payment systems and [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and [[Personal identification number|PIN]]s.

===Utilities and industrial equipment===

Computers control functions at many utilities, including coordination of [[telecommunications]], the [[power grid]], [[nuclear power plant]]s, and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks.  The Internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected, but the [[Stuxnet]] worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the Internet can be vulnerable to physical damage caused by malicious commands sent to industrial equipment (in that case [[uranium enrichment]] centrifuges) which are infected via [[removable media]]. In 2014, the [[Computer Emergency Readiness Team]], a division of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pagliery|first1=Jose|title=Hackers attacked the U.S. energy grid 79 times this year|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/18/technology/security/energy-grid-hack/|website=CNN Money|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref>

=== Aviation ===
The aviation industry is very reliant on a series of complex system which could be attacked.<ref name="Computer Security in Aviation">P. G. Neumann, "Computer Security in Aviation," presented at International Conference on Aviation Safety and Security in the 21st Century, White House Commission on Safety and Security, 1997.</ref> A simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussions worldwide,<ref>J. Zellan, Aviation Security. Hauppauge, NY: Nova Science, 2003, pp. 65–70.</ref> much of the system relies on radio transmissions which could be disrupted,<ref>http://www.securityweek.com/air-traffic-control-systems-vulnerabilities-could-make-unfriendly-skies-black-hat</ref> and controlling aircraft over oceans is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends 175 to 225 miles offshore.<ref>http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/08/04/337794061/hacker-says-he-can-break-into-airplane-systems-using-in-flight-wi-fi</ref> There is also potential for attack from within an aircraft.<ref>http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/04/us-cybersecurity-hackers-airplanes-idUSKBN0G40WQ20140804</ref>

The consequences of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity, which may lead to more serious concerns such as exfiltration of data, network and [[air traffic control]] outages, which in turn can lead to airport closures, loss of aircraft, loss of passenger life, [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|damages on the ground]] and to transportation infrastructure. A successful attack on a [[military aviation]] system that controls [[munitions]] could have even more serious consequences.

===Consumer devices===
Desktop computers and laptops are commonly infected with malware either to gather passwords or financial account information, or to construct a [[botnet]] to attack another target. [[Smart phone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, [[smart watch]]es, and other mobile devices such as [[Quantified Self]] devices like [[activity tracker]]s have also become targets and many of these have sensors such as cameras, microphones, GPS receivers, compasses, and accelerometers which could be exploited, and may collect personal information, including sensitive health information.  Wifi, Bluetooth, and cell phone network on any of these devices could be used as attack vectors, and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful breach.<ref name="nestwatch">http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/08/06/338334508/is-your-watch-or-thermostat-a-spy-cyber-security-firms-are-on-it</ref>

[[Home automation]] devices such as the [[Nest thermostat]] are also potential targets.<ref name="nestwatch" />

===Large corporations===
Large corporations are common targets. In many cases this is aimed at financial gain through identity theft and involves [[data breach]]es such as the loss of millions of clients' credit card details by [[Home Depot]],<ref>{{cite news |author=Melvin Backman |date={{date|2014-09-18}} |title=Home Depot: 56 million cards exposed in breach |publisher=[[CNNMoney]] |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/18/technology/security/home-depot-hack/ }}</ref> [[Staples Inc.|Staples]],<ref>{{cite news | url = http://fortune.com/2014/12/19/staples-cards-affected-breach/ |title = Staples: Breach may have affected 1.16 million customers' cards |publisher = Fortune.com |date = December 19, 2014 | accessdate= 2014-12-21}}</ref> and [[Target Corporation]].<ref name=milwaukee>{{cite news|title=Target security breach affects up to 40M cards|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/national/target-40m-accounts-may-be-involved-in-breach648fde78ab7a4e838a2eced0da89b9a5-236530941.html|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=Associated Press via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=19 December 2013}}</ref>

Not all attacks are financially motivated however; for example security firm [[HBGary Federal]] suffered a serious series of attacks in 2011 from hacktivist goup [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] in retaliation for the firm's CEO claiming to have infiltrated their group,

===Automobiles===
If access is gained to a car's internal [[controller area network]], it is possible to disable the brakes and turn the steering wheel.<ref name="vox">http://www.vox.com/2015/1/18/7629603/car-hacking-dangers</ref>  Computerized engine timing, [[cruise control]], [[anti-lock brakes]], seat belt tensioners, door locks, [[airbag]]s and [[advanced driver assistance systems]] make these disruptions possible, and [[self-driving car]]s go even further. [[Connected car]]s may use wifi and bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer devices, and the cell phone network to contact concierge and emergency assistance services or get navigational or entertainment information; each of these networks is a potential entry point for malware or an attacker.<ref name="vox"/>  Researchers in 2011 were even able to use a malicious [[compact disc]] in a car's stereo system as a successful attack vector,<ref>http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-usenixsec2011.pdf</ref> and cars with built-in voice recognition or remote assistance features have onboard microphones which could be used for eavesdropping.

A 2015 report by U.S. Senator Edward Markey criticized manufacturers' security measures as inadequate, and also highlighted privacy concerns about driving, location, and diagnostic data being collected, which is vulnerable to abuse by both manufacturers and hackers.<ref>http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2015-02-06_MarkeyReport-Tracking_Hacking_CarSecurity%202.pdf</ref>

===Government===
Government and [[military]] computer systems are commonly attacked by activists<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/usa/anonymous-barrettbrown-sopa-megaupload-241/ |title=Internet strikes back: Anonymous' Operation Megaupload explained |date=January 20, 2012 |work=RT |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GNY6Rgfk |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Tel profile">{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/4320901/Gary-McKinnon-profile-Autistic-hacker-who-started-writing-computer-programs-at-14.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Gary McKinnon profile: Autistic 'hacker' who started writing computer programs at 14 | date=23 January 2009}}</ref><ref name="bbcprofile">{{cite news

==Impact of security breaches==
Serious financial damage has been caused by [[security breaches]], but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident, the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved. "Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to [[computer virus|virus]] and [[computer worm|worm]] attacks and to hostile digital acts in general. The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $13 billion (worms and viruses only) to $226 billion (for all forms of covert attacks). The reliability of these estimates is often challenged; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal."<ref>Cashell, B., Jackson, W. D., Jickling, M., & Webel, B. (2004). The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attacks. Congressional Research Service, Government and Finance Division. Washington DC: The Library of Congress.</ref>

However, reasonable estimates of the financial cost of security breaches can actually help organizations make rational investment decisions. According to the classic [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] analyzing the optimal investment level in information security, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss (i.e., the [[expected value]] of the loss resulting from a cyber/information [[security breach]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Lawrence|last2=Loeb|first2=Martin|title=The Economics of Information Security Investment|journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security|date=November 2002|volume=5|issue=4|pages=438–457|doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}</ref>

==Attacker motivation==
As with [[physical security]], the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers. Some are thrill-seekers or [[Vandalism|vandal]]s, others are activists; or criminals looking for financial gain. State-sponsored attackers are now common and well resourced, but started with amateurs such as [[Markus Hess]] who hacked for the [[KGB]], as recounted by [[Clifford Stoll]],  in ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]''.

A standard part of [[threat modelling]] for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system, and who might be motivated to breach it. The level and detail of precautions will vary depending on the system to be secured. A home [[personal computer]], [[bank]] and [[Classified information|classified]] military [[computer network|network]] all face very different threats, even when the underlying technologies in use are similar.

== Computer protection (countermeasures) ==
In computer security a countermeasure is an action, device, procedure, or technique that reduces a [[Threat (computer)|threat]], a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]], or an [[attack (computing)|attack]] by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken.<ref name=rfc2828>RFC 2828 Internet Security Glossary</ref><ref name=CNSSI4009>[http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf CNSS Instruction No. 4009] dated 26 April 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Glossary.pdf InfosecToday Glossary]</ref>

Some common countermeasures are listed in the following sections:

===Security measures===
A state of computer "security" is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of the three processes: threat prevention, detection, and response.  These processes are based on various policies and system components, which include the following:

* [[User account]] [[access control]]s and [[cryptography]] can protect systems files and data, respectively.
* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can (if properly configured) shield access to internal network services, and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering.  Firewalls can be both hardware- or software-based.
* [[Intrusion Detection System]] (IDS) products are designed to detect network attacks in-progress and assist in post-attack [[forensics]], while [[audit trail]]s and [[data logging|log]]s serve a similar function for individual systems.
* "Response" is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of [[legal]] authorities, counter-attacks, and the like. In some special cases, a complete destruction of the compromised system is favored, as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected.

Today, computer security comprises mainly "preventive" measures, like firewalls or an [[exit procedure]]. A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the [[Internet]], and can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the [[network stack]] (or, in the case of most [[UNIX]]-based operating systems such as [[Linux]], built into the operating system [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]]) to provide real time filtering and blocking. Another implementation is a so-called [[physical firewall]] which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic. Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the [[Internet]].

However, relatively few organisations maintain computer systems with effective detection systems, and fewer still have organised response mechanisms in place. As result, as Reuters points out: "Companies for the first time report they are losing more through electronic theft of data than physical stealing of assets".<ref>{{cite web
  |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/18/us-crime-fraud-idUSTRE69H25820101018
  |title=Firms lose more to electronic than physical theft
  |publisher=Reuters
}}</ref> The primary obstacle to effective eradication of cyber crime could be traced to excessive reliance on firewalls and other automated "detection" systems. Yet it is basic evidence gathering by using [[packet capture appliance]]s that puts criminals behind bars.

===Reducing vulnerabilities===
While [[formal verification]] of the correctness of computer systems is possible,<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/LICS.2003.1210044|title=Formal verification at Intel|year=2003|last1=Harrison|first1=J.|pages=45–54}}</ref><ref>[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=800667 Formal verification of a real-time hardware design]. Portal.acm.org (1983-06-27). Retrieved on April 30, 2011.</ref> it is not yet common. Operating systems formally verified include [[seL4]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sel4.systems/Docs/seL4-spec.pdf |title=Abstract Formal Specification of the seL4/ARMv6 API |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2015}}</ref> and [[SYSGO]]'s [[PikeOS]]<ref>Christoph Baumann, Bernhard Beckert, Holger Blasum, and Thorsten Bormer [http://www-wjp.cs.uni-saarland.de/publikationen/Ba10EW.pdf Ingredients of Operating System Correctness? Lessons Learned in the Formal Verification of PikeOS]</ref><ref>
[http://www.ganssle.com/rants/gettingitright.htm "Getting it Right"] by Jack Ganssle</ref> - but these make up a very small percentage of the market.

[[Cryptography]] properly implemented is now virtually impossible to directly break. Breaking them requires some non-cryptographic input, such as a stolen key, stolen plaintext (at either end of the transmission), or some other extra cryptanalytic information.

[[Two factor authentication]] is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information. It requires "something you know"; a password or PIN, and "something you have"; a card, dongle, cellphone, or other piece of hardware. This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access.

Social engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only be prevented by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information.  Even in a highly disciplined environment, such as in military organizations, social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.

It is possible to reduce an attacker's chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates, using a security scanner or/and hiring competent people responsible for security. The effects of data loss/damage can be reduced by careful [[backup|backing up]] and [[insurance]].

=== Security by design ===
{{Main|Secure by design}}

[[Secure by design|Security by design]], or alternately secure by design, means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure.  In this case, security is considered as a main feature.

Some of the techniques in this approach include:
* The [[principle of least privilege]], where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function. That way even if an [[Hacker (computer security)|attacker]] gains access to that part, they have only limited access to the whole system.
* [[Automated theorem proving]] to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems.
* [[Code review]]s and [[unit testing]], approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible.
* [[Defense in depth (computing)|Defense in depth]], where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds.
* Default secure settings, and design to "fail secure" rather than "fail insecure" (see [[fail-safe]] for the equivalent in [[safety engineering]]). Ideally, a secure system should require a deliberate, conscious, knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure.
* [[Audit trail]]s tracking system activity, so that when a security breach occurs, the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined. Storing audit trails remotely, where they can only be appended to, can keep intruders from covering their tracks.
* [[Full disclosure (computer security)|Full disclosure]] of all vulnerabilities, to ensure that the "[[vulnerability (computing)|window of vulnerability]]" is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered.

=== Security architecture ===
The Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture as "the design [[Artifact (software development)|artifacts]] that describe how the security controls (security countermeasures) are positioned, and how they relate to the overall information technology architecture. These controls serve the purpose to maintain the system's quality attributes: confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability and [[assurance services]]".<ref>[http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture Definitions: IT Security Architecture]. SecurityArchitecture.org, Jan, 2006</ref>

Techopedia defines security architecture as "a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. The design process is generally reproducible." The key attributes of security architecture are:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jannsen|first1=Cory|title=Security Architecture|url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture|website=Techopedia|publisher=Janalta Interactive Inc|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref>
* the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other. 
* the determination of controls based on risk assessment, good practice, finances, and legal matters. 
* the standardization of controls.

While hardware may be a source of insecurity, such as with microchip vulnerabilities maliciously introduced during the manufacturing process,<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hacker-in-your-hardware/ ''The Hacker in Your Hardware: The Next Security Threat''] August 4, 2010 [[Scientific American]]</ref><ref>{{Citation| last1 = Waksman  | first1 = Adam | last2 = Sethumadhavan | first2 = Simha | title = Tamper Evident Microprocessors  | volume = | pages =  | periodical = Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy | location = Oakland, California  | url = http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~waksman/PDFs/Oakland_2010.pdf | year = 2010  | issn =  | doi =  | isbn = }}</ref> hardware-based or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to software-only computer security. Using devices and methods such as [[dongle]]s, [[trusted platform module]]s, intrusion-aware cases, drive locks, disabling USB ports, and mobile-enabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access (or sophisticated [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor access]]) required in order to be compromised.  Each of these is covered in more detail below.

* USB [[dongle]]s are typically used in software licensing schemes to unlock software capabilities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-spincorp.com/espinv3/index.php/solutions/3-solutions/174-sentinel-hasp-hl |title=Sentinel HASP HL |publisher=E-Spin|accessdate=2014-03-20}}</ref> but they can also be seen as a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other device's software.  The dongle, or key, essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key.  The principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle, such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) provides a stronger measure of security, since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it.  Another security application for dongles is to use them for accessing web-based content such as cloud software or [[Virtual Private Networks]] (VPNs).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.safenet-inc.com/multi-factor-authentication/authenticators/pki-usb-authentication/etoken-5200-token-based-authentication/ |title=Token-based authentication |publisher=SafeNet.com|accessdate=2014-03-20}}</ref> In addition, a USB dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewindowsclub.com/lock-protect-your-windows-pc-using-a-usb-drive-with-predator|title=Lock and protect your Windows PC |publisher=TheWindowsClub.com|accessdate=2014-03-20}}</ref>
* [[Trusted platform module]]s (TPMs) secure devices by integrating cryptographic capabilities onto access devices, through the use of microprocessors, or so-called computers-on-a-chip.  TPMs used in conjunction with server-side software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware devices, preventing unauthorized network and data access.<ref>{{cite web

* [[Computer case#Intrusion detection|Computer case intrusion detection]] refers to a push-button switch which is triggered when a computer case is opened.  The firmware or BIOS is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time.
* Drive locks are essentially software tools to encrypt hard drives, making them inaccessible to thieves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmagazine.com/safenet-protectdrive-84/review/2596/|title=SafeNet ProtectDrive 8.4|publisher=SCMagazine.com|date=2008-10-04|accessdate=2014-03-20}}</ref>  Tools exist specifically for encrypting external drives as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2342798,00.asp|title=Secure Hard Drives: Lock Down Your Data|publisher=PCMag.com|date=2009-05-11}}</ref>
*Disabling USB ports is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer.  Infected USB dongles connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by Network World as the most common hardware threat facing computer networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2010/110810-network-vulnerabilities.html |title=Top 10 vulnerabilities inside the network|publisher=[[Network World]]|date=2010-11-08|accessdate=2014-03-20}}</ref>
*Mobile-enabled access devices are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phones.  Built-in capabilities such as [[Bluetooth]], the newer [[Bluetooth low energy]] (LE), [[Near field communication]] (NFC) on non-iOS devices and [[biometrics|biometric]] validation such as thumb print readers, as well as [[QR code]] reader software designed for mobile devices, offer new, secure ways for mobile phones to connect to access control systems.  These control systems provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/2804966490001/forget-ids-use-your-phone-as-credentials/?playlist_id=937116503001#sp=show-clips |title=Forget IDs, use your phone as credentials|publisher=[[Fox Business Network]]|date=2013-11-04|accessdate=2014-03-20}}</ref>

=== Secure operating systems ===
{{Main|Security-focused operating system}}
One use of the term "computer security" refers to technology that is used to implement secure [[operating system]]s. Much of this technology is based on science developed in the 1980s and used to produce what may be some of the most impenetrable operating systems ever. Though still valid, the technology is in limited use today, primarily because it imposes some changes to system management and also because it is not widely understood. Such ultra-strong secure operating systems are based on [[operating system kernel]] technology that can guarantee that certain security policies are absolutely enforced in an operating environment. An example of such a [[Computer security policy]] is the [[Bell-LaPadula model]]. The strategy is based on a coupling of special [[microprocessor]] hardware features, often involving the [[memory management unit]], to a special correctly implemented operating system kernel. This forms the foundation for a secure operating system which, if certain critical parts are designed and implemented correctly, can ensure the absolute impossibility of penetration by hostile elements. This capability is enabled because the configuration not only imposes a security policy, but in theory completely protects itself from corruption. Ordinary operating systems, on the other hand, lack the features that assure this maximal level of security. The design methodology to produce such secure systems is precise, deterministic and logical.

Systems designed with such methodology represent the state of the art{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}<!--WHAT ART?--> of computer security although products using such security are not widely known. In sharp contrast to most kinds of software, they meet specifications with verifiable certainty comparable to specifications for size, weight and power. Secure operating systems designed this way are used primarily to protect national security information, military secrets, and the data of international financial institutions. These are very powerful security tools and very few secure operating systems have been certified at the highest level ([[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria|Orange Book]] A-1) to operate over the range of "Top Secret" to "unclassified" (including Honeywell SCOMP, USAF SACDIN, NSA Blacker and Boeing MLS LAN). The assurance of security depends not only on the soundness of the design strategy, but also on the assurance of correctness of the implementation, and therefore there are degrees of security strength defined for COMPUSEC. The [[Common Criteria]] quantifies security strength of products in terms of two components, security functionality and assurance level (such as EAL levels), and these are specified in a [[Protection Profile]] for requirements and a [[Security Target]] for product descriptions. None of these ultra-high assurance secure general purpose operating systems have been produced for decades or certified under Common Criteria.

In USA parlance, the term High Assurance usually suggests the system has the right security functions that are implemented robustly enough to protect DoD and DoE classified information. Medium assurance suggests it can protect less valuable information, such as income tax information. Secure operating systems designed to meet medium robustness levels of security functionality and assurance have seen wider use within both government and commercial markets. Medium robust systems may provide the same security functions as high assurance secure operating systems but do so at a lower assurance level (such as Common Criteria levels EAL4 or EAL5). Lower levels mean we can be less certain that the security functions are implemented flawlessly, and therefore less dependable. These systems are found in use on web servers, guards, database servers, and management hosts and are used not only to protect the data stored on these systems but also to provide a high level of protection for network connections and routing services.

=== Secure coding ===
{{Main|Secure coding}}
If the operating environment is not based on a secure operating system capable of maintaining a domain for its own execution, and capable of protecting application code from malicious subversion, and capable of protecting the system from subverted code, then high degrees of security are understandably not possible. While such secure operating systems are possible and have been implemented, most commercial systems fall in a 'low security' category because they rely on features not supported by secure operating systems (like portability, and others). In low security operating environments, applications must be relied on to participate in their own protection. There are 'best effort' secure coding practices that can be followed to make an application more resistant to malicious subversion.

In commercial environments, the majority of software subversion [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] result from a few known kinds of coding defects. Common software defects include [[buffer overflows]], [[format string vulnerabilities]], [[integer overflow]], and [[Code injection|code/command injection]]. These defects can be used to cause the target system to execute putative data. However, the "data" contain executable instructions, allowing the attacker to gain control of the processor.

Some common languages such as C and C++ are vulnerable to all of these defects (see Seacord, ''"Secure Coding in C and C++"'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/books/secure-coding |title=Secure Coding in C and C++, Second Edition |publisher=Cert.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref>  Other languages, such as Java, are more resistant to some of these defects, but are still prone to code/command injection and other software defects which facilitate subversion.

Another bad coding practice occurs when an object is deleted during normal operation yet the program neglects to update any of the associated memory pointers, potentially causing system instability when that location is referenced again. This is called [[dangling pointer]], and the first known exploit for this particular problem was presented in July 2007. Before this publication the problem was known but considered to be academic and not practically exploitable.<ref>[http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid14_gci1265116,00.html New hacking technique exploits common programming error]. SearchSecurity.com, July 2007</ref>

Unfortunately, there is no theoretical model of "secure coding" practices, nor is one practically achievable, insofar as the code (ideally, read-only) and data (generally read/write) generally tends to have some form of defect.

=== Capabilities and access control lists ===
{{Main|Access control list|Capability (computers)}}

Within computer systems, two of many [[Computer security model|security models]] capable of enforcing privilege separation are [[access control list]]s (ACLs) and [[capability-based security]]. Using ACLs to confine programs has been proven to be insecure in many situations, such as if the host computer can be tricked into indirectly allowing restricted file access, an issue known as the [[confused deputy problem]]. It has also been shown that the promise of ACLs of giving access to an object to only one person can never be guaranteed in practice. Both of these problems are resolved by capabilities. This does not mean practical flaws exist in all ACL-based systems, but only that the designers of certain utilities must take responsibility to ensure that they do not introduce flaws.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Capabilities have been mostly restricted to research [[operating system]]s, while commercial OSs still use ACLs. Capabilities can, however, also be implemented at the language level, leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard object-oriented design. An open source project in the area is the [[E programming language|E language]].

The most secure computers are those not connected to the Internet and shielded from any interference. In the real world, the most secure systems are [[operating system]]s where [[security]] is not an add-on.

===Response to breaches===
Responding forcefully to attempted [[security breaches]] (in the manner that one would for attempted physical security breaches) is often very difficult for a variety of reasons:
* Identifying attackers is difficult, as they are often in a different [[jurisdiction]] to the systems they attempt to breach, and operate through proxies, temporary anonymous dial-up accounts, wireless connections, and other anonymising procedures which make backtracing difficult and are often located in yet another jurisdiction.  If they successfully breach security, they are often able to delete [[Data logging|log]]s to cover their tracks.
* The sheer number of attempted attacks is so large that organisations cannot spend time pursuing each attacker (a typical home user with a permanent (e.g., [[cable modem]]) connection will be attacked at least several times per day<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberlawsindia.net/computer-insecurity.html |title=Computer Security |publisher=cyberlawsindia.net |accessdate=2015-10-23}}</ref>, so more attractive targets could be presumed to see many more). Note however, that most of the sheer bulk of these attacks are made by automated [[vulnerability scanner]]s and [[computer worm]]s.
* [[Law enforcement officer]]s are often unfamiliar with [[information technology]], and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers.  There are also budgetary constraints.  It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as [[DNA]] testing, and improved [[forensics]] mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a [[network administrator]] or a [[system administrator]]) requires a [[search warrant]] and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.

==Notable computer security attacks and breaches==
Some illustrative examples of different types of computer security breaches are given below.
<!-- We don't want to list every breach ever - and please keep the descriptions short -->

===Robert Morris and the first computer worm===
{{main|Morris worm}}
In 1988, only 60,000 computers were connected to the Internet, and most were mainframes, minicomputers and professional workstations. On November 2, 1988, many started to slow down, because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computers - the first internet "[[computer worm]]".<ref name="multiple">Jonathan Zittrain, 'The Future of The Internet', Penguin Books, 2008</ref> The software was traced back to 23-year-old [[Cornell University]] graduate student [[Robert Tappan Morris, Jr.]] who said 'he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the Internet'.<ref name="multiple" />

===Rome Laboratory===
In 1994, over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the [[Rome Laboratory]], the US Air Force's main command and research facility. Using [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]], hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to Rome's networking systems and remove traces of their activities. The intruders were able to obtain classified files, such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s Goddard Space Flight Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, some Defense contractors, and other private sector organizations, by posing as
a trusted Rome center user.<ref>[http://www.fas.org/irp/gao/aim96084.htm Information Security]. United States Department of Defense, 1986</ref>

===Global surveillance disclosures===
{{main|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)}}
In early 2013, massive breaches of computer security by the [[NSA]] were revealed, including deliberately inserting a backdoor in a [[NIST]] standard for encryption<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/can-you-trust-nist|title=Can You Trust NIST?|publisher=}}</ref> and tapping the links between [[Google]]'s data centres.<ref>[http://mashable.com/2013/10/30/nsa-google-yahoo-data-centers/ "New Snowden Leak: NSA Tapped Google, Yahoo Data Centers"], Oct 31, 2013, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, mashable.com</ref> These were disclosed by [[NSA]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]].<ref name=ARDinterview>{{cite web|last=Seipel |first=Hubert |title=Transcript: ARD interview with Edward Snowden |url=https://www.freesnowden.is/fr/2014/01/27/video-ard-interview-with-edward-snowden/ |work=La Foundation Courage|accessdate=11 June 2014}}</ref>

===Target and Home Depot breaches===

In 2013 and 2014, a [[Russia]]n/[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] hacking ring known as "Rescator" broke into [[Target Corporation]] computers in 2013, stealing roughly 40 million credit cards,<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-13/target-missed-alarms-in-epic-hack-of-credit-card-data "Missed Alarms and 40 Million Stolen Credit Card Numbers: How Target Blew It"]</ref> and then [[Home Depot]] computers in 2014, stealing between 53 and 56 million credit card numbers.<ref>[http://www.cnet.com/news/53-million-emails-stolen-in-home-depot-breach/ "Home Depot says 53 million emails stolen"]</ref>  Warnings were delivered at both corporations, but ignored;  physical security breaches using [[self checkout machine]]s are believed to have played a large role.  "The malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting," says Jim Walter, director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee - meaning that the heists could have easily been stopped by existing [[antivirus]] software had administrators responded to the warnings.  The size of the thefts has resulted in major attention from state and Federal United States authorities and the investigation is ongoing.

==Legal issues and global regulation==
Conflict of laws in cyberspace has become a major cause of concern for computer security community. Some of the main challenges and complaints about the antivirus industry are the lack of global web regulations, a global base of common rules to judge, and eventually punish, [[cyber crimes]] and [[cyber criminals]]. There is no global cyber law and cybersecurity treaty that can be invoked for enforcing global cybersecurity issues.

International legal issues of cyber attacks are complicated in nature. Even if an antivirus firm locates the cyber criminal behind the creation of a particular [[Virus (computer)|virus]] or piece of [[malware]] or form of [[Cyber-Attacks|cyber attack]], often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute.<ref name="ted.com">{{cite web|title=Mikko Hypponen: Fighting viruses, defending the net|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_fighting_viruses_defending_the_net.html|publisher=TED}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mikko Hypponen - Behind Enemy Lines |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TMFRO66Wv4|publisher=Hack In The Box Security Conference}}</ref> Authorship attribution for cyber crimes and cyber attacks is a major problem for all law enforcement agencies.

"[Computer viruses] switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world, using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this. So the Internet is as if someone [had] given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world."<ref name="ted.com"/> Use of dynamic DNS, [[fast flux]] and [[Bulletproof hosting|bullet proof servers]] have added own complexities to this situation.

==Government==
The role of the government is to make [[Cyber-security regulation|regulations]] to force companies and organizations to protect their systems, infrastructure and information from any [[cyber attack]]s, but also to protect its own national infrastructure such as the national [[Power grid|power-grid]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The question of whether the government should intervene or not in the regulation of the [[cyberspace]] is a very polemical one. Indeed, for as long as it has existed and by definition, the cyberspace is a [[virtual space]] free of any government intervention. Where everyone agree that an improvement on [[Cyber security|cybersecurity]] is more than vital, is the government the best actor to solve this issue?
Many government officials and experts think that the government should step in and that there is a crucial need for regulation, mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem. [[Richard A. Clarke|R. Clarke]] said during a panel discussion at the [[RSA Conference|RSA Security Conference]] in [[San Francisco]], he believes that the "industry only responds when you threaten regulation. If industry doesn't respond (to the threat), you have to follow through."<ref name="Clarke ref">{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-02-17/business/17361991_1_rsa-security-conference-cybersecurity-counterpane-internet-security | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Carrie | last=Kirby | title=Former White House aide backs some Net regulation / Clarke says government, industry deserve 'F' in cybersecurity | date=June 24, 2011}}</ref>
On the other hand, executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently.

==Actions and teams in the US==

===Legislation===

The 1986 {{usc|18|1030}}, more commonly known as the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] is the key legislation. It prohibits unauthorized access or damage of "protected computers" as defined in {{USCSub|18|1030|e|2}}.

Although various other measures have been proposed, such as the "Cybersecurity Act of 2010 - S. 773" in 2009, the "International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act - H.R.4962"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4962/text |title=Text of H.R.4962 as Introduced in House: International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act - U.S. Congress |publisher=OpenCongress |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref> and "Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010 - S.3480"<ref>[http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=4ee63497-ca5b-4a4b-9bba-04b7f4cb0123] {{wayback|url=http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=4ee63497-ca5b-4a4b-9bba-04b7f4cb0123 |date=20150704124401 }}</ref> in 2010 - none of these has succeeded.

===Germany===

====Berlin starts National Cyber Defense Initiative====
On June 16, 2011, the German Minister for Home Affairs, officially opened the new German NCAZ (National Center for Cyber Defense) [[National Cyberdefence Centre|Nationales Cyber-Abwehrzentrum]], which is located in Bonn. The NCAZ closely cooperates with BSI (Federal Office for Information Security) [[Federal Office for Information Security|Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik]], BKA (Federal Police Organisation) [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Bundeskriminalamt (Deutschland)]], BND (Federal Intelligence Service) [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]], MAD (Military Intelligence Service) [[Militärischer Abschirmdienst|Amt für den Militärischen Abschirmdienst]] and other national organisations in Germany taking care of national security aspects. According to the Minister the primary task of the new organisation founded on February 23, 2011, is to detect and prevent attacks against the national infrastructure and mentioned incidents like [[Stuxnet]].

===South Korea===
Following cyberattacks in the first half of 2013, when government, news-media, television station, and bank websites were compromised, the national government committed to the training of 5,000 new cybersecurity experts by 2017. The South Korean government blamed its northern counterpart for these attacks, as well as incidents that occurred in 2009, 2011,<ref name="South Korean news agency Yonhap">{{cite news|title=South Korea seeks global support in cyber attack probe|accessdate=27 October 2013|newspaper=BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific|date=7 March 2011}}</ref> and 2012, but Pyongyang denies the accusations.<ref name="Jun">{{cite news|title=Seoul Puts a Price on Cyberdefense|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/09/23/seoul-puts-a-price-on-cyberdefense/|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=23 September 2013|author=Kwanwoo Jun|agency=Dow Jones & Company, Inc}}</ref>

===India===
Some provisions for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000.

The [[National Cyber Security Policy 2013]] is a policy framework by Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) which aims to protect the public and private infrastructure from cyber attacks, and safeguard "information, such as personal information (of web users), financial and banking information and sovereign data".

The [[Indian Companies Act 2013]] has also introduced cyber law and cyber security obligations on the part of Indian directors.

==Modern warfare==
{{Main|Cyberwarfare}}

Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important as more information and technology is being made available on cyberspace. There is growing concern among governments that cyberspace will become the next theatre of warfare. As Mark Clayton from the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' described in an article titled "The New Cyber Arms Race":
<blockquote>
In the future, wars will not just be fought by soldiers with guns or with planes that drop bombs. They will also be fought with the click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer programs that disrupt or destroy critical industries like utilities, transportation, communications, and energy. Such attacks could also disable military networks that control the movement of troops, the path of jet fighters, the command and control of warships.<ref name="The new cyber arms race">{{cite web|last1=Clayton|first1=Mark|title=The new cyber arms race|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0307/The-new-cyber-arms-race|website=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref>
</blockquote>

This has led to new terms such as ''[[cyberwarfare]]'' and ''[[cyberterrorism]]''. More and more critical infrastructure is being controlled via computer programs that, while increasing efficiency, exposes new vulnerabilities. The test will be to see if governments and corporations that control critical systems such as energy, communications and other information will be able to prevent attacks before they occur. As Jay Cross, the chief scientist of the Internet Time Group, remarked, "Connectedness begets vulnerability."<ref name="The new cyber arms race"/>

==The cyber security job market==

== Terminology ==
{{cleanup|section|date=November 2010}}
The following terms used with regards to engineering secure systems are explained below.
* Access [[authorization]] restricts access to a computer to group of users through the use of [[authentication]] systems. These systems can protect either the whole computer – such as through an interactive [[login]] screen – or individual services, such as an [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as [[password]]s, [[identification card]]s, and, more recently, [[smart card]]s and [[biometric]] systems.
* [[Anti-virus software]] consists of computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart and eliminate [[computer viruses]] and other malicious software ([[malware]]).
* [[Application software|Applications]] with known security flaws should not be run. Either leave it turned off until it can be patched or otherwise fixed, or delete it and replace it with some other application. Publicly known flaws are the main entry used by [[Computer worm|worms]] to automatically break into a system and then spread to other systems connected to it. The security website [[Secunia]] provides a search tool for unpatched known flaws in popular products.
* [[Authentication]] techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.
* [[Automated theorem proving]] and other verification tools can enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications.
* [[Backup]]s are a way of securing information; they are another copy of all the important computer files kept in another location. These files are kept on hard disks, [[CD-R]]s, [[CD-RW]]s, [[Magnetic tape data storage|tapes]] and more recently on the cloud. Suggested locations for backups are a fireproof, waterproof, and heat proof safe, or in a separate, offsite location than that in which the original files are contained. Some individuals and companies also keep their backups in [[safe deposit box]]es inside [[bank vault]]s. There is also a fourth option, which involves using one of the [[file hosting service]]s that backs up files over the [[Internet]] for both business and individuals, known as the cloud.
** Backups are also important for reasons other than security. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or tornadoes, may strike the building where the computer is located. The building can be on fire, or an explosion may occur. There needs to be a recent backup at an alternate secure location, in case of such kind of disaster. Further, it is recommended that the alternate location be placed where the same disaster would not affect both locations. Examples of alternate disaster recovery sites being compromised by the same disaster that affected the primary site include having had a primary site in [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] I and the recovery site in [[7 World Trade Center]], both of which were destroyed in the [[9/11]] attack, and having one's primary site and recovery site in the same coastal region, which leads to both being vulnerable to hurricane damage (for example, primary site in New Orleans and recovery site in [[Jefferson Parish]], both of which were hit by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005). The backup media should be moved between the geographic sites in a secure manner, in order to prevent them from being stolen.
* [[Capability (computers)|Capability]] and [[access control list]] techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control. [[Computer security#Capabilities vs. ACLs|This section]] discusses their use.
* [[Chain of trust]] techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the system's designers.
* [[Confidentiality]] is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person.<ref>{{cite web|title=Confidentiality|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/confidentiality|accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref>
* [[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems, reducing the probability that data exchanged between systems can be intercepted or modified.
* Cyberwarfare is an Internet-based conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems. Such attacks can, for example, disable official websites and networks, disrupt or disable essential services, steal or alter classified data, and criple financial systems.
* [[Data integrity]] is the accuracy and consistency of stored data, indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data record.<ref>{{cite web|title=Data Integrity|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html|accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref>
[[File:Encryption - decryption.svg|thumb|300px|[[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques involve transforming information, scrambling it so it becomes unreadable during transmission. The intended recipient can unscramble the message; ideally, eavesdroppers cannot.]]
* [[Encryption]] is used to protect the message from the eyes of others. [[Cryptography|Cryptographically]] secure [[cipher]]s are designed to make any practical attempt of [[cryptanalysis|breaking]] infeasible. [[symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric-key]] ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using [[shared key]]s, and [[public-key encryption]] using [[digital certificate]]s can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.
* Endpoint security software helps networks to prevent exfiltration (data theft) and virus infection at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected portable computing devices, such as laptops and mobile devices, and external storage devices, such as USB drives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Endpoint Security|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html|accessdate=2014-03-15}}</ref>
* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] are an important method for control and security on the Internet and other networks. A network firewall can be a communications processor, typically a router, or a dedicated server, along with firewall software. A firewall serves as a gatekeeper system that protects a company's intranets and other computer networks from intrusion by providing a filter and safe transfer point for access to and from the Internet and other networks. It screens all network traffic for proper passwords or other security codes and only allows authorized transmission in and out of the network. Firewalls can deter, but not completely prevent, unauthorized access (hacking) into computer networks; they can also provide some protection from online intrusion.
* [[Honeypot (computing)|Honey pots]] are computers that are either intentionally or unintentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers or fix vulnerabilities.
* [[Intrusion-detection system]]s can scan a network for people that are on the network but who should not be there or are doing things that they should not be doing, for example trying a lot of passwords to gain access to the network.
* A [[microkernel]] is the near-minimum amount of software that can provide the mechanisms to implement an operating system.  It is used solely to provide very low-level, very precisely defined machine code upon which an operating system can be developed. A simple example is the early '90s GEMSOS (Gemini Computers), which provided extremely low-level machine code, such as "segment" management, atop which an operating system could be built. The theory (in the case of "segments") was that&mdash;rather than have the operating system itself worry about mandatory access separation by means of military-style labeling&mdash;it is safer if a low-level, independently scrutinized module can be charged '''solely''' with the management of individually labeled segments, be they memory "segments" or file system "segments" or executable text "segments." If software below the visibility of the operating system is (as in this case) charged with labeling, there is no theoretically viable means for a clever hacker to subvert the labeling scheme, since the operating system ''per se'' does '''not''' provide mechanisms for interfering with labeling: the operating system is, essentially, a client (an "application," arguably) atop the microkernel and, as such, subject to its restrictions.
* [[Ping (networking utility)|Ping]]ing The ping application can be used by potential crackers to find if an IP address is reachable. If a cracker finds a computer, they can try a port scan to detect and attack services on that computer.
* [[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] awareness keeps employees aware of the dangers of social engineering and/or having a policy in place to prevent social engineering can reduce successful breaches of the network and servers.
