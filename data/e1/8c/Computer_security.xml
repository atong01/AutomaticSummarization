This is done using multiple transparent or opaque layers. The attacker is basically &quot;hijacking&quot; the clicks meant for the top level page and routing them to some other irrelevant page, most likely owned by someone else. A similar technique can be used to hijack keystrokes. Carefully drafting a combination of stylesheets, iframes, buttons and text boxes, a user can be led into believing that they are typing the password or other information on some authentic webpage while it is being channeled into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Social engineering and trojans</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Social engineering (security)</arg></template><template><target>See also</target><arg>Category:Cryptographic attacks</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Social engineering (computer security)</target><part>Social engineering</part></link><space/>aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. by, for example, impersonating a bank, a contractor, or a customer.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Arcos Sergio</arg><arg name="title">Social Engineering</arg><arg name="url">http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/bitstream/2099.1/12289/1/73827.pdf</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Systems at risk</heading><paragraph>Computer security is critical in almost any industry which uses computers.<extension extension_name='ref' name="FAA Computer Security">J.

Much of this technology is based on science developed in the 1980s and used to produce what may be some of the most impenetrable operating systems ever. Though still valid, the technology is in limited use today, primarily because it imposes some changes to system management and also because it is not widely understood. Such ultra-strong secure operating systems are based on<space/><link><target>operating system kernel</target></link><space/>technology that can guarantee that certain security policies are absolutely enforced in an operating environment. An example of such a<space/><link><target>Computer security policy</target></link><space/>is the<space/><link><target>Bell-LaPadula model</target></link>. The strategy is based on a coupling of special<space/><link><target>microprocessor</target></link><space/>hardware features, often involving the<space/><link><target>memory management unit</target></link>, to a special correctly implemented operating system kernel. This forms the foundation for a secure operating system which, if certain critical parts are designed and implemented correctly, can ensure the absolute impossibility of penetration by hostile elements. This capability is enabled because the configuration not only imposes a security policy, but in theory completely protects itself from corruption. Ordinary operating systems, on the other hand, lack the features that assure this maximal level of security. The design methodology to produce such secure systems is precise, deterministic and logical.</paragraph><paragraph>Systems designed with such methodology represent the state of the art<template><target>Clarify</target><arg name="date">February 2009</arg></template><space/>of computer security although products using such security are not widely known. In sharp contrast to most kinds of software, they meet specifications with verifiable certainty comparable to specifications for size, weight and power. Secure operating systems designed this way are used primarily to protect national security information, military secrets, and the data of international financial institutions. These are very powerful security tools and very few secure operating systems have been certified at the highest level (<link><target>Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria</target><part>Orange Book</part></link><space/>A-1) to operate over the range of &quot;Top Secret&quot; to &quot;unclassified&quot; (including Honeywell SCOMP, USAF SACDIN, NSA Blacker and Boeing MLS LAN). The assurance of security depends not only on the soundness of the design strategy, but also on the assurance of correctness of the implementation, and therefore there are degrees of security strength defined for COMPUSEC. The<space/><link><target>Common Criteria</target></link><space/>quantifies security strength of products in terms of two components, security functionality and assurance level (such as EAL levels), and these are specified in a<space/><link><target>Protection Profile</target></link><space/>for requirements and a<space/><link><target>Security Target</target></link><space/>for product descriptions. None of these ultra-high assurance secure general purpose operating systems have been produced for decades or certified under Common Criteria.</paragraph><paragraph>In USA parlance, the term High Assurance usually suggests the system has the right security functions that are implemented robustly enough to protect DoD and DoE classified information. Medium assurance suggests it can protect less valuable information, such as income tax information. Secure operating systems designed to meet medium robustness levels of security functionality and assurance have seen wider use within both government and commercial markets. Medium robust systems may provide the same security functions as high assurance secure operating systems but do so at a lower assurance level (such as Common Criteria levels EAL4 or EAL5). Lower levels mean we can be less certain that the security functions are implemented flawlessly, and therefore less dependable. These systems are found in use on web servers, guards, database servers, and management hosts and are used not only to protect the data stored on these systems but also to provide a high level of protection for network connections and routing services.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Secure coding</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Secure coding</arg></template>If the operating environment is not based on a secure operating system capable of maintaining a domain for its own execution, and capable of protecting application code from malicious subversion, and capable of protecting the system from subverted code, then high degrees of security are understandably not possible. While such secure operating systems are possible and have been implemented, most commercial systems fall in a 'low security' category because they rely on features not supported by secure operating systems (like portability, and others). In low security operating environments, applications must be relied on to participate in their own protection. There are 'best effort' secure coding practices that can be followed to make an application more resistant to malicious subversion.</paragraph><paragraph>In commercial environments, the majority of software subversion<space/><link><target>vulnerability (computing)</target><part>vulnerabilities</part></link><space/>result from a few known kinds of coding defects.

These defects can be used to cause the target system to execute putative data. However, the &quot;data&quot; contain executable instructions, allowing the attacker to gain control of the processor.</paragraph><paragraph>Some common languages such as C and C++ are vulnerable to all of these defects (see Seacord,<space/><italics>&quot;Secure Coding in C and C++&quot;</italics>).<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.cert.org/books/secure-coding<space/></arg><arg name="title">Secure Coding in C and C++, Second Edition<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Cert.org<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2013-09-25</arg></template></extension><space/>Other languages, such as Java, are more resistant to some of these defects, but are still prone to code/command injection and other software defects which facilitate subversion.</paragraph><paragraph>Another bad coding practice occurs when an object is deleted during normal operation yet the program neglects to update any of the associated memory pointers, potentially causing system instability when that location is referenced again.

Using ACLs to confine programs has been proven to be insecure in many situations, such as if the host computer can be tricked into indirectly allowing restricted file access, an issue known as the<space/><link><target>confused deputy problem</target></link>. It has also been shown that the promise of ACLs of giving access to an object to only one person can never be guaranteed in practice. Both of these problems are resolved by capabilities.

A network firewall can be a communications processor, typically a router, or a dedicated server, along with firewall software. A firewall serves as a gatekeeper system that protects a company's intranets and other computer networks from intrusion by providing a filter and safe transfer point for access to and from the Internet and other networks. It screens all network traffic for proper passwords or other security codes and only allows authorized transmission in and out of the network. Firewalls can deter, but not completely prevent, unauthorized access (hacking) into computer networks; they can also provide some protection from online intrusion.</listitem><listitem><link><target>Honeypot (computing)</target><part>Honey pots</part></link><space/>are computers that are either intentionally or unintentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers.

It is used solely to provide very low-level, very precisely defined machine code upon which an operating system can be developed.

The theory (in the case of &quot;segments&quot;) was that&amp;mdash;rather than have the operating system itself worry about mandatory access separation by means of military-style labeling&amp;mdash;it is safer if a low-level, independently scrutinized module can be charged<space/><bold>solely</bold><space/>with the management of individually labeled segments, be they memory &quot;segments&quot; or file system &quot;segments&quot; or executable text &quot;segments.&quot; If software below the visibility of the operating system is (as in this case) charged with labeling, there is no theoretically viable means for a clever hacker to subvert the labeling scheme, since the operating system<space/><italics>per se</italics><space/>does<space/><bold>not</bold><space/>provide mechanisms for interfering with labeling: the operating system is, essentially, a client (an &quot;application,&quot; arguably) atop the microkernel and, as such, subject to its restrictions.</listitem><listitem><link><target>Ping (networking utility)</target><part>Ping</part><trail>ing</trail></link><space/>The ping application can be used by potential crackers to find if an IP address is reachable.
