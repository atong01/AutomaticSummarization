An '''anthem''' is a [[musical composition]] of [[wikt:celebration|celebration]], usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the [[national anthem]]s of [[country|countries]]. Originally, and in [[music theory]] and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred [[choral music|choral work]] and still more particularly to a specific form of [[Anglican church music]].

==Etymology==
''Anthem'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀντίφωνα}} (''antíphōna'') via [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|''antefn''}}. Both words originally referred to [[antiphon]]s, a [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] style of singing.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The adjectival form is "anthemic".

==History==
Anthems were originally a form of [[liturgical music]]. In the [[Church of England]], the [[rubric]] appoints them to follow the third [[collect]] at morning and evening prayer. Several anthems are included in the [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation service]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The words are selected from [[Holy Scripture]] or in some cases from the [[Liturgy]] and the music is generally more elaborate and varied than that of [[psalm]] or [[hymn tune]]s.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Being written for a trained [[choir]] rather than the congregation, the Anglican anthem is analogous to the [[motet]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran Church]]es but represents an essentially English [[musical form]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} Anthems may be described as "[[verse anthem|verse]]", "full", or "full with verse", depending on whether they are intended for [[solo (music)|solo]]ists, the [[choir|full choir]], or both.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}

The anthem developed as a replacement for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] "votive antiphon" commonly sung as an appendix to the main [[Liturgy of the Hours|office]] to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] or [[saint (Christianity)|other saints]]. During the [[Elizabethan period]], notable anthems were composed by [[Thomas Tallis]], [[William Byrd]], Tye, and Farrant{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} but they were not mentioned in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] until 1662 when the famous [[rubric]] "In quires and places where they sing here followeth the Anthem" first appears. Early anthems tended to be simple and [[homophony|homophonic]] in texture, so that the words could be clearly heard. During the 17th century, notable anthems were composed by [[Orlando Gibbons]], [[Henry Purcell]], and [[John Blow]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} with the [[verse anthem]] becoming the dominant musical form of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]].{{fact|date=August 2015}} In the 18th century, famed anthems were composed by Croft, Boyce, [[James Kent]], [[James Nares]], [[Benjamin Cooke]], and [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} In the 19th, [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]] wrote anthems influenced by contemporary [[oratorio]] which stretch to several [[movement (music)|movements]] and last twenty minutes or longer. Later in the century, [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] used symphonic techniques to produce a more concise and unified structure. Many anthems have been composed since this time, generally by [[organist]]s rather than professional [[composer]]s and often in a conservative style. Major composers have usually composed anthems in response to commissions and for special occasions. Examples include [[Edward Elgar]]'s 1912 "Great is the Lord" and 1914 "Give unto the Lord" (both with orchestral accompaniment), [[Benjamin Britten]]'s 1943 ''[[Rejoice in the Lamb]]'' (a modern example of a multi-movement anthem, today heard mainly as a concert piece), and, on a much smaller scale, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s 1952 "O Taste and See" written for the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. With the relaxation of the rule, in [[England]] at least, that anthems should be only in English, the repertoire has been greatly enhanced by the addition of many works from the Latin repertoire.

The word "anthem" is now commonly used to describe any celebratory song or composition for a distinct group, as in [[national anthem]]s. Many [[Pop music|pop song]]s are used as [[sports anthem]]s, notably including [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[We Are the Champions]]" and "[[We Will Rock You]]", and some sporting events have their own anthems, most notably including [[UEFA Champions League Anthem|UEFA Champions League]]. Further, some songs are artistically styled as anthems, whether or not they are used as such, including [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s "[[Irresponsible Hate Anthem]]", [[Silverchair]]'s "[[Anthem for the Year 2000]]", and [[Toto (band)|Toto]]'s "Child's Anthem".
