It became widespread after the threat of<space/><link><target>nuclear weapon</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>was realized.</paragraph><paragraph>Since the end of the<space/><link><target>Cold War</target></link>, the focus of civil defense has largely shifted from military attack to emergencies and disasters in general.

The most devastating raids inflicted 121 casualties for each<space/><link><target>ton</target></link><space/>of bombs dropped and it was this figure that was used as a basis for predictions.</paragraph><paragraph>After the war, attention was turned toward civil defence in the event of war, and the<space/><link><target>Air Raid Precautions</target></link><space/>Committee was established in 1924 to investigate ways for ensuring the protection of civilians from the danger of<space/><link><target>Aerial bombing of cities#European theatre</target><part>air-raids</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The Committee produced figures estimating that in<space/><link><target>London</target></link><space/>there would be 9,000 casualties in the first two days and then a continuing rate of 17,500 casualties a week. These rates were thought conservative. It was believed that there would be &quot;total chaos and panic&quot; and hysterical neurosis as the people of London would try to flee the city. To control the population harsh measures were proposed&amp;mdash;bringing London under almost military control; physically cordoning London with 120,000 troops to force people back to work. A different government department proposed setting up camps for<space/><link><target>refugees</target></link><space/>for a few days before sending them back to London.</paragraph><paragraph>A special government department, the<space/><link><target>Civil Defence Service</target></link><space/>was established by the<space/><link><target>Home Office</target></link><space/>in 1935. Its remit included the pre-existing ARP as well as wardens, firemen (initially the<space/><link><target>Auxiliary Fire Service</target></link><space/>(AFS) and latterly the<space/><link><target>National Fire Service</target></link><space/>(NFS)), fire watchers, rescue, first aid post, stretcher party and industry.

Volunteers were ascribed to different units depending on experience or training. Each local civil defence service were divided into several sections. Wardens were responsible for local<space/><link><target>reconnaissance</target></link><space/>and reporting, and leadership, organisation, guidance and control of the general public. Wardens would also advise survivors of the locations of rest and food centres, and other welfare facilities.</paragraph><paragraph>Rescue Parties were required to assess and then access bombed out buildings and retrieve injured or dead people. In addition they would turn off<space/><link><target>gas</target></link>,<space/><link><target>electricity</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>water supply</target><part>water supplies</part></link>, and repair or pull down unsteady buildings. Medical services, including<space/><link><target>First Aid</target><part>First Aid Parties</part></link>, provided on the spot medical assistance.</paragraph><paragraph>The expected stream of information that would be generated during an attack was handled by 'Report and Control' teams. A local<space/><link><target>headquarter</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>would have an ARP controller that would direct rescue, first aid and<space/><link><target>decontamination</target></link><space/>teams to the scenes of reported bombing. If local services were deemed insufficient to deal with the incident then the controller could request assistance from surrounding<space/><link><target>borough</target><trail>s</trail></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Fire Guards were responsible for a designated area/building and required to monitor the fall of<space/><link><target>incendiary bomb</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and pass on news of any fires that had broken out to the NFS. They could deal with an individual<space/><link><target>Elektron (alloy)</target><part>magnesium electron incendiary bomb</part></link><space/>by dousing them in buckets of sand, water or by smothering. Additionally, 'Gas Decontamination Teams' were kitted out with gas-tight and<space/><link><target>waterproof</target></link><space/><link><target>protective clothing</target></link><space/>and were to deal with any<space/><link><target>gas attack</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

In February 1936 the<space/><link><target>Home Secretary</target></link><space/>appointed a technical Committee on Structural Precautions against Air Attack. During the<space/><link><target>Munich crisis</target></link>, local authorities dug trenches to provide shelter. After the crisis, the British Government decided to make these a permanent feature, with a standard design of precast concrete trench lining.

Originally authorised by Public Law 920 of the 81st Congress it was repealed by Public Law 93-337 in 1994. Small portions of that statutory scheme were incorporated into the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Public Law 100-707) which superseded in part, amended in part, and supplemented in part the<space/><link><target>Disaster Relief Act of 1974</target></link><space/>(Public Law 93-288). In the portions of the civil defense statute incorporated into the<space/><link><target>Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act</target></link><space/>the primary modification was to use the term &quot;<link><target>Emergency Preparedness</target></link>&quot; wherever the term &quot;Civil Defence&quot; previously appeared in the statutory language.</paragraph><paragraph>An important concept initiated by President<space/><link><target>Jimmy Carter</target></link><space/>was the so-called &quot;Crisis Relocation Program&quot; administered as part of the federal civil defense program.

After an attack, conventional full-time emergency services are dramatically overloaded, with conventional fire fighting response times often exceeding several days.

Studies in<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link><space/>showed that lightly trained (40 hours or less) civilians in organised teams can perform up to 95% of emergency activities when trained, liaised and supported by local government. In this plan, the populace rescues itself from most situations, and provides information to a central office to prioritize professional emergency services.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 1990s, this concept was revived by the<space/><link><target>Los Angeles Fire Department</target></link><space/>to cope with civil emergencies such as<space/><link><target>earthquake</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The program was widely adopted, providing standard terms for organization. In the U.S., this is now official federal policy, and it is implemented by<space/><link><target>community emergency response team</target><trail>s</trail></link>, under the Department of Homeland Security, which certifies training programmes by local governments, and registers &quot;certified disaster service workers&quot; who complete such training.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Recovery</heading><paragraph>Recovery consists of rebuilding damaged infrastructure, buildings and production. The recovery phase is the longest and ultimately most expensive phase. Once the immediate &quot;crisis&quot; has passed, cooperation fades away and recovery efforts are often politicised or seen as economic opportunities.</paragraph><paragraph>Preparation for recovery can be very helpful. If mitigating resources are dispersed before the attack, cascades of social failures can be prevented. One hedge against bridge damage in riverine cities is to subsidise a &quot;tourist ferry&quot; that performs scenic cruises on the river. When a bridge is down, the ferry takes up the load.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Implementation</heading><paragraph>Some advocates believe that government should change building codes to require<space/><link><target>autonomous building</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>in order to reduce civil societies' dependence on complex, fragile networks of social services.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">August 2010</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>An example of a crucial need after a general nuclear attack would be the fuel required to transport every other item for recovery.
