[[Image:CivilDefence.svg|thumb|right|The international distinctive sign of civil defense, defined by the rules of [[international humanitarian law]] and to be used as a [[protective sign]]]]

'''Civil defense''', '''civil defence''' (see [[British and American English spelling differences|spelling differences]]) or '''civil protection''' is an effort to protect the citizens of a state (generally [[non-combatant]]s) from [[military]] attack. It uses the principles of [[emergency operation]]s: [[Hazard prevention|prevention]], [[#Mitigation|mitigation]], preparation, response, or [[emergency evacuation]] and recovery. Programs of this sort were initially discussed at least as early as the 1920s and were implemented in some countries during the 1930s as the threat of [[war]] and [[strategic bombing|aerial bombardment]] grew. It became widespread after the threat of [[nuclear weapon]]s was realized.

Since the end of the [[Cold War]], the focus of civil defense has largely shifted from military attack to emergencies and disasters in general. The new concept is described by a number of terms, each of which has its own specific shade of meaning, such as '''[[crisis management]]''', '''[[emergency management]]''', '''emergency preparedness''', '''contingency planning''', '''emergency services''', and '''civil protection'''.

In some countries, civil defense is seen as a key part of "total defense". For example, in [[Sweden]], the [[Swedish language|Swedish word]] ''totalf√∂rsvar'' refers to the commitment of a wide range of resources of the nation to its defense - including to civil protection. Respectively, some countries (notably the [[Soviet Union]]) may have or have had military-organized civil defense units (Civil Defense Troops) as part of their [[armed forces]] or as a [[paramilitary]] service.

== History ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Joan Baez]] -->
<!--Use British spelling please -->

=== Origins ===
[[File:It is far better to face the bullets.jpg|thumb|right|upright|British [[First World War]] poster, bringing attention to the threat posed by aerial bombardment from German [[Zeppelin]]s.]]
The advent of civil defence was stimulated by the experience of the bombing of civilian areas during the [[First World War]].The bombing of Britain began on 19 January 1915 when [[zeppelin]]s dropped bombs on the [[Great Yarmouth]] area, killing six people. [[Germany|German]] bombing operations of the First World War were surprisingly effective, especially after the [[Gotha G|Gotha]] bombers surpassed the zeppelins. The most devastating raids inflicted 121 casualties for each [[ton]] of bombs dropped and it was this figure that was used as a basis for predictions.

After the war, attention was turned toward civil defence in the event of war, and the [[Air Raid Precautions]] Committee was established in 1924 to investigate ways for ensuring the protection of civilians from the danger of [[Aerial bombing of cities#European theatre|air-raids]].

The Committee produced figures estimating that in [[London]] there would be 9,000 casualties in the first two days and then a continuing rate of 17,500 casualties a week. These rates were thought conservative. It was believed that there would be "total chaos and panic" and hysterical neurosis as the people of London would try to flee the city. To control the population harsh measures were proposed&mdash;bringing London under almost military control; physically cordoning London with 120,000 troops to force people back to work. A different government department proposed setting up camps for [[refugees]] for a few days before sending them back to London.

A special government department, the [[Civil Defence Service]] was established by the [[Home Office]] in 1935. Its remit included the pre-existing ARP as well as wardens, firemen (initially the [[Auxiliary Fire Service]] (AFS) and latterly the [[National Fire Service]] (NFS)), fire watchers, rescue, first aid post, stretcher party and industry. Over 1.9 million people served within the CD and nearly 2,400 lost their lives to enemy action.

[[File:StateLibQld 1 102384 Air Raid Warden testing new equipment in Brisbane, October 1942.jpg|thumb|left|[[Air Raid Precautions|Air Raid Warden]] testing his equipment in Brisbane in October 1942.]]
The organisation of civil defence was the responsibility of the local authority. Volunteers were ascribed to different units depending on experience or training. Each local civil defence service were divided into several sections. Wardens were responsible for local [[reconnaissance]] and reporting, and leadership, organisation, guidance and control of the general public. Wardens would also advise survivors of the locations of rest and food centres, and other welfare facilities.

Rescue Parties were required to assess and then access bombed out buildings and retrieve injured or dead people. In addition they would turn off [[gas]], [[electricity]] and [[water supply|water supplies]], and repair or pull down unsteady buildings. Medical services, including [[First Aid|First Aid Parties]], provided on the spot medical assistance.

The expected stream of information that would be generated during an attack was handled by 'Report and Control' teams. A local [[headquarter]]s would have an ARP controller that would direct rescue, first aid and [[decontamination]] teams to the scenes of reported bombing. If local services were deemed insufficient to deal with the incident then the controller could request assistance from surrounding [[borough]]s.

Fire Guards were responsible for a designated area/building and required to monitor the fall of [[incendiary bomb]]s and pass on news of any fires that had broken out to the NFS. They could deal with an individual [[Elektron (alloy)|magnesium electron incendiary bomb]] by dousing them in buckets of sand, water or by smothering. Additionally, 'Gas Decontamination Teams' were kitted out with gas-tight and [[waterproof]] [[protective clothing]] and were to deal with any [[gas attack]]s. They were trained to decontaminate buildings, roads, rail and other material that had been contaminated by liquid or jelly gases.

[[File:The Home Front in Britain during the Second World War HU36196.jpg|thumb|[[Air-raid shelter|Anderson shelter]]s were widely distributed in Britain by civil defence authorities, in preparation for aerial bombardment.]]
Little progress was made over the issue of [[air-raid shelter]]s, because of the apparently irreconcilable conflict between the need to send the public underground for shelter and the need to keep them above ground for protection against gas attacks. In February 1936 the [[Home Secretary]] appointed a technical Committee on Structural Precautions against Air Attack. During the [[Munich crisis]], local authorities dug trenches to provide shelter. After the crisis, the British Government decided to make these a permanent feature, with a standard design of precast concrete trench lining. They also decided to issue free to poorer households the [[Anderson shelter]] and to provide steel props to create shelters in suitable basements.<ref>{{Citation|last=Baker|first=Lord John |authorlink=John Baker, Baron Baker |year=1978 |title=Enterprise vs Bureaucracy - The Development of Structural Air Raid Precautions during the 2nd World War |publisher=Pergamon Press}}</ref>

During the [[Second World War]], the ARP was responsible for the issuing of [[gas mask]]s, pre-fabricated [[air-raid shelter]]s (such as [[Anderson shelter]]s, as well as [[Morrison shelter]]s), the upkeep of local public shelters, and the maintenance of the [[blackout (wartime)|blackout]]. The ARP also helped rescue people after air raids and other attacks, and some women became ARP Ambulance Attendants whose job was to help administer first aid to casualties, search for survivors, and in many grim instances, help recover bodies, sometimes those of their own colleagues.

As the war progressed, the effectiveness of aerial bombardment was, beyond the destruction of property, very limited. There were less than three casualties for each ton of bombs dropped by the [[Luftwaffe]] in many British cities and the expected social consequences hardly happened.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The morale of the British people remained high, '[[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder|shell-shock]]' was not at all common, and the rates of other nervous and mental ailments declined.

In the [[United States]], the [[Office of Civil Defense]] was established in May 1941 to coordinate civilian defense efforts. It coordinated with the [[Department of the Army]] and established similar groups to the British ARP. One of these groups that still exists today is the [[Civil Air Patrol]], which was originally created as a civilian auxiliary to the [[US Army|Army]]. The CAP was created on December 1, 1941, with the main civil defense mission of search and rescue. The CAP also sunk 2 Axis submarines and provided aerial reconnaissance for Allied and neutral merchant ships.<ref>http://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/about</ref> In 1946, the Civil Air Patrol was barred from combat by [[Public Law 79-476]]. The CAP then received its current mission: search and rescue for downed aircraft. When the [[US Air Force|Air Force]] was created, in 1947, the Civil Air Patrol became the auxiliary of the [[US Air Force|Air Force]].<ref>Texas Wing Civil Air Patrol 2014 Summer Encampment Standard Operating Instructions (SOI)</ref>

=== Atomic Age ===
[[Image:falloutprotection.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Civil Defense literature such as ''Fallout Protection'' were common during the [[Cold War]] era.]]

In most of the states of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], such as the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[West Germany]] as well as the [[Soviet Bloc]], and especially in the neutral countries, such as [[Switzerland]] and in [[Sweden]] during the 1950s and 1960s, many civil defense practices took place to prepare for the aftermath of a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], which seemed quite likely at that time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McReynolds |first=David |title=Ralph DiGia, 1914-2008 |journal=The [[Catholic Worker]] |year=2008 |volume=LXXV |issue=March‚ÄìApril |pages=6}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the [[Civil Defence Service]] was disbanded in 1945, followed by the ARP in 1946. With the onset of the growing [[Cold War|tensions between East and West]], the service was revived in 1949 as the [[Civil Defence Corps]]. As a civilian volunteer organisation, it was tasked take control in the aftermath of a major national emergency, principally envisaged as being a Cold War [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]]. Although under the authority of the [[Home Office]], with a centralised administrative establishment, the corps was administered locally by Corps Authorities. In general every [[counties of the United Kingdom|county]] was a Corps Authority, as were most [[county borough]]s in [[England and Wales]] and large [[burgh]]s in [[Scotland]].

Each division was divided into several sections, including the Headquarters, Intelligence and Operations, Scientific and Reconnaissance, Warden & Rescue, Ambulance and First Aid and Welfare.

In the United States, the sheer power of [[nuclear weapons]] and the perceived likelihood of such an attack, precipitated a greater response than had yet been required of civil defense. Civil defense, something previously considered an important and common sense step, also became divisive and controversial in the charged atmosphere of the [[Cold War]]. In 1950, the [[National Security Resources Board]] created a 162-page document outlining a model civil defense structure for the U.S.  Called the "Blue Book" by civil defense professionals in reference to its solid blue cover, it was the template for legislation and organization that occurred over the next 40 years.<ref>National Security Resources Board. United States Civil Defense. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), 1950. LCCN 51060552.</ref>

[[File:SurvivalUnderAtomicAttack.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Civil Defense literature such as [[Survival Under Atomic Attack]] was common during the Cold War Era.]]
Perhaps the most memorable aspect of the Cold War civil defense effort was the educational effort made or promoted by the government.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Scheibach|editor1-first=Michael|title="In Case Atom Bombs Fall": An Anthology of Governmental Explanations, Instructions and Warnings from the 1940s to the 1960s|date=2009|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=978-0-7864-4541-7}}</ref>  In ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'', [[Bert the Turtle]] advocated that children "[[duck and cover]]" when they "see the [[nuclear fireball|flash]]."  Booklets were also common place such as ''[[Survival Under Atomic Attack]]'', ''[[Fallout Protection]]'' and ''[[Nuclear War Survival Skills]]''. The transcribed radio program [[Stars for Defense]] combined hit music with civil defense advice. [[Public service announcements]] including children's songs were created by government institutes and then distributed and released by radio stations to educate the public in case of nuclear attack.
[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|The United States and [[Soviet Union]]/Russia nuclear stockpiles, in [[Historical nuclear weapons stockpiles and nuclear tests by country|total number of nuclear bombs/warheads in existence]] throughout the [[Cold War]] and post-Cold War era. However total ''deployed'' US & "Russian"  strategic weapons(ready for use) were far less than this, reaching a maximum of about 10,000 apiece in the 1980s.<ref>[http://krepon.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/3524/worth-the-wait Hans M. Kristensen 2012, "Estimated US-Russian Nuclear Warhead Inventories 1977-2018.]"</ref>]]
The US [[President Kennedy]](1961-63) launched an ambitious effort to install fallout shelters throughout the United States.  These shelters would not protect against the blast and heat effects of nuclear weapons, but would provide some protection against the radiation effects that would last for weeks and even affect areas distant from a nuclear explosion. In order for most of these preparations to be effective, there had to be some degree of warning. In 1951, [[CONELRAD|Control of Electromagnetic Radiation]] was established. Under the system, a few primary stations would be alerted of an emergency and would broadcast an alert.  All broadcast stations throughout the country would be constantly listening to an upstream station and repeat the message, thus passing it from station to station.

In a once classified US [[Military simulation|war game]] analyses, looking at varying levels of war escalation, warning and pre-emptive attacks in the late 1950s early 1960s, it was estimated that approximately 27 million US citizens would have been saved with civil defense education.<ref>[http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb480/docs/doc%2010A%201963.pdf Net Evaluation Subcommittee. page 27]</ref> At the time however the cost of a full-scale civil defense program was regarded as lesser in effectiveness, in [[cost-benefit analysis]] than a [[ballistic missile defense]]([[Nike Zeus]]) system, and as the Soviet adversary was increasing their [[nuclear stockpile]], the [[efficacy]] of both would follow a [[diminishing returns]] trend.<ref>[http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb480/docs/doc%2010A%201963.pdf Net Evaluation Subcommittee. page 27]</ref>

Contrary to the largely noncommittal approach taken in the [[NATO]], with its stops and starts in civil defense depending on the whims of the newly elected government. The military strategy in the comparatively more ideologically consistent [[USSR]] held that, amongst other things, a winnable nuclear war was possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.reed.edu/~ahm/Courses/Reed-POL-422-2012-S1_NP/Syllabus/EReadings/05.2/05.2.Pipes1977Why-the-Soviet-Union.pdf |title=Why the Soviet Union Thinks It Could Fight and Win a Nuclear War |author=Richard Pipes |publisher=Commentary [[Reed College]] |year=1977 |accessdate=September 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/63015546/Why-Russia-Thinks-It-Could-Fight-and-Win-a-Nuclear-War |title=Why the Soviet Union thinks it can fight and win a Nuclear War |author=Richard Pipes |publisher=Commentary |year=1977 |accessdate=April 21, 2013}}</ref><ref name="gwu.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv//nukevault/ebb285 |title=Previously Classified Interviews with Former Soviet Officials Reveal U.S. Strategic Intelligence Failure Over Decades |editor1-last=Burr |editor1-first=William |editor2-last=Savranskaya |editor2-first=Svetlana |date=September 11, 2009 |location=[[Washington, DC]] |accessdate=April 21, 2013}}</ref> To this effect the [[Soviet]]s planned to minimize, as far as possible, the effects of nuclear weapon strikes on its territory and therefore spent considerably more thought on civil defense preparations than in the U.S., with defense plans that have been assessed to be far more effective than those in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1977/mar-apr/dorough.html |title =Soviet Civil Defense U.S.S.R. preparations for industrial-base war survival. |author=Captain John W.

Soviet Civil Defense Troops played the main role in the massive disaster relief operation following the [[Chernobyl accident|1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident]]. Defense Troop [[reservists]] were officially [[mobilization|mobilized]] (as in a case of war) from throughout the USSR to join the Chernobyl task force and formed on  the basis of the [[Kiev]] Civil Defense Brigade. The task force performed some high-risk tasks including, with the failure of their robotic machinery, the manual removal of highly-[[radioactivity|radioactive]] debris. Many of whom were later [[Liquidator (Chernobyl)|decorated with medals for their work at containing the release of radiation into the environment]] with a number{{quantify|date=August 2015}} of [[Deaths due to the Chernobyl disaster|the 56 deaths from the accident]], being Civil defense troops.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

In Western countries, strong civil defense policies were never properly implemented, because it was fundamentally at odds, with the doctrine of "[[mutual assured destruction]]" (MAD) by making provisions for survivors.{{dubious|date=December 2013}} It was also considered that a fully fledged total defense would have not been worth the very large expense. For whatever reason, the public saw efforts at civil defense as fundamentally ineffective against the powerful destructive forces of nuclear weapons, and therefore a waste of time and money. Detailed scientific research programmes did lay behind the much-mocked government civil defence pamphlets of the 1950s and 1960s.<ref>[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7805718 Architects of Armageddon: the Home Office Scientific Advisers' Branch and civil defence in Britain, 1945‚Äì68]</ref>

Governments in most Western countries, with the sole exception of Switzerland, generally sought to underfund Civil Defense due to its perceived pointlessness.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Nevertheless, effective, but commonly dismissed [[duck and cover|civil defense measures against nuclear attack]] were implemented, in the face of popular apathy and scepticism of authority.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} After the end of the Cold War, the focus moved from defense against nuclear war to defense against a terrorist attack possibly involving [[chemical weapon|chemical]] or [[biological weapon]]s.

The [[Civil Defence Corps]] was stood down in Great Britain in 1968 with the tacit realization that nothing practical could be done in the event of an unrestricted nuclear attack.{{cn|date=July 2015}} Its neighbors however remained committed to Civil Defence, namely the [[Isle of Man Civil Defence Corps]] and [[Civil Defence Ireland]] (Republic of Ireland).

In the United States, the various civil defense agencies were replaced with the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) in 1979. In 2002 this became part of the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. The focus was shifted from nuclear war to an "all-hazards" approach of [[Comprehensive Emergency Management]]. [[Natural disasters]] and the emergence of new threats such as [[terrorism]] have caused attention to be focused away from traditional civil defense and into new forms of civil protection such as [[emergency management]] and [[homeland security]].

=== Today ===
Many [[Civil defense by country|countries]] still maintain a national Civil Defence Corps, usually having a wide brief for assisting in large scale civil emergencies such as flood, earthquake, invasion, or civil disorder.

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, in the United States the concept of civil defense has been revisited under the umbrella term of [[homeland security]] and all-hazards emergency management.

In [[Europe]], the triangle CD logo continues to be widely used. The old U.S. civil defense logo was used in the FEMA logo until 2006 and is hinted at in the United States [[Civil Air Patrol]] logo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Cleveland|title=United States Service Symbols|date=1942|page=98|url=http://www.printmag.com/wp-content/uploads/symbol-book-015.jpg|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> Created in 1939 by Charles Coiner of the N. W. Ayer Advertising Agency, it was used throughout World War II and the Cold War era. In 2006, the National Emergency Management Association&mdash;a U.S. organisation made up of state emergency managers&mdash;"officially" retired the Civil Defense triangle logo, replacing it with a stylised EM (standing for [[Emergency management]]).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/washington/01civil.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | first=David W. | last=Dunlap | title=Civil Defense Logo Dies at 67, and Some Mourn Its Passing | date=December 1, 2006}}</ref> The name and logo, however, continue to be used by [[Hawaii]] State Civil Defense<ref>[http://www.scd.hawaii.gov/]</ref> and [[Guam]] Homeland Security/Office of Civil Defense.<ref>[http://www.guamhs.org/main/]</ref>

The term "civil protection" is currently widely used within the [[European Union]] to refer to government-approved systems and resources tasked with protecting the non-combat population, primarily in the event of natural and technological disasters.  In recent years there has been emphasis on preparedness for technological disasters resulting from terrorist attack. Within EU countries the term "crisis-management" emphasises the political and security dimension rather than measures to satisfy the immediate needs of the population.

In Australia, civil defence is the responsibility of the volunteer-based [[State Emergency Service]].

In Russia, and most former Soviet countries, civil defence is the responsibility of Governmental Ministry, Like the [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]] in Russia.

== Importance ==
Relatively small investments in preparation can speed up recovery by months or years and thereby prevent millions of deaths by hunger, cold and disease.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} According to [[human capital]] theory in [[economics]], a country's population is more valuable than all of the land, factories and other assets that it possesses. People rebuild a country after its destruction, and it is therefore important for the economic security of a country that it protect its people. According to [[psychology]], it is important for people to feel as though they are in control of their own destiny, and preparing for uncertainty via civil defense may help to achieve this.

In the United States, the federal civil defense program was authorised by statute and ran from 1951 to 1994. Originally authorised by Public Law 920 of the 81st Congress it was repealed by Public Law 93-337 in 1994. Small portions of that statutory scheme were incorporated into the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Public Law 100-707) which superseded in part, amended in part, and supplemented in part the [[Disaster Relief Act of 1974]] (Public Law 93-288). In the portions of the civil defense statute incorporated into the [[Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act]] the primary modification was to use the term "[[Emergency Preparedness]]" wherever the term "Civil Defence" previously appeared in the statutory language.

An important concept initiated by President [[Jimmy Carter]] was the so-called "Crisis Relocation Program" administered as part of the federal civil defense program. That effort largely lapsed under President Ronald Reagan who discontinued the Carter initiative because of opposition from areas potentially hosting the relocated population. SEE Presidential Review Memorandum/NSC-32 [http://www.fas.or/irp/offdocs/prm/prm32.pdf] (September 30, 1977) and Presidential Decision Memorandum 42 [http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/pd/pd41.pdf].

== Threat assessment ==

Threats to civilians and civilian life include NBC ([[Nuclear warfare|Nuclear]], [[Biological warfare|Biological]], and [[Chemical warfare]]) and others, like the more modern term [[CBRN]], Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear. [[threat assessment]] involves studying each threat so that preventative measures can be built into civilian life.

;Conventional

This would be conventional explosives. A [[blast shelter]] designed to protect only from radiation and fall-out, however, would be much more vulnerable to conventional explosives,also see [[fallout shelter]].

;Nuclear

Shelter intended to protect against nuclear blast effects would include thick concrete and other sturdy elements which are resistant to conventional explosives. The biggest threats from a nuclear attack are effects from the blast, fires and radiation. One of the most prepared countries for a nuclear attack is [[Switzerland]]. Almost every building in Switzerland has an ''abri'' (shelter) against the initial nuclear bomb and explosion followed by the fall-out.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304231204576405700994655570.html?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_world | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Deborah | last=Ball | title=Swiss Renew Push for Bomb Shelters | date=2011-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm | work=BBC News | first=Imogen | last=Foulkes | title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war | date=2007-02-10}}</ref> Because of this, many people use it as a safe to protect valuables, photos, financial information and so on. Switzerland also has air-raid and nuclear-raid sirens in every village.

;Dirty Bomb
A "radiologically enhanced weapon," or "[[dirty bomb]]" uses an explosive to spread radioactive material. This is a theoretical risk, and such weapons have not been used by terrorists. Depending on the quantity of the radioactive material, the dangers may be mainly psychological. Toxic effects can be managed by standard [[dangerous goods|hazmat]] techniques.

;Biological

The threat here is primarily from disease-causing microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses.

;Chemical

Various chemical agents are a threat such as [[nerve gas]] ([[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], [[Sarin]], and so on.).

== Stages ==

=== Mitigation ===
[[Image:T38.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Civil defense logo on an Air raid [[siren (alarm)|siren]] control box in [[Kansas]], [[US]].]]
[[Image:Civil Defense Logo.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Civil Defense logo on a [[Thunderbolt siren|Thunderbolt 1003]] siren.]]

Mitigation is the process of actively preventing the war or the release of [[nuclear weapon]]s. It includes policy analysis, diplomacy, political measures, [[nuclear disarmament]] and more military responses such as a [[National Missile Defense]] and [[air defense artillery]]. In the case of counter-terrorism, mitigation would include diplomacy, [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] gathering and direct action against terrorist groups. Mitigation may also be reflected in long-term planning such as the design of the [[interstate highway]] system and the placement of military bases further away from populated areas.

=== Preparation ===

Preparation consists of building [[blast shelter]]s, and pre-positioning information, supplies and emergency infrastructure. For example, most larger cities in the U.S. now have underground emergency operations centres that can perform civil defense coordination. FEMA also has many underground facilities located near major railheads such as the one in [[Denton, Texas]] and [[Mount Weather]], Virginia for the same purpose.

Other measures would include continuous government inventories of grain silos, the [[Strategic National Stockpile]], the uncapping of the [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve]], the dispersal of lorry-transportable bridges, water purification, mobile refineries, mobile de-contamination facilities, mobile general and special purpose disaster mortuary facilities such as [[Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team]] (DMORT) and [[DMORT-WMD]], and other aids such as temporary housing to speed civil recovery.

On an individual scale, one means of preparation for exposure to [[nuclear fallout]] is to obtain [[potassium iodide]] (KI) tablets as a safety measure to protect the human [[thyroid]] gland from the uptake of dangerous radioactive [[iodine]]. Another measure is to cover the nose, mouth and eyes with a piece of cloth and sunglasses to protect against [[alpha particle]]s, which are only an internal hazard.

To support and supplement efforts at national, regional and local level with regard to disaster prevention, the [[wikt:preparedness|preparedness]] of those responsible for civil protection and the intervention in the event of disaster
* To establish a framework for effective and rapid cooperation between different civil protection services when mutual assistance is needed (police, [[fire service]], [[healthcare]] service, [[public utility]] [[wikt:provider|provider]], voluntary agencies).
*To set up and implement training programs for intervention and coordination teams as well as assessment experts including joint courses and exchange systems.
*To enhance the coherence of actions undertaken at international level in the field of civil protection especially in the context of cooperation.

Preparing also includes sharing information:
*To contribute to the information of the public in view of increasing the level of self-protection of citizens
*To collect and disseminate validated emergency information
*To pool information on national civil protection capabilities, military and medical resources.
*To ensure efficient information sharing between the different authorities.

=== Response ===
Response consists first of warning civilians so they can enter [[Fallout Shelter]]s and protect assets.

Staffing a response is always full of problems in a civil defense emergency. After an attack, conventional full-time emergency services are dramatically overloaded, with conventional fire fighting response times often exceeding several days. Some capability is maintained by local and state agencies, and an emergency reserve is provided by specialised military units, especially [[Civil Affairs|civil affairs]], [[Military Police]], [[Judge Advocate]]s and [[combat engineer]]s.

However, the traditional response to massed attack on civilian population centres is to maintain a mass-trained force of volunteer emergency workers. Studies in [[World War II]] showed that lightly trained (40 hours or less) civilians in organised teams can perform up to 95% of emergency activities when trained, liaised and supported by local government. In this plan, the populace rescues itself from most situations, and provides information to a central office to prioritize professional emergency services.

In the 1990s, this concept was revived by the [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] to cope with civil emergencies such as [[earthquake]]s. The program was widely adopted, providing standard terms for organization. In the U.S., this is now official federal policy, and it is implemented by [[community emergency response team]]s, under the Department of Homeland Security, which certifies training programmes by local governments, and registers "certified disaster service workers" who complete such training.

=== Recovery ===

Recovery consists of rebuilding damaged infrastructure, buildings and production. The recovery phase is the longest and ultimately most expensive phase. Once the immediate "crisis" has passed, cooperation fades away and recovery efforts are often politicised or seen as economic opportunities.

Preparation for recovery can be very helpful. If mitigating resources are dispersed before the attack, cascades of social failures can be prevented. One hedge against bridge damage in riverine cities is to subsidise a "tourist ferry" that performs scenic cruises on the river. When a bridge is down, the ferry takes up the load.

== Implementation ==

Some advocates<!-- "Who" would only make sense if the advocates were doing an action --> believe that government should change building codes to require [[autonomous building]]s in order to reduce civil societies' dependence on complex, fragile networks of social services.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

An example of a crucial need after a general nuclear attack would be the fuel required to transport every other item for recovery. However, [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] are large, immobile, and probable targets. One proposal is to preposition truck-mounted fuel refineries near oil fields and bulk storage depots. Other critical infrastructure needs would include road and bridge repair, [[telecommunication|communications]], electric power, food production, and potable water.

== Civil defense organizations ==

Civil Defense is also the name of a number of organizations around the world dedicated to protecting civilians from military attacks, as well as to providing rescue services after natural and human-made disasters alike.

Worldwide is managed by the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] ([[OCHA]]).

In a few countries such as [[Jordan]] and [[Singapore]] (see [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]]), civil defense is essentially the same organisation {{clarify|date=February 2013}} as the [[fire brigade]]. In most countries however, civil defense is a government-managed, volunteer-staffed organisation, separate from the fire brigade and the [[ambulance]] service.

As the threat of Cold War eased, a number of such civil defense organisations have been disbanded or mothballed (as in the case of the [[Royal Observer Corps]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States civil defense]]), while others have changed their focuses into providing rescue services after natural disasters (as for the [[State Emergency Service]] in [[Australia]]). However the ideals of Civil Defense {{clarify|date=February 2013}} have been brought back in the [[United States]] under FEMA's [[Citizen Corps]] and [[Community Emergency Response Team]] (CERT).

In the [[United Kingdom]] Civil Defence work is carried out by Emergency Responders under the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]], with assistance from voluntary groups such as [[RAYNET]], [[Search and Rescue]] Teams and [[4x4 Response]]. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Civil Defence Ireland|Civil Defence]] is still very much an active organisation and is occasionally called upon for its Auxiliary Fire Service and ambulance/rescue services when emergencies such as [[flash flooding]] occur and require additional manpower. The organisation has units of trained [[firemen]] and [[medical responder]]s based in key areas around the country.
