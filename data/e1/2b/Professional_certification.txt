'''Professional certification''', '''trade certification''', or '''professional designation''', often called simply ''certification'' or ''qualification'', is a designation earned by a person to assure qualification to perform a job or task. Not all certifications that use [[post-nominal letters]] are an acknowledgement of educational achievement, or an agency appointed to safeguard the public interest.

== Overview ==
Certifications are earned from a [[professional society]], university, a certification body, or from a private certifier, for some specific certifications (e.g.,&nbsp;[[Microsoft]], [[Cisco]], etc.). Some certifications must be renewed periodically, or may be valid for a specific period of time (e.g.,&nbsp;the lifetime of the product upon which the individual is certified). As a part of a complete renewal of an individual's certification, it is common for the individual to show evidence of continued learning&mdash;often falsely{{dubious|date=May 2015}} termed [[continuing education]]&mdash;or earning [[continuing education unit]]s (CEU).

Many certification programs are created, sponsored, or affiliated with professional associations, trade organizations, or private vendors interested in raising standards. Many of those programs completely independent from membership organizations enjoy association support and endorsement.

::The growth of certification programs is also a reaction to the changing employment market. Certifications are portable, since they do not depend on one company's definition of a certain job. Certification stands about the resume and the professional reference by being an impartial, third-party endorsement of an individual's professional knowledge and experience.<ref>Phillip Barnhart, [http://books.google.com/books?id=3tY8Fck5UVkC&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20guide%20to%20national%20professional%20certification%20programs&pg=PA2 The Guide to National Professional Certification Programs] (1997), HRD Press. ISBN 0-8493-9960-2 Retrieved electronically 7 July 2009.</ref>

Certifications are usually earned from a professional society or educational institute, not the government. However, a government agency can decree a certification is required ''by law'' for a person to be allowed to perform a task or job. Certification is different from professional licensure. In the United States, [[U.S. State professional licenses|professional licenses]] are usually issued by state agencies, having as a requirement the university title for that profession. In other countries, licensing is granted by the professional society or college, but you need to certificate after some years (usually three to five) and so on thereafter. The certification assessment process, for some organizations, is very similar or even the same as licensure and may differ only in terms of legal status, while in other organizations, can be quite different and more comprehensive than that of licensure.

The [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI), Standard&nbsp;1100, defines the requirements of meeting the ANSI standard for being a certifying organization. According to ANSI&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;1100, a professional certifying organization must meet two requirements:
# Deliver an assessment based on industry knowledge, independent from training courses or course providers.
# Grant a time-limited credential to anyone who meets the assessment standards.

Certifications are very common in [[aviation]], [[construction]], [[technology]], environment, and other [[industrial sector]]s, as well as [[health care]], [[business]], [[Real estate broker]] and [[finance]]. In the United States, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] regulates aviator certifications.

The [[Institute for Credentialing Excellence]] (ICE) is a U.S.-based organization that sets rigorous standards for accreditation of certification programs based on the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (APA, AERA, NCME). Many members of the [[Association of Test Publishers]] (ATP) are also certification organizations.

== Types of certifications==
There are three general types of certification. Listed in order of development level and portability, they are: corporate (internal), product-specific, and profession-wide.

Corporate, or "internal" certifications, are made by a [[corporation]] or low-stakes organization for internal purposes. For example, a corporation might require a one-day training course for all sales personnel, after which they receive a certificate. While this certificate has limited portability – to other corporations, for example – it is the most simple to develop.

Product-specific certifications are more involved, and are intended to be referenced to a product across all applications. This approach is very prevalent in the [[information technology]] (IT) industry, where personnel are certified on a version of [[software]] or hardware. This type of certification is portable across locations (for example, different corporations that use that software), but not across other products. Another example could be the certifications issued for shipping personnel, which are under international standards even for the recognition of the certification body, under an International Maritime Organization (IMO).

The most general type of certification is profession-wide. Certification in the medical profession is often offered by particular specialties. In order to apply professional standards, increase the level of practice, and protect the public, a professional organization might establish a certification. This is intended to be portable to all places a certified professional might work. Of course, this generalization increases the cost of such a program; the process to establish a legally defensible assessment of an entire profession is very extensive. An example of this is a [[Certified Public Accountant]]&nbsp;(CPA), which would not be certified for just one corporation or one piece of [[accountancy]] software but for general work in the profession.

==Professional certificates awarded by universities==
Many universities grant professional certificates as an award for the completion of an educational program. The curriculum of a professional certificate is most often in a focused subject matter. Many professional certificates have the same curriculum as master's degrees in the same subject. Many other professional certificates offer the same courses as master's degrees in the same subject, but require the student to take fewer total courses to complete the program. Some professional certificates have a curriculum that more closely resembles a baccalaureate major in the same field.  The typical professional certificate program is between 200-300 class-hours in size. It is uncommon for a program to be larger or smaller than that. Most professional certificate programs are open enrollment, but some have admissions processes. A few universities put some of their professional certificates into a subclass they refer to as advanced professional certificates.

Some universities that offer extensive ranges of professional certificates include [[Duke University|Duke]],<ref>[http://www.learnmore.duke.edu/certificates/ Professional Certificates - Duke Continuing Studies].

=== Aerospace ===
'''[[Aerospace Technicians]]''' assemble, service, test, operate, and repair systems associated with both expendable and reusable space launch vehicles, payloads, related laboratories, and ground support equipment. Because space-related activities are evolving, professional certifications vary by country and sometimes by company within a country. Credentials are not yet closely regulated but have evolved over time. Most are performance-based due to the hands-on nature of the work and the importance of assuring the quality and safety of activities and operations in this demanding field.

Currently performance based certifications for aerospace technicians in the United States of America are patterned after the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Airframe and Powerplant certificates for aircraft mechanics. The regulatory arm of the FAA for space is the Office of Commercial Space Transportation (FAA-AST).<ref>[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/about] FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation.</ref>

Presently the only national credentials meeting the ISO-17024 standards for certification and holding an FAA Safety Approval for the credentialing process are those conferred by the SpaceTEC® - a National Science Foundation National Resource Center.<ref>[http://www.spacetec.org] SpaceTEC National Resource Center for Aerospace Technical Education.</ref> These certifications employ a proctored computer-based written examination followed by an oral examination (if required) and a practical performance-based skills examination administered by a trained and certified SpaceTEC® Examiner (STE).

The existing certifications for aerospace technicians include a Core certification for entry level employees and Concentrations in specialized disciplines for journeymen technicians:
* [[Certified Aerospace Technician™ - Core]] - covering an Introduction to the Aerospace Workplace; Applied Mechanics; Basic Electricity; Test & Measurements; Materials and Processes; and Aerospace Safety.
* [[Aerospace Manufacturing]] - Four disciplines/endorsements require Concentration examinations in Manufacturing Essentials (all four areas) with specializations in: Structures and Assembly Processes; Welding and Cutting Processes; Manual Machining Processes; and Computerized Numeric Control (CNC) Machining Operations.
* [[Aerospace Composities|Aerospace Composites]] - A single Concentration examination in four basic areas: Characteristics of Composites; Fabrication Methods; Testing, Inspection, and Repair; and Health and Safety.
* [[Aerospace Vehicle Processing]] - a single Concentration examination in five disciplines: Aerospace Systems; Electronic Fabrication and Fiber Optics; Fluid Systems; Structural Fabrication; and Technical Task Analysis.

Usually candidates for aerospace certification must qualify through a combination of experience and education, meeting at least one of the following criteria:
* A two-year college technical program degree.
* A two-year technical military assignment in a related field.
* A current FAA Airframe/powerplant certificate.
* Two or more years of on-the-job training and experience in the Aerospace industry.
Specialized Concentration exams for journeyman credentials require a Core Certification.

=== Architecture ===
*AIA ([[Member, American Institute of Architects]]) conferred by [[American Institute of Architects]]

* iBACP, [[iBooks Author]] Certified Professional, awarded by Score Publishing, a publishing house based in Nashville, Tennessee.

=== Aviation ===
[[Aviators]] are certified through theoretical and in-flight examinations. Requirements for certifications are quite equal in most countries and are regulated by each National Aviation Authority. The existing certificates or pilot licenses are:
* SPL (Sport Pilot License)conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]])
* [[Private Pilot License|PPL]] (Private Pilot License) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])
* CPL ([[Commercial Pilot Licence]]) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])
* ATP ([[Airline Transport Pilot License|Airline Transport Pilot]]) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])

Licensing in these categories require not only examinations but also a minimum of flight hours. All categories are available for Fixed-Wing Aircraft ([[airplane]]s) and Rotatory-Wing Aircraft ([[helicopter]]s). Within each category, aviators may also obtain certifications in:
*Instrument Flight Rules ([[Instrument flight rules|IFR]])
*[[:Category:Multi-engine aircraft|Multi-engine aircraft]]
*[[Turbojet]] Engines
*[[Jet Engine]]s
*[[Experimental aircraft]]
*[[Amphibious aircraft]]
*[[Seaplane]]s
Usually, aviators must be certified also in their log books for the type and model of aircraft they are allowed to fly. Currency checks as well as regular medical check-ups with a frequency of 6 months, 12 months, or 36 months, depending on the type of flying permitted, are obligatory. An aviator can fly only if holding:
*A valid pilot license
*A valid medical certificate
*Valid certifications for the type of aircraft and type of flight.

In [[Europe]], the [[Air Navigation Service Provider|ANSP]], [[Air traffic controller|ATCO]] & ANSP technicians are certified according to [[EUROCONTROL Safety Regulatory Requirement|ESARR]]s [http://www.eurocontrol.int/src/public/standard_page/src_deliverables.html] (according to [[European Union|EU]] regulation 2096/2005 "Common Requirements").

=== Warehousing management ===
A warehouse management system (WMS) is a key part of the supply chain and primarily aims to control the movement and storage of materials within a warehouse and process the associated transactions, including shipping, receiving, putaway and picking. The systems also direct and optimize stock putaway based on real-time information about the status of bin utilization. A WMS monitors the progress of products through the warehouse. It involves the physical warehouse infrastructure, tracking systems, and communication between product stations.

More precisely, warehouse management involves the receipt, storage and movement of goods, (normally finished goods), to intermediate storage locations or to a final customer. In the multi-echelon model for distribution, there may be multiple levels of warehouses. This includes a central warehouse, a regional warehouses (serviced by the central warehouse) and potentially retail warehouses (serviced by the regional warehouses).

=== Insurance and risk management ===

=== Language education ===
[[English language learning and teaching|TESOL]] is a large field of employment with widely varying degrees of regulation. Most provision worldwide is through the [[state school]] system of each individual country, and as such, the instructors tend to be trained primary- or [[secondary school]] teachers who are [[native speakers]] of the language of their pupils, and not of English. Though native speakers of English have been working in non-English speaking countries [[TEFL|in this capacity]] for years, it was not until the last twenty-five years or so that there was any widespread focus on training particularly for this field. Previously, workers in this sort of job were anyone from [[backpacking (travel)|backpacker]]s hoping to earn some extra travel money to well-educated professionals in other fields doing [[volunteer]] work, or retired people. These sort of people are certainly still to be found, but there are many who consider TESOL their main profession.

One of the problems facing these full-time teachers is the absence of international governing body for the certification or licenture of English language teachers. However, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and its subsidiary body [[UCLES]] are pioneers in trying to get some degree of accountability and quality control to consumers of English courses, through their [[CELTA]] and [[DELTA (ELT)|DELTA]] programs. [[Trinity College London]] has equivalent programs, the [[CertTESOL]] and the [[LTCL DipTESOL]]. They offer initial certificates in teaching, in which candidates are trained in [[language]] awareness and [[classroom]] techniques, and given a chance to practice teaching, after which feedback is reported. Both institutions have as a follow-up a professional diploma, usually taken after a year or two in the field. Although the initial certificate is available to anyone with a high school education, the diploma is meant to be a post-graduate qualification and in fact can be incorporated into a master's degree program.

=== Legal affairs ===
An increasing number of [[lawyer]]s are choosing to be recognized as having special knowledge and experience by becoming certified specialists in certain fields of law. According to the [[American Bar Association]], a lawyer that is a certified specialist has been recognized by an independent professional certifying organization as having an enhanced level of skill and expertise, as well as substantial involvement in an established legal specialty. These organizations require a lawyer to demonstrate special training, experience and knowledge to ensure that the lawyer's recognition as a certified specialist is meaningful and reliable. Lawyer conduct with regard to specialty certification is regulated by the states.

NBLSC is an American Bar Association (ABA) accredited organization providing Board Certification for US Lawyers. Board Certification is a rigorous testing and approval process that officially recognizes the extensive education and courtroom experience of attorneys. NBLSC provides Board Certification for Trial Lawyers & Trial Attorneys, Civil Lawyers, Criminal Lawyers, Family Lawyers and Social Security Disability Lawyers.

=== Medicine ===
{{Main|Medical credentials}}
[[Board certification]] is the process by which a physician in the United States documents by written, practical or computer based testing, illustrating a mastery of knowledge and skills that define a particular area of medical specialization. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]], a not-for-profit organization, assists 24 approved medical specialty boards in the development and use of standards in the ongoing evaluation and certification of physicians.

Medical specialty certification in the United States is a voluntary process. While medical licensure sets the minimum competency requirements to diagnose and treat patients, it is not specialty specific.<ref>[http://www.abms.org/about_board_certification/means.aspx What Board Certification Means]. Abms.org. Retrieved on 2013-10-05.</ref> Board certification demonstrates a physician’s exceptional expertise in a particular specialty or sub-specialty of medical practice.

Patients, physicians, health care providers, insurers and quality organizations regard certification as an important measure of a physician’s knowledge, experience and skills to provide quality health care within a given specialty.

Other professional certifications include certifications such as [[medical license]]s, [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians]], [[nursing board certification]], diplomas in [[social work]]. The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists that are knowledgeable about principles of geriatric pharmacotherapy and the provision of pharmaceutical care to the elderly. The [[Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies]] administers a voluntary accreditation program for [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]].  Additional certifying bodies relating to the medical field include:

*[[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists]]
*[[American College of Emergency Physicians]]
*[[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]]
*[[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons]]
*[[Membership of the College of Emergency Medicine]]

Interconnected or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses are involved in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain.[2] Supply chain management has been defined as the "design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronizing supply with demand and measuring performance globally.

SCM draws heavily from the areas of operations management, logistics, procurement, and information technology, and strives for an integrated approach.

== Criticisms ==
Many political commentators, often criticize professional or [[occupational licensing]], especially medical and legal licensing, for restricting the supply of services and therefore making them more expensive, often putting them out of reach of poor people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/business/for-law-schools-a-price-to-play-the-abas-way.html?_r=2&sq=law%20the%20a.b.a.%20way&st=cse&scp=1&pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=David | last=Segal | title=For Law Schools, a Price to Play the A.B.A.'s Way | date=17 December 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://reason.com/blog/2010/09/17/professional-licensing-watch-l Professional Licensing Watch, Liberal Division - Hit & Run].

;Computer technologies
The current proliferation of IT certifications (both offered and attained){{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}, like the [[Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik|FSI]]'s [[IT baseline protection]] certification, has led some technologists to question their value. Proprietary content that has been distributed on the Internet allows some to gain credentials without the implied depth or breadth of expertise. Certifying agencies have responded in various ways: Some now incorporate hands-on elements, anti-cheating methodologies or have expanded their content. Others have expired and restructured their certificate programs or raised their fees to deter abuse.

Certification programs that take into account length of service and demonstrated experience via industry peer and employer recommendation avoid some of the issues associated with purely passing an examination; however, certification remains a contentious issue.

Also, some professional certifications require a criminal record check for the certification to be approved. The presence of a criminal history when applying for certification may be grounds for denial of certification.
