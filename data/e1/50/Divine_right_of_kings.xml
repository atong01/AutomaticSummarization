In the Scriptures kings are called gods, and so their power after a certain relation compared to the Divine power. Kings are also compared to fathers of families; for a king is truly parens patriae [parent of the country], the politic father of his people.

The divine right of kings, or divine-right theory of kingship, is a political and religious doctrine of royal and political legitimacy. It asserts that a monarch is subject to no earthly authority, deriving his right to rule directly from the will of God. The king is thus not subject to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or any other estate of the realm, including (in the view of some, especially in Protestant countries) the church. A weaker or more moderate form of this political theory does hold, however, that the king is subject to the church and the pope, although completely irreproachable in other ways; but according to this doctrine in its strong form, only God can judge an unjust king. The doctrine implies that any attempt to depose the king or to restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute a sacrilegious act.</paragraph><paragraph>One passage in scripture supporting the idea of divine right of kings was<space/><link><target>s:Bible (King James)/Romans#Chapter 13</target><part>Romans 13</part></link>.<space/><link><target>Martin Luther</target></link>, when urging the secular authorities to crush the<space/><link><target>German Peasants' War</target><part>Peasant Rebellion of 1525</part></link><space/>in Germany in his<space/><italics><link><target>Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants</target></link></italics>, based his argument on St. Paul's Epistle to the<space/><template><target>bibleverse</target><arg></arg><arg>Romans</arg><arg>13:1â€“7</arg><arg>NKJV</arg></template>.</paragraph><paragraph>It is related to the ancient Catholic philosophies regarding monarchy, in which the monarch is God's<space/><link><target>vicegerent</target></link><space/>upon the earth and therefore subject to no inferior power.

The only human power capable of deposing the king was the pope. The reasoning was that if a subject may overthrow his superior for some bad law, who was to be the judge of whether the law was bad? If the subject could so judge his own superior, then all lawful superior authority could lawfully be overthrown by the arbitrary judgement of an inferior, and thus all law was under constant threat.
