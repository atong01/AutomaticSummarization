==History==
[[File:2014 Barnard College Barnard Hall entrance facade.jpg|left||thumb|237px|The entrance to Barnard Hall]]

[[Columbia College, Columbia University]] admitted only men for undergraduate study for 229 years.<ref name=farmer20080825>{{cite web|last1=Farmer|first1=Melanie|title=College Marks 25 years of Coeducation|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/record/coeducation.html|website=The Record|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> Barnard College was founded to provide an undergraduate [[Female education|education for women]] comparable to that of Columbia and other [[Ivy League]] schools. The college was named after [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard]], an American educator and mathematician, who served as the tenth president of Columbia from 1864 to 1889. He advocated equal educational privileges for men and women, preferably in a coeducational setting, and began proposing in 1879 that Columbia admit women.{{r|jstor368780}}

The board of trustees repeatedly rejected Barnard's suggestion,{{r|jstor368780}} but in 1883 agreed to create a detailed syllabus of study for women. While they could not attend Columbia classes, those who passed examinations based on the syllabus would receive a degree. The first such woman graduate received her bachelor's degree in 1887. A former student of the program, [[Annie Nathan Meyer]],{{r|rosenberg}} and other prominent New York women persuaded the board in 1889 to create a women's college connected to Columbia.<ref name="jstor368780">{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/368780 | title=Social and Cultural Stratification in Women's Higher Education: Barnard College and Teachers College, 1898-1912 | author=Weneck, Bette | journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=Spring 1991 | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=1–25 | jstor=368780}}</ref>

Barnard College's original 1889 home was a rented [[brownstone]] at 343 Madison Avenue, where a faculty of six offered instruction to 14 students in the School of Arts, as well as to 22 "specials", who lacked the entrance requirements in Greek and so enrolled in science. When Columbia University announced in 1892 its impending move to Morningside Heights, Barnard built a new campus on 119th-120th Streets with gifts from Mary E. Brinckerhoff, [[Elizabeth Milbank Anderson]] and Martha T. Fiske. [[Milbank, Brinckerhoff, and Fiske Halls]], built in 1897–1898, were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2003.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref>

[[Ella Weed]] supervised the college in its first four years; [[Emily James Smith Putnam|Emily James Smith]] succeeded her as Barnard's first dean.{{r|jstor368780}} As the college grew it needed additional space, and in 1903 it received the three blocks south of 119th Street from Anderson who had purchased a former portion of the Bloomingdale Asylum site from the New York Hospital.<ref>Plimpton Papers, Barnard College Archives</ref> By the mid-20th century Barnard had succeeded in its original goal of providing an elite education to women. Between 1920 and 1974, only the much larger [[Hunter College]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]] produced more women graduates who later received doctorate degrees.{{r|zimmerman20120314}}

[[Students' Hall]], now known as Barnard Hall, was built in 1916. [[Brooks and Hewitt Halls]] were built in 1906–1907 and 1926–1927, respectively.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny">{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10059|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Brooks and Hewitt Halls|date=June 2003|accessdate=2011-03-19 |author=Kathleen A.

The affiliation permits the two schools to share some academic resources; for example, only Barnard has an [[urban studies]] department, and only Columbia has a [[computer science]] department. Most Columbia classes are open to Barnard students and vice versa. Barnard students and faculty are represented in the University Senate, and student organizations such as the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'' are open to all students.

===Academic ranking===
{{details|Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)}}

In the 2014 U.S. News & World Report rankings, Barnard was ranked as the 32nd best liberal arts college in the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best Liberal Arts College|website=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/barnard-college-2708|accessdate=2014-08-16}}</ref> The ranking came under widespread criticism, as it only accounted for institution-specific resources. Greg Brown, chief operating officer at Barnard, said, "I believe that our ranking is lower than it should be, primarily because the methodology simply can't account for the Barnard-Columbia relationship. Because the Columbia relationship doesn't fit neatly into any of the survey categories, it is essentially ignored. Rankings are inherently limited in this way."

In 1998, then president [[Judith Shapiro]] compared the ranking service to the "equivalent of ''Sport's Illustrated''{{'s}} swimsuit issue." According to Shapiro's letter, "Such a ranking system certainly does more harm than good in terms of educating the public." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnard.edu/president/usnews.html|title=US News|publisher=bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}</ref> On June 19, 2007, following a meeting of the [[Annapolis Group]], which represents over 100 liberal arts colleges, Barnard announced that it would no longer participate in the U.S. News annual survey, and that they would fashion their own way to collect and report common data.<ref>{{cite news | first =Marty | last =Kaplan | title =Reaming College Rankings| work = [[The Huffington Post]] | date = June 20, 2007 | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marty-kaplan/reaming-college-rankings_b_52995.html }}</ref>

==Barnard Library==

It also houses an archival collection of official and student publications, photographs, letters, alumnae scrapbooks and other material that documents Barnard's history from its founding in 1889 to the present day. Among the special collections are the Overbury Collection and a small collection of other rare books. The Overbury Collection consists of 3,300 items, including special and first edition books as well as manuscript materials by and about American women authors. Alumnae Books is a collection of books donated by Barnard alumnae authors. Conflicting accounts list either Richard B. Snow or Philip M.

===Zine Collection===
Birthed from a proposal by longtime zinester Jenna Freedman, Barnard collects [[zine]]s in an effort to document [[third-wave feminism]] and [[Riot Grrrl]] culture. The Zine Collection complements Barnard's [[women's studies]] research holdings, giving room to voices of girls and women otherwise under or not at all represented in the book stacks. According to its [[library collection development]] policy, "Barnard's zines are written by women (cis- and transgender) with an emphasis on zines by women of color. We collect zines on feminism and femme identity by people of all genders. The zines are personal and political publications on [[activism]], [[anarchism]], [[body image]], third wave feminism, [[gender]], [[parenting]], queer community, riot grrrl, [[sexual assault]], trans experience, and other topics."<ref>[http://zines.barnard.edu/about-zines-at-barnard Barnard Zine Library]. Retrieved May 17, 2015.</ref>

Barnard's collection documents movements and trends in [[Feminism|feminist]] thought through the personal work of artists, writers, and activists. Currently, the Barnard Zine Collection has approximately 7,000 items, including zines about [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], gender, [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[childbirth]], [[mother]]hood, [[politics]], and [[Intimate relationship|relationships]]. Barnard attempts to collect two copies of each zine, one of which circulates with the second copy archived for [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]]. To facilitate [[library circulation|circulation]], Barnard zines are [[Library catalog|cataloged]] in CLIO (the Columbia/Barnard [[Online public access catalog|OPAC]]) and [[Online Computer Library Center|OCLC]]'s [[WorldCat|Worldcat]].

==Culture and student life==
[[Image:Barnard College Greek Games statue IMG 0972.JPG|right|thumb|275px|Barnard College Greek Games statue]]

===Student organizations===
Every Barnard student is part of the [[Students' union|Student Government Association]] (SGA), which elects a representative [[Student governments in the United States|student government]]. SGA aims to facilitate the expression of opinions on matters that directly affect the Barnard community. Members of the Executive Board and the Representative Council of SGA promote these goals through active communication between students, faculty, and administration. The Executive Board includes the President of SGA, Vice President, Vice President for Campus Life, Vice President for Communications,and Vice President of Finance. Members of the Representative Council include the Senior Representative to the Board of Trustees, Junior Representative to the Board of Trustees, University Senator, Representative for Campus Policy, Representative for Academic Affairs, Representative for Diversity, Representative for Student Services, Representative for Student Interests, Representative for College Relations, Representative for Arts and Culture, Representative for Campus Affairs, and Representative for Information and Technology. In addition to these members the President and Vice President of each Class Council also sit on the Representative Council.

Student groups include [[theatre]] and vocal music groups, language clubs, [[literary magazines]], a freeform radio station called [[WBAR]], a biweekly magazine called the ''Barnard Bulletin'', community service groups, and others. Barnard students can also join [[Extracurricular activity|extracurricular activities]] or organizations at Columbia University, while Columbia University students are allowed in most, but not all, Barnard organizations.

Barnard's McIntosh Activities Council (commonly known as McAC), named after the first President of Barnard, Millicent McIntosh, organizes various community focused events on campus, such as Big Sub and [[Midnight breakfast|Midnight Breakfast]]. McAC is made up of five sub-committees which are the Mosaic committee (formerly known as Multicultural), the Wellness committee, the Network committee, the Community committee, and the Action committee. Each committee has a different focus, such as hosting and publicizing identity and cultural events (Mosaic), having health and wellness related events (Wellness), giving students opportunities to be involved with Alumnae and various professionals (Network), planning events that bring the entire student body together (Community), and planning community service events that give back to the surrounding community (Action).

In 2011, Barnard's SGA and McAC will work together to bring back the Greek Games, an old but quite famous Barnard tradition.{{update after|2011}}

Barnard College officially banned sororities in 1913,<ref>[http://barnardarchives.wordpress.com/tag/sororities/ Sororities | Barnard College Archives]. Barnardarchives.wordpress.com (2010-09-30). Retrieved on 2013-09-07.</ref> but Barnard students continue to participate in Columbia's five National Panhellenic Conference sororities—[[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], and [[Sigma Delta Tau]]—and the National Pan-Hellenic Council Sororities- [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] (Lambda chapter) and [[Delta Sigma Theta]] (Rho chapter) as well as other sororities in the Multicultural Greek Council. Two [[National Panhellenic Conference]] organizations were founded at Barnard College. The [[Alpha Omicron Pi]] Fraternity, founded on January 2, 1897, left campus during the 1913 ban but returned to establish its Alpha chapter in 2013. The [[Alpha Epsilon Phi]], founded on October 24, 1909, is no longer on campus.  As of 2010, Barnard does not fully recognize the National Panhellenic Conference sororities at Columbia, but it does provide some funding to account for Barnard students living in Columbia housing through these organizations.<ref>[http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/04/27/barnard-funding-sororities-not-recognition Barnard funding for sororities, but not recognition | Columbia Daily Spectator].

This annual event grew out of a 1988 [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] conference. The march has grown from under 200 participants in 1988 to more than 2,500 in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nicholas Bergson-Shilcock |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/tbtn/ |title=Take Back the Night |publisher=Columbia.edu |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}</ref>
*WBAR-B-Q, a free and all-day music festival takes place on Lehman Lawn each April. It is put on by Barnard's student-run [[Freeform (radio format)|freeform]] radio station, [[WBAR]].
*[[Midnight breakfast|Midnight Breakfast]] marks the beginning of finals week. As a highly popular event and long-standing college tradition, Midnight Breakfast is hosted by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council). In addition to providing standard breakfast foods, each year's theme is also incorporated into the menu. Past themes have included "I YUMM the 90s," "Grease," and "Take me out to the ballgame." The event is a school-wide affair as college deans, trustees and the President, [[Debora Spar]], serve food to about a thousand students. It takes place the night before finals begin every semester.
*On Spirit Day, there is a large barbecue, the deans serve [[ice cream]] to students, different activities are hosted, and the whole student body celebrates. The school sells "I Love BC" T-shirts, and gives out free Barnard products. The event is run by the Spirit Day Planning Committee which is chaired by the Programming Officer of the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council) and the Representative for Community Affairs of the Student Government Association (SGA).
*During the fall semester, students help to construct and then [[Eating|consume]] a [[sandwich]] {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} long known as "The big sub". Every year another foot is added onto the sub as it stretches across campus. The event is organized by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council).
*In the spring of each year, Barnard holds the Night Carnival, in which many of Barnard's student groups set up tables with games and prizes. The event is organized by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council).
* At the end of the Fall semester, the Columbia Marching Band plays in the Barnard Quad on the last night of reading week (traditionally known as "Orgo night" because it is the night before the Organic Chemistry final is given). Students traditionally open their windows and throw out all the old papers from the semester that they no longer need.

===Athletics===
Barnard athletes compete in the [[Ivy League]] ([[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]) through the Columbia/Barnard Athletic Consortium, which was established in 1983. Through this arrangement, Barnard is the only [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]] offering Division I athletics.<ref name="athletics">[http://www.barnard.edu/admissions/campus/athletics Athletics]</ref> There are 15 [[College athletics|intercollegiate teams]], and students also compete at the [[Intramural sports|intramural]] and club levels.

From 1975–1983, before the establishment of the Columbia/Barnard Athletic Consortium, Barnard students competed as the "Barnard Bears".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/barnard/docs/magazine-spring09/6 |title=magazine-spring09/6 |publisher=Issuu.com |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}</ref> Prior to 1975, students referred to themselves as the "Barnard honeybears".

===Seven Sisters—student collaborations===
Established within the Barnard Student Government Association (SGA), The Seven Sisters Governing Board represents Barnard College as part of the Seven Sisters Coalition, which is a group of representatives from student councils of the historic Seven Sisters colleges. The reps on the coordinating board of Seven Sisters Coalition are rotating every year to hold the annual Seven Sisters Conference in a serious but informal setting. The first Seven Sisters Conference was hosted by SGA student representatives at Barnard College in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Seven Sisters Student Coalition|title=Leadership Conference |url=https://sites.google.com/site/sevensistersstudents/volunteer-information/volunteer-dispatch |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>  In fall 2013, the conference was hosted by Vassar college during the first weekend of November. The major topic focused on inner college collaborations and differences in student government structures among Seven Sisters Colleges. The Seven Sisters Coordinating Board of Barnard brought six Barnard student representatives to attend the Fall Semester conference, which was hosted at Vassar College in the past fall semester. Based on the Coalition Coordinating Board Constitution<ref>{{cite web|last=Seven Sisters Coalition|title=Coalition Coordinating Board Constitution|url=https://sites.google.com/site/sevensistersstudents/in-the-community/inaugural-spring-summit|accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>  established in February 2013, Students delegates were initiating projects in the aspects of public relations,alumni outreach and website management to promote the presence and development of the seven sisters culture. Meanwhile, The Barnard delegates engaged in discussions about the various structures of the student governments among the historic seven sisters colleges.

==Sustainability==
Barnard College has issued a statement affirming its commitment to [[Sustainability|environmental sustainability]], a major part of which is the goal of reducing its [[greenhouse gas]] emissions by 30% by 2017.<ref name="Sustainability At Barnard">{{cite web| title =Sustainability At Barnard| publisher =Barnard College| url =http://www.barnard.edu/green/index.html| accessdate = 2009-06-08 | archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090427201010/http://www.barnard.edu/green/index.html| archivedate= April 27, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="Sustainability - Barnard Growing Greener">{{cite web| title =Sustainability - Barnard Growing Greener| publisher =Barnard College| url =http://www.barnard.edu/green/planyc.html| accessdate = 2009-06-08 }}</ref> Student EcoReps work as a resource on environmental issues for students in Barnard's residence halls, while the student-run Earth Coalition works on outreach initiatives such as local park clean-ups, tutoring elementary school students in environmental education, and sponsoring environmental forums.<ref name="Groups and Organizations - The Earth Institute at Columbia">{{cite web| title =Groups and Organizations - The Earth Institute at Columbia| publisher =Columbia University| url =http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/31| accessdate = 2009-06-08 }}</ref> Barnard earned a "C-" for its sustainability efforts on the [[Campus Carbon Neutrality#Sustainable Endowments Institute & the College Sustainability Report Card|College Sustainability Report Card]] 2009 published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Its highest marks were in Student Involvement and Food and Recycling, receiving a "B" in both categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2009/schools/barnard-college |title=Greenreportcard.org |publisher=Greenreportcard.org |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}</ref>

== Liberal arts requirements ==
The liberal arts requirements are called the '''Nine Ways of Knowing'''. Students must take one year of one laboratory science, study a single foreign language for four semesters, and complete one 3-credit course in each of the following categories: reason and value, social analysis, historical studies, cultures in comparison, quantitative and deductive reasoning, literature, and visual and performing arts. The use of AP or IB credit to fulfill these requirements is very limited, but Nine Ways of Knowing courses may overlap with major or minor requirements. In addition to the Nine Ways of Knowing, students must complete a first-year seminar, a first-year English course, and one semester of physical education.

==Controversies==
In the spring of 1960 Columbia University president Grayson Kirk complained to the president of Barnard that Barnard students were wearing inappropriate clothing. The garments in question were pants and Bermuda shorts. The administration forced the student council to institute a dress code. Students would be allowed to wear shorts and pants only at Barnard and only if the shorts were no more than two inches above the knee and the pants were not tight. Barnard women crossing the street to enter the Columbia campus wearing shorts or pants were required to cover themselves with a long coat similar to a [[jilbab]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Ban on Shorts Threatens Classic Barnard Couture |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A15F73F5916738DDDA10A94DC405B808AF1D3 |work=The New York Times |page=1 |date=April 28, 1960 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Barnard College Blue Book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=87–88|chapter=Administrative Regulations: Campus Etiquette}}</ref>

In March 1968, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article on students who cohabited, identifying one of the persons they interviewed as a student at Barnard College from New Hampshire named "Susan".<ref>{{Cite news

She was called before Barnard's student-faculty administration judicial committee, where she faced the possibility of expulsion. A student protest included a petition signed by 300 other Barnard women, admitting that they too had broken the regulations against cohabitating. The judicial committee reached a compromise and the student was allowed to remain in school, but was denied use of the college cafeteria and barred from all social activities. The student briefly became a focus of intense national attention. She eventually dropped out of Barnard.<ref>''Newsweek'', April 8, 1968, p. 85 and ''Newsweek'', April 29, 1968, p. 79-80.</ref><ref name="rosenberg">{{cite web
