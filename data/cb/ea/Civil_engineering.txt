==History of the civil engineering profession==
{{See also|History of structural engineering}}

[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonhard Euler]] developed the theory explaining the [[buckling]] of columns]]

Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], and [[Mesopotamia]] (Ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a [[nomad]]ic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and [[Maritime history|sailing]].

Until modern times there was no clear distinction between civil engineering and architecture, and the term engineer and architect were mainly geographical variations referring to the same occupation, and often used interchangeably.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC&q=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&dq=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&pgis=1 ''The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance''] Jacob Burckhardt ISBN 0-8052-1082-2</ref> The construction of [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in Egypt (circa 2700–2500 BC) were some of the first instances of large structure constructions. Other ancient historic civil engineering constructions include the [[Qanat]] water management system (the oldest is older than 3000 years and longer than 71&nbsp;km,<ref>p. 4 of {{Cite book | publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-90-481-8631-0| last = Mays| first = L.| title = Ancient Water Technologies| date = 30 August 2010}}</ref>) the [[Parthenon]] by [[Iktinos]] in [[Ancient Greece]] (447–438 BC), the [[Appian Way]] by [[Roman engineering|Roman engineers]] (c. 312 BC), the [[Great Wall of China]] by General [[Meng Tian|Meng T'ien]] under orders from Ch'in Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang|Shih Huang Ti]] (c. 220 BC)<ref name="Oakes"/> and the stupas constructed in ancient [[Sri Lanka]] like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] and the extensive irrigation works in [[Anuradhapura]]. The Romans developed civil structures throughout their empire, including especially [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[insulae]], harbors, bridges, dams and roads.

[[Image:John Smeaton.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[John Smeaton]], the "father of civil engineering"]]
In the 18th century, the term civil engineering was coined to incorporate all things civilian as opposed to military engineering.<ref name=eb/> The first self-proclaimed civil engineer was [[John Smeaton]], who constructed the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]].<ref name=CSCE/><ref name="Oakes"/> In 1771 Smeaton and some of his colleagues formed the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, a group of leaders of the profession who met informally over dinner. Though there was evidence of some technical meetings, it was little more than a social society.

In 1818 the Institution of Civil Engineers was founded in London, and in 1820 the eminent engineer [[Thomas Telford]] became its first president. The institution received a Royal Charter in 1828, formally recognising civil engineering as a profession. Its charter defined civil engineering as:
{{quote|the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man, as the means of production and of traffic in states, both for external and internal trade, as applied in the construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation and docks for internal intercourse and exchange, and in the construction of ports, harbours, moles, breakwaters and lighthouses, and in the art of navigation by artificial power for the purposes of commerce, and in the construction and application of machinery, and in the drainage of cities and towns.<ref name=ICE>{{cite web | url=http://www.ice.org.uk| title=Institution of Civil Engineers' website| accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>}}

===History of civil engineering education===
The first private college to teach civil engineering in the United States was [[Norwich University]], founded in 1819 by Captain Alden Partridge.<ref>[http://www.norwich.edu/about/legacy.html "Norwich University Legacy Website"]</ref> The first degree in civil engineering in the United States was awarded by [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1835.<ref>Griggs, Francis E Jr. "Amos Eaton was Right!". ''Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice'', Vol. 123, No. 1, January 1997, pp. 30–34.</ref><ref>[http://www.lib.rpi.edu/Archives/timeline/all_time/index.html RPI Timeline]</ref> The first such degree to be awarded to a woman was granted by [[Cornell University]] to [[Nora Stanton Blatch]] in 1905.<ref name=EB>{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9124919/Nora-Stanton-Blatch-Barney | accessdate=8 October 2010 | title=Nora Stanton Blatch Barney | work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online }}</ref>

In the UK during the early 19th century, the division between civil engineering and military engineering (served by the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]), coupled with the demands of the Industrial Revolution, spawned new engineering education initiatives: the [[University of Westminster|Royal Polytechnic Institution]] was founded in 1838, the private [[College for Civil Engineers]] in [[Putney]] was established in 1839, and the UK's first Chair of Engineering was established at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1840.

Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is intricately linked to advances in understanding of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] throughout history. Because civil engineering is a wide ranging profession, including several separate specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, geography, geology, [[soil]]s, [[hydrology]], [[Environmental science|environment]], [[mechanics]] and other fields.

Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s, such as [[masonry|stonemasons]] and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of [[Architect|master builder]]. Knowledge was retained in [[guilds]] and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures, roads and infrastructure that existed were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.<ref name=Saouma>{{cite web | url=http://ceae.colorado.edu/~saouma/Lecture-Notes/se.pdf| title=Lecture notes in Structural Engineering| author=Victor E. Saouma| publisher=University of Colorado| accessdate=2 November 2007}}</ref>

One of the earliest examples of a scientific approach to physical and mathematical problems applicable to civil engineering is the work of [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC, including Archimedes Principle, which underpins our understanding of [[buoyancy]], and practical solutions such as [[Archimedes' screw]]. [[Brahmagupta]], an Indian mathematician, used arithmetic in the 7th century AD, based on Hindu-Arabic numerals, for excavation (volume) computations.<ref>Henry Thomas Colebrook, [http://books.google.com/books?id=A3cAAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=brahmagupta ''Algebra: with Arithmetic and mensuration''] (London 1817)</ref>

===Education and licensure===
{{Main|Civil engineer}}
[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Surveying students with professor at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in the late 19th century.]]

''Civil engineers'' typically possess an [[academic degree]] in civil engineering. The length of study is three to five years, and the completed degree is designated as a [[bachelor of engineering]], or a [[bachelor of science]]. The curriculum generally includes classes in physics, mathematics, [[project management]], design and specific topics in civil engineering. After taking basic courses in most sub-disciplines of civil engineering, they move onto specialize in one or more sub-disciplines at advanced levels. While an undergraduate degree (BEng/BSc) normally provides successful students with industry-accredited qualification, some academic institutions offer post-graduate degrees (MEng/MSc), which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest.<ref name="CITE Postgrad">,{{cite web | url= http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm| title= Cite Postgrad}}</ref>

In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]], and a [[professional body]] certifies the degree program. After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience and exam requirements) before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated as a professional engineer (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), a [[chartered engineer]] (in most [[Commonwealth]] countries), a chartered professional engineer (in Australia and [[New Zealand]]), or a European engineer (in most countries of the [[European Union]]). There are international agreements between relevant professional bodies to allow engineers to practice across national borders.

The benefits of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada, "only a licensed [[professional engineer]] may prepare, sign and seal, and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or seal engineering work for public and private clients."<ref>{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate = 11 August 2007 }}</ref> This requirement is enforced under provincial law such as the Engineers Act in [[Quebec]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | accessdate = 11 August 2007 }}</ref>

No such legislation has been enacted in other countries including the United Kingdom. In Australia, state licensing of engineers is limited to the state of [[Queensland]]. Almost all certifying bodies maintain a [[code of ethics]] which all members must abide by.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ethics Codes and Guidelines | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessdate = 11 August 2007 }}</ref>

Engineers must obey [[contract law]] in their contractual relationships with other parties. In cases where an engineer's work fails, he may be subject to the law of [[negligence|tort of negligence]], and in extreme cases, criminal charges.<ref>{{cite web | title = Singapore's Circle Line criminal trial started | work = New Civil Engineer | url = http://www.nce.co.uk/singapores-circle-line-criminal-trial-started/530302.article | accessdate = 16 November 2013 }}</ref> An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as [[building codes]] and [[environmental law]].

==Sub-disciplines==
[[Image:Akashi-kaikyo bridge3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]] in Japan, currently the world's longest suspension span.]]
In general, civil engineering is concerned with the overall interface of human created fixed projects with the greater world. General civil engineers work closely with surveyors and specialized civil engineers to design grading, drainage, [[Pavement (material)|pavement]], water supply, sewer service,dams, electric and communications supply. General civil engineering is also referred to as site engineering, a branch of civil engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage to another. Site engineers spend time visiting project sites, meeting with stakeholders, and preparing construction plans. Civil engineers apply the principles of geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering and construction engineering to residential, commercial, industrial and public works projects of all sizes and levels of construction.

===Materials science and engineering===
{{Main|Materials science}}
''Materials science'' is closely related to civil engineering. It studies fundamental characteristics of materials, and deals with ceramics such as concrete and mix asphalt concrete, strong metals such as aluminum and steel, and polymers including [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) and carbon fibers.

''Materials engineering'' involves protection and prevention (paints and finishes). Alloying combines two types of metals to produce another metal with desired properties. It incorporates elements of [[applied physics]] and [[chemistry]]. With recent media attention on [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]], materials engineering has been at the forefront of academic research. It is also an important part of forensic engineering and [[failure analysis]].

===Coastal engineering===
{{Main|Coastal engineering|Coastal management}}
[[File:Oosterscheldekering, Netherlands.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Oosterscheldekering]], a [[storm surge barrier]] in the Netherlands.]]
''Coastal engineering'' is concerned with managing coastal areas. In some jurisdictions, the terms sea defense and coastal protection mean defense against flooding and erosion, respectively. The term coastal defense is the more traditional term, but coastal management has become more popular as the field has expanded to techniques that allow erosion to claim land.

===Construction engineering===
{{Main|Construction engineering}}
''Construction engineering'' involves planning and execution, transportation of materials, site development based on hydraulic, environmental, structural and geotechnical engineering. As construction firms tend to have higher business risk than other types of civil engineering firms do, construction engineers often engage in more business-like transactions, for example, drafting and reviewing contracts, evaluating [[Logistics|logistical operations]], and monitoring prices of supplies.

===Earthquake engineering===
{{Main|Earthquake engineering}}
''Earthquake engineering'' involves designing structures to withstand hazardous earthquake exposures. Earthquake engineering is a sub-discipline of structural engineering. The main objectives of earthquake engineering are<ref>Chen W-F, Scawthorn C. Earthquake Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2003, ISBN 0-8493-0068-1, Chapter 2</ref> to understand interaction of structures on the shaky ground; foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes; and design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake in compliance with [[building code]]s.

===Environmental engineering===
{{Main|Environmental engineering}}
[[Image:Water pollution.jpg|right|thumbnail|left|250px|Water pollution]]
''Environmental engineering'' is the contemporary term for [[sanitary engineering]], though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included much of the hazardous waste management and environmental remediation work covered by environmental engineering. Public health engineering and environmental health engineering are other terms being used.

Environmental engineering deals with treatment of chemical, biological, or thermal wastes, purification of water and air, and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated sites after waste disposal or accidental contamination. Among the topics covered by environmental engineering are pollutant transport, [[water purification]], [[waste water treatment]], air pollution, [[Waste management|solid waste treatment]], and [[hazardous waste|hazardous waste management]]. Environmental engineers administer pollution reduction, green engineering, and [[industrial ecology]]. Environmental engineers also compile information on environmental consequences of proposed actions.

===Geotechnical engineering===
{{Main|Geotechnical engineering}}
[[File:Soil-phase-diagram.svg|thumb|A phase diagram of soil indicating the weights and volumes of air, soil, water, and voids.]]
''Geotechnical engineering'' studies rock and soil supporting civil engineering systems. Knowledge from the field of [[soil science]], materials science, [[mechanics]], and [[hydraulics]] is applied to safely and economically design [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], [[retaining wall]]s, and other structures. Environmental efforts to protect [[groundwater]] and safely maintain landfills have spawned a new area of research called geoenvironmental engineering.<ref name="mitchell">Mitchell, James Kenneth (1993), Fundamentals of Soil Behavior (2nd ed.), John Wiley and Sons, pp 1–2</ref><ref>Shroff, Arvind V.; Shah, Dhananjay L. (2003), Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Taylor & Francis, 2003, pp 1–2</ref>

Identification of soil properties presents challenges to geotechnical engineers. [[Boundary condition]]s are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering, but unlike steel or concrete, the material properties and behavior of soil are difficult to predict due to its variability and limitation on [[geotechnical investigation|investigation]]. Furthermore, soil exhibits nonlinear ([[stress (physics)|stress]]-dependent) [[shear strength (soil)|strength]], stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application of shear stress), making studying [[soil mechanics]] all the more difficult.<ref name="mitchell"/>

===Water resources engineering===
{{See also|Hydraulic engineering|Hydrology}}
[[File:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Hoover dam]] ]]
''Water resources engineering'' is concerned with the collection and management of water (as a [[natural resource]]). As a discipline it therefore combines hydrology, environmental science, [[meteorology]], geology, [[water conservation|conservation]], and [[resource management]]. This area of civil engineering relates to the prediction and management of both the quality and the quantity of water in both underground ([[aquifers]]) and above ground (lakes, rivers, and streams) resources. Water resource engineers analyze and model very small to very large areas of the earth to predict the amount and content of water as it flows into, through, or out of a facility. Although the actual design of the facility may be left to other engineers.

''Hydraulic engineering'' is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[water supply network]], drainage facilities (including bridges, dams, [[Channel (geography)|channels]], [[culvert]]s, [[levee]]s, [[storm sewer]]s), and canals. Hydraulic engineers design these facilities using the concepts of [[fluid pressure]], [[fluid statics]], [[fluid dynamics]], and hydraulics, among others.

===Structural engineering===
{{Main|Structural engineering}}
[[File:Burj Dubai Evolution.ogv|right|thumb|[[Burj Khalifa]] animation of construction process|thumbtime=0:23]]
[[File:Construcción de una cimentación por zapata aislada.ogv|thumb|left|[[Shallow foundation]] construction example]]
''Structural engineering'' is concerned with the [[structural design]] and [[structural analysis]] of buildings, bridges, [[tower]]s, [[overpass|flyovers]] (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, [[aerostructure]] and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be ''serviceable''). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including [[wind engineering]] and earthquake engineering.<ref>Narayanan, R, A Beeby. ''Introduction to Design for Civil Engineers''. London: Spon, 2003.</ref>

Design considerations will include strength, stiffness, and stability of the structure when subjected to loads which may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, seismic, crowd or vehicle loads, or transitory, such as temporary construction loads or impact. Other considerations include cost, constructability, safety, aesthetics and [[sustainability]].

===Surveying===
{{Main|Surveying|Construction surveying}}
[[File:Civil Engineering Students.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Civil engineering students using a [[theodolite]].]]
''Surveying'' is the process by which a surveyor measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface in the form of a map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as [[geographic information system]]s. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, [[tramway track]]s, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as [[harbor]]s, before construction.

;Land surveying
[[File:Bureau of Land Management Cadastral Survey Marker Arizona.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] [[cadastral]] survey marker from 1992 in [[San Xavier, Arizona]].]]
In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a distinct profession. [[Surveying#Land surveyor|Land surveyors]] are not considered to be engineers, and have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. The services of a licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new boundary lines and roads), both of which are generally referred to as [[Cadastral surveying]].

;Construction surveying
Construction surveying is generally performed by specialised technicians. Unlike land surveyors, the resulting plan does not have legal status. Construction surveyors perform the following tasks:
* Surveying existing conditions of the future work site, including topography, existing buildings and infrastructure, and underground infrastructure when possible;
* "lay-out" or "setting-out": placing reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures such as roads or buildings;
* Verifying the location of structures during construction;
* As-Built surveying: a survey conducted at the end of the construction project to verify that the work authorized was completed to the specifications set on plans.

===Transportation engineering===
{{Main|Transportation engineering}}
[[Image:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], England, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving]]
''Transportation engineering'' is concerned with moving people and goods efficiently, safely, and in a manner conducive to a vibrant community. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining transportation infrastructure which includes streets, canals, highways, [[rail transport|rail systems]], airports, ports, and [[mass transit]]. It includes areas such as transportation design, [[transportation planning]], [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], some aspects of [[municipal or urban engineering|urban engineering]], [[queueing theory]], [[pavement engineering]], [[Intelligent Transportation System]] (ITS), and infrastructure management.

===Forensic engineering===
{{Main|Forensic engineering}}
''Forensic engineering'' is the investigation of materials, [[Product (business)|products]], structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. The consequences of failure are dealt with by the law of product liability. The field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery. The subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases, although it may be of use in criminal law cases. Generally the purpose of a Forensic engineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an accident. It can also involve investigation of intellectual property claims, especially [[patents]].

===Municipal or urban engineering===
{{Main|Urban engineering}}
[[Image:LagoMenorChapultepec3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Lake [[Chapultepec]]]]
''Municipal engineering'' is concerned with municipal infrastructure. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, [[sidewalk]]s, [[municipal water supply|water supply networks]], sewers, [[street light]]ing, [[municipal solid waste]] management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), [[urban park|public parks]] and [[cycling infrastructure]]. In the case of underground [[public utility|utility]] networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services. It can also include the optimizing of waste collection and [[public transport bus service|bus service]] networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously, and managed by the same municipal authority.  Municipal engineers may also design the site civil works for large buildings, industrial plants or campuses (i.e. access roads, parking lots, potable water supply, treatment or pretreatment of waste water, site drainage, etc.)

===Control engineering===
{{Main|Control engineering}}
''Control engineering'' (or ''[[control systems]] engineering'') is the branch of civil engineering discipline that applies [[control theory]] to design systems with desired behaviors. The practice uses sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled (often a vehicle) and those measurements can be used to give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called [[automatic control]] (such as cruise control for regulating a car's speed). Multidisciplinary in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by [[mathematical modeling]] of systems of a diverse range.
