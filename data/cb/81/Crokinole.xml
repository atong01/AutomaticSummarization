Players take turns shooting discs across the circular playing surface, trying to have their discs land in the higher-scoring regions of the board, while also attempting to knock away opposing discs.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Equipment</heading><paragraph>Board dimensions vary with a playing surface typically of polished wood or laminate approximately<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>26</arg><arg>in</arg><arg>mm</arg></template><space/>in diameter. The arrangement is 3 concentric rings worth 5, 10, and 15 points as you move in from the outside. There is a shallow 20-point hole at the center. The inner 15-point ring is guarded with 8 small bumpers or posts. The outer ring of the board is divided into four quadrants. The outer edge of the board is raised a bit to keep errant shots from flying out, with a gutter between the playing surface and the edge to collect discarded pieces. Crokinole boards are typically octagonal or round in shape. The discs are roughly<space/><link><target>Draughts</target><part>checker</part></link>-sized, slightly smaller in diameter than the board's central hole, and may have concave faces to reduce sliding friction. Alternatively, the game may be played with ring-shaped pieces with a central hole.<link><target>File:Crokinole Board.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Round tournament style crokinole board from http://muzzies.ca. Boards may also be octagonal, which is the more &quot;traditional&quot; shape.</part></link></paragraph><heading level='3'>Powder</heading><paragraph>The use of any lubricating powder in crokinole is controversial, with some purists reviling the practice.</paragraph><paragraph>Powder is used to ensure pieces slide smoothly on the surface. According to Carrom rules, the powder must be of high quality to keep the surface smooth and dry, and shall not be wet. Pouches and containers are used to spread the powder over the playing surface. There must be no impurity in the powder. Boric acid powder is mostly used for this purpose.</paragraph><paragraph>In the UK, many players use a version of<space/><link><target>anti-set-off spray powder</target></link>, from the printing industry, which has specific<space/><link><target>electrostatic</target></link><space/>properties, with particles of 50-micrometre diameter (<template><target>convert</target><arg>0.001</arg><arg>mm</arg><arg>in</arg><arg name="disp">output only</arg></template>). The powder is made of pure food-grade plant/vegetable starch.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Gameplay</heading><paragraph>Crokinole is most commonly played by two players, or by four players in teams of two, with partners sitting across the board from each other. Players take turns flicking their discs from the outer edge of their quadrant of the board onto the playfield. Shooting is usually done by flicking the disc with a finger, though sometimes small<space/><link><target>cue stick</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>may be used. If there are any enemy discs on the board, a player must make contact, directly or indirectly, with an enemy disc during the shot. If unsuccessful, the shot disc is &quot;fouled&quot; and removed from the board, along with any of the player's other discs that were moved during the shot.</paragraph><paragraph>When there are no enemy discs on the board, many (but not all) rules also state that a player must shoot for the centre of the board, and a shot disc must finish either completely inside the 15-point guarded ring line, or (depending on the specifics of the rules) be inside or touching this line. This is often called the &quot;no hiding&quot; rule, since it prevents players from placing their first shots where their opponent must traverse completely though the guarded centre ring to hit them and avoid fouling. When playing without this rule, a player may generally make any shot desired, and as long as a disc remains completely inside the outer line of the playfield, it remains on the board. During any shot, any disc that falls completely into the recessed central &quot;20&quot; hole (a.k.a. the &quot;Toad&quot;) is removed from play, and counts as twenty points for the owner of the disc at the end of the round, assuming the shot is valid.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Aubrey"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Aubrey<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Irene Elizabeth<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Sports and Games in Canadian Children's Books<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>National Library of Canada<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>1982<space/></arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>0-662-51763-6<space/></arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Bell"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last"><space/>Bell<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>R.

Play continues until a predetermined winning score is reached.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History of the game</heading><paragraph>The earliest known crokinole board was made by craftsman Eckhardt Wettlaufer in 1876 in<space/><link><target>Perth County, Ontario</target><part>Perth County</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Ontario</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Canada</target></link>. Several other home-made boards of southwestern Ontario origin, and dating from the 1870s, have been discovered since the 1990s. A board game which appears similar to crokinole was patented on April 20, 1880, by Joshua K.

Tavistock was chosen as the host city because it was the home of Eckhardt Wettlaufer, the maker of the earliest known board. The reigning world Adult single's crokinole champion is Justin Slater from Toronto, Ontario. The reigning world Adult doubles champions are Tony Snyder of Waterloo and Jon Conrad of Poole. This is their second World Championship as a pairing.</paragraph><paragraph>The WCC begins with a qualifying round in which competitors play 10 matches against randomly assigned opponents. The qualifying round is played in a large randomly determined competition. At the end of the opening round, the top 16 competitors move on to the playoffs. The top four in the playoffs advance to the semifinals to play each other, and the top two compete in the finals.</paragraph><paragraph>The WCC has multiple divisions, including a singles finger-shooting category for competitive players (Adult Singles), novices (Recreational), and younger players (Intermediate, 11-14 yrs; Junior, 6-10 yrs). The WCC also awards a prize for the top 20-hole shooter in the Competitive Singles qualifying round, in the Recreational Singles qualifying round, in the Intermediate Singles, and in the Junior Singles.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Chinese Championships of Crokinole</heading><paragraph>Originating in<space/><link><target>Dalian</target></link><space/>in 2005, the Chinese Championships of Crokinole (CCC) has been heavily contested since.

This, of course, gave great prestige to the Chinese version and in the first four years of play only one winner has emerged from China.
