A local society supported the family financially<space/><template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">September 2011</arg></template>.

The myth, that his &quot;father was thought to have been a Church of Scotland minister&quot;, is also discounted.

When this news reached England, it confirmed Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and various naval commanders were ordered to &quot;pursue and seize the said Kidd and his accomplices&quot; for the &quot;notorious piracies&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Hamilton, (1961)</extension><space/>they had committed.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Kidd kept the French passes of<space/><italics>Quedagh Merchant</italics>, as well as the vessel itself.
