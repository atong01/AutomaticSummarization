The '''kingdom of the East Saxons''' ({{lang-ang|Ēast Seaxna Rīce}}; {{lang-la|Regnum Orientalium Saxonum}}), today referred to as the '''Kingdom of Essex''', was one of the seven traditional kingdoms of the so-called [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Heptarchy]].<ref>The Latin name was used, for instance, by [[William of Malmesbury]].</ref> It was founded in the 6th century and covered the territory later occupied by the [[Counties of England|counties]] of [[Essex]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Middlesex]] and (for a short while) [[Kent]]. Kings of Essex were frequently subservient to foreign overlords. The last king of Essex was Sigered and in 825, he ceded the kingdom to [[Egbert of Wessex]].

==Extent==
[[File:Ancient Essex 750.png|thumb|200px|left|A map showing the outline of those parts now adjacent to the traditional county of Essex (in grey) but which historians postulate were part of the ancient Kingdom of Essex before becoming detached during the middle of the 8th Century.]]
The kingdom was bounded to the north by the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] and the [[Kingdom of East Anglia]], to the south by the [[River Thames]] and [[Kent]], to the east lay the [[North Sea]] and to the west [[Mercia]]. The territory included the remains of two provincial [[ancient Rome|Roman]] capitals [[Colchester]] and [[London]]. The early kingdom included the land of the [[Middle Saxons]],<ref>Keightley, A., ''The History of England'', (1840)</ref> later Middlesex, most if not all of [[Hertfordshire]]<ref name="Yorke, B. 1984 pp47-52">Yorke, B., ''Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England'',(1984) pp47-52</ref> and may at times have included Surrey.<ref>John Baker, ''Cultural Transition in the Chilterns and Essex Region (University of Hertfordshire Press, 2005)</ref> For a brief period in the 8th century, the Kingdom of Essex controlled what is now Kent.

The modern [[England|English]] [[county]] of Essex maintains the historic northern and the southern borders, but only covers the territory east of the [[River Lea]], the other parts being lost to neighbouring [[Mercia]] during the 8th Century.<ref name="Yorke, B. 1984 pp47-52"/>

In the [[Tribal Hidage]] it is listed as containing 7,000 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s.

==History==
Although the kingdom of Essex was one of the kingdoms of the Heptarchy, its history is not well documented. It produced relatively few [[Anglo-Saxon charters]]<ref name=rippon>Rippon, Stephen, ''Essex c. 760 – 1066'' (in Bedwin, O, ''The Archaeology of Essex: Proceedings of the Writtle Conference'' (Essex County Council, 1996)</ref> and no version of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''; in fact the only mention in the chronicle concerns Bishop [[Mellitus]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Anglo-Saxons|year=1991|publisher=Penguin|page=26|editor=Campbell, James}}</ref> As a result, the kingdom is regarded as comparatively obscure.<ref name=Hamerow>[[Helena Hamerow|H Hamerow]], ''Excavations at Mucking, Volume 2: The Anglo-Saxon Settlement'' (English Heritage Archaeological Report 21, 1993)</ref> For most of the kingdom's existence, the Essex king was subservient to an overlord - variously the kings of Kent, Anglia or Mercia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yorke|first=Barbara|chapter=The Kingdom of the East Saxons|title=Anglo-Saxon England 14|year=1985|pages=31–36|editor-first=Peter|editor-last=Clemoes|editor2-first=Simon|editor2-last=Keynes|editor3-first=Michael|editor3-last=Lapidge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>

===Origin===
Saxon occupation of land that was to form the kingdom had begun by the early 5th century at [[Mucking excavation#Results|Mucking]] and other locations. A large proportion of these original settlers came from [[Old Saxony]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Yorke|first=Barbara|chapter=The Kingdom of the East Saxons|title=Anglo-Saxon England 14|year=1985|page=14|editor-first=Peter|editor-last=Clemoes|editor2-first=Simon|editor2-last=Keynes|editor3-first=Michael|editor3-last=Lapidge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> According to British legend (see: [[Historia Brittonum]]) the territory known later as Essex was ceded by the Britons to the Saxons following the infamous ''[[Treachery of the Long Knives|Brad y Cyllyll Hirion]]'' event which occurred ca. AD 460 during the reign of High-King [[Vortigern]]. Della Hooke relates the territory ruled by the kings of Essex to the pre-Roman territory of the [[Trinovantes|Trinovantium]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Della|last=Hooke|title=The Landscape of Anglo-Saxon England |year=1998|publisher=Leicester University Press| page=46}}</ref>

The kingdom of Essex grew by the absorption of smaller sub-kingdoms<ref name=reynolds>Andrew Reynolds, ''Later Anglo-Saxon England'' (Tempus, 2002, page 67) drawing on S Bassett (ed) ''The Origin of Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms'' (Leicester, 1989)</ref> or Saxon tribal groups. There are a number of suggestions for the location of these sub-kingdoms including:

===Essex monarchy===
Essex emerged as a single kingdom during the 6th century. The dates, names and achievements of the Essex kings, like those of most early rulers in the [[Heptarchy]], remain conjectural. The historical identification of the kings of Essex, including the evidence and a reconstructed genealogy are discussed extensively by Yorke.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yorke|first=Barbara|chapter=The Kingdom of the East Saxons|title=Anglo-Saxon England 14|year=1985|pages=1–36|editor-first=Peter|editor-last=Clemoes|editor2-first=Simon|editor2-last=Keynes|editor3-first=Michael|editor3-last=Lapidge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> The dynasty claimed descent from [[Woden]] via [[Seaxnēat]]. A genealogy of the Essex royal house was prepared in Wessex in the 9th century. Unfortunately the surviving copy is somewhat mutilated.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yorke|first=Barbara|chapter=The Kingdom of the East Saxons|title=Anglo-Saxon England 14|year=1985|page=3|editor-first=Peter|editor-last=Clemoes|editor2-first=Simon|editor2-last=Keynes|editor3-first=Michael|editor3-last=Lapidge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> At times during the history of the kingdom several sub-kings within Essex appear to have been able to rule simultaneously.<ref name="Yorke, B. 1984 pp47-52"/> They may have exercised authority over different parts of the kingdom. The first recorded king, according to the East Saxon King List, was [[Aescwine of Essex|Æscwine]] to which a date of AD 527 is given for the start of his reign, although there are some difficulties with the date of his reign, and [[Sledda]] is listed as the founder of the Essex royal house by other sources.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yorke|first=Barbara|chapter=The Kingdom of the East Saxons|title=Anglo-Saxon England 14|year=1985|page=16|editor-first=Peter|editor-last=Clemoes|editor2-first=Simon|editor2-last=Keynes|editor3-first=Michael|editor3-last=Lapidge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>

The Essex kings issued coins that echoed those issued by [[Cunobelin]] simultaneously asserting a link to the first century rulers while emphasising independence from Mercia.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Anglo-Saxons|year=1991|publisher=Penguin|pages=63–64|chapter=Anglo-Saxon Coins 1|first=DM|last=Metcalf|editor=Campbell, James}}</ref>

The tomb of King [[Sæbbi of Essex]] (r.664-683) was visible in [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|Old St. Paul's]] Cathedral until the [[Great Fire of London]] of 1666 when the cathedral and this tomb within it were lost.

===Christianity===
The earliest English record of the kingdom dates to [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', which noted the arrival of Bishop (later Saint) [[Mellitus]] in London in 604. [[Æthelberht of Kent|Æthelberht]] (King of Kent and overlord of southern England according to Bede) was in a position to exercise some authority in Essex shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King [[Saebert of Essex]] (son of [[Sledda|Sledd]]), his nephew, to Christianity. It was Æthelberht, and not Sæberht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where [[St. Paul’s Cathedral]] now stands. Bede describes Æthelberht as Sæberht’s overlord.<ref>Bede, book II, chapter 3</ref><ref name=Stenton_109>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 109.</ref> After the death of [[Saebert of Essex|Saebert]] in AD 616, Mellitus was driven out and the kingdom reverted to paganism. This may have been the result of opposition to Kentish influence in Essex affairs rather than being specifically anti-Christian.<ref name="Yorke, Barbara 1990"/> 

The kingdom reconverted to Christianity under [[Sigeberht II of Essex|Sigeberht II the Good]] following a mission by [[Cedd|St Cedd]] who established monasteries at ''Tilaburg'' (probably [[East Tilbury]], but possibly [[West Tilbury]]) and ''Ithancester'' (almost certainly [[Bradwell-on-Sea]]). A [[Royal saxon tomb in Prittlewell|royal tomb]] at Prittlewell was discovered and excavated in 2003. Finds included gold foil crosses, suggesting the occupant was Christian. If the occupant was a king, it was probably either Saebert or Sigeberht (murdered AD 653). It is, however, also possible that the occupant was not royal, but simply a wealthy and powerful individual whose identity has gone unrecorded.<ref>Blair, I. 2007. Prittlewell Prince. ''Current Archaeology'' '''207''': 8-11</ref>

Essex reverted to Paganism again in 660 with the ascension of the Pagan King [[Swithelm of Essex]]. He converted in 662, but died in 664. He was succeeded by his two sons, [[Sighere of Essex|Sigehere]] and [[Sebbi of Essex|Sæbbi]]. A plague the same year caused Sigehere and his people to recant their Christianity and Essex reverted to Paganism a third time. This rebellion was suppressed by [[Wulfhere of Mercia]] who established himself as overlord. Bede describes Sigehere and Sæbbi as "rulers … under Wulfhere, king of the Mercians".<ref name=Kirby_114_1>Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', p.&nbsp;114.</ref> Wulfhere sent Jaruman, the bishop of [[Lichfield]], to reconvert the East Saxons.<ref>Bede, ''HE'', III, 30, pp. 200–1.</ref>

[[Wine (bishop)|Wine]] (in 666)<ref name=Handbook239>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 239</ref> and [[Erkenwald]] (in 675)<ref name=Handbook239/> were appointed bishops of London with spiritual authority over the East Saxon Kingdom. Although London (and the rest of Middlesex) was lost by the East Saxons in the 8th century, the bishops of London continued to exert spiritual authority over Essex as a kingdom, shire and county until 1845.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp;jsessionid=AE9DA57B52C81919C5ADBE98B322E165?u_id=10568420&c_id= Essex archdeaconry through time]</ref>

===Later history and end===
Despite the comparative obscurity of the kingdom, there were strong connections between Essex and the Kentish kingdom across the river Thames which led to the marriage of King Sledd to Ricula, sister of the king, [[Aethelbert of Kent]]. For a brief period in the 8th century the kingdom encompassed the Kentish Kingdom to the South. During this period, Essex kings were issuing their own [[sceattas]] (coins), perhaps as an assertion of their own independence.<ref>{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Rippon|chapter=Essex c.700 - 1066|editor=Bedwin, O|title=The Archaeology of Essex, proceedings of the Writtle conference|page=117}}</ref> However, by the mid 8th century much of the kingdom, including London, had fallen to [[Mercia]] and the rump of Essex, roughly the modern county, was now subordinate to the same.<ref>{{cite book|page=18|title=London, 800-1216: the shaping of a city|first=Christopher Nugent Lawrence|last=Brooke|first2=Gillian|last2=Keir|year=1975|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> After the defeat of the Mercian king [[Beornwulf of Mercia|Beornwulf]] around  AD 825, [[Sigered of Essex|Sigered]], the last king of Essex, ceded the kingdom which then became a possession of the [[West Saxon kingdom|Wessex]] king [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles|editor=Swanton, Michael|page=60|publisher=Phoenix Press|year=1996}}</ref>

The Mercians continued to control parts of Essex and may have supported a pretender to the Essex throne since a Sigeric ''rex Orientalem Saxonum'' witnessed a Mercian charter after AD 825.<ref name=Hart>Cyril Hart ''The Danelaw'' (The Hambledon Press, 1992, chapter 3)</ref> During the ninth century, Essex was part of a sub-kingdom that included Sussex, Surrey and Kent.<ref name=Hart/> Sometime between 878 and 886, the territory was formally ceded by Wessex to the [[Danelaw]] kingdom of East Anglia, under the [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]]. After the reconquest by [[Edward the Elder]] the king's representative in Essex was styled an [[ealdorman]] and Essex came to be regarded as a [[shire]].<ref>{{cite book|title=An Essex Tribute|editor-last=Neale|editor-first=Kenneth|publisher=Leopard's Head Press|year=1987|last=Hart|first=Cyril|chapter=The Ealdordom of Essex|page=62}}</ref>

===Spelling===
There are a number of variations of the spelling of the names of the Kings listed above. This was a time when spellings varied widely, even within a document. Amongst these variations are the preference between þ and ð (both "th" - voiced or unvoiced depending on adjacent letters).

The character '{{Unicode|⁊}}' was used as the ampersand '&' in contemporary Anglo-Saxon writings.  The era pre-dates the emergence of forms of writing accepted today, notably [[Minuscule cursive|minuscule]], and the letters 'W' and 'U'.  Where W was followed by U this was generally rendered as 'VV' (which was also used for 'W' alone).
