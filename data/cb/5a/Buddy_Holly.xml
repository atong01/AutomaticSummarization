</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><bold>Charles Hardin Holley</bold><space/>(September 7, 1936 February 3, 1959), known as<space/><bold>Buddy Holly</bold>, was an American musician and singer/songwriter who was a central figure of mid-1950s<space/><link><target>rock and roll</target></link>. Holly was born in<space/><link><target>Lubbock, Texas</target></link>, to a musical family during the<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link>; he learned to play guitar and to sing alongside his siblings. His style was influenced by<space/><link><target>country music</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>rhythm and blues</target></link><space/>acts, and he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school. He made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group &quot;Buddy and Bob&quot; with his friend<space/><link><target>Bob Montgomery (musician)</target><part>Bob Montgomery</part></link>. In 1955, after opening for<space/><link><target>Elvis Presley</target></link>, Holly decided to pursue a career in music. He opened for Presley three times that year; his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when he opened for<space/><link><target>Bill Haley &amp; His Comets</target></link>, Holly was spotted by<space/><link><target>Nashville, Tennessee</target><part>Nashville</part></link><space/>scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with<space/><link><target>Decca Records</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Holly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by<space/><link><target>Owen Bradley</target></link>. Holly was unhappy with Bradley's restrictions and the results of their work, and went to producer<space/><link><target>Norman Petty</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Clovis, New Mexico</target></link>, where, among other songs, they recorded a demo of &quot;<link><target>That'll Be the Day</target></link>&quot;. Petty became the band's manager and he sent the demo to<space/><link><target>Brunswick Records</target></link>, which released it as a single credited to &quot;<link><target>The Crickets</target></link>&quot;, which became the name of Holly's band.In September 1957, as the band toured, &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot; topped the<space/><link><target>List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957</target><part>US &quot;Best Sellers in Stores&quot;</part></link><space/>chart and the<space/><link><target>UK Singles Chart</target></link>. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, &quot;<link><target>Peggy Sue</target></link>&quot;.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>In November 1957, the album<space/><italics><link><target>The &quot;Chirping&quot; Crickets</target><part>Chirping Crickets</part></link></italics><space/>was released; it reached number five on the<space/><link><target>UK Albums Chart</target></link>. By January 1958, Holly had appeared twice on<space/><italics><link><target>The Ed Sullivan Show</target></link></italics>. Following his second performance on the show, he toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, Holly assembled a new band consisting of future country music icon<space/><link><target>Waylon Jennings</target></link><space/>(bass) and<space/><link><target>Tommy Allsup</target></link><space/>(guitar), and embarked on a tour of the Midwestern U.S. After a show in<space/><link><target>Clear Lake, Iowa</target></link>, Holly chartered an airplane to travel to his next show in<space/><link><target>Moorhead, Minnesota</target></link>. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Holly,<space/><link><target>Ritchie Valens</target></link>,<space/><link><target>the Big Bopper</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Roger Peterson (pilot)</target><part>the pilot</part></link>, an infamous milestone in rock history known as<space/><link><target>The Day the Music Died</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>During his short career, Holly wrote, recorded, and produced his own material. He is often regarded as the act that defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums. Holly was a major influence on later<space/><link><target>popular music</target></link><space/>artists and bands, including<space/><link><target>the Beatles</target></link>,<space/><link><target>the Rolling Stones</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Eric Clapton</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Elton John</target></link>. He was among the first acts to be inducted into the<space/><link><target>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</target></link><space/>in 1986, and later ranked by<space/><italics><link><target>Rolling Stone (magazine)</target><part>Rolling Stone</part></link></italics><space/>at number 13 on its list of &quot;100 Greatest Artists&quot;.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Life and career</heading><heading level='3'>Early life and career (19361955)</heading><paragraph>Charles Hardin Holley was born on September 7, 1936, in<space/><link><target>Lubbock, Texas</target></link>, at 3:30 pm; he was the fourth child of Lawrence Odell &quot;L.O&quot; Holley and Ella Pauline Drake. His older siblings were Larry (born in 1925), Travis (born in 1927), and Patricia Lou (born in 1929). From early childhood, he was nicknamed &quot;Buddy&quot;.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Gribbin, John</arg><arg>2012</arg><arg name="p">12</arg></template><space/>During the<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link>, the Holleys frequently moved residence within Lubbock; L.O changed jobs several times.

The older Holley brothers performed in local talent shows; on one occasion, Buddy joined them on violin. Since he could not play it, his brother Larry greased the strings so it would not make any sound.

Upon his return, Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a shipmate while serving in the Pacific. At age 11, Buddy took piano lessons, but abandoned them after nine months. He switched to guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus. Buddy's parents initially bought him a<space/><link><target>steel guitar</target></link>, but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother's. His parents bought the guitar from a pawn shop and Travis taught him to play it.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Gribbin, John</arg><arg>2012</arg><arg name="p">14</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>During his early childhood, Buddy was influenced by the music of<space/><link><target>Hank Williams</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)</target><part>Jimmie Rodgers</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Hank Snow</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Bob Wills</target></link>, and the<space/><link><target>Carter Family</target></link>.

He was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Presley performing live in Lubbock, whose act was booked by Pappy Dave Stone of KDAV. In February, Holley opened for Presley at the Fair Park Coliseum, in April at the Cotton Club, and again in June at the Coliseum. By that time, he had incorporated into his band Larry Welborne on the stand-up bass and Allison on drums, as his style shifted from C&amp;W to<space/><link><target>rock and roll</target></link>.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Lehmer, Larry</arg><arg name="p">7</arg><arg>2003</arg></template><space/>In October, Stone booked Bill Haley &amp; His Comets and placed Holley as the opening act to be seen by<space/><link><target>Nashville, Tennessee</target><part>Nashville</part></link><space/>scout Eddie Crandall.

The group recorded a demo of &quot;<link><target>That'll Be the Day</target></link>&quot;, a song they had previously recorded in Nashville. Now playing lead guitar, Holly achieved the sound he desired. Petty became his manager and sent the record to<space/><link><target>Brunswick Records</target></link><space/>in New York City. Holly was still under contract with Decca and could not use his name; it was decided a band name was to be used.

Petty disapproved of the marriage and advised Holly to keep it secret to avoid upsetting Holly's female fans. Petty's reaction created friction between Holly and him; Holly also started to question Petty's bookkeeping.

Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll, and wanted to make an album with<space/><link><target>Ray Charles</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Mahalia Jackson</target></link>.

To hide her marriage to Holly, she was presented as the Crickets' secretary. She took care of the laundry and equipment set-up, and collected the concert revenues. Santiago kept the money for the band instead of their habitual transfer to Petty in New Mexico.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Norman, Philip</arg><arg>2011</arg><arg name="p">274</arg></template><space/>She and her aunt Provi Garcia, executive of the Latin American music department at<space/><link><target>Peer-Southern</target></link>, convinced Holly that Petty was paying the band's royalties from Coral-Brunswick into his own company's account. Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Petty and to later fire him as manager and producer.

The two had a verbal agreement; Greenfield would obtain 5% of the booking earnings. Greenfield later felt he was also acting as Holly's manager and deserved a higher payment, which Holly refused. Greenfield then sued Holly. According to New York law, because the royalty proceedings of Holly were originated in New York and directed out-of-state, the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled.
