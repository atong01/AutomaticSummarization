For DES, questions were raised about the adequacy of its key size early on, even before it was adopted as a standard, and it was the small key size, rather than theoretical cryptanalysis, which dictated a need for a replacement algorithm. As a result of discussions involving external consultants including the NSA, the key size was reduced from 128 bits to 56 bits to fit on a single chip.<extension extension_name='ref' name="stallings-2006">Stallings, W.<space/><italics>Cryptography and network security: principles and practice</italics>.

In 1977, Diffie and Hellman proposed a machine costing an estimated US$20 million which could find a DES key in a single day. By 1993, Wiener had proposed a key-search machine costing US$1 million which would find a key within 7 hours. However, none of these early proposals were ever implementedor, at least, no implementations were publicly acknowledged. The vulnerability of DES was practically demonstrated in the late 1990s. In 1997,<space/><link><target>RSA Security</target></link><space/>sponsored a series of contests, offering a $10,000 prize to the first team that broke a message encrypted with DES for the contest. That contest was won by the<space/><link><target>DESCHALL Project</target></link>, led by Rocke Verser,<space/><link><target>Matt Curtin</target></link>, and Justin Dolske, using idle cycles of thousands of computers across the Internet. The feasibility of cracking DES quickly was demonstrated in 1998 when a custom DES-cracker was built by the<space/><link><target>Electronic Frontier Foundation</target></link><space/>(EFF), a cyberspace civil rights group, at the cost of approximately US$250,000 (see<space/><link><target>EFF DES cracker</target></link>). Their motivation was to show that DES was breakable in practice as well as in theory: &quot;<italics>There are many people who will not believe a truth until they can see it with their own eyes.
