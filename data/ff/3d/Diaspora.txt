A '''diaspora''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] διασπορά, "scattering, dispersion")<ref name=liddell>{{LSJ|diaspora/|διασπορά|ref}}</ref> is a scattered population whose origin lies within a smaller geographic locale.  Diaspora can also refer to the movement of the population from its original homeland.<ref name=webster>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diaspora |title=Diaspora |accessdate=2011-02-22 |quote= |publisher=[[Merriam Webster]] }}</ref><ref name=ember/>  Diaspora has come to refer particularly to historical mass dispersions of an involuntary nature, such as the [[Jewish diaspora|expulsion of Jews from Judea]], the fleeing of [[Greeks]] after the fall of [[Constantinople]], the African Trans-[[Atlantic slave trade]], the southern Chinese or Hindus of [[South Asia]] during the [[coolie|coolie trade]], the [[Palestinian diaspora|deportation of Palestinians in the 20th century]]<ref name=ember/><ref>{{cite book|last=Rozen|first=Mina|title=Homelands and Diasporas: Greeks, Jews and Their Migrations (International Library of Migration Studies)|year=2008|publisher=I.

Recently, scholars have distinguished between different kinds of diaspora, based on its causes such as [[imperialism]], trade or labor migrations, or by the kind of social coherence within the diaspora community and its ties to the ancestral lands. Some diaspora communities maintain strong political ties with their homeland. Other qualities that may be typical of many diasporas are thoughts of return, relationships with other communities in the diaspora, and lack of full integration into the host country.<ref name=ember>{{cite book |editor=[[Melvin Ember]], [[Carol R.

==Origins and development of the term==
The term is derived from the Greek verb διασπείρω (''diaspeirō''), "I scatter", "I spread about"<ref name=liddell/> and that from διά (''dia''), "between, through, across"<ref name=liddell/> + the verb σπείρω (''speirō''), "I sow, I scatter".<ref name=liddell/> In [[Ancient Greece]] the term διασπορά (''diaspora'') hence meant "scattering"<ref name=liddell/> and was inter alia used to refer to citizens of a dominant [[city-state]] who emigrated to a conquered land with the purpose of [[colonization]], to assimilate the territory into the empire.<ref>pp.1-2,  Tetlow</ref> An example of a diaspora from classical antiquity is the century-long exile of the [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenians]] under [[Sparta]]n rule.

Its use began to develop from this original sense when the [[Hebrew Bible]] was translated into Greek;<ref>p.81, Kantor</ref>  the first mention of a diaspora created as a result of exile is found in the [[Septuagint]],<ref name=liddell/> first in
*[[Deuteronomy]] 28:25, in the phrase {{lang|grc| ἔσῃ ἐν διασπορᾷ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς βασιλείαις τῆς γῆς}}, ''esē en diaspora en pasais tais basileiais tēs gēs'', translated to mean "thou shalt be a dispersion in all kingdoms of the earth" 
and secondly in 
*[[Psalms]] 146(147).2, in the phrase {{lang|grc|οἰκοδομῶν Ἰερουσαλὴμ ὁ Kύριος καὶ τὰς διασπορὰς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπισυνάξει}}, ''oikodomōn Ierousalēm ho Kyrios kai tas diasporas tou Israēl episynaxē'', translated to mean "The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel". 
So after the Bible's translation into Greek, the word ''Diaspora'' would then have been used to refer to the Northern Kingdom exiled between 740-722 BC from Israel by the Assyrians,<ref>[[Assyrian captivity of Israel]]</ref> as well as Jews, Benjaminites, and Levites exiled from the Southern Kingdom in 587 BCE by the [[Babylonian exile|Babylonians]], and from [[Roman Judea]] in 70 CE by the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>pp.53, 105-106, Kantor</ref> It subsequently came to be used to refer to the historical movements of the dispersed ethnic population of Israel, to the cultural development of that population or to that population itself.<ref>p.1, Barclay</ref> In English when capitalized and without modifiers (that is simply, ''the Diaspora''), the term refers specifically to the [[Jewish diaspora]];<ref name=webster/> when uncapitalized the word ''diaspora'' may be used to refer to [[refugee]] or [[Immigration|immigrant]] populations of other origins or ethnicities living "away from an established or ancestral homeland".<ref name=webster/> The wider application of ''diaspora'' evolved from the Assyrian two-way mass deportation policy of conquered populations to deny future territorial claims on their part.<ref>pp.96-97, Galil & Weinfeld</ref>

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary Online]]'', the first known recorded usage of the word ''diaspora'' in the [[English language]] was in 1876 referring "extensive ''diaspora'' work (as it is termed) of evangelizing among the National Protestant Churches on the continent".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/52085|title=diaspora, n.|work=[[Oxford English Dictionary Online]]|date=November 2010|accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref> The term became more widely assimilated into [[English language|English]] by the mid 1950s, with long-term [[expatriates]] in significant numbers from other particular countries or regions also being referred to as a diaspora.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} An academic field, [[diaspora studies]], has become established relating to this sense of the word.

In all cases, the term ''diaspora'' carries a sense of [[Forced migration|displacement]] the population so described finds itself for whatever reason separated from its national territory, and usually its people have a hope, or at least a desire, to return to their homeland at some point, if the "homeland" still exists in any meaningful sense. Some writers{{Who|date=November 2010}} have noted that diaspora may result in a loss of nostalgia for a single home as people "re-root" in a series of meaningful displacements. In this sense, individuals may have multiple homes throughout their diaspora, with different reasons for maintaining some form of attachment to each. Diasporic cultural development often assumes a different course from that of the population in the original place of settlement. Over time, remotely separated communities tend to vary in culture, traditions, language and other factors. The last vestiges of cultural affiliation in a diaspora is often found in community resistance to [[language change]] and in maintenance of traditional religious practice.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Expanding definition===
In an article published in 1991, [[William Safran]] set out six rules to distinguish diasporas from migrant communities. These included criteria that the group maintains a myth or collective memory of their homeland; they regard their ancestral homeland as their true home, to which they will eventually return; being committed to the restoration or maintenance of that homeland; and they relate "personally or vicariously" to the homeland to a point where it shapes their identity.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=5}}{{sfn|Weinar|2010|p=75}}{{sfn|Cohen|2008|p=6}} While Safran's definitions were influenced by the idea of the Jewish diaspora, he recognised the expanding use of the term.{{sfn|Cohen|2008|p=4}}

[[Rogers Brubaker]] (2005) also notes that use of the term diaspora has been widening. He suggests that one element of this expansion in use "involves the application of the term diaspora to an ever-broadening set of cases: essentially to any and every nameable population category that is to some extent dispersed in space".{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=3}} Brubaker has used the [[WorldCat]] database to show that 17 out of the 18 books on diaspora published between 1900 and 1910 were on the Jewish diaspora. The majority of works in the 1960s were also about the Jewish diaspora, but in 2002 only two out of 20 books sampled (out of a total of 253) were about the Jewish case, with a total of eight different diasporas covered.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=14}}

Brubaker outlines the original use of the term diaspora as follows:

<blockquote>Most early discussions of diaspora were firmly rooted in a conceptual 'homeland'; they were concerned with a paradigmatic case, or a small number of core cases. The paradigmatic case was, of course, the Jewish diaspora; some dictionary definitions of diaspora, until recently, did not simply illustrate but defined the word with reference to that case.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=2}}</blockquote>

Brubaker argues that the initial expansion of the use of the phrase extended it to other, similar cases, such as the [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian]] and [[Greek diaspora]]s. More recently, it has been applied to emigrant groups that continue their involvement in their homeland from overseas, such as the category of long-distance nationalists identified by [[Benedict Anderson]]. Brubaker notes that (as examples): Albanians, Basques, Hindu Indians, Irish, Japanese, Kashmiri, Koreans, Kurds, Palestinians, and Tamils have been conceptualised as diasporas in this sense. Furthermore, "labour migrants who maintain (to some degree) emotional and social ties with a homeland" have also been described as diasporas.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=2}}

In further cases of the use of the term, "the reference to the conceptual homeland – to the 'classical' diasporas – has become more attenuated still, to the point of being lost altogether". Here, Brubaker cites "transethnic and transborder linguistic categories...such as [[French language|Francophone]], [[English language|Anglophone]] and [[Lusophone]] 'communities'", along with Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Confucian, Huguenot, Muslim and Catholic 'diasporas'.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|pp=2–3}} Brubaker notes that, {{as of|2005|lc=on}}, there were also academic books or articles on the [[Dixie]], white, liberal, gay, queer and digital diasporas.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=14}}

Some observers have labeled evacuation from [[New Orleans]] and the [[Gulf Coast]] in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]] the [[New Orleans diaspora]], since a significant number of evacuees have not been able to return, yet maintain aspirations to do so.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/katrina-evacuees-economic-impact-new-homes-destinations/19614294/|title=The Economic Impact of the 'Katrina Diaspora'|first=Bruce|last=Kennedy|work=Daily Finance|date=31 August 2010|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4203360.stm|title=Katrina scatters a grim diaspora|first=Will|last=Walden|publisher=BBC News|date=1 September 2005|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> Agnieszka Weinar (2010) notes the widening use of the term, arguing that recently, "a growing body of literature succeeded in reformulating the definition, framing diaspora as almost any ''population'' on the move and no longer referring to the specific ''context'' of their existence".{{sfn|Weinar|2010|p=75}} It has even been noted that as charismatic Christianity becomes increasingly globalized, many Christians conceive of themselves as a diaspora, and form an imaginary that mimics salient features of ethnic diasporas.<ref>{{cite web|last=McAlister|first=Elizabeth|title=Listening for Geographies|url=http://works.bepress.com/elizabeth_mcalister/28/|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=5 November 2012}}</ref>

Professional communities of individuals no longer in their homeland can also be considered diaspora. For example, science diasporas are communities of scientists who conduct their research away from their homeland.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burns|first=William|title=The Potential of Science Diasporas|journal=Science & Diplomacy|date=December 9, 2013|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2013/potential-science-diasporas}}</ref> In an article published in 1996, Khachig Tölölyan<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tölölyan|first=Khachig|title=Rethinking Diaspora(s): Stateless Power in the Transnational Moment|journal=Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies |date=December 1996|volume=3|issue=36|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/diaspora_a_journal_of_transnational_studies/summary/v005/5.1.tololyan.html}}</ref> argues that the media have used the term corporate diaspora in a rather arbitrary and inaccurate fashion, for example as applied to “mid-level, mid-career executives who have been forced to find new places at a time of corporate upheaval” (10) The use of [[corporate diaspora]] reflects the increasing popularity of the diaspora notion to describe a wide range of phenomena related to contemporary migration, displacement and transnational mobility. While corporate diaspora seems to avoid or contradict connotations of violence, coercion and unnatural uprooting historically associated to the notion of diaspora, its scholarly use may heuristically describe the ways in which corporations function alongside diasporas. In this way, corporate diaspora might foreground the racial histories of diasporic formations without losing sight of the cultural logic of [[late capitalism]] in which corporations orchestrate the transnational circulation of people, images, ideologies and capital.

==European diasporas==
{{Further|European diaspora}}
[[File:Greek Colonization Archaic Period.png|300px|right|thumb|Greek Homeland and Diaspora 6th century BCE]]
European history contains numerous diaspora-like events. In ancient times, the trading and colonising activities of the [[ancient Greeks|Greek]] tribes from the [[Balkans]] and [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] spread people of Greek culture, religion and language around the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]] basins, establishing Greek [[city states]] in [[Magna Graecia]] ([[Sicily]], [[southern Italy]]), northern [[Libya]], eastern [[Spain]], the [[south of France]], and the Black Sea coasts. Greeks founded more than 400 colonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072424354/student_view0/chapter10/table_of_contents.html |title=Early development of Greek society |publisher=Highered.mcgraw-hill.com |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref> [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] marked the beginning of the [[Hellenistic period]], which was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], with Greek ruling classes established in [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Egypt]], [[Seleucid Empire|southwest Asia]] and [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|northwest India]].<ref>[http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc1/lectures/10hellenism.html Hellenistic Civilization]</ref> Subsequent waves of colonization and migration during the Middle Ages added to the older settlements, or created new ones, thus replenishng the [[Greek diaspora]] and making it one of the most long-standing and widespread in the world.

The [[Migration Period]] relocations, which included several phases, are just one set of many in history. The first phase Migration Period displacement from between CE 300 and 500 included relocation of the [[Goths]] ([[Ostrogoths]] and [[Visigoths]]), [[Vandals]], [[Franks]], various other [[Germanic people]] ([[Burgundians]], [[Lombards]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]], [[Suebi]], [[Alemanni]], [[Varangian]]s and [[Normans]]), [[Alans]] and numerous [[Slavic peoples|Slavic tribes]]. The second phase, between CE 500 and 900, saw [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], [[Turkic people|Turkic]], and other tribes on the move, resettling in [[Eastern Europe]] and gradually making it predominantly Slavic, and affecting [[Anatolia]] and the [[Caucasus]] as the first Turkic tribes ([[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Pechenegs]]), as well as [[Bulgars]], and possibly [[Magyars]] arrived. The last phase of the [[Migration Period|migrations]] saw the coming of the Hungarian Magyars and the [[Vikings|Viking]] expansion out of [[Scandinavia]] into Europe and the [[British Isles]], as well as [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]].

Such colonizing migrations cannot be considered indefinitely as diasporas; over very long periods, eventually the migrants assimilate into the settled area so completely that it becomes their new homeland. Thus the modern population of Hungary do not feel that they belong in the Western [[Siberia]] that the Hungarian Magyars left 12 centuries ago; and the [[England|English]] descendants of the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] do not yearn to reoccupy the plains of Northwest Germany.

In 1492, a Spanish expedition headed by [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in the [[Americas]], after which European exploration and colonization rapidly expanded. Historian [[James Axtell]] estimates that 240,000 people left Europe for the Americas in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART |first=James |last= Axtell |title=The Columbian Mosaic in Colonial America |journal=Humanities |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119071952/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART |archivedate=November 19, 2009 |date=September–October 1991 | issue=5| volume=12| pages=12–18 |jstor=4636419}}</ref> Immigration continued. In the 19th century alone over 50 million Europeans migrated to North and South America.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eltis |first=Kingston David |title=Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic Slave Trade |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=139|isbn=978-0-19-536481-1}}</ref>

A specific 19th-century example is the [[Irish diaspora]], beginning in the mid-19th century and brought about by ''An Gorta Mór'' or "The Great Hunger" of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]]. Estimates are that between 45% and 85% of Ireland's population emigrated, to countries including Britain, the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia and [[New Zealand]]. The size of the diaspora is demonstrated by the number of people around the world who claim Irish ancestry; some sources put the figure at 80-100 million.

==African diaspora==
{{Further|African diaspora}}
One of the largest diaspora of modern times is the [[African Diaspora]], which dates back several centuries. During the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]], 9.4 to 12 million people from North, West, West-Central and South-east Africa survived transportation to arrive in the [[Western Hemisphere]] as [[slavery|slaves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 |title="Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History", '&#39;Encyclopædia Britannica'&#39; |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref> This population and their descendants were major influences on the culture of English, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish [[New World]] colonies.  Prior to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, millions of Africans had moved and settled as merchants, seamen and slaves in different parts of Asia and Europe.

In ''Black Europe and the African Diaspora'', Alexander Weheliye writes a section and clearly explains diaspora this way: "Diaspora offers pathways that retrace laverings of difference in the aftermath of colonialism and slavery, as well as the effects of other forms of migration and displacement. Thus, diaspora enables the desedimentation of the nation from the ‘interior’ by taking into account the groups that fail to comply with the reigning definition of the people as a cohesive political subject due to sharing one culture, one race, one language, one religion, and so on, and from the 'exterior' by drawing attention to the movements that cannot be contained by the nation’s administrative and ideological borders".<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Europe and the African Diaspora|last=Weheliye|first=Alexander|page=162|year=2009|isbn=9780252076572}}</ref>

The mass emigration that occurred from the 19th century to 1949 was caused mainly by wars and starvation in [[mainland China]], as well as political corruption. Most immigrants were illiterate or poorly educated peasants and [[coolies]] (Chinese: 苦力, literally "hard labor"), who immigrated to developing countries in need of labor, such as the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] and other places.

The largest Asian diaspora outside of Southeast Asia is the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]]. The overseas Indian community, estimated at over 25 million, is spread across many regions in the world, on every continent. It constitutes a diverse, heterogeneous and eclectic global community representing different regions, languages, cultures, and faiths (see ''[[Desi]]'').

The [[Romani people|Romani]] are [[Romani diaspora|widely dispersed]], with their largest concentrated populations in Europe. Linguistic and genetic evidence indicates the Romanies originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]], emigrating from India towards the northwest no earlier than the 11th century.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Genetic studies of the Roma (Gypsies): A review |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/2/5 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |doi=10.1186/1471-2350-2-5 |year=2001 |last=Kalaydjieva |first=Luba |journal=BMC Medical Genetics |volume=2 |page=5 |pmid=11299048 |last2=Gresham |first2=D |last3=Calafell |first3=F |pmc=31389 }}</ref>

At least three waves of [[People of Nepal|Nepalese diaspora]] can be identified. The earliest wave dates back to hundreds of years as early marriage and high birthrates propelled Hindu settlement eastward across Nepal, then into [[Sikkim]] and [[Bhutan]]. A backlash developed in the 1980s as Bhutan's political elites realized that Bhutanese Buddhists were at risk of becoming a minority in their own country. At least 60,000 ethnic [[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] from [[Bhutan]] have been resettled in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm | title = Bhutan refugees are 'intimidated' | author = Bhaumik, Subir | date = November 7, 2007 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2008-04-25}}</ref> A second wave was driven by British recruitment of mercenary soldiers beginning around 1815 and resettlement after retirement in the British Isles and southeast Asia. The third wave began in the 1970s as land shortages intensified and the pool of educated labor greatly exceeded job openings in Nepal. Job-related emigration created Nepalese enclaves in India, the wealthier countries of the Middle East, Europe and North America. Current estimates of the number of Nepalese living outside Nepal range well up into the millions.

In Siam, regional power struggles among several kingdoms in the region led to a large diaspora of ethnic Lao between the 1700s-1800s by Siamese rulers to settle large areas of the Siamese kingdom's northeast region, where Lao ethnicity is still a major factor in 2012. During this period, Siam decimated the Lao capital, capturing, torturing and killing the Lao king Anuwongse.

From the 1860s, [[Circassians]] were dispersed through the Levant, Europe, North America, Australia, and within historical [[Circassia]] in the North Caucasus currently in [[Russia]]. {{Further|Circassian diaspora}}

==20th century==

The 20th century saw huge population movements. Some involved large-scale transfers of people by government action. Some migrations occurred to avoid conflict and warfare. Other diasporas were created as a consequence of political decisions, such as the end of [[colonialism]].

===World War II and the end of colonial rule===

As [[World War II]] unfolded, Nazi Germany deported and killed millions of Jews and many millions of others were likewise enslaved or murdered, including Ukrainians, Russians and other Slavs. Some Jews fled from persecution to unoccupied parts of western Europe and the Americas before borders closed. Later, other eastern European refugees moved west, away from Soviet annexation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirmus.ee/baltic_archives_abroad_2006/participants.html |title=An International Conference on the Baltic Archives Abroad |publisher=Kirmus.ee |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref> and the [[Iron Curtain]] regimes after World War II. Hundreds of thousands of these anti-Soviet political refugees and Displaced Persons ended up in western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States of America.

After World War II, the Soviet Union and Communist-controlled [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Yugoslavia]] expelled millions of [[ethnic Germans]], most of whom were descendants of immigrants who had settled in those areas nearly two centuries before. This was allegedly in retaliation for the German Nazi invasion and their pan-German attempts at annexation. Most of the refugees moved to the West, including western Europe, and with tens of thousands seeking refuge in the United States.

[[Spain]] sent many political activists into exile during [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s military regime from 1936 to his death in 1975.

Following World War II, the creation of the state of [[Israel]], and a series of uprisings against colonialist rule, the [[Middle East]] nations became more hostile in relation to their historic Jewish populations, sepharadim and mizrahiml, of nearly 1 million people. Most of them emigrated, with the majority resettling in Israel.

At the same time, the [[Palestinian diaspora]] resulted from Israel's creation in 1948, in which 750,000 people were expelled or fled from their homes. The diaspora was enlarged by the effects of the [[1967 Arab-Israeli War]]. Many Palestinians continue to live in refugee camps maintained by Middle Eastern nations, but others have resettled in the Middle East and other countries.

The [[Partition of India|1947 Partition]] resulted in the migration of millions of people between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Millions were murdered in the religious violence of the period, with estimates of fatalities up to 2 million people. Thousands of former subjects of the [[British Raj]] went to the [[UK]] from the [[Indian subcontinent]] after India and Pakistan became independent in 1947.

From the late 19th century, and formally from 1910, Japan made Korea a colony. Millions of Chinese fled to western provinces not occupied by Japan (that is, in particular Ssuchuan/Szechwan and Yunnan in the Southwest and Shensi and Kansu in the Northwest) and to Southeast Asia. More than 100,000 Koreans moved across the Amur River into Eastern Russia (then the Soviet Union) away from the Japanese.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===The Cold War and the formation of post-colonial states===
During and after the [[Cold War]]-era, huge populations of refugees migrated from conflict, especially from then-[[developing countries]].

==Diaspora populations on the Internet==
There are numerous web-based news portals and forum sites dedicated to specific diaspora communities, often organized on the basis of an origin characteristic and a current location characteristic (e.g. [http://www.chineseinboston.com/ ChineseInBoston.com]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Van Den Bos|first1=Matthijs|last2=Nell|first2=Liza|title=Territorial bounds to virtual space: transnational online and offline networks of Iranian and Turkish–Kurdish immigrants in the Netherlands|journal=Global Networks: A Journal of Transnational Affairs|year=2006|volume=6|issue=2|pages=201–220|url=http://islamicgroupatasu.wikispaces.com/file/view/Van+den+bos.pdf|accessdate=30 September 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0374.2006.00141.x}}</ref> The location-based networking features of mobile applications such as China's [[WeChat]] have also created de facto online diaspora communities when used outside of their home markets.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chester|first=Ken|title=How WeChat And Zalo Shine a Light On The Asian American Diaspora|url=http://www.techinasia.com/wechat-zalo-asian-american-diaspora/|accessdate=30 September 2013|newspaper=Tech in Asia|date=7 August 2013}}</ref> Furthermore, in this evolutionary process, in which web-based portals and forums are created to aid Diaspora’s, is that, platforms are not only focusing on specific communities. The term Diaspora is evolving towards a more general term that can apply to a vast percentage of the World population and platforms have been developed to engage with them (e.g. [https://www.diasporaengager.com/ DiasporaEngager.com]).<ref>[https://DiasporaEngager.com/  DiasporaEngager: International diaspora engagement social media]</ref> Recently a global map of the international diasporas and their stakeholders has been made by '''DiasporaEngager''' ([https://www.diasporaengager.com/map DiasporaEngager.com/map]).<ref>[https://diasporaengager.com/map/ '''Diaspora Map''': Map of the International Diasporas and their Stakeholders]</ref>
