Players take turns taking shots, and the last person standing is the winner. Some games have rules involving the &quot;cascade&quot;, &quot;fountain&quot; or &quot;waterfall&quot;, which encourages each player to drink constantly from their cup so long as the player before him does not stop drinking. Such games can also favor speed over quantity, in which players race to drink a case of beer the fastest. Often drinking large amounts will be combined with a stylistic element or an abnormal method of drinking, as with the<space/><link><target>boot of beer</target></link>,<space/><link><target>yard of ale</target></link><space/>or a<space/><link><target>keg stand</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Tolerance games are simply about seeing which player can last the longest.

Some say that the most important skill to improving speed is to relax and take fewer but larger gulps. There are a variety of individual tactics to accomplishing this, such as bending the knees in anticipation, or when drinking from a plastic cup, squeezing the sides of the cup to form a more perfect funnel.</paragraph><paragraph>Athletic races involving alcohol including the<space/><link><target>beer mile</target></link>, which consists of a mile run with a can of beer consumed before each of the four laps.
