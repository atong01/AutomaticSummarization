This was carried out in worsening weather, and by the time the refuelling was complete and the call was made for the passengers to re-board the aircraft, the wintry showers had taken hold and snow had settled heavily on the runway and around the airport. There were two aborted take-offs which led to concern on board, and the passengers were advised by a stewardess to disembark again while a minor technical error was fixed.</paragraph><paragraph>The team was back in the airport terminal barely ten minutes when the call to reconvene on the plane came, and a number of passengers began to feel nervous. Charlton and teammate<space/><link><target>Dennis Viollet</target></link><space/>swapped places with<space/><link><target>Tommy Taylor</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>David Pegg</target></link>, who had decided they would be safer at the back of the plane.</paragraph><paragraph>The plane clipped the fence at the end of the runway on its next take-off attempt and a wing tore through a nearby house, setting it alight. The wing and part of the tail came off and hit a tree and a wooden hut, the plane spinning along the snow until coming to a halt. It had been cut in half.</paragraph><paragraph>Charlton, strapped into his seat, had fallen out of the cabin and when United goalkeeper<space/><link><target>Harry Gregg</target></link><space/>(who had somehow got through a hole in the plane unscathed and begun a one-man rescue mission) found him, he thought he was dead. That said, he grabbed both Charlton and Viollet by their trouser waistbands and dragged them away from the plane in constant fear that it would explode. Gregg returned to the plane to try to help the appallingly injured Busby and Blanchflower, and when he turned around again, he was relieved to see that Charlton and Viollet, both of whom he had presumed to be dead, had got out of their detached seats and were looking into the wreckage.</paragraph><paragraph>Charlton suffered cuts to his head and severe<space/><link><target>shock (circulatory)</target><part>shock</part></link><space/>and was in hospital for a week. Seven of his teammates had perished at the scene, including Taylor and Pegg, with whom he and Viollet had swapped seats prior to the fatal take-off attempt. Club captain<space/><link><target>Roger Byrne</target></link><space/>was also killed, along with<space/><link><target>Mark Jones (footballer, born 1933)</target><part>Mark Jones</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Liam Whelan</target><part>Billy Whelan</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Eddie Colman</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Geoff Bent</target></link>.<space/><link><target>Duncan Edwards</target></link><space/>died a fortnight later from the injuries he had sustained. In total, the crash claimed 23 lives. Initially, ice on the wings was blamed, but a later inquiry declared that<space/><link><target>slush</target></link><space/>on the runway had made a safe take-off almost impossible.</paragraph><paragraph>Of the 44 passengers and crew (including the 17-strong Manchester United squad), 23 people (eight of them Manchester United players) died as a result of their injures in the crash. Charlton survived with minor injuries. Of the eight other players who survived, two of them were injured so badly that they never played again.</paragraph><paragraph>Charlton was the first injured survivor to leave hospital.<space/><link><target>Harry Gregg</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Bill Foulkes</target></link><space/>were not hospitalized since they escaped uninjured. He arrived back in England on 14 February 1958, eight days after the crash. As he convalesced with family in Ashington, he spent some time kicking a ball around with local youths, and a famous photograph of him was taken. He was still only 20 years old, yet now there was an expectation that he would help with the rebuilding of the club as Busby's aides tried to piece together what remained of the season.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Resuming his career</heading><paragraph>Charlton returned to playing in an FA cup tie against West Bromwich Albion on 1 March; the game was a draw and United won the replay 10. Not unexpectedly, United went out of the European Cup to<space/><link><target>A.C. Milan</target><part>Milan</part></link><space/>in the semi-finals to a 52 aggregate defeat and fell behind in the League. Yet somehow they reached their second consecutive FA Cup final, and the big day at Wembley coincided with Busby's return to work. However, his words could not inspire a side which was playing on a nation's goodwill and sentiment, and<space/><link><target>Nat Lofthouse</target></link><space/>scored twice to give<space/><link><target>Bolton Wanderers F.C.</target><part>Bolton Wanderers</part></link><space/>side a 20 win.</paragraph><paragraph>Further success with Manchester United came at last when they beat<space/><link><target>Leicester City F.C.</target><part>Leicester City</part></link><space/>31 in the FA Cup final of 1963, with Charlton finally earning a winners' medal in his third final. Busby's post-Munich rebuilding programme continued to progress with two League championships within three seasons, with United taking the title in 1965 and 1967. A successful (though trophyless) season with Manchester United had seen him take the honours of<space/><italics><link><target>Football Writers' Association</target><part>Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year</part></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>Ballon d'Or</target><part>European Footballer Of The Year</part></link></italics><space/>into the competition.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1968, Manchester United reached the<space/><link><target>1968 European Cup Final</target><part>European Cup final</part></link>, ten seasons after Munich.
