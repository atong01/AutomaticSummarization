==Early life and education==
Wiles was born in 1953 in [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]], England, the son of [[Maurice Wiles|Maurice Frank Wiles]] (1923–2005), the [[Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford]],<ref name="whoswho"/> and Patricia Wiles (née Mowll). His father worked as the Chaplain at [[Ridley Hall, Cambridge]], for the years 1952–55. Wiles attended King's College School, Cambridge, and [[The Leys School, Cambridge]].

Wiles states that he came across Fermat's Last Theorem on his way home from school when he was 10 years old. He stopped by his local library where he found a book about the theorem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/wiles.html |title=NOVA &#124; Andrew Wiles on Solving Fermat |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref> Fascinated by the existence of a theorem that was so easy to state that he, a ten-year-old, could understand it, but nobody had proven it, he decided to be the first person to prove it. However, he soon realised that his knowledge was too limited, so he abandoned his childhood dream, until it was brought back to his attention at the age of 33 by [[Ken Ribet]]'s 1986 proof of the [[epsilon conjecture]], which [[Gerhard Frey]] had previously linked to Fermat's famous equation.

==Mathematical career==
Wiles earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in mathematics in 1974 at [[Merton College, Oxford]], and a PhD in 1980 at [[Clare College, Cambridge]]. After a stay at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[New Jersey]] in 1981, Wiles became a professor at [[Princeton University]]. In 1985–86, Wiles was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] near Paris and at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. From 1988 to 1990, Wiles was a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor at the [[University of Oxford]], and then he returned to Princeton. He rejoined Oxford in 2011 as Royal Society Research Professor.

Wiles's graduate research was guided by [[John Coates (mathematician)|John Coates]] beginning in the summer of 1975. Together these colleagues worked on the arithmetic of [[elliptic curve]]s with [[complex multiplication]] by the methods of [[Iwasawa theory]]. He further worked with [[Barry Mazur]] on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over the [[rational number]]s, and soon afterward, he generalised this result to [[totally real field]]s.

==The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem==
{{main|Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem}}

Starting in the summer of 1986, based on successive progress of the previous few years of [[Gerhard Frey]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Ken Ribet]], it became clear that [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] could be proven as a corollary of a limited form of the [[modularity theorem]] (unproven at the time and then known as the "Taniyama–Shimura-Weil conjecture"). The modularity theorem involved elliptic curves, which was also Wiles' own specialist area.

The conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important, but extraordinarily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove.<ref name="Singh">''[[Fermat's Last Theorem]]'', [[Simon Singh]], 1997, ISBN 1-85702-521-0</ref>{{rp|203–205, 223, 226}} For example, Wiles' ex-supervisor [[John H. Coates|John Coates]] states that it seemed "impossible to actually prove",<ref name="Singh" />{{rp|226}} and Ken Ribet considered himself "one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible", adding that "Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it]."<ref name="Singh" />{{rp|223}}

Despite this, Wiles, who had had a childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem, decided to undertake the challenge of proving the conjecture at least to the extent needed for Frey's curve.<ref name="Singh" />{{rp|226}} He dedicated all of his research time to this problem for over 6 years in near-total secrecy, covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only in his wife.<ref name="Singh" />{{rp|229–230}} In 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last=Kolata|first=Gina|title=At Last, Shout of 'Eureka!' In Age-Old Math Mystery|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/24/us/at-last-shout-of-eureka-in-age-old-math-mystery.html|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 June 1993}}</ref> In August 1993 it was discovered that the proof contained a flaw in one area. Wiles tried and failed for over a year to repair his proof. According to Wiles, the crucial idea for circumventing, rather than closing this area, came to him on 19 September 1994 when he was on the verge of giving up. Together with his former student [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], he published a second paper which circumvented the problem and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in 1995 in a special volume of the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''.

==Recognition by the media==
His proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] has stood up to the scrutiny of the world's other mathematical experts. Wiles was interviewed for an episode of the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]''<ref name="horizon">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074rxx |title=BBC TWO, Horizon Fermat's Last Theorem |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref> that focused on Fermat's Last Theorem. This was renamed "The Proof", and it was made an episode of the [[Public Broadcasting Service]]'s science television series ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]''.<ref>{{cite web|year=1997|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/|title=NOVA Online: The Proof|publisher=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]|accessdate=3 May 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060501060938/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/| archivedate= 1 May 2006 | deadurl= no}}</ref> His work and life are also mentioned in great detail in [[Simon Singh]]'s popular book, [[Fermat's Last Theorem (book)|Fermat's Last Theorem]]. He has been a foreign member of the [[US National Academy of Sciences]] since 1996.

Wiles nomination for election to the [[Royal Society]] reads:
{{quote|Andrew Wiles is almost unique amongst number-theorists in his ability to bring to bear new tools and new ideas on some of the most intractable problems of number theory. His finest achievement to date has been his proof, in joint work with Mazur, of the "main conjecture" of Iwasawa theory for cyclotomic extensions of the rational field. This work settles many of the basic problems on [[cyclotomic field]]s which go back to Kummer, and is unquestionably one of the major advances in number theory in our times. Earlier he did deep work on the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer for elliptic curves with complex multiplication – one offshoot of this was his proof of an unexpected and beautiful generalisation of the classical explicit reciprocity laws of Artin-Hasse-Iwasawa. Most recently, he has made new progress on the construction of l-adic representations attached to Hilbert modular forms, and has applied these to prove the "main conjecture" for cyclotomic extensions of totally real fields – again a remarkable result since none of the classical tools of cyclotomic fields applied to these problems.<ref name="royal">{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1989%2F39%27) |title = EC/1989/39: Wiles, Sir Andrew John |publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=26 May 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6PqVmzjmR |location=London}}</ref>}}

==In popular culture==
* An episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', filmed while Wiles was researching the proof, asserted that Fermat's Last Theorem remains unproven in the 24th century. An episode of ''[[Facets (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' mentioned Wiles's proof.
* He was also mentioned in [[Stieg Larsson]]'s second book of the Millennium trilogy ''[[The Girl Who Played With Fire]]'', and also the third, ''[[The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest]]''. Wiles was credited with solving Fermat's Last Theorem when the female protagonist [[Lisbeth Salander]] attempted to solve it.
* [[Tom Lehrer]] updated the lyrics to his song ''That's Mathematics'', to mention that Wiles "confirms what Fermat / Jotted down in that margin / Which could've used some enlargin'."
* Rock band [[Bats (band)|Bats]] have a song named after Wiles which describes his career.
* Rock Band Kineto wrote a song about his endless pursuit to solve Fermat's Last Theorem.
* Wiles and his achievement are also mentioned in [[Yoko Ogawa]]'s novel ''[[The Housekeeper and the Professor]]''.
* Wiles' 1993 presentation in Cambridge is mentioned in the novel ''[[The Oxford Murders (novel)|The Oxford Murders]]'' by [[Guillermo Martínez (writer)|Guillermo Martínez]], which was adapted into a film of [[The Oxford Murders (film)|the same title]]. In the film, Wiles is represented as "Professor Wilkes" of Cambridge who addressed "Bormat's Last Theorem".
