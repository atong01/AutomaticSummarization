'''Coal''' (from the Old English term ''col'', which has meant "mineral of fossilized carbon" since the 13th century)<ref>{{OEtymD|coal}}</ref> is a [[combustible]] black or brownish-black [[sedimentary rock]] usually occurring in [[stratum|rock strata]] in layers or veins called '''coal beds<!-- redirected term title-->''' or '''coal seams'''. The harder forms, such as [[anthracite|anthracite coal]], can be regarded as [[metamorphic rock]] because of later exposure to elevated temperature and [[pressure]]. Coal is composed primarily of [[carbon]] along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly  [[hydrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Blander|first=M|title=Calculations of the Influence of Additives on Coal Combustion Deposits|url=http://www.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/Volumes/Vol34-2.pdf|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate=17 December 2011|page=315}}</ref>

Throughout history, coal has been used as an energy resource, primarily burned for the production of electricity and/or heat, and is also used for industrial purposes, such as refining metals. A [[fossil fuel]], coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into [[peat]], which in turn is converted into [[lignite]], then sub-bituminous coal, after that [[bituminous coal]], and lastly [[anthracite]]. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over a long period. The United States [[Energy Information Administration]] estimates coal [[Mineral resource classification|reserves]] at {{val|948|e=9}} [[short ton]]s (860 [[Gigatonne|Gt]]).<ref name=EIAreserves/> One estimate for [[Mineral resource classification|resources]] is 18 000 Gt.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fire in the hole: After fracking comes coal|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=Feb 15, 2014|pages=36–41|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129560.400-fire-in-the-hole-after-fracking-comes-coal.html?full=true|author=Fred Pearce|authorlink=Fred Pearce}}</ref>

Coal is the largest source of energy for the [[Electricity generation|generation of electricity]] worldwide, as well as one of the largest worldwide [[anthropogenic]] sources of [[carbon dioxide]] releases.

Coal is extracted from the ground by [[coal mining]], either underground by [[shaft mining]], or at ground level by [[open pit mining]] extraction. Since 1983 the world top coal producer has been [[China]].<ref name="BPReview2011"/> In 2011 China produced 3,520 million tonnes of coal – 49.5% of 7,695 million tonnes world coal production. In 2011 other large producers were [[United States]] (993 million tonnes), [[India]] (589), [[European Union]] (576) and Australia (416).<ref name="BPReview2011"/> In 2010 the largest exporters were Australia with 328 million tonnes (27.1% of world coal export) and [[Indonesia]] with 316 million tonnes (26.1%),<ref name=ei/> while the largest importers were [[Japan]] with 207 million tonnes (17.5% of world coal import), China with 195 million tonnes (16.6%) and [[South Korea]] with 126 million tonnes (10.7%).<ref name=eim/>

The extraction of coal, its use in energy production and its byproducts are all associated with severe environmental and health effects.<ref name =psr/>

==Formation==
[[File:Struktura chemiczna węgla kamiennego.svg|thumb|Example chemical structure of coal]]

At various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. As coal contains mainly carbon, the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonization.<ref>{{Cite book| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009}}</ref>

The wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous]] Period provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods. The exception is the coal gap in the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], where coal is rare. Coal is known from [[Precambrian]] strata, which predate land plants — this coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae.<ref name="Tyler1957">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1130/0016-7606(1957)68[1293:ACFPUH]2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Tyler | first1 = S.

==Ranks==

[[File:Coal Rank USGS.png|thumb|Coal ranking system used in the United States (US Geological Survey)]]

As geological processes apply [[pressure]] to dead [[biotic material]] over time, under suitable conditions, its [[metamorphic grade]] increases successively into:
* [[Peat]], considered to be a precursor of coal, has industrial importance as a fuel in some regions, for example, Ireland and Finland. In its dehydrated form, peat is a highly effective absorbent for fuel and oil spills on land and water. It is also used as a conditioner for soil to make it more able to retain and slowly release water.
* [[Lignite]], or brown coal, is the lowest rank of coal and used almost exclusively as fuel for electric power generation. [[jet (lignite)|Jet]], a compact form of lignite, is sometimes polished and has been used as an ornamental stone since the [[Upper Palaeolithic]].
* [[Sub-bituminous coal]], whose properties range from those of lignite to those of bituminous coal, is used primarily as fuel for steam-electric power generation and is an important source of light [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s for the [[chemical synthesis]] industry.
* [[Bituminous coal]] is a dense sedimentary rock, usually black, but sometimes dark brown, often with well-defined bands of bright and dull material; it is used primarily as fuel in steam-electric power generation, with substantial quantities used for heat and power applications in manufacturing and to make [[coke (fuel)|coke]].
* "Steam coal" is a grade between bituminous coal and anthracite, once widely used as a fuel for [[steam locomotive]]s. In this specialized use, it is sometimes known as "sea-coal" in the US.<ref>[[Funk and Wagnalls]], quoted in {{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|edition=2|chapter=sea-coal}}</ref> Small steam coal (dry small steam nuts or DSSN) was used as a fuel for domestic [[water heating]].
* [[Anthracite]], the highest rank of coal, is a harder, glossy black coal used primarily for residential and commercial [[space heating]]. It may be divided further into metamorphically altered bituminous coal and "petrified oil", as from the deposits in Pennsylvania.
* [[Graphite]] is one of the more difficult coals to ignite and is not commonly used as fuel — it is mostly used in pencils, and when powdered, as a [[lubricant]].

The classification of coal is generally based on the content of volatiles. However, the exact classification varies between countries. According to the German classification, coal is classified as follows:<ref>Eberhard Lindner; Chemie für Ingenieure; Lindner Verlag Karlsruhe, S. 258</ref>

The middle six grades in the table represent a progressive transition from the English-language sub-bituminous to bituminous coal, while the last class is an approximate equivalent to anthracite, but more inclusive (US anthracite has < 6% volatiles).

[[Cannel coal]] (sometimes called "candle coal") is a variety of fine-grained, high-rank coal with significant hydrogen content. It consists primarily of "[[exinite]]" [[maceral]]s, now termed "liptinite".

===Hilt's law===

{{main|Hilt's law}}

[[Hilt's law]] is a geological term that states that, in a small area, the deeper the coal, the higher its rank (grade). The law holds true if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical, but metamorphism may cause lateral changes of rank, irrespective of depth.

An alternative approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) power plant. Instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam-generating boiler, the coal can be first gasified (see [[coal gasification]]) to create [[syngas]], which is burned in a [[gas turbine]] to produce electricity (just like natural gas is burned in a turbine). Hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a [[heat recovery steam generator]] which powers a supplemental [[steam turbine]]. Thermal efficiencies of current IGCC power plants range from 39-42%<ref>{{cite web | title = IGCC Efficiency/Performance | publisher = National Energy Technology Laboratory | url = http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/igcc-efficiency | accessdate =16 July 2014}}</ref> (HHV basis) or ~42-45% (LHV basis) for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies (Shell, GE Gasifier, CB&I). IGCC power plants outperform conventional pulverized coal-fueled plants in terms of pollutant emissions, and allow for relatively easy carbon capture.

===Coking coal and use of coke===
{{Main|Coke (fuel)}}
[[File:Coke Ovens Abercwmboi.jpg|right|thumb|Coke oven at a [[smokeless fuel]] plant in [[Wales]], [[United Kingdom]]]]

Coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal (metallurgical coal), from which the volatile constituents are driven off by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000&nbsp;°C (1,832&nbsp;°F), so the fixed carbon and residual ash are fused together. Metallurgical coke is used as a fuel and as a [[reducing agent]] in smelting [[iron]] ore in a [[blast furnace]].<ref>[http://www.steelonthenet.com/cost-bof.html Blast furnace steelmaking cost model]. Steelonthenet.com. Retrieved on 24 August 2012.</ref> The result is [[pig iron]], and is too rich in dissolved carbon, so it must be treated further to make [[steel]]. The coking coal should be low in [[sulfur]] and [[phosphorus]], so they do not migrate to the metal. Based on the ash percentage, the coking coal can be divided into various grades. These grades are:
* Steel Grade - I (Not exceeding 15%)
* Steel Grade -II (Exceeding 15% but not exceeding 18%)
* Washery Grade -I (Exceeding 18% but not exceeding 21%)
* Washery Grade -II (Exceeding 21% but not exceeding 24%)
* Washery Grade -III (Exceeding 24% but not exceeding 28%)
* Washery Grade -IV (Exceeding 28% but not exceeding 35%)
<ref>[http://www.coal.nic.in/content/coal-grades "Coal Grades"],"Ministry of Coal"</ref>
The coke must be [[Coke strength after reaction|strong enough]] to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace, which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route. However, the alternative route is [[direct reduced iron]], where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron. Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 24.8 million Btu/ton (29.6 MJ/kg). Some cokemaking processes produce valuable byproducts, including [[coal tar]], [[ammonia]], light oils, and [[coal gas]].

[[Petroleum coke]] is the solid residue obtained in [[oil refining]], which resembles coke, but contains too many impurities to be useful in metallurgical applications.

===Gasification===
{{Main|Coal gasification|Underground coal gasification}}
Coal gasification can be used to produce [[syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas. Often syngas is used to fire gas turbines to produce electricity, but the versatility of syngas also allows it to be converted into transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, through the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]; alternatively, syngas can be converted into [[methanol]], which can be blended into fuel directly or converted to gasoline via the methanol to gasoline process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/methanol-to-gasoline |title=Conversion of Methanol to Gasoline |publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory |accessdate=2014-07-16}}</ref> Gasification combined with Fischer-Tropsch technology is currently used by the [[Sasol]] chemical company of [[South Africa]] to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas. Alternatively, the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for various purposes, such as powering a [[hydrogen economy]], making ammonia, or upgrading fossil fuels.

During gasification, the coal is mixed with [[oxygen]] and [[steam]] while also being heated and pressurized. During the reaction, oxygen and water molecules [[oxidize]] the coal into carbon monoxide (CO), while also releasing [[hydrogen]] gas (H<sub>2</sub>). This process has been conducted in both underground coal mines and in the production of [[town gas]].

: C (''as Coal'') + O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → H<sub>2</sub> + CO

If the refiner wants to produce gasoline, the syngas is collected at this state and routed into a Fischer-Tropsch reaction. If hydrogen is the desired end-product, however, the syngas is fed into the [[water gas shift reaction]], where more hydrogen is liberated.

: CO + H<sub>2</sub>O → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>

In the past, coal was converted to make coal gas ([[town gas]]), which was piped to customers to burn for illumination, heating, and cooking.

===Liquefaction===
{{Main|Coal liquefaction}}

Coal can also be converted into [[synthetic fuel]]s equivalent to [[gasoline]] or [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] by several different direct processes (which do not intrinsically require gasification or indirect conversion).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/direct-liquefaction|title=Direct Liquefaction Processes|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory|accessdate=2014-07-16}}</ref> In the direct liquefaction processes, the coal is either [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] or [[carbonization|carbonized]]. Hydrogenation processes are the [[Bergius process]],<ref>{{Cite journal| first = Robert|last= Haul| title = Friedrich Bergius (1884–1949)| page = 62 |journal = Chemie in unserer Zeit| publisher = VCH-Verlagsgesellschaft mbH| volume= 19|date= April 1985| doi=10.1002/ciuz.19850190205}}</ref> the SRC-I and SRC-II (Solvent Refined Coal) processes, the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process<ref name=handbook2>

These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar. The coal tar is then further processed into fuels. An overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Höök, M., Aleklett, K.|url=http://www.tsl.uu.se/uhdsg/Publications/CTL_Article.pdf |doi=10.1002/er.1596|title=A review on coal-to-liquid fuels and its coal consumption|year=2010|journal=International Journal of Energy Research|volume=34|issue=10|pages=848}}</ref>

Coal liquefaction methods involve carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) emissions in the conversion process. If coal liquefaction is done without employing either [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) technologies or biomass blending, the result is lifecycle greenhouse gas footprints that are generally greater than those released in the extraction and refinement of liquid fuel production from [[crude oil]]. If CCS technologies are employed, reductions of 5–12% can be achieved in [[Coal to liquids|Coal to Liquid (CTL)]] plants and up to a 75% reduction is achievable when co-gasifying coal with commercially demonstrated levels of biomass (30% biomass by weight) in coal/biomass-to-liquids plants.<ref>{{cite journal| author= Tarka, Thomas J.; Wimer, John G.; Balash, Peter C.; Skone, Timothy J.; Kern, Kenneth C.; Vargas, Maria C.; Morreale, Bryan D.; White III, Charles W.; Gray, David| title=Affordable Low Carbon Diesel from Domestic Coal and Biomass| publisher= [[United States Department of Energy]], [[National Energy Technology Laboratory]]| year=2009| page=21}}</ref> For future [[synthetic fuel]] projects, [[carbon dioxide sequestration]] is proposed to avoid releasing {{CO2}} into the atmosphere. Sequestration adds to the cost of production.

===Refined coal===
{{Main|Refined coal}}
Refined coal is the product of a coal-upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals. It is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal's characteristics before it is burned. The goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned. Depending on the situation, precombustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers.

===Industrial processes {{anchor|Industrial processes|Sea coal}}===
Finely ground bituminous coal, known in this application as sea coal, is a constituent of [[foundry sand]]. While the molten metal is in the [[Molding (process)|mould]], the coal burns slowly, releasing [[Reducing agent|reducing gases]] at pressure, and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand. It is also contained in 'mould wash', a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=P. N.|title=Manufacturing technology: foundry, forming and welding|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|location=New Delhi|year=2007|edition=2|page=107|chapter=Moulding materials|isbn=978-0-07-463180-5}}</ref> Sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining (the "bod") used for the bottom of a [[cupola furnace]]. When heated, the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable, easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=Edward|title=Cupola Furnace – A Practical Treatise on the Construction and Management of Foundry Cupolas|publisher=Baird|location=Philadelphia, PA|year=1899|page=95|chapter=Cupola management|oclc=2884198}}</ref>

===Production of chemicals===
[[File:Coal to chemicals routes diagram.jpg|right|thumb|Production of Chemicals from Coal]]

Coal is an important feedstock in production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chemicals|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/chemicals|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> The main route to these products is [[coal gasification]] to produce [[syngas]]. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others. The versatility of [[syngas]] as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using relatively inexpensive coal to produce a wide range of valuable commodities.

Historically, production of chemicals from coal has been used since the 1950s and has become established in the market. According to the 2010 Worldwide Gasification Database,<ref name=DOEGasificationDatabase2010>{{cite web|title=Gasification Systems 2010 Worldwide Gasification Database|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/gasification/worlddatabase/|publisher=United States Department of Energy|accessdate=March 3, 2013}}</ref> a survey of current and planned gasifiers, from 2004 to 2007 chemical production increased its gasification product share from 37% to 45%. From 2008 to 2010, 22% of new gasifier additions were to be for chemical production.

Because the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa, China, India and the United States where there are abundant coal resources. The abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in China is strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry pursued there. In the United States, the best example of the industry is Eastman Chemical Company which has been successfully operating a coal-to-chemicals plant at its Kingsport, Tennessee, site since 1983. Similarly, Sasol has built and operated coal-to-chemicals facilities in South Africa.

Coal to chemical processes do require substantial quantities of water. As of 2013 much of the coal to chemical production was in the People's Republic of China<ref name=OILDRUM9371>{{cite web|title=China's Coal to Chemical Future|url=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/9371|publisher=The Oil Drum.Com|accessdate=3 March 2013|author="Rembrandt"|format=Blog post by expert|date=2 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=ICIS022712>{{cite news|title=China develops coal-to-olefins projects, which could lead to ethylene self-sufficiency|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2012/02/27/9535534/china-develops-coal-to-olefins-projects-which-could-lead-to-ethylene.html|author=Ken Yin|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=ICIS Chemical Business|date=27 February 2012}}</ref> where environmental regulation and [[Water resource management|water management]]<ref name=IHT02513>{{cite news|title=Worse Than Poisoned Water: Dwindling Water, in China's North|url=http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/worse-than-poisoned-water-dwindling-water-in-chinas-north-and-west/|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|date=5 February 2013|author=Didi Kirsten Tatlow|format=Blog in edited newspaper}}</ref> was weak.<ref name=NYT020213>{{cite news|title=Spill in China Underlines Environmental Concerns|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/world/asia/spill-in-china-lays-bare-environmental-concerns.html|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 March 2013}}</ref>

==Coal as a traded commodity==
In North America, Central [[Appalachia]]n coal [[futures contract]]s are currently traded on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] (trading symbol ''QL''). The trading unit is {{convert|1550|ST|t}} per contract, and is quoted in U.S. dollars and cents per ton. Since coal is the principal fuel for generating electricity in the United States, coal futures contracts provide coal producers and the [[Electrical power industry|electric power industry]] an important tool for [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] and [[risk management]].<ref>{{cite web | title=NYMEX.com: Coal | url=http://www.nymex.com/coa_fut_descri.aspx| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080312083033/http://www.nymex.com/coa_fut_descri.aspx| archivedate=2008-03-12| accessdate=16 January 2008}}</ref>

===Health effects===

Despite significant economic benefits of using coal as fuel, a number of adverse health<ref>[http://www.lungusa.org/assets/documents/healthy-air/toxic-air-report.pdf Toxic Air: The Case for Cleaning Up Coal-fired Power Plants].

Union of Concerned Scientists</ref> especially in [[power station]]s, and of [[coal mining]], exist. The [[Pea soup fog#London|London smog]] was caused in part by the heavy use of coal for heating and cooking.

It has been estimated that coal-fired power plants cause nearly 24,000 premature deaths annually in the United States, including 2,800 from [[lung cancer]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5174391/ "Deadly power plants?

The [[American Lung Association]], the [[American Nurses' Association]], and the [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]] released a report in 2009 which detailed in depth the detrimental effects coal has on human health, on both workers in the mines, as well as individuals living in communities where coal is burned as a power source. The report provides detailed medical information on how the burning of coal for fuel damages the lungs, heart, and nervous system. Coal as an environmental air pollutant has been shown to contribute to asthma, strokes, reduced intelligence, artery blockages, heart attacks, congestive heart failure, arrythmias, mercury poisoining, arterial occlusion, and lung cancer.<ref name =psr>http://www.psr.org/news-events/press-releases/coal-pollution-damages-human-health.html.</ref>  More recently, the Chicago School of Public Health released a largely similar report, echoing many of the same findings.<ref>http://noharm.org/lib/downloads/climate/Coal_Literature_Review_2.pdf</ref> A 2010 study by the Clean Air Task Force estimated "that air pollution from coal-fired power plants accounts for more than 13,000 premature deaths, 20,000 heart attacks, and 1.6 million lost workdays in the U.S. each year. The total monetary cost of these health impacts is over $100 billion annually.<ref>http://www.rmi.org/RFGraph-health_effects_from_US_power_plant_emissions</ref>

Around 10% of coal is ash, and the US alone consumes of the order of 1,000,000,000 tones of coal per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-and-you/affect/coal.html|title=Coal|work=epa.gov}}</ref> This means that use of coal generates hundreds of millions of tons of waste products per year. These include [[fly ash]], [[bottom ash]], and [[flue-gas desulfurization]] sludge, that contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[uranium]], [[thorium]], [[arsenic]], and other [[heavy metals]], along with non-metals such as [[selenium]].<ref>World Coal Association [http://www.worldcoal.org/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=127 "Environmental impact of Coal Use"]</ref> Uranium and thorium are radioactive elements that add to the radiation dose, especially for those living near coal plants.<ref name="sa-coal-ash-more-rdactiv">{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste|title=Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste|author=Mara Hvistendahl|work=scientificamerican.com}}</ref>

===Environmental effects===
Water systems are also affected by coal.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Environmental Impact of Coal Mining on Water Regime and Its Management|author=R. K. Tiwary|journal=Water, Air and Soil Pollution|year=2001|volume=132|pages=185–199}}</ref> For example, mining affects with [[groundwater]] and [[water table]] levels and acidity. Spills of fly ash, such as the [[Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill]], can also contaminate land and waterways, and destroy homes. Power stations that burn coal also consume large quantities of water. This can affect the flows of rivers, and has consequential impacts on other land uses.

One of the earliest known impacts of coal on the water cycle was [[acid rain]]. Approximately 75 Tg/S per year of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulphur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The oxidation rate and residence time of sulphur dioxide in the arctic atmosphere|author=L.A. Barrie, R.M. Hoff|journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=18|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2711–2722}}</ref> whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Release of SO<sub>2</sub> also contributes to the widespread acidification of ecosystems.<ref>Human Impacts on Atmospheric Chemistry, by PJ Crutzen and J Lelieveld, Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Vol. 29: 17 -45 (Volume publication date May 2001)</ref>

Disused coal mines can also cause issues. Subsidence can occur above tunnels, causing damage to infrastructure or cropland. Coal mining can also cause long lasting fires, and it has been estimated that [[coal seam fire|around 1000 coal seam fires are burning at any given time]]. For example, there is a [[Coal seam fire#Germany|coal seam fire in Germany]] that has been burning since 1668, and is still burning in the 21st century.

Some environmental impacts are modest, such as dust nuisance. However, perhaps the largest and most long term effect of coal use is the release of carbon dioxide, a [[greenhouse gas]] that causes [[climate change]] and [[global warming]], according to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]. Coal is the largest contributor to the human-made increase of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2007/IowaCoal_20071105.pdf Direct Testimony of James E. Hansen]. State of Iowa</ref>

===Clean coal technology===
{{Main|Clean coal technology}}

"Clean" coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed to mitigate the environmental impact of coal energy generation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c01.html |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |title= Coal vs. Wind |accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref> Those technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing [[mineral]]s and impurities from the coal, [[gasification]] (see also [[Integrated gasification combined cycle|IGCC]]), improved technology for treating [[flue]] gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the [[flue gas]] and dewatering lower rank coals ([[brown coal]]s) to improve the [[calorific value]], and thus the efficiency of the conversion into [[electricity]]. Figures from the United States Environmental Protection Agency show that these technologies have made today's coal-based generating fleet 77 percent cleaner on the basis of regulated emissions per unit of energy produced.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/ | publisher=Environmental Protection Agency | title=Air Trends}}</ref>

Clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal. Historically, the primary focus was on SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>, the most important gases in causation of [[acid rain]], and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health. More recent focus has been on carbon dioxide (due to its impact on [[global warming]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/coal/ |publisher= Massachusetts Institute of Technology |title=The Future of Coal |accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref> and concern over toxic species such as mercury.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/mats/powerplants.html |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |title= Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) |accessdate=2014-07-21}}</ref> Concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/30/fossilfuels-carbonemissions |publisher=The Guardian |title=Time to bury the 'clean coal' myth |accessdate=2008-12-23 | location=London | date=2008-10-30 | first=Fred | last=Pearce}}</ref> potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/cost-of-coal.pdf |publisher=Greenpeace |title=The True Cost of Coal |accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref> and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/ccs/ |publisher=University of Edinburgh, School of Geosciences |title=Carbon Capture and Storage |accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/07/02/carbon-capture-storage.html |publisher=Discovery Channel |title=Carbon Capture Plans get Reality Check |accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref>

Several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by  the clean coal concept:
*Pre-combustion capture - This involves [[gasification]] of a feedstock (such as coal) to form synthesis gas, which may be [[water-gas shift reaction|shifted]] to produce a H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>-rich gas mixture, from which the CO<sub>2</sub> can be efficiently captured and separated, transported, and ultimately sequestered,<ref>{{cite web|title=Pre-combustion Carbon Capture Research|url=http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/carbon-capture-and-storage-research/carbon-capture-rd/pre-combustion-carbon|website=Energy.gov|publisher=Office of Fossil Energy, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref> This technology is usually associated with [[Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle]] process configurations.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/18398/|title= Picking a Winner in Clean-Coal Technology}}</ref>
*Post-combustion capture - This refers to capture of CO<sub>2</sub> from exhaust gases of combustion processes, typically using sorbents, solvents, or membrane separations to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the bulk gases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Post-combustion Carbon Capture Research|url=http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/carbon-capture-and-storage-research/carbon-capture-rd/post-combustion-carbon|website=Energy.gov|publisher=Office of Fossil Energy, U.S. Department of Energy}}</ref>
*[[Oxy-fuel combustion]] - Fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient, low-cost CO<sub>2</sub> capture.<ref>{{cite web|title=R&D Facts - Oxy-Fuel Combustion|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/factsheets/rd/R&D127.pdf|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref>
The [[Kemper Project|Kemper County IGCC Project]], a 582 MW [[coal gasification]]-based power plant, will use pre-combustion capture of CO<sub>2</sub> to capture 65% of the CO<sub>2</sub> the plant produces, which will be utilized/geologically sequestered in [[enhanced oil recovery]] operations.<ref>{{cite web|title=IGCC Project Examples - Kemper County IGCC Project|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/project-examples#kemper|website=Gasifipedia|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref>

The Saskatchewan Government's Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project will use post-combustion, amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by Unit 3 of the power plant; this CO<sub>2</sub> will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/project/boundary-dam-integrated-carbon-capture-and-sequestration-demonstration-project|publisher=Global CCS Institute|accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref>

An early example of a coal-based plant using (oxy-fuel) carbon-capture technology is Swedish company [[Vattenfall]]'s [[Schwarze Pumpe power station]] located in [[Spremberg]], [[Germany]], built by German firm [[Siemens]], which went on-line in September 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vattenfall.com/www/co2_en/co2_en/index.jsp |publisher= Vattenfall | title= Vattenfall's Project on CSS}}</ref><ref name="discovermagazine"/> The facility captures CO<sub>2</sub> and acid rain producing pollutants, separates them, and compresses the CO<sub>2</sub> into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO<sub>2</sub> into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical.<ref name="discovermagazine">http://discovermagazine.com/2009/feb/25-can-clean-coal-actually-work/?searchterm=clean%20coal "Can Clean Coal Actually Work?" article in Feb. 2009 issue, page 18, Retrieved 2009-05-11</ref>

==Bioremediation==

The white rot fungus [[Trametes versicolor]] can grow on and metabolize naturally occurring coal.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://web.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/33_4_LOS%20ANGELES_09-88_0514.pdf|title=BIODEGRADATION OF COAL-RELAED MODEL COMPOUNDS|author1=J.

==Economic aspects==
Coal (by liquefaction technology) is one of the [[backstop resources]] that could limit escalation of [[oil prices]] and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under [[peak oil]]. This is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum. Estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic U.S. production of fuel from coal becomes cost-competitive with oil priced at around $35 per barrel,<ref>{{cite news | title=Diesel Fuel News: Ultra-clean fuels from coal liquefaction: China about to launch big projects – Brief Article | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYH/is_15_6/ai_89924477 |accessdate=9 September 2005 | work=Diesel Fuel News | first=Jack | last=Peckham | year=2002}}</ref> with the $35 being the break-even cost. With oil prices as low as around $40 per barrel in the U.S. as of December 2008, liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the U.S., but will probably be re-vitalized, similar to [[oil sand]] projects, with an oil price around $70 per barrel.

In China, due to an increasing need for liquid energy in the transportation sector, coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel.<ref>{{cite news |author=Tingting, Si and Jing, Li  | title=Coal-to-liquids project rescheduled to launch in early 2009 | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-12/12/content_7300666.htm |date=12 December 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2008 |newspaper=China Daily}}</ref> This is probably because China prefers not to be dependent on foreign oil, instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves. As oil prices were increasing during the first half of 2009, the coal liquefaction projects in China were again boosted, and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of $40.<ref>{{cite news | title=Sasol, Shenhua Group May Complete Coal-to-Fuel Plant by 2013 | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a.MSdPvb0Ep8|accessdate=10 January 2009 | work=Bloomberg | date=7 January 2009}}</ref>

China is the largest producer of coal in the world. It is the world's largest energy consumer, and relies on coal to supply 69% of its energy needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=ch|title=China |publisher=United States Energy Information Administration}}</ref> An estimated 5 million people worked in China's coal-mining industry in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1595235,00.html |title=Where The Coal Is Stained With Blood |work=TIME |date=2 March 2007 |first=Simon |last=Elegant|last2=Zhangjiachang |accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref>

==Energy density and carbon impact==
{{See also|Energy value of coal}}
The [[energy density]] of coal, i.e. its [[heating value]], is roughly 24 [[megajoule]]s per kilogram<ref>{{cite web | last = Fisher | first = Juliya | title = Energy Density of Coal | work = The Physics Factbook | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JuliyaFisher.shtml|year=2003|accessdate =25 August 2006}}</ref> (approximately 6.7 [[kilowatt-hours]] per kg). For a coal power plant with a 40% efficiency, it takes an estimated {{convert|325|kg|abbr=on}} of coal to power a 100&nbsp;W lightbulb for one year.<ref>{{cite web| title = How much coal is required to run a 100-watt light bulb 24 hours a day for a year?| work = Howstuffworks| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/question481.htm| accessdate =25 August 2006}}</ref>

As of 2006, the average efficiency of electricity-generating power stations was 31%; in 2002, coal represented about 23% of total global energy supply, an equivalent of 3.4 billion tonnes of coal, of which 2.8 billion tonnes were used for electricity generation.<ref>[http://www.euractiv.com/energy/analysis-efficiency-coal-fired-power-stations-evolution-prospects/article-154672 Analysis: Efficiency of coal-fired power stations – evolution and prospects].

==Underground fires==
{{Main|Coal seam fire}}
Thousands of coal fires are burning around the world.<ref>{{cite web | title=Sino German Coal fire project | url=http://www.coalfire.caf.dlr.de/projectareas/world_wide_distribution_en.html | accessdate=9 September 2005}}</ref> Those burning underground can be difficult to locate and many cannot be extinguished. Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their combustion gases are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface [[wildfire]]s. Coal seams can be set on fire by [[spontaneous combustion]] or contact with a [[mine fire]] or surface fire. Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition. The coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the flame front. A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire.<ref>{{cite web | title=Committee on Resources-Index | url=http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/archives/108/testimony/johnmasterson.htm | accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20050825231038/http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/archives/108/testimony/johnmasterson.htm |archivedate = 25 August 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Snapshots 2003 |work=fire.blm.gov| url=http://www.fire.blm.gov/textdocuments/6-27-03.pdf| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20060218013724/http://www.fire.blm.gov/textdocuments/6-27-03.pdf| archivedate=2006-02-18| accessdate=9 September 2005|format=PDF}}</ref> Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, amounting to 2–3% of the annual worldwide production of CO<sub>2</sub> from [[fossil fuels]].<ref>{{cite web | title=EHP 110-5, 2002: Forum | url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2002/110-5/forum.html | accessdate=9 September 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Overview about ITC's activities in China | url=http://www.itc.nl/personal/coalfire/activities/overview.html | accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20050616004903/http://www.itc.nl/personal/coalfire/activities/overview.html  |archivedate = 16 June 2005}}</ref> In [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] (a [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] located in the [[Coal Region]] of the [[United States]]), an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned [[anthracite coal|anthracite]] [[Surface mining|strip mine]] pit.

===World coal reserves===
The 948 billion short tons of recoverable coal reserves estimated by the Energy Information Administration are equal to about 4,196 BBOE (billion [[barrel of oil equivalent|barrels of oil equivalent]]).<!-- (948,000*0.907186*4.879) --><ref name=EIAreserves>{{cite web | title=EIA International Energy Statistics : Coal : Recoverable Reserves | url=http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=1&pid=7&aid=6| accessdate=31 May 2012}}</ref> The amount of coal burned during 2007 was estimated at 7.075 billion short tons, or 133.179 quadrillion BTU's.<ref>{{cite web | title=EIA International Energy Statistics : Coal : Consumption | url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=1&pid=1&aid=2 |accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> This is an average of 18.8 million BTU per short ton.

[[BP|British Petroleum]], in its 2007 report, estimated at 2006 end that there were 147 years [[reserves-to-production ratio]] based on ''proven'' coal reserves worldwide. This figure only includes reserves classified as "proven"; exploration drilling programs by mining companies, particularly in under-explored areas, are continually providing new reserves. In many cases, companies are aware of coal deposits that have not been sufficiently drilled to qualify as "proven". However, some nations haven't updated their information and assume reserves remain at the same levels even with withdrawals.

Of the three fossil fuels, coal has the most widely distributed reserves; coal is mined in over 100 countries, and on all continents except [[Antarctica]]. The largest reserves are found in the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Australia]] and [[India]]. Note the table below.

==Cultural usage==
Coal is the [[List of U.S. state minerals, rocks, stones and gemstones|official state mineral]] of [[Kentucky]].<ref name="Kentucky mineral">{{cite web|url=http://sos.ky.gov/kids/all/symbols/mineral.htm|title=Kentucky: Secretary of State – State Mineral|date=20 October 2009|accessdate=7 August 2011}}</ref> and the official state rock of [[Utah]];<ref name="Utah rock">{{cite web|url=http://pioneer.utah.gov/research/utah_symbols/rock.html|title=Utah State Rock – Coal|work=Pioneer: Utah's Online Library|publisher=Utah State Library Division|accessdate=7 August 2011}}</ref> both [[U.S. state]]s have a historic link to coal mining.

Some cultures hold that children who misbehave will receive only a lump of coal from [[Santa Claus]] for Christmas in their [[christmas stocking]]s instead of presents.

It is also customary and considered lucky in Scotland and the North of England to give coal as a gift on New Year's Day. This occurs as part of [[First-Foot]]ing and represents warmth for the year to come.
