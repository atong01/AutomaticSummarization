'''Bundaberg Rum''' is a dark [[rum]] produced in [[Bundaberg]], Australia. It is often referred to as "Bundy".
The Bundaberg Distilling Company owns its own [[cola]]-producing facility, which supplies the cola for its [[Alcopop|ready-to-drink]] Bundaberg Rum and Cola products.

==History==

Bundaberg Rum originated because the local sugar mills had a problem with what to do with the waste [[molasses]] after the sugar was extracted (it was heavy, difficult to transport and the costs of converting it to stock feed were rarely worth the effort). Sugar men first began to think of the profits that could be made from distilling. The vital meeting was held at the Royal Hotel on 1 August 1885, W M C Hickson served as the chairman, and other notables in attendance included all the big sugar mill owners of that time, W G Farquhar, F L Nott, S McDougall, T Penny, S H Bravo and A H Young, all to become the first directors of the Company. They started with a capital of [[pound sterling|₤]]5,000.<ref>{{citation|title=Bundy A Centenary History|first=Keith|last=Dunstan}}</ref>

The Bundaberg Distilling Company began its operations in 1888.

Bundaberg rum was first produced in 1889, production ceased from 1907 to 1914 and from 1936 to 1939 after fires, the second of which caused rum from the factory to spill into the nearby [[Burnett River]].<ref>{{citation|first=Julia|last=Robinson|title=Voices of Queensland: words from the sunshine state|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2001}}</ref>

H T Christsen Pty Ltd operated their own Bundaberg Rum bottling plant in Bourbong Street, Bundaberg at the rear of their large grocery and hardware business in the centre of town. The spirit was sold at UP and OP strength from their business. Spokesperson for the original family, Mr Rod Patch, recalls the origins of the shape of the current "Bundy Bottle". It originated from the Bushells Coffee Chicory bottle that Bundaberg folks sold to his grandfather at the firm for one penny a bottle, after which they were washed and filled with the famous spirit. The shape remains the same but the capacity has been increased to the current 700ml. Patch's great grandfather, Hans Truval Christsen, a  Danish immigrant from Copenhagen and his son Frederick Christsen had an employment policy of employing staff from the Salvation Army faith in the rum bottling process as they were less likely to be tempted to sample the spirit. The Christsen family supported settlement farming families through hard times and these good deeds were acknowledged with the naming of Christsen Park at Bargara Beach.

In 1961, the company introduced the [[polar bear]] as its unusual choice of mascot, to imply that the rum could ward off the coldest chill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundabergrum.com.au/explore/distillery/chapter/03 |title=Bundaberg Rum website – history section |accessdate=26 March 2008 |work=Bundaberg Rum website}}</ref>

In 2000, the Bundaberg Rum company and [[Distillation|distillery]] were sold to British company [[Diageo]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.just-drinks.com/news/diageo-acquires-bundaberg-rum-from-bundaberg-sugar-group-ltd_id78650.aspx |title=Diageo acquires Bundaberg Rum from Bundaberg Sugar Group Ltd|author=Diageo PLC|publisher=Just-Drinks|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140213221626/http://www.just-drinks.com/news/diageo-acquires-bundaberg-rum-from-bundaberg-sugar-group-ltd_id78650.aspx|archivedate=13 February 2014|date=6 December 2000}}</ref>

In 2014, A decision by Diageo to relocate the bottling operations of Queensland's iconic drink, "Bundaberg Rum", to the western Sydney suburb of [[Huntingwood, New South Wales|Huntingwood]] resulted in local job losses in the city that bears its name. The decision drew criticism from all levels of Queensland politics:
* Premier Campbell Newman said it was a disappointing move, particularly in a region that had suffered devastating floods in recent years.<ref name=Atfield>{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/workers-sacked-as-bundaberg-rum-bottling-moves-to-sydney-20140517-38glq.html|title=Workers sacked as Bundaberg Rum bottling moves to Sydney|first=Cameron|last=Atfield|date=18 May 2014|newspaper=Brisbane Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140607175745/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/workers-sacked-as-bundaberg-rum-bottling-moves-to-sydney-20140517-38glq.html|archivedate=7 June 2014}}</ref>
* Bundaberg mayor Mal Forman said "I'm saddened by the announcement, but I had been assured the company had a commitment to the city".
* Cr Forman said "I understood demand for bottled Bundaberg Rum had declined as more people bought pre-mixed cans, a trend I wanted no part of".

Later a Diageo spokeswoman clarified by saying "Some premium products, such as the Master Distillers Collection, would continue to be bottled in Bundaberg. This was not a decision we have taken lightly, however it is a necessary one to ensure the longer term sustainability of the distillery. We remain absolutely committed to Bundaberg and the distillery and will continue to invest and focus on our core business of distilling, maturing and blending great quality rum in Bundaberg as we have done for the last 125 years."<ref name=Atfield/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2014/05/16/4005996.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission|date=16 May 2014|first1=Ross|last1=Kay|first2=Kallee|last2=Buchanan|title=Sydney Rum?
