The '''Emancipation Proclamation''' was a [[presidential proclamation]] and [[executive order]] issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on January 1, 1863.  In a single stroke, it changed the federal legal status of more than 3 million [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved persons]] in the designated areas of the South from "slave" to "free". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally free. Eventually it reached and liberated all of the designated slaves.  It was issued as a war measure during the [[American Civil War]], directed to all of the areas in rebellion and all segments of the [[Executive branch of the United States|executive branch]] (including the Army and Navy) of the United States.<ref>Political scientist Brian R. Dirck states: "The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order, itself a rather unusual thing in those days. Executive orders are simply presidential directives issued to agents of the executive department by its boss."  {{cite book|author=Brian R.

It proclaimed the freedom of slaves in the ten states that were still in rebellion.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Emancipation Proclamation|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration | accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref> Because it was issued under the President's war powers, it necessarily excluded areas not in rebellion - it applied to more than 3 million of the 4 million slaves in the U.S. at the time.

The Proclamation also ordered that suitable persons among those freed could be enrolled into the paid service of United States' forces, and ordered the Union Army (and all segments of the Executive branch) to "recognize and maintain the freedom of" the ex-slaves. The Proclamation did not compensate the owners, did not outlaw slavery, and did not grant citizenship to the ex-slaves (called [[Freedman|freedmen]]). It made the eradication of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] an explicit war goal, in addition to the goal of reuniting the Union.<ref>{{harvnb|Foner|2010|pp=239–42}}</ref>
Around 20,000 to 50,000 slaves in regions where rebellion had already been subdued were immediately emancipated. It could not be enforced in areas still under rebellion, but as the Union army took control of Confederate regions, the Proclamation provided the legal framework for freeing more than 3 million slaves in those regions. Prior to the Proclamation, in accordance with the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], escaped slaves were either returned to their masters or held in camps as [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] for later return. The Proclamation applied only to slaves in Confederate-held lands; it did not apply to those in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|four slave states]] that were not in rebellion (Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri, which were unnamed), nor to Tennessee (unnamed but occupied by Union troops since 1862) and lower Louisiana (also under occupation), and specifically excluded those counties of Virginia soon to form the state of West Virginia. Also specifically excluded (by name) were some regions already controlled by the Union army. Emancipation in those places would come after separate state actions and/or the December 1865 ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which made slavery and indentured servitude, except for those duly convicted of a crime, illegal everywhere subject to United States jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html | title=Amendments to the U.S. Constitution | accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>

On September 22, 1862, Lincoln had issued a preliminary proclamation warning that he would order the emancipation of all slaves in any state that did not end its rebellion against the Union by January 1, 1863. None of the Confederate states restored themselves to the Union, and Lincoln's order, signed and issued January 1, 1863, took effect. The Emancipation Proclamation outraged white Southerners (and their sympathizers) who envisioned a race war, angered some Northern Democrats, energized anti-slavery forces, and undermined forces in Europe that wanted to intervene to help the Confederacy.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: vol 6. War Becomes Revolution, 1862–1863'' (1960) pp. 231–41, 273</ref> The Proclamation lifted the spirits of [[African American]]s both free and slave. It led many slaves to escape from their masters and get to Union lines to obtain their freedom.

The Emancipation Proclamation broadened the goals of the Civil War. While slavery had been a major issue that led to the war, Lincoln's only mission at the start of the war was to maintain the Union. The Proclamation made freeing the slaves an explicit goal of the Union war effort. Establishing the abolition of slavery as one of the two primary war goals served to deter intervention by Britain and France.<ref name="Howard Jones 1999">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Howard|title=Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVvZb5oeVtwC|year=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-2582-2}}</ref> The Emancipation Proclamation was never challenged in court. To ensure the abolition of slavery in all of the U.S., Lincoln pushed for passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]. Congress passed it by the necessary two-thirds vote on January 31, 1865, and it was ratified by the states on December 6, 1865.<ref>{{cite web|title=13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref>

The [[United States Constitution]] of 1787 did not use the word "slavery" but included several provisions about unfree persons.

"Nineteenth century apologists for the expansion of slavery developed a political philosophy that placed property at the pinnacle of personal interests and regarded its protection to be the government's chief purpose. The Fifth Amendment's Just Compensation clause provided the proslavery camp with a bastion for fortifying the peculiar institution against congressional restrictions to its spread westward. Based on this property-rights centered argument, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, in ''Dred Scott v. Sanford'' (1857), found the Missouri Compromise unconstitutionally violated due process."</ref> Socially, slavery was also supported in law and in practice by a pervasive culture of [[white supremacy]].<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 18–23.

Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery in peacetime was limited by the Constitution which before 1865, committed the issue to individual [[US States|states]].<ref name="Mackubin">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp|title=The Liberator|first=Thomas Owens|last=Mackubin|date=March 25, 2004|work=National Review|publisher=National Review|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a7fJ9hj|archivedate=2011-10-20}}</ref> Against the background of the [[American Civil War]], however, Lincoln issued the Proclamation under his authority as "[[Commander-in-chief|Commander in Chief]] of the Army and Navy" under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 2|Article II, section 2]] of the United States Constitution.<ref>Crowther p. 651</ref> As such, he claimed to have the martial power to free persons held as slaves in those states that were in rebellion "as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion".<ref>Numerous slaves were being commanded to perform tasks to support the Confederate war effort, including making weapons.</ref> He did not have Commander-in-Chief authority over the four [[Slave and free states|slave-holding states]] that were not in rebellion: [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]] and [[Delaware]], and so those states were not named in the Proclamation.{{refn|The fourth paragraph of the proclamation explains that Lincoln issued it, "by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief, of the Army and Navy of the United States in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/transcript.html|title=The Emancipation Proclamation|date=January 1, 1863|work=Transcription|publisher=[http://www.archives.gov/ U.S. National Archives]}}</ref>}} The fifth border jurisdiction, [[West Virginia]], where slavery remained legal but was in the process of being abolished, was, in January 1863, still part of the legally recognized [[Restored Government of Virginia|"reorganized" state of Virginia]], based in Alexandria, which was in the Union (as opposed to the Confederate state of Virginia, based in Richmond).

==Coverage==
The Proclamation applied in the ten states that were still in rebellion in 1863, and thus did not cover the nearly 500,000 slaves in the slave-holding [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland or Delaware) which were Union states. Those slaves were freed by later separate state and federal actions.

The state of [[Tennessee]] had already mostly returned to Union control, under a recognized Union government, so it was not named and was exempted. [[Virginia]] was named, but exemptions were specified for the 48 counties then in the process of forming the new state of [[West Virginia]], and seven additional counties and two cities in the Union-controlled [[Tidewater region of Virginia|Tidewater region]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Freedmen and Southern Society Project|title=Freedom: a documentary history of emancipation 1861–1867 : selected from the holdings of the National Archives of the United States.

Additionally, the Proclamation provided the legal framework for the emancipation of nearly all four million slaves as the Union armies advanced, and committed the Union to ending slavery, which was a controversial decision even in the North. Hearing of the Proclamation, more slaves quickly escaped to Union lines as the Army units moved South. As the Union armies advanced through the Confederacy, thousands of slaves were freed each day until nearly all (approximately 3.9 million, according to the 1860 Census)<ref name=1860Census>{{cite web |url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/slavery/slave-maps/slave-census.htm |title=Census, Son of the South |author= |year=1860|publisher=sonofthesouth.net |accessdate= }}</ref> were freed by July 1865.

While the Proclamation had freed most slaves as a war measure, it had not made slavery illegal.

==Background==
{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}
===Military action prior to emancipation===
The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] required individuals to return runaway slaves to their owners. During the war, Union generals such as [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] declared that slaves in occupied areas were [[contraband (American Civil War)|contraband of war]] and accordingly refused to return them.<ref name="NYT_20110411">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/magazine/mag-03CivilWar-t.html| date=April 1, 2011| title=How Slavery Really Ended in America| author=Adam Goodheart| work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref> This decision was controversial because it implied recognition of the Confederacy as a separate nation under international law, a notion that Lincoln steadfastly denied. As a result, he did not promote the contraband designation. In addition, as contraband, these people were legally designated as "property" when they crossed Union lines and their ultimate status was uncertain.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/cwdw/historyculture/living-contraband-former-slaves-in-the-capital-during-and-after-the-civil-war.htm | title=Living Contraband - Former Slaves in the Nation's Capital During the Civil War | publisher=National Park Service | work=Civil War Defenses of Washington | accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref>

===Governmental action towards emancipation===
In December 1861, Lincoln sent his first annual message to Congress (the [[State of the Union Address]], but then typically given in writing and not referred to as such). In it he praised the free labor system, as respecting human rights over property rights; he endorsed legislation to address the status of contraband slaves and slaves in loyal states, possibly through buying their freedom with federal taxes, and also the funding of strictly voluntary colonization efforts.<ref>{{cite book| last=Striner| first=Richard| title=Father Abraham: Lincoln's Relentless Struggle to End Slavery |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=147–148|isbn=978-0-19-518306-1}}</ref> In January 1862, [[Thaddeus Stevens]], the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] leader in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]], called for total war against the rebellion to include emancipation of slaves, arguing that emancipation, by forcing the loss of enslaved labor, would ruin the rebel economy. On March 13, 1862, Congress approved a "Law Enacting an Additional Article of War", which stated that from that point onward it was forbidden for Union Army officers to return fugitive slaves to their owners.<ref>{{cite book|title=U.S., Statutes at Large, Treaties, and Proclamations of the United States of America |volume=12 |location=Boston |year=1863 |page=354.}}</ref> On April 10, 1862, Congress declared that the federal government would compensate slave owners who freed their slaves. Slaves in the [[Geography of Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] were freed on April 16, 1862, and their owners were compensated.

On June 19, 1862, Congress prohibited slavery in all current and future [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States#List of organized incorporated territories|United States territories]] (though not in the states), and President Lincoln quickly signed the legislation. By this act, they repudiated the 1857 opinion of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott Case]]'' that Congress was powerless to regulate slavery in U.S. territories.<ref>Guminski, Arnold.

This joint action by Congress and President Lincoln also rejected the notion of [[popular sovereignty]] that had been advanced by [[Stephen A. Douglas]] as a solution to the slavery controversy, while completing the effort first legislatively proposed by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1784 to confine slavery within the borders of existing states.<ref>Montgomery, David.

In July 1862, Congress passed and Lincoln signed the [[Second Confiscation Act]], containing provisions for court proceedings to liberate slaves held by convicted "rebels", or of slaves of rebels that had escaped to Union lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/conact2.htm |title=The Second Confiscation Act, July 17, 1862 |publisher=History.umd.edu | accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref> The Act applied in cases of criminal convictions and to those who were slaves of "disloyal" masters.  However, Lincoln's position continued to be that Congress lacked power to free all slaves within the borders of rebel held states, but Lincoln as commander in chief could do so if he deemed it a proper military measure,<ref>Donald, David.

===Public opinion of emancipation===
[[File:Gordon, scourged back, NPG, 1863.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Medical examination photo of [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]], widely distributed by Abolitionists to expose the brutality of slavery.]]
[[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionists]] had long been urging Lincoln to free all slaves. In the summer of 1862, Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the highly influential [[New York Tribune]] wrote a famous editorial entitled "The Prayer of Twenty Millions" demanding a more aggressive attack on the Confederacy and faster emancipation of the slaves: "On the face of this wide earth, Mr. President, there is not one ... intelligent champion of the Union cause who does not feel ... that the rebellion, if crushed tomorrow, would be renewed if slavery were left in full vigor ... and that every hour of deference to slavery is an hour of added and deepened peril to the Union."<ref>Harold Holzer, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tA4lXY3W8hkC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de#v=onepage&q&f=false Dear Mr. Lincoln: Letters to the President]'', Southern Illinois University Press, 2006, p. 160–161</ref> Lincoln responded in his [[q:AbrahamLincoln#Letter to Horace Greeley (1862)|Letter To Horace Greeley]] from August 22, 1862, in terms of the limits imposed by his duty as president to save the Union:

{{quote|If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.... I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.<ref>''The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln'' edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume V, p. 388–389</ref>}}

Lincoln scholar [[Harold Holzer]] wrote in this context about Lincoln's letter: "Unknown to Greeley, Lincoln composed this after he had already drafted a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which he had determined to issue after the next Union military victory. Therefore, this letter, was in truth, an attempt to position the impending announcement in terms of saving the Union, not freeing slaves as a humanitarian gesture. It was one of Lincoln's most skillful public relations efforts, even if it has cast longstanding doubt on his sincerity as a liberator."<ref>Harold Holzer, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tA4lXY3W8hkC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de#v=onepage&q&f=false Dear Mr. Lincoln: Letters to the President]'', Southern Illinois University Press, 2006, p. 162</ref> Historian Richard Striner argues that "for years" Lincoln's letter has been misread as "Lincoln only wanted to save the Union."<ref name="Striner">{{cite book| last=Striner| first=Richard| title=Father Abraham: Lincoln's Relentless Struggle to End Slavery |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press|page=176|isbn=978-0-19-518306-1}}</ref> However, within the context of Lincoln's entire career and pronouncements on slavery this interpretation is wrong, according to Striner. Rather, Lincoln was softening the strong Northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the Union. This opposition would fight for the Union but not to end slavery, so Lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both, at the same time.<ref name="Striner"/> In his 2014 book, ''[[Lincoln's Gamble]]'', journalist and historian [[Todd Brewster]] asserted that Lincoln's desire to reassert the saving of the Union as his sole war goal was in fact crucial to his claim of legal authority for emancipation. Since slavery was protected by the Constitution, the only way that he could free the slaves was as a tactic of war—not as the mission itself.<ref name="Brewster">{{cite book| last=Brewster| first=Todd| title=Lincoln's Gamble: The Tumultuous Six Months that Gave America the Emancipation Proclamation and Changed the Course of the Civil War|year=2014|publisher=Scribner|page=59|isbn=978-1451693867}}</ref> But that carried the risk that when the war ended, so would the justification for freeing the slaves. Late in 1862, Lincoln asked his Attorney General, [[Edward Bates]], for an opinion as to whether slaves freed through a war-related proclamation of emancipation could be re-enslaved once the war was over. Bates had to work through the language of the Dred Scott decision to arrive at an answer, but he finally concluded that they could indeed remain free. Still, a complete end to slavery would require a constitutional amendment.<ref>{{cite book| last=Brewster| first=Todd| title=Lincoln's Gamble: The Tumultuous Six Months that Gave America the Emancipation Proclamation and Changed the Course of the Civil War|year=2014|publisher=Scribner|page=236|isbn=978-1451693867}}</ref> Conflicting advice, to free all slaves, or not free them at all, was presented to Lincoln in public and private. [[Thomas Nast]], a cartoon artist during the Civil War and the late 1800s considered "Father of the American Cartoon", composed many works including a two-sided spread that showed the transition from slavery into civilization after President Lincoln signed the Proclamation. Nast believed in equal opportunity and equality for all people, including enslaved Africans or free blacks.<ref>[[Thomas Nast]]</ref> A mass rally in Chicago on September 7, 1862, demanded an immediate and universal emancipation of slaves.

Even used as a war power, emancipation was a risky political act.

Lincoln first discussed the proclamation with his cabinet in July 1862. He drafted his "preliminary proclamation" and read it to Secretary of State William Seward, and Secretary of Navy Gideon Welles, on July 13. Seward and Welles were at first speechless, then Seward referred to possible anarchy throughout the South and resulting foreign intervention; Welles apparently said nothing. On July 22, Lincoln presented it to his entire cabinet as something he had determined to do and he asked their opinion on wording.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/alhtml/almintr.html | title=Emancipation Proclamation | publisher=Library of Congress and Knox College | work=Lincoln Papers | year=2002 | accessdate=2013-06-28}}</ref> Although Secretary of War Edwin Stanton supported it, Seward advised Lincoln to issue the proclamation after a major Union victory, or else it would appear as if the Union was giving "its last shriek of retreat".<ref>{{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=Doris|title=Team of Rivals|year=2005|publisher=Blithedale Productions|location=New York}}</ref>

In September 1862, the [[Battle of Antietam]] gave Lincoln the victory he needed to issue the Emancipation. In the battle, though [[General McClellan]] allowed the escape of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s retreating troops, Union forces turned back a Confederate invasion of Maryland. On September 22, 1862, five days after Antietam occurred, Lincoln called his cabinet into session and issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.<ref>[http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals_iv/sections/preliminary_emancipation_proclamation.html# U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, 1862]</ref> According to Civil War historian [[James M.

Others present used the word ''resolution'' instead of ''vow to God''.<br>
[[Gideon Welles]], ''Diary of Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy Under Lincoln and Johnson'' (Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1911), 1:143, reported that Lincoln made a covenant with God that if God would change the tide of the war, Lincoln would change his policy toward slavery.

The final proclamation was issued January 1, 1863. Although implicitly granted authority by Congress, Lincoln used his powers as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, "as a necessary war measure" as the basis of the proclamation, rather than the equivalent of a statute enacted by Congress or a constitutional amendment. Some days after issuing the final Proclamation, Lincoln wrote to Major General [[John McClernand]]: "After the commencement of hostilities I struggled nearly a year and a half to get along without touching the "institution"; and when finally I conditionally determined to touch it, I gave a hundred days fair notice of my purpose, to all the States and people, within which time they could have turned it wholly aside, by simply again becoming good citizens of the United States. They chose to disregard it, and I made the peremptory proclamation on what appeared to me to be a military necessity. And being made, it must stand."<ref>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6/1:84.1?rgn=div2;view=fulltext;q1=broken+eggs "The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln]" edited by Roy P.

Initially, the Emancipation Proclamation effectively freed only a small percentage of the slaves, those who were behind Union lines in areas not exempted. Most slaves were still behind Confederate lines or in exempted Union-occupied areas. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] commented, "We show our sympathy with slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free." Had any slave state ended its secession attempt before January 1, 1863, it could have kept slavery, at least temporarily. The Proclamation only gave the Lincoln Administration the legal basis to free the slaves in the areas of the South that were still in rebellion on January 1, 1863. It effectively destroyed slavery as the Union armies advanced south and conquered the entire Confederacy.

The Emancipation Proclamation also allowed for the enrollment of freed slaves into the United States military. During the war nearly 200,000 blacks, most of them ex-slaves, joined the Union Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/blacks-civil-war/ |title=Teaching With Documents: The Fight for Equal Rights: Black Soldiers in the Civil War|work=[[National Archives and Records Administration|U.S. National Archives and Records Administration]]}}</ref> Their contributions gave the North additional manpower that was significant in winning the war.

Though the counties of Virginia that were soon to form [[West Virginia]] were specifically exempted from the Proclamation (Jefferson County being the only exception), a condition of the state's [[admittance to the Union]] was that its constitution provide for the gradual abolition of slavery (an immediate emancipation of all slaves was also adopted there in early 1865). Slaves in the border states of [[Maryland]] and [[Missouri]] were also emancipated by separate state action before the Civil War ended. In Maryland, a new state constitution abolishing slavery in the state went into effect on November 1, 1864. The Union-occupied counties of eastern Virginia and parishes of Louisiana, which had been exempted from the Proclamation, both adopted state constitutions that abolished slavery in April 1864.<ref>http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Virginia_Convention_of_1864</ref><ref>http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/april-1864-civil-war.htm</ref> In early 1865, Tennessee adopted an amendment to its constitution prohibiting slavery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/chronol.htm |title=Freedmen and Southern Society Project: Chronology of Emancipation |publisher=History.umd.edu |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.tn.us/tsla/exhibits/blackhistory/timelines/timeline_1861-1865.htm |title=TSLA: This Honorable Body: African American Legislators in 19th Century Tennessee |publisher=State.tn.us |date= |accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref> Slaves in [[Kentucky]] and [[Delaware]] were not emancipated until the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified.

The Proclamation was issued in two parts. The first part, issued on September 22, 1862, was a preliminary announcement outlining the intent of the second part, which officially went into effect 100 days later on January 1, 1863, during the second year of the Civil War. It was Abraham Lincoln's declaration that all slaves would be permanently freed in all areas of the Confederacy that had not already returned to federal control by January 1863. The ten affected states were individually named in the second part (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina). Not included were the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[slave state]]s of [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]]. Also not named was the state of [[Tennessee]], in which a Union-controlled military government had already been set up, based in the capital, Nashville. Specific exemptions were stated for areas also under Union control on January 1, 1863, namely 48 counties that would soon become [[West Virginia]], seven other named counties of [[Virginia]] including Berkeley and Hampshire counties, <!-- "to" here? --> which were soon added <!--omit "to" here? -->to West Virginia, [[New Orleans]] and 13 named parishes nearby.

|As the great day drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night. Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom. ... Some man who seemed to be a stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paper—the Emancipation Proclamation, I think. After the reading we were told that we were all free, and could go when and where we pleased. My mother, who was standing by my side, leaned over and kissed her children, while tears of joy ran down her cheeks. She explained to us what it all meant, that this was the day for which she had been so long praying, but fearing that she would never live to see.}}

Emancipation took place without violence by masters or ex-slaves. The Proclamation represented a shift in the war objectives of the North—reuniting the nation was no longer the only goal. It represented a major step toward the ultimate abolition of [[slavery in the United States]] and a "new birth of freedom".

Runaway slaves who had escaped to Union lines had previously been held by the Union Army as "contraband of war" under the [[Confiscation Acts]]; when the proclamation took effect, they were told at midnight that they were free to leave. The [[Sea Islands]] off the coast of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] had been occupied by the Union Navy earlier in the war. The whites had fled to the mainland while the blacks stayed. An early program of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was set up for the former slaves, including schools and training. Naval officers read the proclamation and told them they were free.

Slaves had been part of the "engine of war" for the Confederacy. They produced and prepared food; sewed uniforms; repaired railways; worked on farms and in factories, shipping yards, and mines; built fortifications; and served as hospital workers and common laborers. News of the Proclamation spread rapidly by word of mouth, arousing hopes of freedom, creating general confusion, and encouraging thousands to escape to Union lines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goodheart|first=Adam|title=1861: The Civil War Awakening|year=2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|location=New York}}</ref> George Washington Albright, a teenage slave in [[Mississippi]], recalled that like many of his fellow slaves, his father escaped to join Union forces. According to Albright, plantation owners tried to keep the Proclamation from slaves but news of it came through the "grapevine". The young slave became a "runner" for an informal group they called the ''4Ls'' ("Lincoln's Legal Loyal League") bringing news of the proclamation to secret slave meetings at plantations throughout the region.<ref>Jenkins, Sally, and John Stauffer.

[[Robert E. Lee]] saw the Emancipation Proclamation as a way for the Union to bolster the number of soldiers it could place on the field, making it imperative for the Confederacy to increase their own numbers.

Writing on the matter after the sack of Fredericksburg, Lee wrote "In view of the vast increase of the forces of the enemy, of the savage and brutal policy he has proclaimed, which leaves us no alternative but success or degradation worse than death, if we would save the honor of our families from pollution, our social system from destruction, let every effort be made, every means be employed, to fill and maintain the ranks of our armies, until God, in his mercy, shall bless us with the establishment of our independence."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Civil War, a Narrative: Fredericksburg to Meridian|author=Shelby Foote|volume=Volume 2|year=1963|publisher=Random House}}</ref> Lee's request for a drastic increase of troops would go unfulfilled.

The Proclamation was immediately denounced by [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]] who opposed the war and advocated restoring the union by allowing slavery. [[Horatio Seymour]], while running for the governorship of New York, cast the Emancipation Proclamation as a call for slaves to commit extreme acts of violence on all white southerners, saying it was "a proposal for the butchery of women and children, for scenes of lust and rapine, and of arson and murder, which would invoke the interference of civilized Europe".<ref name="Weber">{{cite book|title=Copperheads: the rise and fall of Lincoln's opponents in the North|last=Weber|first=Jennifer L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|year=2006|ref=harv}}</ref> The Copperheads also saw the Proclamation as an unconstitutional abuse of Presidential power. Editor Henry A. Reeves wrote in Greenport's ''Republican Watchman'' that "In the name of freedom of Negroes, [the proclamation] imperils the liberty of white men; to test a utopian theory of equality of races which Nature, History and Experience alike condemn as monstrous, it overturns the Constitution and Civil Laws and sets up Military Usurpation in their Stead."<ref name="Weber"/>

Racism remained pervasive on both sides of the conflict and many in the North supported the war only as an effort to force the South to stay in the Union. The promises of many Republican politicians that the war was to restore the Union and not about black rights or ending slavery, were now declared lies by their opponents citing the Proclamation. Copperhead David Allen spoke to a rally in Columbiana, Ohio, stating "I have told you that this war is carried on for the Negro. There is the proclamation of the President of the United States. Now fellow Democrats I ask you if you are going to be forced into a war against your Brithren<!--quote in cited source uses 'i', not 'e'--> of the Southern States for the Negro. I answer No!"<ref>{{Harvnb|Weber|2006|p=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=k4aPFovq9m8C&pg=PA65 65]}}.
</ref> The Copperheads saw the Proclamation as irrefutable proof of their position and the beginning of a political rise for their members; in Connecticut, H. B. Whiting wrote that the truth was now plain even to "those stupid thick-headed persons who persisted in thinking that the President was a conservative man and that the war was for the restoration of the Union under the Constitution".<ref name="Weber"/>

[[War Democrats]] who rejected the Copperhead position within their party, found themselves in a quandary. While throughout the war they had continued to espouse the racist positions of their party and their disdain of the concerns of slaves, they did see the Proclamation as a viable military tool against the South, and worried that opposing it might demoralize troops in the Union army. The question would continue to trouble them and eventually lead to a split within their party as the war progressed.<ref name="Weber"/>

Lincoln further alienated many in the Union two days after issuing the preliminary copy of the Emancipation Proclamation by [[Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War|suspending habeas corpus]]. His opponents linked these two actions in their claims that he was becoming a despot. In light of this and a lack of military success for the Union armies, many War Democrat voters who had previously supported Lincoln turned against him and joined the Copperheads in the off-year elections held in October and November.<ref name="Weber"/>

In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1862|1862 elections]], the Democrats gained 28 seats in the House as well as the governorship of [[New York]]. Lincoln's friend Orville Hickman Browning told the President that the Proclamation and the suspension of habeas corpus had been "disastrous" for his party by handing the Democrats so many weapons. Lincoln made no response. Copperhead William Javis of Connecticut pronounced the election the "beginning of the end of the utter downfall of [[Abolitionism in the United States]]".<ref name="Weber"/>

Historians James M. McPherson and Allan Nevins state that though the results looked very troubling, they could be seen favorably by Lincoln; his opponents did well only in their historic strongholds and "at the national level their gains in the House were the smallest of any minority party's in an off-year election in nearly a generation. Michigan, California, and Iowa all went Republican.... Moreover, the Republicans picked up five seats in the Senate."<ref name="Weber"/> McPherson states "If the election was in any sense a referendum on emancipation and on Lincoln's conduct of the war, a majority of Northern voters endorsed these policies."<ref name="Weber"/>

The initial Confederate response was one of expected outrage. The Proclamation was seen as vindication for the rebellion, and proof that Lincoln would have abolished slavery even if the states had remained in the Union.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rebel Message: What Jefferson Davis Has to Say|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/HistArchive/?p_product=EANX-K12&p_theme=ahnp_k12&p_nbid=E59Q56PUMTMyNTY5MTAwNy4yOTAyNjM6MToxMzozOC4xMDUuOTYuMjM4&p_action=timelinedoc&p_docref=v2:11A050B7B120D3F8@EANX-11AE489CABB99E68@2401523-11AE489CB81982E0@0-11AE489D1F55ED48@The+Rebel+Message.+The+Document+in+Full.+What+Jeff.+Davis+Says+of+President+Lincoln%27s+Emancipation+Proclamation&d_doclabel=The+Rebel+Message%3A+What+Jefferson+Davis+Has+to+Say|work=New York Herald|publisher=America's Historical Newspapers|accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref>

===International impact===
As Lincoln had hoped, the Proclamation turned foreign popular opinion in favor of the Union by gaining the support of anti-slavery countries and countries that had already abolished slavery (especially the developed countries in Europe). This shift ended the Confederacy's hopes of gaining official recognition.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert E. May|title=The Union, the Confederacy, and the Atlantic rim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIspT4gpgUAC|year=1995|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-061-5|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uIspT4gpgUAC&pg=PA29 29–68]|chapter=History and Mythology : The Crisis over British Intervention in the Civil War}}</ref>

Since the Emancipation Proclamation made the eradication of slavery an explicit Union war goal, it linked support for the South to support for slavery. Public opinion in Britain would not tolerate direct support for slavery. British companies, however, continued to build and operate [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]] for the South. As [[Henry Adams]] noted, "The Emancipation Proclamation has done more for us than all our former victories and all our diplomacy." In Italy, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] hailed Lincoln as "the heir of the aspirations of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]". On August 6, 1863, Garibaldi wrote to Lincoln: ''Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure''.<ref>Mack Smith, p. 72</ref>

Alan Van Dyke, a representative for workers from [[Manchester]], England, wrote to Lincoln saying, "We joyfully honor you for many decisive steps toward practically exemplifying your belief in the words of your great founders: 'All men are created free and equal.'" The Emancipation Proclamation served to ease tensions with Europe over the North's conduct of the war, and combined with the recent failed Southern offensive at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], to cut off any practical chance for the Confederacy to receive international support in the war.

==Gettysburg Address==
Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in November 1863 made indirect reference to the Proclamation and the ending of slavery as a war goal with the phrase "new birth of freedom". The Proclamation solidified Lincoln's support among the rapidly growing abolitionist element of the Republican Party and ensured they would not block his re-nomination in 1864.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: vol 6. War Becomes Revolution, 1862–1863'' (1960)</ref>

==Postbellum==
[[File:EMANCI4.jpg|thumb|Emancipation from Freedmen's viewpoint; illustration from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' 1865]]

Near the end of the war, abolitionists were concerned that the Emancipation Proclamation would be construed solely as a war measure, Lincoln's original intent, and would no longer apply once fighting ended. They were also increasingly anxious to secure the freedom of all slaves, not just those freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Thus pressed, Lincoln staked a large part of his 1864 presidential campaign on a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery uniformly throughout the United States. Lincoln's campaign was bolstered by separate votes in both Maryland and Missouri to abolish slavery in those states. Maryland's new constitution abolishing slavery took effect in November 1864. Slavery in Missouri was ended by executive proclamation of its governor, Thomas C. Fletcher, on January 11, 1865.

Winning re-election, Lincoln pressed the [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] [[38th United States Congress|38th Congress]] to pass the proposed amendment immediately rather than wait for the incoming [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]] to convene. In January 1865, Congress sent to the state legislatures for ratification what became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], banning slavery in all [[U.S. state]]s and territories. The amendment was ratified by the legislatures of enough states by December 6, 1865, and proclaimed 12 days later. There were about 40,000 slaves in Kentucky and 1,000 in Delaware who were liberated then.<ref name="1860Census"/>

==Critiques==
{{further|Abraham Lincoln and slavery}}
As the years went on and American life continued to be deeply unfair towards blacks, cynicism towards Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation increased. Perhaps the strongest attack was [[Lerone Bennett, Jr.|Lerone Bennett's]] ''[[Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream]]'' (2000), which claimed that Lincoln was a white supremacist who issued the Emancipation Proclamation in lieu of the real racial reforms for which radical abolitionists pushed. In his ''Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation'', [[Allen C. Guelzo]] noted the professional historians' lack of substantial respect for the document, since it has been the subject of few major scholarly studies. He argued that Lincoln was America's "last [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[politician]]"<ref>{{harvnb|Guelzo|2006|p=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=MOFHPTQYqzgC&pg=PA3 3]}}.</ref> and as such was dedicated to removing slavery strictly within the bounds of law.

Other historians have given more credit to Lincoln for what he accomplished within the tensions of his cabinet and a society at war, for his own growth in political and moral stature, and for the promise he held out to the slaves.<ref>Doris Kearns Goodwin, ''A Team of Rivals'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005</ref> More might have been accomplished if he had not been assassinated. As [[Eric Foner]] wrote:
<blockquote>Lincoln was not an abolitionist or Radical Republican, a point Bennett reiterates innumerable times. He did not favor immediate abolition before the war, and held racist views typical of his time. But he was also a man of deep convictions when it came to slavery, and during the Civil War displayed a remarkable capacity for moral and political growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ericfoner.com/reviews/040900latimes.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027065400/http://www.ericfoner.com/reviews/040900latimes.html |archivedate=2004-10-27 |deadurl=no |title=review of ''Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream'' by Lerone Bennett, Jr. |first=Eric |last=Foner |publisher=Los Angeles Times Book Review |date=April 9, 2000 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}</ref></blockquote>

Kal Ashraf wrote:
<blockquote>Perhaps in rejecting the critical dualism–Lincoln as individual emancipator pitted against collective self-emancipators–there is an opportunity to recognise the greater persuasiveness of the combination. In a sense, yes: a racist, flawed Lincoln did something heroic, and not in lieu of collective participation, but next to, and enabled, by it. To venerate a singular –Great Emancipator' may be as reductive as dismissing the significance of Lincoln's actions. Who he was as a man, no one of us can ever really know. So it is that the version of Lincoln we keep is also the version we make.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.baas.ac.uk/resources/american-studies-in-britain-the-baas-newsletter/ |title=Editorial in American Studies in Britain (108: Spring 2013) iSSN 1465-9956 |first=Kal |last=Ashraf |publisher=British Association for American Studies |date=March 2013 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref></blockquote>

==Legacy in the Civil Rights Era==
[[File:President Barack Obama views the Emancipation Proclamation in the Oval Office 2010-01-18.jpg|thumb|300px|right|President [[Barack Obama]] views the Emancipation Proclamation in the Oval Office next to a bust of Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

===Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.===
[[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] made many references to the Emancipation Proclamation during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|Civil Rights Movement]]. These include a speech made at an observance of the hundredth anniversary of the issuing of the Proclamation made in New York City on September 12, 1962 where he placed it alongside the Declaration of Independence as an "imperishable" contribution to civilization, and "All tyrants, past, present and future, are powerless to bury the truths in these declarations". He lamented that despite a history where America "proudly professed the basic principles inherent in both documents", it "sadly practiced the antithesis of these principles". He concluded "There is but one way to commemorate the Emancipation Proclamation. That is to make its declarations of freedom real; to reach back to the origins of our nation when our message of equality electrified an unfree world, and reaffirm democracy by deeds as bold and daring as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/anti/historyculture/mlk-ep.htm|title=Dr. Martin Luther King on the Emancipation Proclamation|publisher=National Park Service|author=Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.}}</ref>

King's most famous invocation of the Emancipation Proclamation was in a speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] (often referred to as the "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech). King began the speech saying "Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity. But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/i-have-dream|title=I Have A Dream|publisher=The King Center|date=August 28, 1963|author=Dr. Marin Luther King, Jr.}}</ref>

====The "Second Emancipation Proclamation"====
{{Main|Second Emancipation Proclamation}}
In the early 1960s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates developed a strategy to call on President [[John F. Kennedy]] to bypass a Southern segregationist opposition in the Congress by issuing an [[Executive Order]] to put an end to segregation. This envisioned document was referred to as the "Second Emancipation Proclamation".

===President John F. Kennedy===
On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy appeared on national television to address the issue of civil rights. Kennedy, who had been routinely criticized as timid by some of the leaders of the civil rights movement, told Americans that [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door|two black students had been peacefully enrolled]] in the University of Alabama with the aid the National Guard despite the opposition of Governor [[George Wallace]].

John Kennedy called it a "moral issue"<ref name=Peniel/> Invoking the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation he said "One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice. They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression. And this Nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free. We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is a land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The [[Birmingham campaign|events in Birmingham]] and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them."<ref>{{cite web|title=237 - Radio and Television Report to the American People on Civil Rights|date=June 11, 1963|author=John F. Kennedy|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=9271&st=&st1=#}}</ref>

In the same speech Kennedy announced he would introduce comprehensive civil rights legislation to the United States Congress which he did a week later (he continued to push for its passage until his assassination in November 1963). Historian Peniel E. Joseph holds Lyndon Johnson's ability to get that bill, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], passed on July 2, 1964 was aided by "the moral forcefulness of the June 11 speech" which turned "the narrative of civil rights from a regional issue into a national story promoting racial equality and democratic renewal".<ref name=Peniel>{{cite news |title=Kennedy's Finest Moment |author=Peniel E. Joseph |date=June 10, 2013 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/opinion/kennedys-civil-rights-triumph.html?hp |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

===President Lyndon B. Johnson===
During the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|American Civil Rights movement of the 1960s]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] invoked the Emancipation Proclamation holding it up as a promise yet to be fully implemented.

As Vice President while speaking from Gettysburg on May 30, 1963 (Memorial Day), at the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, Johnson connected it directly with the ongoing Civil Rights struggles of the time saying "One hundred years ago, the slave was freed. One hundred years later, the Negro remains in bondage to the color of his skin.... In this hour, it is not our respective races which are at stake—it is our nation. Let those who care for their country come forward, North and South, white and Negro, to lead the way through this moment of challenge and decision.... Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact. To the extent that the proclamation of emancipation is not fulfilled in fact, to that extent we shall have fallen short of assuring freedom to the free."<ref>{{cite web|title=Remarks of Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson|date=May 30, 1963|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/speeches.hom/630530.asp}}</ref>

As President, Johnson again invoked the proclamation in a speech presenting the [[Voting Rights Act]] at a joint session of Congress on Monday, March 15, 1965. This was one week after violence had been inflicted on peaceful civil rights marchers during the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. Johnson said "... it's not just Negroes, but really it's all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And [[We Shall Overcome#Use in the 1960s civil rights and other protest movements|we shall overcome]]. As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil, I know how agonizing racial feelings are. I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society. But a century has passed—more than 100 years—since the Negro was freed. And he is not fully free tonight. It was more than 100 years ago that Abraham Lincoln—a great President of another party—signed the Emancipation Proclamation. But emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact. A century has passed—more than 100 years—since equality was promised, and yet the Negro is not equal. A century has passed since the day of promise, and the promise is unkept. The time of justice has now come, and I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back. It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come, and when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American."<ref>{{cite web|title=We Shall Overcome|author=Lyndon B.
