They were also increasingly anxious to secure the freedom of all slaves, not just those freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Thus pressed, Lincoln staked a large part of his 1864 presidential campaign on a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery uniformly throughout the United States. Lincoln's campaign was bolstered by separate votes in both Maryland and Missouri to abolish slavery in those states. Maryland's new constitution abolishing slavery took effect in November 1864.

This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity. But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/i-have-dream</arg><arg name="title">I Have A Dream</arg><arg name="publisher">The King Center</arg><arg name="date">August 28, 1963</arg><arg name="author">Dr. Marin Luther King, Jr.</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='4'>The &quot;Second Emancipation Proclamation&quot;</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Second Emancipation Proclamation</arg></template>In the early 1960s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates developed a strategy to call on President<space/><link><target>John F.

We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is a land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes?

Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact.

But a century has passedmore than 100 yearssince the Negro was freed. And he is not fully free tonight. It was more than 100 years ago that Abraham Lincolna great President of another partysigned the Emancipation Proclamation. But emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact. A century has passedmore than 100 yearssince equality was promised, and yet the Negro is not equal. A century has passed since the day of promise, and the promise is unkept.
