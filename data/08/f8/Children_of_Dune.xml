Herbert's vision of a people forced by circumstance into total ecological awareness is worked out in convincing details ... What sets these books apart from their competitors is the obsessive quality of Herbert's imagination ... To read the ''Dune'' trilogy is to plunge into someone else's obsession ... Virtually every page in the trilogy contains a sentence that hints at the momentousness of the events being described. This is where the religiosity comes in. Herbert keeps interrupting the action with quotes from made-up sources that reinforce the atmosphere of millennial conflict and resolution. Taken out of context, these passages sound silly, like the words of wisdom spoken by Oriental sages on a TV sound stage ... But the whole point of an obsession is that it cannot be criticized from the outside; what distinguishes a successful obsessional tale from a failure that the reader is held, like Coleridge's Wedding Guest, so that 'he cannot choose but hear', no matter what his other faculties tell him. On this criterion, I would personally rate the ''Dune'' trilogy an unqualified success.</arg></template></extension><space/>and was nominated for the<space/><link><target>Hugo Award</target></link><space/>for<space/><link><target>Hugo Award for Best Novel</target><part>Best Novel</part></link><space/>in 1977.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Hugo77"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1977-hugo-awards/</arg><arg name="title">1977 Hugo Awards</arg><arg name="publisher">World Science Fiction Society</arg><arg name="accessdate">March 8, 2011</arg></template></extension><space/>It was originally<space/><link><target>Serial (literature)</target><part>serial</part><trail>ized</trail></link><space/>in<space/><italics><link><target>Analog Science Fiction and Fact</target></link></italics><space/>in 1976, and was the last<space/><italics>Dune</italics><space/>novel to be serialized before book publication.

''Dune Messiah'' performs a classic inversion of the theme. ''Children of Dune'' expands the number of themes interplaying. I refuse, however, to provide further answers to this complex mixture. That fits the pattern of the fugue. You find your own solutions. Don't look to me as your leader.</arg></template></extension><space/>When the second novel,<space/><italics>Dune Messiah</italics>, opens, MuadDibs religion has sent his fanatical soldiers on an interstellar jihad, destroying the traditional structures of government and leaving billions dead. His vision of peace is corrupted by dogmatic religious bureaucrats, and his once-noble desert tribes, the Fremen, grow fat and wealthy on the spoils of war and the de-desertification of Dune.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Synopsis</heading><paragraph>Nine years after Emperor Paul Muad'Dib walked into the desert, blind, the ecological transformation of<space/><link><target>Arrakis</target><part>Dune</part></link><space/>has reached the point where some Fremen are living without<space/><link><target>stillsuit</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>in the less arid climate and have started to move out of the sietches and into the villages and cities. As the old ways erode, more and more pilgrims arrive to experience the planet of Muad'Dib. The Imperial high council has lost its political might and is powerless to control the Jihad.</paragraph><paragraph>Paul's young twin children, Leto II and Ghanima, have concluded that their guardian Alia has succumbed to<space/><link><target>abomination (Dune)</target><part>abomination</part></link><space/>the possession by one of her ancestors and fear that a similar fate awaits them. They (and Alia) also realize that the<space/><link><target>terraforming</target></link><space/>of Dune will kill all the<space/><link><target>Sandworm (Dune)</target><part>sandworm</part><trail>s</trail></link>, thus destroying the source of the spice, but the thing which has possessed Alia desires this outcome. Leto also fears that, like his father, he will be trapped by his prescience.</paragraph><paragraph>Possessed by the persona of her grandfather<space/><link><target>Vladimir Harkonnen</target><part>Baron Vladimir Harkonnen</part></link>, Alia fears that her mother<space/><link><target>Lady Jessica</target></link>, about to return to Arrakis, will recognize her abomination. Meanwhile a new religious figure called &quot;The Preacher&quot; has risen in the desert, railing against the religious government's injustices and the changes among the Fremen. Some Fremen believe he is Paul Atreides. Princess<space/><link><target>Wensicia</target></link><space/>of the fallen House Corrino on<space/><link><target>Salusa Secundus</target></link><space/>plots to assassinate the twins and regain power.</paragraph><paragraph>Jessica returns to Arrakis and recognizes that her daughter has been possessed, but finds no signs of abomination in the twins. Leto arranges for Fremen leader<space/><link><target>Stilgar</target></link><space/>to protect his sister if there is an attempt on their lives. The Preacher journeys to Salusa Secundus to meet Wensicia's son<space/><link><target>Farad'n</target></link>, and in return pledges<space/><link><target>Duncan Idaho</target></link><space/>as an agent of House Corrino. Alia attempts to assassinate Jessica, who escapes into the desert with Duncan's help, precipitating a rebellion among the Fremen. The twins anticipate and survive the Corrino assassination plot. Leto leaves to seek out the Preacher while Ghanima, masking her memory with self-hypnosis, reports falsely that her brother had been murdered. Duncan and Jessica flee to Salusa Secundus where Jessica begins to mentor the Corrino heir. He seizes power from his regent mother Wensicia and allies with the<space/><link><target>Bene Gesserit</target></link>, who promise to marry him to Ghanima and support his bid for coronation as Emperor.</paragraph><paragraph>A band of Fremen outlaws capture Leto and force him to undergo the spice trance at the suggestion of Gurney, who has infiltrated the group on Jessica's orders. His spice-induced visions show him a myriad of possible futures where humanity has become extinct and only one where humanity survives. He names this future &quot;The<space/><link><target>Golden Path (Dune)</target><part>Golden Path</part></link>&quot; and resolves to bring it to fruition. He escapes his captors and sacrifices his humanity in pursuit of the Golden Path by physically fusing with a school of sandtrout, gaining superhuman strength and near-invulnerability. He travels across the desert and confronts the Preacher who does, in fact, prove to be his father Paul.</paragraph><paragraph>Duncan returns to Arrakis and provokes Stilgar into killing him. With Stilgar's neutrality now untenable, he seizes Ghanima and flees. Alia recaptures Ghanima and arranges her marriage to Farad'n, planning to exploit the expected chaos when Ghanima kills him to avenge her brother's murder. The Preacher and Leto return to the capital to confront Alia, who has the Preacher murdered, revealing his true identity. Leto reveals himself in a display of superhuman strength and triggers the return of Ghanima's genuine memories. He confronts Alia and offers to help her overcome her possession, but she is overwhelmed by her ancestral personae and elects to commit suicide.</paragraph><paragraph>Leto declares himself Emperor and asserts control over the Fremen. Farad'n enlists in his service and delivers control of the Corrino armies. The seemingly immortal and omnipotent Leto is left as Emperor of the Known Universe, with Ghanima at his side. Leto will wed his own sister, but Farad'n, now renamed Harq al Ada (<italics>The Breaking of the Way</italics>), will become Ghanima's consort and continue the Atreides line.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Reception</heading><paragraph>Initially selling over 75,000 copies,<space/><italics>Children of Dune</italics><space/>became the first hardcover best-seller ever in the science fiction field.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Touponce 119"></extension><space/>The novel was critically well-received for its gripping plot, action, and atmosphere,<extension extension_name='ref' name="NYT 1976"></extension><space/>and was nominated for the<space/><link><target>Hugo Award</target></link><space/>for<space/><link><target>Hugo Award for Best Novel</target><part>Best Novel</part></link><space/>in 1977.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Hugo77"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In a 1976 review,<space/><link><target>Spider Robinson</target></link><space/>found the novel unsatisfying, faulting the ending as unconvincing and thematically overfamiliar.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="title">Galaxy Bookshelf<space/></arg><arg name="first">Spider<space/></arg><arg name="last">Robinson<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink">Spider Robinson</arg><arg name="work">[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]</arg><arg name="date">September 1976</arg><arg name="pages">111–13</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Reviewing<space/><italics>Children of Dune</italics>,<space/><link><target>David Pringle</target></link><space/>gave the novel a rating of two stars out of four and described the novel as &quot;dark and convoluted stuff.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="first">David<space/></arg><arg name="last">Pringle<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink">David Pringle<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Ultimate Guide To Science Fiction<space/></arg><arg name="location">New York<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Pharos Books: [[St. Martin's Press]]<space/></arg><arg name="date">1990<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">0886875374<space/></arg><arg name="page">58<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>30em</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Dune franchise</target></template><template><target>Frank Herbert</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Category:1976 novels</target></link><link><target>Category:Novels by Frank Herbert</target></link><link><target>Category:Dune novels</target></link><link><target>Category:Works originally published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact</target></link><link><target>Category:Novels first published in serial form</target></link><link><target>Category:G.
