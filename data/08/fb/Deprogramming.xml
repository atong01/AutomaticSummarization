Deprogrammers usually work for a fee, which may easily run as high as $25,000. The deprogramming process begins with abduction. Often strong men muscle the subject into a car and take him to a place where he is cut from everyone but his captors. He may be held against his will for upward of three weeks. Frequently, however, the initial deprogramming only last a few days. The subject's sleep is limited and he is told that he will not be released until his beliefs meet his captors' approval.

Some people blur the distinctions on purpose: some practitioners do so to avoid criticism; some opponents do so to intensify it.</paragraph><paragraph>Proponents of the distinction, however, state that deprogramming entails coercion and confinement, whereas exit counseling assures the cult member of the freedom to leave at any time. Deprogramming typically costs $10,000 or more, mainly because of the expense of a security team. Exit counseling typically costs $2,000 to $4,000, including expenses, for a three- to five-day intervention, although cases requiring extensive research of little-known groups can cost much more. Deprogramming, especially when it fails, entails considerable legal and psychological risk (for example, a permanent alienation of the cultist from his or her family). The psychological and legal risks in exit counseling are significantly reduced. Although deprogrammers do prepare families for the process, exit counselors tend to work with them directly, expecting those requesting the intervention to contribute more to the process; that is, exit counseling requires that families establish a reasonable and respectful level of communication with their loved one before the program itself can begin. Because they rely on coercion, which is illegal except in the case of conservatorship and is generally viewed as unethical, deprogrammers' critiques of the unethical practices of cults will tend to have less credibility with cult members than the critiques of exit counselors.<link type='external' href='http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0121a.html'></link></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Steven Hassan</target></link>, author of the book<space/><italics><link><target>Combatting Cult Mind Control</target></link></italics>, states that he took part in a number of deprogrammings in the late 1970s, and has spoken out against them since 1980.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.freedomofmind.com/stevehassan/refuting/'>Refuting the Disinformation Attacks Put Forth by Destructive Cults and their Agents</link>, by Steven Hassan</extension><space/>Hassan states that he has not participated in any deprogrammings since then, although on page 114 of<space/><italics>Combatting</italics>, Hassan states that deprogrammings should be kept as a last resort if all other attempts to reach the individual fail.
