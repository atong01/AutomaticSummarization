Morgan, in particular, acknowledged that certain forms of society and culture could not possibly have arisen before others. For example, industrial farming could not have been invented before simple farming, and metallurgy could not have developed without previous non-smelting processes involving metals (such as simple ground collection or mining). Morgan, like other 19th century social evolutionists, believed there was a more or less orderly progression from the primitive to the civilized.</paragraph><paragraph>20th-century anthropologists largely reject the notion that all human societies must pass through the same stages in the same order, on the grounds that such a notion does not fit the empirical facts.

Although 19th-century ethnologists saw &quot;diffusion&quot; and &quot;independent invention&quot; as mutually exclusive and competing theories, most ethnographers quickly reached a consensus that both processes occur, and that both can plausibly account for cross-cultural similarities. But these ethnographers also pointed out the superficiality of many such similarities. They noted that even traits that spread through diffusion often were given different meanings and function from one society to another.

This understanding of culture confronts anthropologists with two problems: first, how to escape the unconscious bonds of one's own culture, which inevitably bias our perceptions of and reactions to the world, and second, how to make sense of an unfamiliar culture.

Its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals (such as a religious, occupational, sub cultural group, or a particular community) and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their cultural environment, usually over an extended period of time. The method originated in the<space/><link><target>field work</target><part>field research</part></link><space/>of social anthropologists, especially Bronislaw Malinowski in Britain, the students of<space/><link><target>Franz Boas</target></link><space/>in the United States, and in the later urban research of the<space/><link><target>Chicago school (sociology)</target><part>Chicago School of sociology</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Such research involves a range of well-defined, though variable methods: informal interviews, direct<space/><link><target>observation</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Participation (decision making)</target><part>participation</part></link><space/>in the life of the group,<space/><link><target>Focus group</target><part>collective discussions</part></link>, analyses of<space/><link><target>Primary source</target><part>personal documents</part></link><space/>produced within the group,<space/><link><target>Reflexivity (social theory)</target><part>self-analysis</part></link>, results from activities undertaken off or online, and<space/><link><target>Life history (sociology)</target><part>life-histories</part></link>.

Traditional participant observation is usually undertaken over an extended period of time, ranging from several months to many years, and even generations. An extended research time period means that the researcher is able to obtain more detailed and accurate information about the individuals, community, and/or population under study. Observable details (like daily time allotment) and more hidden details (like<space/><link><target>taboo</target></link><space/>behavior) are more easily observed and interpreted over a longer period of time. A strength of observation and interaction over extended periods of time is that researchers can discover discrepancies between what participants sayand often believeshould happen (the<space/><link><target>formal system</target></link>) and what actually does happen, or between different aspects of the formal system; in contrast, a one-time survey of people's answers to a set of questions might be quite consistent, but is less likely to show conflicts between different aspects of the social system or between conscious representations and behavior.<extension extension_name='ref' name="DeWalt">DeWalt, K.

An ethnography is a piece of writing about a people, at a particular place and time. Typically, the anthropologist lives among people in another society for a period of time, simultaneously<space/><link><target>participant observation</target><part>participating in and observing</part></link><space/>the social and cultural life of the group.</paragraph><paragraph>Numerous other ethnographic techniques have resulted in ethnographic writing or details being preserved, as cultural anthropologists also curate materials, spend long hours in libraries, churches and schools poring over records, investigate graveyards, and decipher ancient scripts. A typical ethnography will also include information about physical geography, climate and habitat. It is meant to be a holistic piece of writing about the people in question, and today often includes the longest possible timeline of past events that the ethnographer can obtain through primary and secondary research.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Bronisaw Malinowski</target></link><space/>developed the ethnographic method, and<space/><link><target>Franz Boas</target></link><space/>taught it in the<space/><link><target>United States</target></link>. Boas' students such as<space/><link><target>Alfred L. Kroeber</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Ruth Benedict</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Margaret Mead</target></link><space/>drew on his conception of culture and<space/><link><target>cultural relativism</target></link><space/>to develop cultural anthropology in the United States. Simultaneously, Malinowski and<space/><link><target>Alfred Radcliffe-Brown</target><part>A.R. Radcliffe Brown</part></link>s students were developing<space/><link><target>social anthropology</target></link><space/>in the United Kingdom. Whereas cultural anthropology focused on symbols and values, social anthropology focused on social groups and institutions. Today socio-cultural anthropologists attend to all these elements.</paragraph><paragraph>In the early 20th century, socio-cultural anthropology developed in different forms in<space/><link><target>Europe</target></link><space/>and in the United States. European &quot;<link><target>social anthropologists</target></link>&quot; focused on observed social behaviors and on &quot;social structure&quot;, that is, on<space/><link><target>interpersonal relationship</target><part>relationships</part></link><space/>among social<space/><link><target>role</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(for example, husband and wife, or parent and child) and social<space/><link><target>institution</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(for example,<space/><link><target>anthropology of religion</target><part>religion</part></link>,<space/><link><target>economic anthropology</target><part>economy</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>political anthropology</target><part>politics</part></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>American &quot;cultural anthropologists&quot; focused on the ways people expressed their view of themselves and their world, especially in<space/><link><target>symbol</target><trail>ic</trail></link><space/>forms, such as<space/><link><target>art</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Mythology</target><part>myths</part></link>. These two approaches frequently converged and generally complemented one another. For example,<space/><link><target>kinship</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>leadership</target></link><space/>function both as symbolic systems and as social institutions. Today almost all socio-cultural anthropologists refer to the work of both sets of predecessors, and have an equal interest in what people do and in what people say.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Cross-cultural comparison</heading><paragraph>One means by which anthropologists combat ethnocentrism is to engage in the process of cross-cultural comparison. It is important to test so-called &quot;human universals&quot; against the ethnographic record. Monogamy, for example, is frequently touted as a universal human trait, yet comparative study shows that it is not. The<space/><link><target>Human Relations Area Files</target></link>, Inc. (HRAF) is a research agency based at<space/><link><target>Yale University</target></link>. Since 1949, its mission has been to encourage and facilitate worldwide<space/><link><target>Cross-cultural studies</target><part>comparative studies</part></link><space/>of human culture, society, and behavior in the past and present. The name came from the Institute of Human Relations, an interdisciplinary program/building at Yale at the time. The Institute of Human Relations had sponsored HRAFs precursor, the<space/><italics>Cross-Cultural Survey</italics><space/>(see<space/><link><target>George Peter Murdock</target></link>), as part of an effort to develop an integrated science of human behavior and culture.

ethnography</heading><paragraph>Ethnography dominates socio-cultural anthropology. Nevertheless, many contemporary socio-cultural anthropologists have rejected earlier models of ethnography as treating local cultures as bounded and isolated. These anthropologists continue to concern themselves with the distinct ways people in different locales experience and understand their<space/><link><target>Human condition</target><part>lives</part></link>, but they often argue that one cannot understand these particular ways of life solely from a local perspective; they instead combine a focus on the local with an effort to grasp larger political, economic, and cultural frameworks that impact local lived realities. Notable proponents of this approach include<space/><link><target>Arjun Appadurai</target></link>,<space/><link><target>James Clifford (historian)</target><part>James Clifford</part></link>,<space/><link><target>George Marcus</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Sidney Mintz</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Michael Taussig</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Eric Wolf</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Ronald Daus</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>A growing trend in anthropological research and analysis is the use of multi-sited ethnography, discussed in George Marcus' article, &quot;Ethnography In/Of the World System: the Emergence of Multi-Sited Ethnography&quot;. Looking at culture as embedded in macro-constructions of a global social order, multi-sited ethnography uses traditional methodology in various locations both spatially and temporally. Through this methodology, greater insight can be gained when examining the impact of world-systems on local and global communities.</paragraph><paragraph>Also emerging in multi-sited ethnography are greater interdisciplinary approaches to fieldwork, bringing in methods from cultural studies, media studies, science and technology studies, and others. In multi-sited ethnography, research tracks a subject across spatial and temporal boundaries. For example, a multi-sited ethnography may follow a &quot;thing,&quot; such as a particular commodity, as it is transported through the networks of global capitalism.</paragraph><paragraph>Multi-sited ethnography may also follow ethnic groups in<space/><link><target>diaspora</target></link>, stories or rumours that appear in multiple locations and in multiple time periods, metaphors that appear in multiple ethnographic locations, or the biographies of individual people or groups as they move through space and time. It may also follow conflicts that transcend boundaries. An example of multi-sited ethnography is<space/><link><target>Nancy Scheper-Hughes</target></link>' work on the international black market for the trade of human organs. In this research, she follows organs as they are transferred through various legal and illegal networks of capitalism, as well as the rumours and urban legends that circulate in impoverished communities about child kidnapping and organ theft.</paragraph><paragraph>Sociocultural anthropologists have increasingly turned their investigative eye on to<space/><link><target>western culture</target><part>&quot;Western&quot; culture</part></link>. For example,<space/><link><target>Philippe Bourgois</target></link><space/>won the<space/><link><target>Margaret Mead Award</target></link><space/>in 1997 for<space/><italics>In Search of Respect</italics>, a study of the entrepreneurs in a Harlem crack-den.
