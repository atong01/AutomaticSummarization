* [[Mass media|Media]]: A [[Program on International Policy Attitudes]] (PIPA) study conducted with [[California]]-based Knowledge Networks, titled "Misperceptions, the Media, and the Iraq War," is released.  According to this study, misperceptions about the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] are most common among consumers of [[Fox News Channel]] and supporters of President [[George W. Bush]] and least common among consumers of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and [[NPR]] and supporters of Democratic presidential candidates.  The study also found that frequent viewers of Fox News are more likely to believe in the misconceptions than less frequent ones. One example misconception is the belief that [[weapons of mass destruction]] have already been found in Iraq.<ref>[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/EJ04Ak01.html Asia Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===October 3, 2003 (Friday)===
* [[Near-Earth asteroid]]: Confirmation on the closest near-miss of a natural object ever recorded. The asteroid (designated [[2003 SQ222]]), about the size of a small house, flew past Earth at a distance of around 88,000 kilometres. It would have made a fireball had it entered the atmosphere.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994228 Science and technology news - New Scientist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction]]: The world continues to digest David Kay's report that finds very little evidence of [[Weapons of mass destruction]] in [[Iraq]], although the regime did intend to develop more weapons with additional capabilities. Such plans and programs appear to have been dormant, the existence of these were also concealed from the [[United Nations]] during the inspections that began in 2002. Weapons inspectors in Iraq do find clandestine "''network of biological [[laboratory|laboratories]]''" and a deadly strain of [[botulinum]]. The US-sponsored search for WMD has so far cost {{Nowrap|$300 million}} and is projected to cost around {{Nowrap|$600 million}} more.<ref>[http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20031003-104756-7758r.htm This story is no longer available - Washington Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.etaiwannews.com/World/2003/10/05/1065322964.htm Taiwan News Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

*[[Evo Morales]] said that [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]], president of [[Bolivia]], may be preparing a [[coup d'état|coup]].<ref>[http://www.lapatriaenlinea.com/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=1246 Periódico La Patria - Noticias de Bolivia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (in Spanish)
* Polish soldiers of the United States-led Coalition discovered four advanced [[missile]]s around central [[Iraq]] in the Hilla region near a highway. The [[Roland missile|Roland-type]] French-made missiles (which are fired from a [[mobile launcher vehicle]] against low flying aircraft) were initially believed to have been manufactured earlier in 2003. [[Arms export]]s to Iraq had been barred by the United Nations after the 1990 invasion of [[Kuwait]]. France says it last shipped Roland missiles to Iraq in 1986. The Polish soldiers were later found to have misinterpreted markings that read 07-01-KND 2003 as a date on the missiles.<ref>[http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/index.cfm?id=1099272003 Polish troops discover four French missiles in Iraq - The Scotsman<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/middleeast/view/50640/1/.html Channel NewsAsia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="reuters2">[http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=3558401 Breaking News, Top News & Latest News Headlines | Reuters.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

* [[Robin Cook]], former United Kingdom [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] who resigned from the British Government in protest prior the [[2003 occupation of Iraq timeline|Iraq war]], publishes his personal diaries.

* Poland apologizes to France for its claims that it had found newly produced [[Roland missile|Roland]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s in [[Iraq]].

===October 5, 2003 (Sunday)===
*[[Maher Arar]] is reported to have been freed from a [[Syria]]n jail.

Israeli media state this is the first Israeli attack on Syrian soil in more than two decades. An emergency session of the UN Security Council is scheduled to debate the action.  France and Germany condemn the attack. The international community calls for restraint by all parties involved.<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/holnus/01052200.htm] {{wayback|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/holnus/01052200.htm |date=20120819074656 }}</ref>

* ''[[Ireland on Sunday]]'' claims that [[Pope John Paul&nbsp;II]] is suffering from terminal [[stomach cancer]] which has spread to his [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. The newspaper reports that the Pope has dictated a [[living will]] which gives instructions as to how the Roman Catholic Church is to be administered when the medical treatment he is receiving makes it impossible for him to function as pope. According to the paper, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] have been told to be ready at a moment's notice to fly to [[Rome]] for a [[Papal funeral]] and [[Papal conclave]].

* [[SCO v. IBM Linux lawsuit|SCO v. IBM]]: In an open letter to the [[Linux]] community published by [[Silicon Graphics]] (SGI), SGI states it conducted a comprehensive comparison of the [[Linux kernel]] and the [[UNIX System&nbsp;V]] [[source code]] owned by The [[SCO Group]]. According to the letter (authored by SGI [[Vice President]] of [[Software]] [[Rich Altmaier]]), SGI's "''exhaustive comparison''" of the source codes turned up only "''trivial''" code segments that "''may arguably be related''" to SCO's software. The letter also disputed SCO's claims that SGI inappropriately contributed its [[XFS]] (eXtensible File System).<ref>[http://www.itworld.com/Man/2685/031006sgisco/] {{wayback|url=http://www.itworld.com/Man/2685/031006sgisco/ |date=20080706190657 }}</ref>

* [[American occupation of Iraq|Occupation of Iraq]]: Some in the international community have rejected a revised United States draft [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]  concerning [[Iraq]] (calling for a multinational force of peacekeeping troops in Iraq under American command; transferring power gradually to elected civilian rule [though there is no handover timetable for sovereignty]). The resolution is being supported by the United Kingdom. France, Germany, and Russia (which opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]) have joined [[Kofi Annan]] in opposing the resolution. Annan states that the [[United Nations]] itself will not become heavily involved unless there are early moves toward passing sovereignty to the Iraqi people. Annan's stance is similar to that of [[Pope John Paul&nbsp;II]] and some members of the [[European Union]].<ref>[http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_1050.shtml FinalCall.com News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/ap/ap_story.html/Intl/AP.V6661.AP-UN-Iraq.html] {{wayback|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/ap/ap_story.html/Intl/AP.V6661.AP-UN-Iraq.html |date=20141016111311 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.wishtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=1470372 Story of my Life | WISH-TV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=55C8D482-E130-4E0F-88E43A2F02B92964] {{wayback|url=http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=55C8D482-E130-4E0F-88E43A2F02B92964 |date=20120406081409 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.swisspolitics.org/en/news/index.php?section=int&page=news_inhalt&news_id=4312369] {{wayback|url=http://www.swisspolitics.org/en/news/index.php?section=int&page=news_inhalt&news_id=4312369 |date=20110927120949 }}</ref>
*Attempts by the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s government to ban smoking in [[public house|pubs]], restaurants and hotels run into more trouble as a government minister who will have responsibility for enforcing the ban, [[Frank Fahey]], refuses to deny that he is critical of the plan and wants a compromise that would allow smoking in some areas to continue. A former [[Mayor of Galway]] and [[Fianna Fáil]] councillor who has links with the pub industry resigns from a health authority in protest at the refusal of the Fianna Fáil-[[Progressive Democrats|Progressive Democrat]] government to compromise on the proposed ban. This follows an earlier announcement that publicans in [[County Kerry]] will refuse to obey the new law and indications of growing popular opposition to the ban.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2003/1006/tobacco.html Health board chief quits over smoking ban - RTÉ News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
