They also claimed that an Army Convention representing &quot;95 per cent of volunteers&quot; had unanimously elected a new 12-member Army Executive, which in turn appointed a new seven-member Army Council. The moves came as a result of dissatisfication with the southern-based leadership and the apparent winding-down of military operations.
