'''Celebrity''' is fame and public attention in the media, usually applied to a person, or group of people (celebrity couple, family etc.), or occasionally, to animals or fictional entities. Celebrity status is often associated with wealth (commonly referred to as ''fame and fortune'') and fame can often provide opportunities to make money.

Successful careers in sports and entertainment are commonly associated with celebrity status;<ref name = "I want to be famous ">{{cite news |title= I want to be famous|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/17/i-want-to-be-famous |publisher= Celebbuzz|date= April 17, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2011|location=London|first=Emma|last=Brockes}}</ref><ref name = "Western world kids want to grow up to be famous Children in developing countries want to be doctors ">{{cite news |title= Western world kids want to grow up to be famous|url= http://www.news1130.com/news/local/article/304123--western-world-kids-want-to-grow-up-to-be-famous |publisher= [[News1130]]|date= November 28, 2011|accessdate=December 25, 2011|location=Vancouver}}</ref> political leaders often become celebrities.

==History==
Throughout recorded history there are accounts of people who attracted the trappings of celebrity which would be recognized today.<ref name=BBC>{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1777554.stm|title = A brief history of celebrity|date = April 4, 2003|accessdate = June 8, 2014|website = BBC News|publisher = BBC|last = |first = }}</ref>

Athletes in [[Ancient Greece]] were welcomed home as heroes, had songs and poems written in their honour and received free food and gifts from those seeking [[celebrity endorsement]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Ancient Greek Athletics|last = Miller|first = Stephen|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 0-300-11529-6|location = |pages = }}</ref> [[Ancient Rome]] similarly lauded actors and notorious gladiators and [[Julius Caesar]] appeared on a coin in his own lifetime (a departure from the usual depiction of battles and divine lineage).<ref name=BBC />

In the 12th century, [[Thomas Becket]] became famous following his murder. He was promoted by the Christian Church as a martyr and images of him and scenes from his life became widespread in just a few years. In a pattern often repeated, what started out as an explosion of popularity (often referred to with the suffix 'mania') turned into a long-lasting fame: pilgrimages to Canterbury Cathedral where he was killed became instantly fashionable and the fascination with his life and death have inspired plays and films.

The cult of personality (particularly in the west) can be traced back to the Romantics in the 18th Century,<ref>{{cite book|title = A Short History of Celebrity|author = Morgan, Dr Simon|publisher = Princeton University Press|date  = 2010}}</ref> whose livelihood as artists and poets depended on the currency of their reputation. The establishment of cultural hot-spots became an important factor in the process of generating fame: for example, London and Paris in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Newspapers started including gossip columns <ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/concisehistbritnews/britnews19th/ | title = Concise History of the British Newspaper in the Nineteenth Century | publisher = British Library}}</ref> and certain clubs and events became places to be seen in order to receive publicity.

The movie industry spread around the globe in the first half of the 20th Century and with it the now familiar concept of the instantly recognizable faces of its superstars. Yet, celebrity wasn't always tied to actors in films, especially when cinema was starting out as a medium. As Paul McDonald states in ''The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities'', "in the first decade of the twentieth century, American film production companies withheld the names of film performers, despite requests from audiences, fearing that public recognition would drive performers to demand higher salaries."<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities|last = McDonald|first = Paul|publisher = Wallflower|year = 2000|isbn = 978-1-903364-02-4|location = Great Britain|pages = 15}}</ref>  Public fascination went well beyond the on-screen exploits of movie stars and their private lives became headline news: for example, in Hollywood the marriages of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and in [[Bollywood]] the affairs of [[Raj Kapoor]] in the 1950s.

The second half of the century saw television and popular music bring new forms of celebrity. The rock star and pop group epitomised by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Beatles]] respectively. [[John Lennon]]'s quote: "We're more popular than Jesus now"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.beatlesbible.com/1966/03/04/how-does-a-beatle-live-by-maureen-cleave/ |publisher = London Evening Standard|date  = 1966|author = Cleave, Maureen|title=How does a beatle live}}</ref> gives an insight into both the adulation and notoriety that fame can bring. Unlike movies, television created celebrities who were not primarily actors; for example, presenters, talk show hosts and news readers. However, most of these are only famous within the regions reached by their particular broadcaster, and only a few such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Jerry Springer]] or [[David Frost]] could be said to have broken through into a wider stardom.

==Regional and cultural implications==
[[File:Barack Obama at White House gun violence meeting.jpg|left|thumb|Many people around the world know the name and face of the current US president, [[Barack Obama]].]]

Cultures and regions with a significant population may have their own independent celebrity systems, with distinct hierarchies. For example, the Canadian province of Quebec, which is French-speaking, has its own system of French-speaking television, movie and music celebrities. A person who garners a degree of fame in one culture may be considered less famous or obscure in another. Some nationwide celebrities might command some attention outside their own nation; for example, the singer [[Lara Fabian]] is widely known in the [[French-speaking]] world, but only had a couple of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hits in the US, whereas the francophone Canadian singer [[Celine Dion]] is well known in both the French-speaking world and in the US.

Regions within a country, or cultural communities (linguistic, ethnic, religious) can also have their own celebrity systems, especially in linguistically or culturally distinct regions such as [[Quebec]] or [[Wales]]. Regional radio personalities, [[newscasters]], politicians or community [[leader]]s may be local or regional celebrities.

[[File:Rajesh Khanna Profile.jpg|thumb|The Indian actor [[Rajesh Khanna]] was referred to as "[[Bollywood]]'s first superstar".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bollywood's 'first superstar' Rajesh Khanna dies aged 69|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-18881804|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=BBC|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref>]]

English-speaking media commentators and journalists will sometimes refer to celebrities as belonging to the ''[[A-List]]'' or state that a certain actor belongs to the ''B-List'', the latter being a disparaging context. These informal rankings indicate a placing within a hierarchy. However, due to differing levels of celebrity in different regions, it is difficult to place people within one bracket. A Brazilian actor might be a B-list action film actor in the US, but an A-list star in Portugal.

Some elements are associated with fame, such as appearing on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', being spoofed in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', having a wax statue in ''[[Madame Tussauds]]'', or receiving a star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].''

Certain people are known even to people unfamiliar with the area in which they excelled. If one has to name a famous boxer, they are more likely to name [[Muhammad Ali]] or [[Mike Tyson]], since their fame expanded beyond the sport itself.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Pablo Picasso]]'s style and name are known even to people who are not interested in art; likewise many know that [[Harry Houdini]] was an illusionist, [[Tiger Woods]] a golfer, [[Bill Gates]] an entrepreneur, [[Albert Einstein]] a scientist; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] classical composers; [[Luciano Pavarotti]] an opera singer.

===Fictional implications===
The same phenomenon is true for fictional characters. [[Superman]], [[Spider-Man]], and [[Batman]] represent super heroes to a far wider audience than that of the comics and graphic novels in which they appear.  Disney have themeparks around the world which rely on the fame of its creations headed by [[Mickey Mouse]]. [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[James Bond]] continue to be portrayed in film, television and literature decades after the original stories were published. Some characters from video and computer games have developed a celebrity life beyond these media, such as [[Lara Croft]] and [[Mario]].

==Becoming a celebrity in the U.S.==
[[File:Kobe Bryant smiling on the bench USA vs GBR 2012.jpg|thumb|Professional athletes such as [[Kobe Bryant]] (above) who play for various sports teams are one of the most sought after careers in the world.]]

People may become celebrities in a wide range of ways; from their professions, following appearances in the media, committing a [[mass murder]],<ref>"[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2012-07-20/aurora-colorado-batman-movie-murder/56376566/1 Don't turn Aurora killer into celebrity]". USATODAY.com. July 20, 2012.</ref> or by complete accident. The term "instant celebrity" describes someone who becomes a celebrity in a very short period of time. Someone who achieves a small amount of [[15 minutes of fame|transient fame]] (through, say, [[Media circus|hype]] or mass media) may become labeled a "B-grade celebrity". Often, the generalization extends to someone who falls short of mainstream or persistent fame but who seeks to extend or exploit it.

===Success===
There are no guarantees of success for an individual to become a celebrity. Though celebrities come from many different working fields, most celebrities are typically associated with the fields of sports and entertainment or a person may be a public figure who is commonly recognizable in mass media. Celebrities are often stereotyped as individuals who possess exorbitant amounts of [[wealth]] and [[glamour (presentation)|glamor]]. They are also sometimes denigrated by the general public as being overpaid and publicly overrated compared to a normal worker such as a doctor, police officer or a teacher.

Though glamor and wealth certainly plays a role for only famous celebrities, most people in the sports and entertainments sphere, be it music, film, television, radio, modelling, comedy, literature etc. live in obscurity and only a small percentage achieve fame and fortune. Due to the [[Machiavellian]] and competitive nature within both industries, a vast amount of aspiring entertainers and athletes in the world, even some of the most talented may never be recognized and won't ever receive the opportunity to carve a name for themselves.<ref>{{cite web|author=Book of Odds (View Profile) |url=http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |title=Odds of Becoming a YouTube Celebrity |publisher=DivineCaroline |date= |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Natalie Boxall |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2007/may/26/graduates.careers |title=Making it in the music industry &#124; Money |work=The Guardian |date= May 30, 2007|accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=White |first=Alison |url=http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/music-industry-careers?commentpage=all |title=Live Q&A: Career options in the music industry &#124; Guardian careers &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Careers.guardian.co.uk |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |title=Chances of Making it to the NHL |publisher=Cumberlandminorhockey.ca |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref>

===Difficulty===
[[File:David Letterman 2.jpg|thumb|[[David Letterman]], late night talk show host and comedian.]]

A large number of [[Sportsperson|athletes]] who are unable to turn professional take a second job or even sometimes abandon their athletic aspirations in order to make ends meet. A small percentage of entertainers and athletes are able to make a decent living but a vast majority will spend their careers toiling from hard work, determination, rejection and frequent unemployment. For minor league to amateur athletes, earnings are usually on the lower end of the pay-scale. Many of them take second jobs on the side or even venture into other occupations within the field of sports such as coaching, [[general management]], [[referee]]ing or recruiting and scouting up-and-coming athletes.<ref>{{cite web|author=E.

For instance, [[David Letterman]] is well known for branching into [[late night television]] as a [[talk show host]] while honing his skills as a stand-up comedian, [[Barbra Streisand]] ventured into acting while operating as a singer, or [[Clint Eastwood]], who achieved even greater fame in Hollywood for being a film director and a producer than for his acting credentials.

According to American entertainment magnate [[Master P]], entertainers and professional athletes make up less than 1% of all millionaires in the entire world.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/p-miller-formerly-master-p-says-if-you-have-computer-500-i-can-show-you-how-make-millions-912343.htm | title=P.

According to the US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] the median wage for commercial and print models was only $11.22 per hour in 2006 and was also listed one of the top ten worst jobs in the United States.<ref name="worst jobs">{{cite news | last = Mantell | first = Ruth | title = The 10 worst jobs in America: Low pay, no benefits put these workers in a tough spot | work = MarketWatch | publisher = Dow Jones | date = November 1, 2007 | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/10-worst-jobs-america/story.aspx?guid=%7B6345DDB1%2D03BA%2D4760%2DB763%2D4F98BA9D9145%7D&dist=MostReadHome | accessdate = 2008-01-31}}</ref>  Most models only draw in around US$500 every showcase and only famous models that are high in demand such as [[Miranda Kerr]] or [[Gisele Bündchen]] earn multi-million dollar salaries. Freelance writers and authors who aspire to be the next [[Stephen King]] and [[Dan Brown]] are known to submit manuscripts of their latest literary creations hoping for their big break are only to be bombarded with numerous rejection letters from major publishing houses. Many aspiring comedians who dream of becoming the next [[Louis C.K.]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]] never see the inside of a movie or television studio, but rather spend most of their careers doing stand-up in [[comedy club]]s and other small venues, hoping to be discovered. Because gigs can be infrequent, it can be very difficult to make a living as a freelance entertainer. As a result, many supplement their income by holding down other jobs on the side.

Though become the commonplace for celebrities to place their name with endorsements onto products just for quick money. However, some celebrities have gone beyond merely using their big names and have decided to put their entrepreneurial spirit to work by becoming entrepreneurs by attaching themselves in the business aspects of entertainment and building their own business brand beyond their traditional salaried activities. Along with investing their salaried wages into growing business endeavors, a number of celebrities have become innovative business leaders in their respective industries, gaining the admiration of their peers and contributing to the country’s economy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.careeraddict.com/3342/top-10-successful-celebrity-entrepreneurs?_hs_=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--5bf7b61a8d2ab764baf9a1d66077f6d6f97e6498 | title=Top 10 Successful Celebrity Entrepreneurs | publisher=Career Addict | accessdate=22 April 2014 | author=Emma Mackenzie}}</ref>

Tabloid magazines and talk TV shows bestow a great deal of attention on celebrities. To stay in the public eye and build wealth in addition to their salaried labor, numerous celebrities have participating and branching into various business ventures and endorsements. Many celebrities have participated in many different endorsement opportunities that include: animation, publishing, fashion designing, cosmetics, [[consumer electronics]], household items and [[home appliance|appliance]]s, cigarettes, [[soft drink]]s and alcoholic beverages, hair care, hairdressing, [[jewelry design]], fast food, credit cards, video games, writing, and toys.<ref name="Best And Worst Celebrity Side Businesses ">{{cite news|title=Best And Worst Celebrity Side Businesses |url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/07/22/stars-biz-successful-forbeslife-cx_dp_0722style_2.html= |work=Forbes |date=July 22, 2009 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120118190511/http://www.forbes.com/2008/07/22/stars-biz-successful-forbeslife-cx_dp_0722style_2.html= |archivedate=18 January 2012 }}</ref>

In addition to various endorsements, a number of celebrities have been involved with some business and investment related ventures also include:  and toddler related items, [[List of professional sports team owners|sports team ownership]], [[fashion design|fashion retailing]], establishments such as restaurants, cafes, hotels, and casinos, movie theaters, advertising and event planning, management related ventures such as [[sports management]], financial services, [[modeling agency|model management]], and [[talent management]], [[record label]]s, [[film production]], [[television producer|television production]], publishing such as [[book publisher|book]] and [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]], massage therapy, [[Beauty salon|salon]]s, health and fitness, and real estate.<ref name="Best And Worst Celebrity Side Businesses "/>

Although some celebrities have achieved additional financial success from various business ventures, the vast majority of celebrities are not successful businesspeople and still rely on salaried labored wages in order earn a living. Most businesses and investments are well known to have a 90 to 95 percent failure rate within the first five years of operation. Not all celebrities eventually succeed with their own businesses and other related side ventures. Some celebrities either went [[wikt:broke|broke]] or filed for bankruptcy as result of dabbling with such side businesses or endorsements. Though some might question such a validity since celebrities themselves are already well known, have mass appeal, and are well exposed to the general public. The average entrepreneur who is not well known and reputable to general public doesn't the same marketing flexibility and status-quo as most celebrities allow and have. Therefore, compared to the average person who starts a business, celebrities already have all the cards and odds stacked in their favor. This means they can have an unfair advantage to expose their business ventures and endorsements and can easily capture a more significant amount of market share than the average entrepreneur.<ref name = "7 Most Embarrassing Celebrity Business Failures">{{cite news |title= 7 Most Embarrassing Celebrity Business Failures|url=http://www.growthink.com/business-plan/7_Most_Embarrassing_Celebrity_Business_Plan_Failures.html|publisher= Growthink|year= 2007|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>

==As a mass media phenomenon==
[[File:Kim Kardashian 2, 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Kim Kardashian]], reality TV star.]]

Celebrities often have fame comparable to [[royal family|royalty]]. As a result, there is a strong public curiosity about their private affairs. The release of [[Kim Kardashian]]'s [[Celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] with rapper [[Ray J]] in 2003 brought her to a new level of fame, leading to magazine covers, book deals, and [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|reality TV]] series.<ref>{{cite journal | title="Kim Kardashian Superstar Featuring Ray J" 18 U.S.C. 2257 Compliance Records | author=S Hirsch | journal=Vivid Entertainment LLC. – 18 U.S.C. 2257 Compliance Records | year=2007}}</ref><ref name=vivid>{{cite web|url= http://www.hiphoppress.com/2007/02/vivid_entertain.html|title= Vivid Entertainment Spends $1-Million To Acquire Notorious Video 'Starring' Sexy Socialite Kim Kardashian And Hip Hop Star Ray J|accessdate= 2008-10-06|author=[[Vivid Entertainment]]|date= 2007-02-07|publisher=Hip Hop Press}}</ref>

Celebrities may be resented for their accolades, and the public may have a love/hate relationship with celebrities. Due to the high visibility of celebrities' private lives, their successes and shortcomings are often made very public. Celebrities are alternately portrayed as glowing examples of perfection, when they garner awards, or as decadent or immoral if they become associated with a scandal. When seen in a positive light, celebrities are frequently portrayed as possessing skills and abilities beyond average people; for example, celebrity actors are routinely celebrated for acquiring new skills necessary for filming a role within a very brief time, and to a level that amazes the professionals who train them. Similarly, some celebrities with very little formal education can sometimes be portrayed as experts on complicated issues. Some celebrities have been very vocal with their political views. For example, [[Matt Damon]] expressed his displeasure with 2008 US vice presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]], as well as with the 2011 [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|United States debt-ceiling crisis]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,420621,00.html |title=Matt Damon: Sarah Palin Presidency Would Be Like a 'Really Bad Disney Movie' |publisher=Fox News |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Young |first=Kevin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8617149.stm |title=Election 2010: Political celebrities – then and now |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref>

===Famous for being famous===
{{Biased-section|date=September 2015}}{{Main|Famous for being famous}}
Famous for being famous, in [[popular culture]] terminology, refers to someone who attains celebrity status for no particular identifiable reason, or who achieves fame through association with a celebrity.<ref name="Jenkins">{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Joe|title=Contemporary moral issues|publisher=Heinemann|year=2002|edition=4, illustrated|series=Examining Religions |page=178|isbn=978-0-435-30309-9}}</ref>  The term is a [[pejorative]], suggesting that the individual has no particular talents or abilities.<ref name="JenJones">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jen|title=Being Famous|publisher=Capstone Press|year=2007|series=Snap Books: 10 Things You Need to Know about|page=20|isbn=978-1-4296-0126-9}}</ref> Even when their fame arises from a particular talent or action on their part, the term will sometimes still apply if their fame is perceived as disproportionate to what they earned through their own talent or work.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The coinages "[[famesque]]" and "[[celebutante]]" are of similar pejorative gist.

==Families==
Another example of celebrity is a family that has notable ancestors or is known for its wealth. In some cases, a well-known family is associated with a particular field. For example, the [[Kennedy family]] is associated with US politics; The [[House of Windsor]] with royalty; [[The Osbournes]], [[Jackson family|The Jacksons]], [[Chaplin family|Chaplin]], and [[Barrymore family|Barrymore]] families with entertainment.

==Restricted access==
Access to celebrities is strictly controlled by their entourage of staff which includes [[Talent manager|manager]]s, [[publicist]]s, [[Talent agent|agent]]s, [[personal assistant]]s, and [[bodyguard]]s. Even journalists find it difficult to access celebrities for interviews. An interview with writer and actor [[Michael Musto]] cites:

{{quote|You have to go through many hoops just to talk to a major celebrity. You have to get past three different sets of publicists: the publicist for the event, the publicist for the movie, and then the celebrity's personal publicist. They all have to approve you.|[[Michael Musto]]|<ref>[[n:An interview with gossip columnist Michael Musto on the art of celebrity journalism|en.wikinews.org]]</ref>}}

Celebrities often hire one or more bodyguards (or close protection officer) to protect themselves and their families from threats ranging from the mundane (intrusive [[paparazzi|paparazzi photographers]] or autograph-seeking [[Fan (person)|fans]]) to serious ([[assault]], [[kidnapping]], [[assassination]], or [[stalking]]). The bodyguard travels with the celebrity during professional activities (movie shoots or concerts) and personal activities such as recreation and errands.

Celebrities also typically have security staff at their home, to protect them from similar threats.<ref>[http://www.iacpo.org/ International Association of Close Protection Officers]</ref><ref name = "Celebrity-stalking has common threads ">{{cite news |title= Celebrity-stalking has common threads|url= http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&id=6730960= |publisher= ABC|date= March 26, 2009|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>

==Cult of celebrity==

===15 minutes of fame===
''See also: [[15 minutes of fame]], [[One-hit wonder]]''
[[File:Andy Warhol 1975.jpg|thumb|[[Andy Warhol]] coined the phrase "[[15 minutes of fame]]".]]

[[Andy Warhol]] famously coined the phrase "[[15 minutes of fame]]" in reference to a short-lived publicity. Certain "15 minutes of fame" celebrities can be average people seen with an A-list celebrity, who are sometimes noticed on entertainment news channels such as [[E! News]]. These persons are ordinary people becoming celebrities, often based on the ridiculous things they do.  "In fact, many reality show contestants fall into this category: the only thing that qualifies them to be on TV is that they're real."<ref>Maasik, Sonia, and Jack Solomon. ''Signs of Life in the USA''. 5th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2006.</ref>

Certain people are only remembered today because of a movie portrayal, certain story or [[urban legend]] surrounding their life and less for their accomplishments. [[Antonio Salieri]] was a famous and well-known 18th-century composer, but his fictional portrayal as an [[antagonist]] (for example, in the musical and film ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'') has been more famous than his music since the end of the 20th century. [[Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]] and [[O. J. Simpson]] are more notorious for their association with murder trials than for their respective movie and sports careers. [[Ronald Reagan]] is more famous as a politician today than as a movie actor. Centuries after his death, [[Andrea Mantegna]] is now better known as the mentor of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] than for his own paintings.

==Social networking==
Celebrities have been flocking to [[social networking]] and video hosting sites such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google+, and MySpace.<ref>Murad, Ahmed [http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article5641893.ece "The 50 most popular celebs on Twitter"], The Sunday Times, February 2, 2009</ref> Social networking sites allow celebrities to communicate directly with their fans, removing the middle-man known as traditional media. Social media humanizes celebrities in a way that arouses public fascination as evident by the success of magazines such as ''[[Us Weekly]]'' and ''[[People (magazine)|People Weekly]]''. Celebrity blogging have also spawned stars such as [[Perez Hilton]] who is well known for not only blogging, but also [[outing]] celebrities.<ref name = "Perez Hilton’s gay witch hunt ">{{cite news |title= Perez Hilton’s gay witch hunt|url= http://www.salon.com/2006/12/15/hilton_2/= |publisher= ABC|date= December 15, 2006|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>

Social media sites have also contributed to the fame of some celebrities, such as [[Tila Tequila]] who became known through MySpace.<ref>Trebay, Guy [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28fame.html "She's Famous (and So Can You)"], The New York Times, October 28, 2007</ref>

==Health implications==

[[John Cleese]] said being famous offers some advantages such as financial wealth and easier access to things that are more difficult for non-famous people to access, such as the ability to more easily meet other famous or powerful people, but that being famous also often comes with the disadvantage of creating the conditions in which the celebrity finds themselves acting, at least temporarily (although sometimes over extended periods of time), in a superficial, inauthentic fashion.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PJaHSovyZ4 John Cleese Speaking at the American School in London] (beginning at about 44:25 into the video)</ref>

Common threats such as [[stalking]] have spawned [[celebrity worship syndrome]] where a person becomes overly involved with the details of a celebrity's personal life.<ref name="Schumaker">Schumaker, John F., 'Star Struck' New Internationalist; Issue 363, p34-35, 2p, December 2003</ref>    Psychologists have indicated that though many people obsess over glamorous film, television, sport and pop stars, the disparity in salaries in society seems to value [[professional athlete]]s and [[list of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry based professional]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Horovitz|first=Bruce|title=The good, bad and ugly of America's celeb obsession|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2003-12-19-celeb_x.htm|work=December 19th 2003|work=USA Today|accessdate=May 5, 2012|date=December 19, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=America's Obsession with Celebrities|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahradio/Americas-Obsession-with-Celebrities|work=June 4th 2007|publisher=Oprah.com|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}</ref> One study found that singers, musicians, actors and sportspeople die younger on average than writers, composers, academics, politicians and businesspeople, with a greater incidence of cancer and especially lung cancer. However, it was remarked that the reasons for this remained unclear, with theories including [[innate]] tendencies towards risk-taking as well as the pressure or opportunities of particular types of fame.<ref>{{cite news|website=BBC News|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22189177|title=Fame may 'lead to a shorter life'|date=April 18, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}</ref>

Furthermore, some have said fame might have negative [[psychological]] effects, and may lead to increasingly selfish tendencies and psychopathy. [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/health/psychology/22fame.html?pagewanted=print&_r=0]

Recently, there has been more attention toward the impact celebrities have on health decisions of the population at large.<ref>S.J. Hoffman, C. Tan. 2015. “Biological, psychological and social processes that explain celebrities' influence on patients' health-related behaviors,” Archives of Public Health 73(3): 1-11. doi:10.1186/2049-3258-73-3</ref> It is believed that the public will follow celebrities health advice to some extent.<ref>S.J. Hoffman, C. Tan. 2013. “Why Do So Many People Follow Celebrities’ Medical Advice? A Meta-Narrative Review,” British Medical Journal 347: f7151. doi:10.1136/bmj.f7151.</ref> This can have positive impacts when the celebrities give solid, evidence informed health advice, however it can also have detrimental affects if the health advice is not accurate enough.
