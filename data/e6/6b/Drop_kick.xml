This is rare, as place kicks are almost always used for the conversion; a drop kick is sometimes used late in a game if the scoring team needs to score again quickly, and taking a place kick would be slower. Also, if a gust of wind blows the ball over on a place kick attempt after the kicker has begun his run-up, thus allowing the opposing team to begin a charge down, then there is no time to reset the ball, and the kicker may attempt a quick drop kick. Drop kicks are also optional for a penalty kick to score a penalty goal. This is rare, as place kicks are almost always used. When kicking for touch (the sideline) from a penalty, a drop kick may be used. This is rare, as the option of a punt kick is almost always taken instead.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Rugby sevens</heading><paragraph>The usage of drop kicks in rugby sevens is the same as in rugby union, except that drop kicks are used for all conversion attempts and for penalty kicks, both of which must be taken within 40 seconds of the try being scored or the award of the penalty.</paragraph><heading level='2'>American and Canadian (gridiron) football</heading><paragraph>In both<space/><link><target>American football</target><part>American</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Canadian football</target></link>, one method of scoring a<space/><link><target>Field goal (football)</target><part>field goal</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>extra point</target></link><space/>is by drop-kicking the football through the goal.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Image:Curlin.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>130px</part><part><link><target>Zach Curlin</target></link><space/>drop kicking.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>It contrasts to a<space/><link><target>Punt (gridiron football)</target><part>punt</part></link>, wherein the player kicks the ball without letting it hit the ground first; and a<space/><link><target>placekicker</target><part>placekick</part></link>, wherein the player kicks a stationary ball off the ground: &quot;from placement&quot;.
