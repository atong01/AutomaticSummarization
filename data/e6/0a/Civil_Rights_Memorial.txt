The '''Civil Rights Memorial''' is a [[memorial]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] to 41 people who died in the struggle for the equal and integrated treatment of all people, regardless of race, during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States.<ref name="montadvertiser1">{{cite news |title=Civil Rights Memorial marks 20 years |author=Scott Johnson |newspaper=Montgomery Advertiser |date=Nov 5, 2009 }}</ref> The memorial is sponsored by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].<ref name="splc">{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/civil-rights-memorial |title=Civil Rights Memorial |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}</ref>

The names included in the memorial belong to those who died between 1954 and 1968. Those dates were chosen because in 1954 the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that [[racial segregation]] in schools was unlawful and 1968 is the year of [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King's assassination]]. The monument was created by [[Maya Lin]], who is best known for creating the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="splc"/> The Civil Rights Memorial was dedicated in 1989.<ref name="montadvertiser1"/>

The concept of Maya Lin's design is based on the soothing and healing effect of water. It was inspired by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s paraphrase ''"... we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. ..."'', from the "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech, delivered at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], [[Washington D.C.]] on August 28, 1963.<ref name="splc"/> This passage in King's speech is a direct reference to [[Book of Amos|Amos]] {{bibleverse-nb||Amos|5:24|KJV}}, as translated in the American Standard Version of the Bible.  The memorial is a [[fountain]] in the form of an asymmetric inverted stone [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]. A film of water flows over the base of the cone, which contains the 41 names included. It is possible to touch the smooth film of water and temporarily alter the surface film, which quickly returns to smoothness. As such, the memorial represents the aspirations of the American Civil Rights Movement against legalized [[racism]].
