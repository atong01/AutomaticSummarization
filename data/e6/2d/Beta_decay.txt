{{Nuclear physics}} 
In [[nuclear physics]], '''beta decay''' (''β''-decay) is a type of [[radioactive decay]] in which a [[proton]] is transformed into a [[neutron]], or vice versa, inside an [[atomic nucleus]]. This process allows the atom to move closer to the optimal [[proton–neutron ratio|ratio of protons and neutrons]]. As a result of this transformation, the nucleus emits a detectable [[beta particle]], which is an [[electron]] or [[positron]].<ref name="konya74">{{cite book

Beta decay is mediated by the [[Weak interaction|weak force]]. There are two types of beta decay, known as ''beta minus'' and ''beta plus''. In beta minus (β<sup>−</sup>) decay a neutron is lost and a proton appears and the process produces an [[electron]] and [[electron antineutrino]], while in beta plus (β<sup>+</sup>) decay a proton is lost and a neutron appears and the process produces a [[positron]] and [[electron neutrino]]; β<sup>+</sup> decay is thus also known as [[positron emission]].<ref>{{Cite book

An example of electron emission (β<sup>−</sup> decay) is the decay of [[carbon-14]] into [[nitrogen-14]]:
:{{nuclide2|carbon|14}} → {{nuclide2|nitrogen|14}} + {{subatomic particle|electron}} + {{subatomic particle|electron antineutrino}}
In this form of decay, the original element becomes a new chemical element in a process known as [[nuclear transmutation]]. This new element has an unchanged [[mass number]] {{mvar|A}}, but an [[atomic number]] {{mvar|Z}} that is increased by one. As in all nuclear decays, the decaying element (in this case {{nuclide2|carbon|14}}) is known as the ''parent nuclide'' while the resulting element (in this case {{nuclide2|nitrogen|14}}) is known as the ''daughter nuclide''. The emitted electron or positron is known as a [[beta particle]].

An example of positron emission (β<sup>+</sup> decay) is the decay of [[magnesium-23]] into [[sodium-23]]:
:{{nuclide2|Magnesium|23}} → {{nuclide2|Sodium|23}} + {{subatomic particle|positron}} + {{subatomic particle|electron neutrino}}
In contrast to β<sup>−</sup> decay, β<sup>+</sup> decay is accompanied by the emission of an [[electron neutrino]] and a [[positron]]. β<sup>+</sup> decay also results in nuclear transmutation, with the resulting element having an atomic number that is decreased by one.

[[Electron capture]] is sometimes included as a type of beta decay, because the basic nuclear process, mediated by the [[weak force]], is the same. In electron capture, an inner atomic electron is captured by a proton in the nucleus, transforming it into a neutron, and an electron neutrino is released. An example of electron capture is the decay of [[krypton-81]] into [[bromine-81]]:
:{{nuclide2|Krypton|81}} + {{subatomic particle|electron}} → {{nuclide2|Bromine|81}} + {{subatomic particle|electron neutrino}}
Electron capture is a competing (simultaneous) decay process for all nuclei that can undergo β<sup>+</sup> decay. The converse, however, is not true: electron capture is the ''only'' type of decay that is allowed in proton-rich nuclides that do not have sufficient energy to emit a positron and neutrino.<ref name="Zuber">{{cite book|last=Zuber|first=Kai|title= Neutrino Physics|isbn= 9781420064711|pages=466|edition=2|publisher= CRC Press|year=2011}}</ref>

== β<sup>−</sup> decay ==
[[Image:Beta Negative Decay.svg|thumb|left|The [[Feynman diagram]] for {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}}&nbsp;decay of a [[neutron]] into a [[proton]], [[electron]], and [[electron antineutrino]] via an intermediate [[W boson|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson]].]]
In {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}}&nbsp;decay, the [[weak interaction]] converts an [[atomic nucleus]] into a nucleus with [[atomic number]] increased by one, while emitting an electron ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}}) and an electron antineutrino ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}}). [[File:RaE1.jpg|thumb|A beta spectrum, showing a typical division of energy between electron and antineutrino]]The generic equation is:

: {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{mvar|Z}}|X}} → {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{math|''Z''+1}}|X'}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron Antineutrino}}<ref name="konya74"/>
where {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|Z}} are the [[mass number]] and [[atomic number]]<!-- "charge" is linked from another place. "mass number" is paired with "atomic number" --> of the decaying nucleus, and X and X' are the initial and final elements, respectively.

Another example is when the [[free neutron]] ({{Nuclide2|neutronium|1}}) decays by {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}}&nbsp;decay into a proton ({{SubatomicParticle|Proton}}):
: {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron Antineutrino}}.
<!-- never use <math> for it, because symbols of particles may not be italicized! -->

At the [[fundamental particle|fundamental]] level (as depicted in the [[Feynman diagram]] on the left), this is caused by the conversion of the negatively charged (−{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;[[elementary charge|e]]) [[down quark]] to the positively charged (+{{frac|2|3}}&nbsp;e) [[up quark]] by emission of a [[W boson|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson]]; the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson subsequently decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino:
:{{Subatomic particle|down quark}} → {{Subatomic particle|up quark}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron Antineutrino}}.

The beta spectrum is a continuous spectrum: the total decay energy is divided between the electron and the antineutrino. In the figure to the right, this is shown, by way of example, for an electron of 0.4 MeV energy. In this example, the antineutrino then gets the remainder: 0.76 MeV, since the total decay energy is assumed to be 1.16 MeV.

{{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}}&nbsp;decay generally occurs in neutron-rich nuclei.<ref name=Loveland>{{cite book|last=Loveland|first=Walter D.|title=Modern Nuclear Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0471115320|pages=232|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZAHJkrJlwbYC&pg=PA233&dq=internal+conversion&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=internal%20conversion&f=false}}</ref>

== β<sup>+</sup> decay ==
{{main|Positron emission}}

In {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}}&nbsp;decay, or "positron emission", the weak interaction converts an atomic nucleus into a nucleus with atomic number decreased by one, while emitting a positron ({{SubatomicParticle|Positron}}) and an [[electron neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}). The generic equation is:

: {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{mvar|Z}}|X}} → {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{math|''Z''−1}}|X’}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron Neutrino}}<ref name="konya74"/>
This may be considered as the decay of a proton inside the nucleus to a neutron
:p → n + {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron Neutrino}}<ref name="konya74"/>

However, {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}}&nbsp;decay cannot occur in an isolated proton because it requires energy due to the [[mass]] of the neutron being greater than the mass of the proton. {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}}&nbsp;decay can only happen inside nuclei when the daughter nucleus has a greater [[nuclear binding energy|binding energy]] (and therefore a lower total energy) than the mother nucleus. The difference between these energies goes into the reaction of converting a proton into a neutron, a positron and a neutrino and into the kinetic energy of these particles. In an opposite process to negative beta decay, the weak interaction converts a proton into a neutron by converting an up quark into a down quark by having it emit a {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}} or absorb a {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}.

== Electron capture (K-capture) ==
{{main|Electron capture}}
In all cases where {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}}&nbsp;decay of a nucleus is allowed energetically, so is [[electron capture]], the process in which the same nucleus captures an atomic electron with the emission of a neutrino:

: {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{mvar|Z}}|X}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} → {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{math|''Z''−1}}|X’}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron Neutrino}}

The emitted neutrino is mono-energetic. In proton-rich nuclei where the energy difference between initial and final states is less than {{math|2''m''<sub>e</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}}&nbsp;decay is not energetically possible, and electron capture is the sole decay mode.<ref name="Zuber" />

If the captured electron comes from the innermost shell of the atom, the K-shell, which has the highest probability to interact with the nucleus, the process is called K-capture.<ref name="Jevremovic2009">{{cite book|author=Tatjana Jevremovic|title=Nuclear Principles in Engineering|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tEM9TCfAe7EC&pg=PA201|date=21 April 2009|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-85608-7|pages=201}}</ref> If it comes from the L-shell, the process is called L-capture, etc.

== Competition of beta decay types ==
Three types of beta decay in competition are illustrated by the single isotope [[copper-64]] (29 protons, 35 neutrons), which has a half-life of about 12.7 hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay. This particular nuclide (though not all nuclides in this situation) is almost equally likely to decay through proton decay by [[positron emission]] (18%) or [[electron capture]] (43%), as through neutron decay by electron emission (39%).

== Helicity (polarization) of neutrinos, electrons and positrons emitted in beta decay ==
After the discovery of parity non-conservation (see history below), it was found that, in beta decay, electrons are emitted mostly with negative [[Chirality (physics)|helicity]], i.e., they move, naively speaking, like left-handed screws driven into a material (they have negative longitudinal [[Spin polarization|polarization]]).<ref>H. Frauenfelder, R. Bobone, E. Von Goeler, N. Levine, H. R. Lewis, R. N. Peacock, A. Rossi and G. DePasquali, Physical Review 106 (1957) 386</ref> Conversely, positrons have mostly positive helicity, i.e., they move like right-handed screws. Neutrinos (emitted in positron decay) have positive helicity, while antineutrinos (emitted in electron decay) have negative helicity.<ref>E. J. Konopinski and M. E. Rose, ''The Theory of nuclear Beta Decay'', in: ''Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy'', ed. by Kai Siegbahn, Vol. 2, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1966</ref>

The higher the energy of the particles, the higher their polarization.

== Energy release ==
The [[Q value (nuclear science)|{{mvar|Q}} value]] is defined as the total energy released in a given nuclear decay. In beta decay, {{mvar|Q}} is therefore also the sum of the kinetic energies of the emitted beta particle, neutrino, and recoiling nucleus. (Because of the large mass of the nucleus compared to that of the beta particle and neutrino, the kinetic energy of the recoiling nucleus can generally be neglected.) Beta particles can therefore be emitted with any [[kinetic energy]] ranging from 0 to {{mvar|Q}}.<ref name="konya74"/> A typical {{mvar|Q}} is around 1&nbsp;[[MeV]], but can range from a few [[keV]] to a few tens of MeV.

Since the [[Mass-energy equivalence|rest mass]] of the electron is 511&nbsp;keV, the most energetic beta particles are [[Ultrarelativistic limit|ultrarelativistic]], with speeds very close to the [[speed of light]].

=== β<sup>−</sup> decay ===
Consider the generic equation for beta decay
: {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{mvar|Z}}|X}} → {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{math|''Z''+1}}|X’}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron Antineutrino}}.
The {{mvar|Q}} value for this decay is
:<math>Q=\left[m_N\left({}^A_Z\mathrm{X}\right) - m_N\left({}^A_{Z+1}\mathrm{X'}\right)-m_e-m_{\overline\nu_e}\right]c^2</math>,
where <math>m_N\left({}^A_Z\mathrm{X}\right)</math> is the mass of the nucleus of the {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{mvar|Z}}|X}} atom, <math>m_e</math> is the mass of the electron, and <math>m_{\overline\nu_e}</math> is the mass of the electron antineutrino. In other words, the total energy released is the mass energy of the initial nucleus, minus the mass energy of the final nucleus, electron, and antineutrino. The mass of the nucleus {{mvar|m<sub>N</sub>}} is related to the standard atomic mass {{mvar|m}} by
:<math>m\left({}^A_Z\mathrm{X}\right)c^2=m_N\left({}^A_Z\mathrm{X}\right)c^2+Zm_ec^2-\sum_{i=1}^Z B_i</math>.
That is, the total atomic mass is the mass of the nucleus, plus the mass of the electrons, minus the binding energy {{mvar|B<sub>i</sub>}} of each electron. Substituting this into our original equation, while neglecting the nearly-zero antineutrino mass and difference in electron binding energy, which is very small for high-{{mvar|Z}} atoms, we have
:<math>Q=\left[m\left({}^A_Z\mathrm{X}\right)-m\left({}^A_{Z+1}\mathrm{X'}\right)\right]c^2</math>
This energy is carried away as kinetic energy by the electron and neutrino.

Because the reaction will proceed only when the {{mvar|Q}}-value is positive, β<sup>−</sup> decay can occur when the mass of atom {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{mvar|Z}}|X}} is greater than the mass of atom {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{math|''Z''+1}}|X’}}.<ref name="Krane1987">{{cite book|author=Kenneth S. Krane|title=Introductory Nuclear Physics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ConwAAAAMAAJ|date=5 November 1987|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-80553-3}}</ref>

=== β<sup>+</sup> decay ===
The equations for β<sup>+</sup> decay are similar, with the generic equation
: {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{mvar|Z}}|X}} → {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{math|''Z''−1}}|X’}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron Neutrino}}
giving
:<math>Q=\left[m_N\left({}^A_Z\mathrm{X}\right) - m_N\left({}^A_{Z-1}\mathrm{X'}\right)-m_e-m_{\nu_e}\right]c^2</math>.
However, in this equation, the electron masses do not cancel, and we are left with
:<math>Q=\left[m\left({}^A_Z\mathrm{X}\right)-m\left({}^A_{Z-1}\mathrm{X'}\right)-2m_e\right]c^2</math>

Because the reaction will proceed only when the {{mvar|Q}}-value is positive, β<sup>+</sup> decay can occur when the mass of atom {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{mvar|Z}}|X}} exceeds that of {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{math|''Z''-1}}|X’}} by at least twice the mass of the electron.<ref name="Krane1987" />

=== Electron capture ===
The analogous calculation for electron capture must take into account the binding energy of the electrons. This is because the atom will be left in an excited state after capturing the electron, and the binding energy of the captured innermost electron is significant. Using the generic equation for electron capture
: {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{mvar|Z}}|X}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} → {{Physics particle|TL={{mvar|A}}|BL={{math|''Z''−1}}|X’}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron Neutrino}}
we have
:<math>Q=\left[m_N\left({}^A_Z\mathrm{X}\right) + m_e - m_N\left({}^A_{Z-1}\mathrm{X'}\right)-m_{\nu_e}\right]c^2</math>,
which simplifies to
:<math>Q=\left[m\left({}^A_Z\mathrm{X}\right) - m\left({}^A_{Z-1}\mathrm{X'}\right)\right]c^2-B_n</math>,
where {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} is the binding energy of the captured electron.

Because the binding energy of the electron is much less than the mass of the electron, nuclei that can undergo β<sup>+</sup> decay can always also undergo electron capture, but the reverse is not true.<ref name="Krane1987" />

== Nuclear transmutation ==
[[File:Table isotopes en.svg|250px|right]]
If the proton and neutron are part of an [[atomic nucleus]], these decay processes [[Nuclear transmutation|transmute]] one chemical element into another. For example:

|}

Beta decay does not change the number&nbsp;{{mvar|A}} of [[nucleon]]s in the nucleus, but changes only its [[electric charge|charge]]&nbsp;{{mvar|Z}}. Thus the set of all [[nuclide]]s with the same&nbsp;{{mvar|A}} can be introduced; these [[isobar (nuclide)|''isobaric'' nuclides]] may turn into each other via beta decay. Among them, several nuclides (at least one for any given mass number {{mvar|A}}) are beta stable, because they present local minima of the [[mass excess]]: if such a nucleus has {{math|(''A'', ''Z'')}} numbers, the neighbour nuclei {{math|(''A'', ''Z''−1)}} and {{math|(''A'', ''Z''+1)}} have higher mass excess and can beta decay into {{math|(''A'', ''Z'')}}, but not vice versa. For all odd mass numbers {{mvar|A}}, there is only one known beta-stable isobar. For even&nbsp;{{mvar|A}}, there are up to three different beta-stable isobars experimentally known; for example, {{Nuclide2|zirconium|96}}, {{Nuclide2|Molybdenum|96}}, and {{Nuclide2|Ruthenium|96}} are all beta-stable. There are about 355 known [[beta-decay stable isobars|beta-decay stable nuclides]] total.<ref name="nndc_Inte">{{Cite web

Usually, unstable nuclides are clearly either "neutron rich" or "proton rich", with the former undergoing beta decay and the latter undergoing electron capture (or more rarely, due to the higher energy requirements, positron decay). However, in a few cases of odd-proton, odd-neutron radionuclides, it may be energetically favorable for the radionuclide to decay to an even-proton, even-neutron isobar either by undergoing beta-positive or beta-negative decay. An often-cited example is {{Nuclide2|copper|64|link=yes}}, which decays by positron emission/electron capture<!--As per reference and as per earlier in the article--> 61% of the time to {{Nuclide2|nickel|64}}, and 39% of the time by (negative) beta decay to {{Nuclide2|zinc|64}}.<ref>{{Cite web

Most naturally occurring isotopes on Earth are beta stable. Those that are not have [[half-life|half-lives]] ranging from under a second to periods of time significantly greater than the [[age of the universe]]. One common example of a long-lived isotope is the odd-proton odd-neutron nuclide {{Nuclide2|link=yes|Potassium|40}}, which undergoes all three types of beta decay ({{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} and electron capture) with a half-life of {{val|1.277|e=9|u=years}}.<ref>{{Cite web

== Double beta decay ==
{{main|Double beta decay}}
Some nuclei can undergo double beta decay (ββ&nbsp;decay) where the charge of the nucleus changes by two units. Double beta decay is difficult to study, as the process has an extremely long half-life. In nuclei for which both β&nbsp;decay and ββ&nbsp;decay are possible, the rarer ββ&nbsp;decay process is effectively impossible to observe. However, in nuclei where β&nbsp;decay is forbidden but ββ&nbsp;decay is allowed, the process can be seen and a half-life measured.<ref name="Bilenky">{{cite journal|author=S.M. Bilenky|title= Neutrinoless double beta-decay|date=October 5, 2010|volume=41|issue=5|journal=Physics of Particles and Nuclei|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1063779610050035|doi=10.1134/S1063779610050035|arxiv = 1001.1946 |bibcode = 2010PPN....41..690B }}</ref> Thus, ββ&nbsp;decay is usually studied only for beta stable nuclei. Like single beta decay, double beta decay does not change {{mvar|A}}; thus, at least one of the nuclides with some given {{mvar|A}} has to be stable with regard to both single and double beta decay.

"Ordinary" double beta decay results in the emission of two electrons and two antineutrinos. If neutrinos are [[Majorana particle]]s (i.e., they are their own antiparticles), then a decay known as [[neutrinoless double beta decay]] will occur. Most neutrino physicists believe that neutrinoless double beta decay has never been observed.<ref name="Bilenky" />

==Bound-state β<sup>−</sup> decay==
A very small minority of free neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called "two-body decays", in which the proton, electron and antineutrino are produced, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 eV energy necessary to escape the proton, and therefore simply remains bound to it, as a neutral [[hydrogen atom]].<ref>[http://www.physi.uni-heidelberg.de/Publications/ckm_byrne.pdf An Overview Of Neutron Decay] J. Byrne in Quark-Mixing, CKM Unitarity (H.Abele and D.Mund, 2002), see p.XV</ref> In this type of beta decay, in essence all of the neutron [[decay energy]] is carried off by the antineutrino.

For fully ionized atoms (bare nuclei), it is possible in likewise manner for electrons to fail to escape the atom, and to be emitted from the nucleus into low-lying atomic bound states (orbitals). This can not occur for neutral atoms with low-lying bound states which already filled by electrons.

The phenomenon in fully ionized atoms was first observed for <sup>163</sup>Dy<sup>66+</sup> in 1992 by Jung et al. of the Darmstadt Heavy-Ion Research group. Although neutral <sup>163</sup>Dy is a stable isotope, the fully ionized <sup>163</sup>Dy<sup>66+</sup> undergoes β&nbsp;decay into the K and L shells with a half-life of 47&nbsp;days.<ref>

Another possibility is that a fully ionized atom undergoes greatly accelerated β&nbsp;decay, as observed for <sup>187</sup>Re by Bosch et al., also at Darmstadt.

==Forbidden transitions==
Beta decays can be classified according to the [[Angular momentum operator|{{mvar|L}}-value]] of the emitted radiation. When {{math|''L'' > 0}}, the decay is referred to as [[forbidden transition|"forbidden"]]. Nuclear [[selection rules]] require high L-values to be accompanied by changes in [[nuclear spin]]&nbsp;({{mvar|J}}) and [[Parity (physics)|parity]]&nbsp;(π). The selection rules for the {{mvar|L}}th forbidden transitions are:

:<math>\Delta J = L-1, L, L+1; \Delta \pi = (-1)^L, </math>

where {{math|1=Δπ = 1}} or {{math|−1}} corresponds to no parity change or parity change, respectively. The special case of a transition between isobaric analogue states, where the structure of the final state is very similar to the structure of the initial state, is referred to as "superallowed" for beta decay, and proceeds very quickly. The following table lists the Δ{{mvar|J}} and Δπ values for the first few values of&nbsp;{{mvar|L}}:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Forbiddenness !! Δ{{mvar|J}} !! Δπ
|-
| Superallowed || 0 || no
|-
| Allowed || 0, 1 || no
|-
| First forbidden || 0, 1, 2 || yes
|-
| Second forbidden || 1, 2, 3 || no
|-
| Third forbidden || 2, 3, 4 || yes
|}

==Fermi transitions==
A '''Fermi transition''' is a beta decay in which the spins of the emitted electron (positron) and anti-neutrino (neutrino) couple to total spin <math>S=0</math>, leading to an angular momentum change <math>\Delta J = 0</math> between the initial and final states of the nucleus (assuming an allowed transition <math>\Delta L=0</math>).
In the non-relativistic limit, the nuclear part of the operator for a Fermi transition is given by

:<math> \mathcal{O}_{F} = G_{V}\sum_{a} \hat{\tau}_{a\pm} </math>
with <math>G_V</math> the weak vector coupling constant, <math>\tau_{\pm}</math> the [[isospin]] [[Ladder operator| raising and lowering operators]], and <math>a</math> running over all protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

==Gamow-Teller transitions==
A '''Gamow-Teller transition''' is a beta decay in which the spins of the emitted electron (positron) and anti-neutrino (neutrino) couple to total spin <math>S=1</math>, leading to an angular momentum change <math>\Delta J = 0,\pm 1</math> between the initial and final states of the nucleus (assuming an allowed transition).
In this case, the nuclear part of the operator is given by

:<math> \mathcal{O}_{GT} = G_{A}\sum_{a} \hat{\sigma}_{a}\hat{\tau}_{a\pm} </math>
with <math>G_{A}</math> the weak axial-vector coupling constant, and <math>\sigma</math> the [[Pauli matrices|spin Pauli matrices]], which can produce a spin-flip in the decaying nucleon.

==Beta emission spectrum==
[[File:Beta spectrum of RaE.jpg|thumb|Beta spectrum of <sup>210</sup>Bi. ''E<sub>max</sub>'' = ''Q'' = 1.16 MeV is the maximum energy ]]
Beta decay can be considered as a [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation]] as described in quantum mechanics, and thus [[Fermi's Golden Rule]] can be applied. This leads to an expression for the kinetic energy spectrum {{math|''N''(''T'')}} of emitted betas as follows:<ref>

:<math>
N(T) = C_L(T) F(Z,T) p E (Q-T)^2
</math>

where {{mvar|T}} is the kinetic energy, {{mvar|C<sub>L</sub>}} is a shape function that depends on the forbiddenness of the decay (it is constant for allowed decays), {{math|''F''(''Z'', ''T'')}} is the Fermi Function (see below) with ''Z'' the charge of the final-state nucleus, {{math|1=''E'' = ''T'' + ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} is the total energy, {{math|1=''p'' = }}{{sqrt|(''E''/''c'')<sup>2</sup> − (''mc'')<sup>2</sup>}} is the momentum, and {{mvar|Q}} is the [[Q value (nuclear science)|Q value]] of the decay. The kinetic energy of the emitted neutrino is given approximately by {{mvar|Q}} minus the kinetic energy of the beta.

As an example, the beta decay spectrum of <sup>210</sup>Bi (originally called RaE) is shown to the right.

===Fermi function===

The Fermi function that appears in the beta spectrum formula accounts for the Coulomb attraction / repulsion between the emitted beta and the final state nucleus. Approximating the associated wavefunctions to be spherically symmetric, the Fermi function can be analytically calculated to be:<ref>

A '''Kurie plot''' (also known as a '''Fermi–Kurie plot''') is a graph used in studying beta decay developed by [[Franz N. D.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}

===Discovery and characterization of β<sup>−</sup> decay===
Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]] in [[uranium]], and subsequently observed by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in [[thorium]] and in the new elements [[polonium]] and [[radium]].
In 1899, [[Ernest Rutherford]] separated radioactive emissions into two types: alpha and beta (now beta minus), based on penetration of objects and ability to cause ionization. Alpha rays could be stopped by thin sheets of paper or aluminium, whereas beta rays could penetrate several millimetres of aluminium. (In 1900, [[Paul Villard]] identified a still more penetrating type of radiation, which Rutherford identified as a fundamentally new type in 1903, and termed [[gamma ray]]s).

In 1900, Becquerel measured the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] ({{math|''m''/''e''}}) for beta particles by the method of [[J.J.&nbsp;Thomson]] used to study cathode rays and identify the electron. He found that {{math|''m''/''e''}} for a beta particle is the same as for Thomson's electron, and therefore suggested that the beta particle is in fact an electron {{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2015}} .

In 1901, Rutherford and [[Frederick Soddy]] showed that alpha and beta radioactivity involves the [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of atoms into atoms of other chemical elements. In 1913, after the products of more radioactive decays were known, Soddy and [[Kazimierz Fajans]] independently proposed their [[Radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy|radioactive displacement law]], which states that beta (i.e., {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}})&nbsp;emission from one element produces another element one place to the right in the [[periodic table]], while alpha emission produces an element two places to the left.

===Neutrinos in beta decay===

Historically, the study of beta decay provided the first physical evidence of the [[neutrino]]. Measurements of the beta particle (electron) kinetic energy spectrum in 1911 by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Hahn]] and in 1913 by [[Jean Danysz]] showed multiple lines on a diffuse background, offering the first hint of a continuous spectrum.<ref name="Jensen">{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Carsten |year=2000 |editor1-link= |editor1-mask= |title=Controversy and Consensus: Nuclear Beta Decay 1911-1934 |url=https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/physics/book/978-3-7643-5313-1 |publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag |isbn=3-7643-5313-9 }}</ref> In 1914, [[James Chadwick]] used a magnetic [[spectrometer]] with one of [[Hans Geiger|Hans Geiger's]] new [[Geiger counter|counters]] to make a more accurate measurement and showed that the spectrum was continuous.<ref name="Jensen"/><ref>{{cite journal | last = Chadwick | first = James | date = 1914 | title = Intensitätsverteilung im magnetischen Spektren der β-Strahlen von Radium B + C | journal = Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft | publisher = [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]] | volume = 16 | pages = 383–391 |language=German}}</ref> This was in apparent contradiction to the [[law of conservation of energy]], since if beta decay were simply electron emission as assumed at the time, then the energy of the emitted electron should equal the energy difference between the initial and final nuclear states and lead to a narrow energy distribution, as observed for both alpha and gamma decay.<ref name=Brown>{{cite journal |bibcode= 1978PhT....31i..23B |doi=10.1063/1.2995181 |title=The idea of the neutrino |journal=Physics Today |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=23–8 |year=1978 |last1=Brown |first1=Laurie M. }}</ref> For beta decay, however, the observed broad continuous spectrum suggested that energy is lost in the beta decay process. 

In 1920–1927, [[Charles Drummond Ellis]] (along with James Chadwick and colleagues) further established that the beta decay spectrum is continuous, ending all controversies. It also had an effective upper bound in energy, which was a severe blow to Bohr's suggestion that conservation of energy might be true only in a statistical sense, and might be violated in any given decay. Now the problem of how to account for the variability of energy in known beta decay products, as well as for conservation of momentum and angular momentum in the process, became acute.

A second problem related to the conservation of [[angular momentum]]. Molecular band spectra showed that the nuclear spin of [[nitrogen-14]] is 1 (i.e. equal to the [[reduced Planck constant]]), and more generally that the spin is integral for nuclei of even [[mass number]] and half-integral for nuclei of odd mass number, as later explained by the [[Discovery of the neutron#Proton-neutron model of the nucleus|proton-neutron model of the nucleus]].<ref name=Brown/> Beta decay leaves the mass number unchanged, so that the change of nuclear spin must be an integer. However the electron spin is 1/2, so that angular momentum would not be conserved if beta decay were simply electron emission.

In a [[Electron neutrino#Pauli's letter|famous letter]] written in 1930, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] suggested that, in addition to electrons and protons, atomic nuclei also contained an extremely light neutral particle, which he called the neutron. He suggested that this "neutron" was also emitted during beta decay (thus accounting for the known missing energy, momentum, and angular momentum) and had simply not yet been observed. In 1931, [[Enrico Fermi]] renamed Pauli's "neutron" to neutrino and, in 1934, he published a very successful [[Fermi's interaction|model of beta decay]] in which neutrinos were produced. The neutrino interaction with matter was so weak that detecting it proved a severe experimental challenge, which was finally met in 1956 in the [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment]].<ref>

===Discovery of other types of beta decay===
In 1934, [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Frédéric]] and [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] bombarded aluminium with alpha particles to effect the nuclear reaction {{Nuclide2|Helium|4}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{Nuclide2|Aluminium|27}}&nbsp;→ {{Nuclide2|Phosphorus|30}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{Nuclide2|neutronium|1}}, and observed that the product isotope {{Nuclide2|Phosphorus|30}} emits a positron identical to those found in cosmic rays by [[Carl David Anderson]] in 1932. This was the first example of {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}}&nbsp;decay ([[positron emission]]), which they termed artificial radioactivity since {{Nuclide2|Phosphorus|30}} is a short-lived nuclide which does not exist in nature.

The theory of [[electron capture]] was first discussed by [[Gian-Carlo Wick]] in a 1934 paper, and then developed by [[Hideki Yukawa]] and others. K-electron capture was first observed in 1937 by [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], in the nuclide <sup>48</sup>V.<ref name=k>
