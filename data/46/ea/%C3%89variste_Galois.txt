'''Évariste Galois''' ({{IPA-fr|evaʁist ɡaˈlwa|lang}}; 25 October 1811 – 31 May 1832) was a [[France|French]] mathematician born in [[Bourg-la-Reine]]. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient condition]] for a [[polynomial]] to be solvable by [[Nth root|radicals]], thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for [[Galois theory]] and [[group theory]], two major branches of [[abstract algebra]], and the subfield of [[Galois connection]]s. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a [[duel]].

==Life==

===Early life===
Galois was born on 25 October 1811 to Nicolas-Gabriel Galois and Adélaïde-Marie (born Demante).<ref name="BG15">{{cite doi|10.14236/ewic/eva2015.18}}</ref> His father was a [[First French Republic|Republican]] and was head of Bourg-la-Reine's [[liberal party]]. He became mayor of the village after [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] returned to the throne in 1814. His mother, the daughter of a [[jurist]], was a fluent reader of [[Latin]] and [[classical literature]] and was responsible for her son's education for his first twelve years. At the age of 10, Galois was offered a place at the [[college of Reims]], but his mother preferred to keep him at home.

In October 1823, he entered the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]], and despite some turmoil in the school at the beginning of the term (when about a hundred students were expelled), Galois managed to perform well for the first two years, obtaining the first prize in [[Latin language|Latin]]. He soon became bored with his studies and, at the age of 14, he began to take a serious interest in [[mathematics]].

He found a copy of [[Adrien Marie Legendre]]'s ''[[Éléments de Géométrie]]'', which, it is said, he read "like a novel" and mastered at the first reading. At 15, he was reading the original papers of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], such as the landmark ''[[Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations]]'' which likely motivated his later work on equation theory, and ''Leçons sur le calcul des fonctions'', work intended for professional mathematicians, yet his classwork remained uninspired, and his teachers accused him of ''affecting'' ambition and originality in a negative way.<ref name="stewart-gt">{{cite book

===Budding mathematician===
In 1828, he attempted the entrance examination for the [[École Polytechnique]], the most prestigious institution for mathematics in France at the time, without the usual preparation in mathematics, and failed for lack of explanations on the oral examination. In that same year, he entered the [[École Normale]] (then known as l'École préparatoire), a far inferior institution for mathematical studies at that time, where he found some professors sympathetic to him.

In the following year Galois's first paper, on [[continued fraction]]s,<ref>

He submitted two papers on this topic to the [[Academy of Sciences]]. [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] refereed these papers, but refused to accept them for publication for reasons that still remain unclear. However, in spite of many claims to the contrary, it is widely held that Cauchy recognized the importance of Galois's work, and that he merely suggested combining the two papers into one in order to enter it in the competition for the Academy's Grand Prize in Mathematics. Cauchy, an eminent mathematician of the time though with political views that were at the opposite end from Galois', considered Galois's work to be a likely winner.<ref name="rothman">{{cite journal

On 28 July 1829 Galois's father committed suicide after a bitter political dispute with the village priest. A couple of days later, Galois made his second and last attempt to enter the Polytechnique, and failed yet again. It is undisputed that Galois was more than qualified; however, accounts differ on why he failed. More plausible accounts state that Galois made too many logical leaps and baffled the incompetent examiner, which enraged Galois. The recent death of his father may have also influenced his behavior.<ref name="stewart-gt"/>

Having been denied admission to the [[École Polytechnique|Polytechnique]], Galois took the Baccalaureate examinations in order to enter the [[École Normale]]. He passed, receiving his degree on 29 December 1829. His examiner in mathematics reported, "This pupil is sometimes obscure in expressing his ideas, but he is intelligent and shows a remarkable spirit of research."

He submitted his memoir on equation theory several times, but it was never published in his lifetime due to various events. As noted before, his first attempt was refused by Cauchy, but in February 1830 following Cauchy's suggestion he submitted it to the Academy's secretary [[Joseph Fourier]], to be considered for the Grand Prix of the Academy. Unfortunately, [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]] died soon after, and the memoir was lost. The prize would be awarded that year to [[Niels Henrik Abel]] posthumously and also to [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]]. Despite the lost memoir, Galois published three papers that year, one of which laid the foundations for [[Galois theory]].<ref>

===Political firebrand===
Galois lived during a time of political turmoil in France. [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] had succeeded [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] in 1824, but in 1827 his party suffered a major electoral setback and by 1830 the opposition liberal party became the majority. Charles, faced with abdication, staged a coup d'état, and issued his notorious [[July Ordinances]], touching off the [[July Revolution]] which ended with [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] becoming king. While their counterparts at the [[École Polytechnique|Polytechnique]] were making history in the streets during ''[[July Revolution|les Trois Glorieuses]]'', Galois and all the other students at the [[École Normale]] were locked in by the school's director. Galois was incensed and wrote a blistering letter criticizing the director, which he submitted to the ''Gazette des Écoles'', signing the letter with his full name. Although the ''Gazette'''s editor omitted the signature for publication, Galois was expelled.<ref name="dupuy">{{cite journal

Although his expulsion would have formally taken effect on 4 January 1831, Galois quit school immediately and joined the staunchly Republican artillery unit of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]]. He divided his time between his mathematical work and his political affiliations. Due to controversy surrounding the unit, soon after Galois became a member, on 31 December 1830, the artillery of the National Guard was disbanded out of fear that they might destabilize the government. At around the same time, nineteen officers of Galois's former unit were arrested and charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government.

In April 1831, the officers were acquitted of all charges, and on 9 May 1831, a banquet was held in their honor, with many illustrious people present, such as [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]. The proceedings grew riotous, and Galois proposed a [[Toast (honor)|toast]] to King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] with a [[dagger]] above his cup, which was interpreted as a threat against the king's life. He was arrested the following day but was acquitted on 15 June 1831.<ref name="dupuy"/><ref name="dumas">

On the following [[Bastille Day]] (14 July 1831), Galois was at the head of a protest, wearing the uniform of the disbanded artillery, and came heavily armed with several pistols, a rifle, and a dagger. He was again arrested. On 23 October he was sentenced to six months in prison for illegally wearing a uniform.<ref name="bell">

===Final days===
[[File:Tombe galois.JPG|thumb|left|The Galois memorial in the cemetery of [[Bourg-la-Reine]]. Évariste Galois was buried in a common grave and the exact location is still unknown.]]
Galois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the [[École Normale]], although he continued to spend time in political activities. After his expulsion became official in January 1831, he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest, but this waned, as it seemed that his political activism had priority.<ref name="stewart-gt"/><ref name="rothman"/> [[Siméon Poisson]] asked him to submit his work on the [[theory of equations]], which he did on 17 January 1831. Around 4 July 1831, [[Siméon Poisson|Poisson]] declared Galois's work "incomprehensible", declaring that "[Galois's] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor"; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: "We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion."<ref>

 | doi = 10.3406/rhs.1947.2607}}</ref> While Poisson's report was made before Galois's Bastille Day arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter, and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Apparently, however, Galois did not ignore Poisson's advice, as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832.<ref name="dupuy"/>

Galois's fatal duel took place on 30 May. The true motives behind the duel will most likely remain forever obscure. There has been much speculation, much of it spurious, as to the reasons behind it. What is known is that five days before his death, he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair.<ref name="rothman"/>

Some archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was a Mademoiselle [[Stéphanie-Félicie Poterin du Motel]], the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life. Fragments of letters from her copied by Galois himself (with many portions either obliterated, such as her name, or deliberately omitted) are available.<ref>{{cite book

  |author2=J.-P. Azra
   | title = Écrits et mémoires mathématiques d'Évariste Galois
  | publisher = Gauthier-Villars

  | year = 1962}}</ref> The letters hint that Mlle. du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois, and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf. This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died. Much more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois's biographers (most notably by [[Eric Temple Bell]] in ''[[Men of Mathematics]]''), such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy.<ref name="bell"/>

As to his opponent in the duel, Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville, one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois's first arrest<ref name="dumas"/> and du Motel's fiancé.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} However, Dumas is alone in this assertion, and extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent that more accurately applies to one of Galois's Republican friends, most probably Ernest Duchatelet, who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges. Given the conflicting information available, the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history.

Whatever the reasons behind the duel, Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts.<ref name="chevalier-letter">

However, the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated.<ref name="rothman"/> In these final papers, he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers.

Early in the morning of 30 May 1832, he was shot in the [[Human abdomen|abdomen]] and died the following morning at ten o'clock in the [[Cochin hospital]] (probably of [[peritonitis]]) after refusing the offices of a priest. There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral, but during the same time frame the leaders heard of General [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque]]'s death, and the funeral was postponed without any uprising occurring. Only Galois's younger brother was notified of the events prior to Galois's death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coutinho|first=S.C.|title=The Mathematics of Ciphers|year=1999|publisher=A K Peters, Ltd.|location=Natick|isbn=1-56881-082-2|pages=127–128}}</ref> He was 20 years old.

Although [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] had already [[Abel-Ruffini theorem|proved the impossibility of a "quintic formula" by radicals]] in 1824 and [[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] had published a solution in 1799 that turned out to be flawed, Galois's methods led to deeper research in what is now called Galois theory. For example, one can use it to determine, for ''any'' polynomial equation, whether it has a solution by radicals.

==Contributions to mathematics==
From the closing lines of a letter from Galois to his friend Auguste Chevalier, dated May 29, 1832, two days before Galois's death:<ref name="chevalier-letter"/>

{{quote|''Tu prieras publiquement Jacobi ou Gauss de donner leur avis, non sur la vérité, mais sur l'importance des théorèmes.''

''Après cela, il y aura, j'espère, des gens qui trouveront leur profit à déchiffrer tout ce gâchis.''

(Ask Jacobi or Gauss publicly to give their opinion, not as to the truth, but as to the importance of these theorems. Later there will be, I hope, some people who will find it to their advantage to decipher all this mess.)}}

Unsurprisingly, Galois's collected works amount to only some 60 pages, but within them are many important ideas that have had far-reaching consequences for nearly all branches of mathematics.<ref name="lie">

===Algebra===
While many mathematicians before Galois gave consideration to what are now known as [[group (algebra)|group]]s, it was Galois who was the first to use the word ''group'' (in French ''groupe'') in a sense close to the technical sense that is understood today, making him among the founders of the branch of algebra known as [[group theory]]. He developed the concept that is today known as a [[normal subgroup]]. He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right [[coset]]s a ''proper decomposition'' if the left and right cosets coincide, which is what today is known as a normal subgroup.<ref name="chevalier-letter"/> He also introduced the concept of a [[finite field]] (also known as a [[Galois field]] in his honor), in essentially the same form as it is understood today.<ref name="numtheory"/>

In his last letter to Chevalier<ref name="chevalier-letter" /> and attached manuscripts, the second of three, he made basic studies of linear groups over finite fields:
*He constructed the [[General linear group#Over finite fields|general linear group over a prime field]], GL(''ν'', ''p'') and computed its order, in studying the Galois group of the general equation of degree ''p<sup>ν</sup>''.<ref>Letter, p. 410</ref>
*He constructed the [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2,''p''). Galois constructed them as fractional linear transforms, and observed that they were simple except if ''p'' was 2 or 3.<ref>Letter, p. 411</ref> These were the second family of finite [[simple group]]s, after the [[alternating group]]s.<ref name="raw">{{Cite book | last1=Wilson | first1=Robert A. | authorlink = Robert Arnott Wilson | title=The finite simple groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] 251 | isbn=978-1-84800-987-5 | doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-988-2 | zbl=05622792 | year=2009 |chapter = Chapter 1: Introduction |chapterurl=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs_files/intro.ps | postscript =, [http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs.html 2007 preprint] | volume=251}}</ref>

===Galois theory===
{{Main|Galois theory}}
Galois's most significant contribution to mathematics by far is his development of Galois theory. He realized that the algebraic solution to a [[polynomial]] equation is related to the structure of a group of [[permutation]]s associated with the roots of the polynomial, the [[Galois group]] of the polynomial. He found that an equation could be solved in [[nth root|radicals]] if one can find a series of subgroups of its Galois group, each one normal in its successor with [[abelian group|abelian]] quotient, or its Galois group is [[solvable group|solvable]]. This proved to be a fertile approach, which later mathematicians adapted to many other fields of mathematics besides the [[theory of equations]] to which Galois originally applied it.<ref name="lie"/>

===Analysis===
{{Expand section|date=February 2009}}
Galois also made some contributions to the theory of [[Abelian integral]]s and [[continued fraction]]s.
