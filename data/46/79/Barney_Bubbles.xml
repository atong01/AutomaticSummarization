Bubbles, who also sketched and painted privately, is best known for his distinctive contribution to the design practices associated with the British independent music scene of the 1970s and 1980s.

He converted the ground -floor space into a graphic art studio, which he named Teenburger Designs. With a business association established with two entrepreneurs, Edward Molton and Stephen Warwick, and with<space/><link><target>John Muggeridge</target></link><space/>from Conran serving briefly as an assistant, he set about working primarily for the music industry. His first record sleeve design was for<space/><link><target>Quintessence (English band)</target><part>Quintessence</part></link>'s LP<space/><italics><link><target>In Blissful Company</target></link></italics><space/>(1969).

Bubbles engaged in many aspects of the group's visual identity, titling releases and designing posters, adverts, stage decoration and performance plans, some of which were adorned with mystical and mock-Teutonic insignia. In 1972 Bubbles produced the triple LP package<space/><link><target>Glastonbury Fayre</target></link>. This comprised a six-panel fold-out card sleeve, two poster inserts, a booklet and a cut-out and build miniature pyramid, housed in a clear vinyl bag (with two sleeve variations and three label variations).</paragraph><paragraph>From 1973 onwards Bubbles increasingly avoided credits for his artwork, typically working anonymously or occasionally adopting alternative pseudonyms.

The marketing of<space/><link><target>Elvis Costello</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>My Aim Is True</target></link></italics><space/>included advertisements in three UK music papers from which a poster of Costello could be constructed, and the first 1,000 pressings contained an insert headed<space/><italics>Help Us Hype Elvis</italics>, which, if completed and returned to Stiff, ensured that a friend would received a free copy.</paragraph><paragraph>When Riviera left Stiff in late 1977 Bubbles joined him at his new label<space/><link><target>Radar Records</target></link><space/>and later at Riviera's<space/><link><target>F-Beat Records</target></link>.

His signature style emerged as one that was colourful, playful, loaded with geometry, art-history and music-history references, jokes, cryptograms and symbols. The overriding appetite was for going against the grain of accepted design standards. His work is simultaneously complex in meaning and simple in its delivery.
