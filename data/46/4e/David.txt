'''David''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|v|ɪ|d}}; {{Hebrew Name|דוד|David|Dāwîḏ}}; <small>[[ISO 259-3]]</small> ''Dawid''; {{lang-ar|داوُود}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Dāwūd}}''; {{lang-syr|ܕܘܝܕ}} ''Dawid''; {{lang-grc|Δαυίδ}}; {{lang-la|Davidus}}; [[Strong's Concordance|Strong's]]: ''Daveed'') was, according to the [[Books of Samuel]], the second king of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel]], and according to the [[New Testament]], an ancestor of [[Jesus]]. His life is conventionally dated to {{circa}} 1040 {{ndash}} 970 BCE, his reign over [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] {{c.}} 1010–970 BCE.<ref name="STIC">Carr, David M. & Conway, Colleen M., [http://books.google.com/books?id=dJerjvlxCHsC&printsec=frontcover ''An Introduction to the Bible: Sacred Texts and Imperial Contexts''], John Wiley & Sons (2010), p. 58</ref>

The [[Books of Samuel]], [[Books of Kings|1 Kings]], and [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] are the only [[Old Testament]] sources of information on David, although the [[Tel Dan Stele]] (dated c. 850–835 BCE) contains the phrase {{Hebrew|בית דוד}} (bytdwd), read as "House of David", which many scholars confirm to be a likely plausible match to the existence in the mid-9th century BCE of a [[Judea and Samaria Area|Judean]] [[dynasty|royal dynasty]] called the [[Davidic line|House of David]].{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=xii}}

Depicted as a valorous warrior of great renown, and a poet and musician credited for composing much of the psalms contained in the [[Book of Psalms]], King David is widely viewed as a righteous and effective king in battle and civil justice. He is described as a man after God's own heart in {{bibleref2|1 Samuel|13:14}} and {{bibleref2|Acts|13:22}}.

David is an important figure to members of the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic faiths. Biblical tradition maintains the [[Messiah]]'s [[Davidic line|direct descent]] from the line of David. In Islam, David is considered a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]].

==Biblical narrative==

===Saul rejected===
{{Main|Saul}}
[[File:Samuel e david.jpg|left|thumb|[[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] anoints David, [[Dura Europos]], [[Syria]], 3rd century CE]]
{{anchor|childhood|Jesse|Bethlehem}}
According to the Biblical narrative, Israel is at first ruled by [[Biblical judges|judges]], but the people demand a monarchy, so the current judge, the prophet Samuel, reluctantly appoints [[Saul]] to be the first king of Israel. Although successful at first, Saul eventually loses favor with God by disobeying directives conveyed through Samuel. Samuel tells Saul that God has rejected him as king, and will give the kingdom instead to "a man after [my] own heart"<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|13:14|NIV}}</ref> who is "better than you."<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:28|NIV}}</ref>

[[Samuel]] goes to Bethlehem on the pretext of performing a sacrifice; in fact intending to appoint Saul's successor from among the sons of [[Jesse]] of [[Bethlehem]]. Samuel examine seven of Jesse's sons, but says to him, "The Lord has not chosen these," and inquires if Jesse has any other sons. Jesse's youngest son, David, is sent for where he is tending the flocks. When Samuel sees David, the Lord says, "Rise and anoint him; this is the one."

===At Saul's court===
The Bible presents two accounts of how David came to become part of Saul’s household. In 1 Samuel 16:14-23, Saul takes David into his service as his “armor-bearer”. In 1 Samuel 17, David is officially presented to Saul as the hero who killed Goliath. According to French scholar, Andre Lemaire, this may represent an amalgamation of different traditions concerning the early relationship between David and Saul.<ref name=Lemaire>Lemaire, Andre. in ''Ancient Israel'', (Hershel Shanks, ed.), Biblical Archaeology Society; Revised edition (1999), ISBN 978-1880317549</ref>

Saul is tormented by an "evil spirit from the Lord" which afflicts him with episodes of deep melancholy which only music can ease. David is recommended as a skilled musician and summoned to the court. Saul makes David one of his armor-bearers, a high honor.<ref name=corbett/> From then on, whenever the evil spirit from God comes upon Saul, David plays music and the evil spirit leaves him.

===David and Goliath===
[[File:David and Goliath -1700s.jpg|thumb|240px|left|"David Giving Thanks to God After the Death of Goliath", 18th century painting attributed to [[Charles Errard the Younger]] ]]
{{See also|Goliath}}
According to 1 Samuel 17, the 'men of Israel' under King [[Saul]] faced the [[Philistines]] near the [[Valley of Elah]]. The two armies are encamped within sight of each other for several days but battle has not been joined; instead the Philistine's champion, the giant Goliath, issues daily challenges to single combat. David arrives in camp, sent by his father to bring provisions to his brothers with the army. He hears [[Goliath]]'s challenge and comments that the uncircumcised Philistine should not insult the army of the living God. Brought to the king, he expresses confidence that he can defeat Goliath just as he has a lion and a bear that threatened the flock. 
[[File:The Triumph of David.jpeg|thumb|David holds the impaled head of Goliath and marches before a general on a white horse, as envisioned by Poussin, ca. 1632]]
Before the ordeal David picks five smooth stones from a nearby brook to use as ammunition. During the duel he avoids Goliath's thrown spear and easily kills him with his [[Sling (weapon)|sling]], afterword removing the giant's head with his own sword as the [[Philistines]] flee in terror. Saul inquires about the name of the young champion's father and David tells him that he is the son of [[Jesse]].<ref name=corbett/> In [[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]] 22, David credits God for delivering him from the hand of the Philistines and saving him from "the snares of death," in his psalm, "David’s Song of Praise."<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2022&version=NIV "David’s Song of Praise"], ''Bible Gateway'', 2 Samuel 22</ref>

{{bibleref2|2 Samuel|21:19}} states that Goliath was killed by [[Elhanan son of Jair|Elhanan]] son of [[Jair]] from [[Bethlehem]] (1 Chronicles 20:5 retells this story using Goliath's ''brother'').<ref>{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein|first1=Israel|last2=Silberman|first2=Neil Asher|title=David and Solomon.

===David and Jonathan===
[[File:Jusepe Leonardo 001.jpeg|thumb|left|Saul threatening David, by [[José Leonardo]].]]
{{Main|David and Jonathan}}
Saul makes David a commander over his armies and offers him his daughter [[Michal]] in marriage for a bride price of 100 Philistine [[foreskins]], intending that David will die in trying to remove them; instead he brings back 200 foreskins, saying "God was with me". David is increasingly successful and increasingly popular and Saul begins to see him as a threat. Saul repeatedly tries to arrange for David's death, but the plots only endear David further to the people, and especially to his friend, Saul's son [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]]. (1 Samuel 18:1, 2 Samuel 1:25–26).<ref>''See'' [[David and Jonathan]]. There is debate amongst some scholars on whether this relationship might have been platonic, romantic, sexual, or self-interested. The Hebrew word 'ahav, meaning "love," has a very broad range of meanings, including simply the opposite of "hate" (The New Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Hebrew and English Lexicon [1978], p. 12), which can be shown by loyalty, as in 1 Samuel 18:16, "All Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns." Boswell, John. ''Same-sex Unions in Premodern Europe''. New York: Vintage, 1994; Martti Nissinen, ''Homoeroticism in the Biblical World'', Minneapolis, 1998; ''When Heroes Love:. The Ambiguity of Eros in the Stories of Gilgamesh and David'' (New York & Chichester, Columbia University Press, 2005); ''Homosexuality and Liminality in the Gilgamesh and Samuel'' (Amsterdam, Hakkert, 2007); Gagnon, ''The Bible and Homosexual Practice. Texts and Hermeneutics'' (Nashville, Abingdon Press, 2001); Markus Zehnder, "Observations on the Relationship Between David and Jonathan and the Debate on Homosexuality", ''Westminster Theological Journal 69'' (2007)</ref> Jonathan warns David of his father's plots; David flees into the wilderness at the head of a band of followers.

During this time as a fugitive from King Saul, David becomes a vassal of the Philistine king Achish of Gath, for which Achish gives him the border town of [[Ziklag]]. Despite being in the employ of their enemy, David maintains good relations with the Israelites by defending them from the Amalekites. When [[Achish]] marches against the Israelites his nobles question David's loyalty, pointing out that if David turns on them during the battle he could win back Saul's favor, so he is excused from the battle and left behind to guard the camp.

===Proclaimed king===
Jonathan and Saul are killed in battle with the Philistines at [[Mount Gilboa]]. David travels to [[Hebron]], where he is [[Anointing|anointed]] king. In the north, Saul's son [[Ish-Bosheth]] is anointed king by [[Abner]]. War ensues until Ish-Bosheth is murdered. The assassins bring his head to  David hoping for a reward, but David executes them for their crime. With the death of Saul's son, the elders of Israel come to [[Hebron]] and David is anointed King over [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|a united Israel]].<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/463973/jewish/David-King-of-Judah.htm "David the King", Chabad.org]</ref>

===Jerusalem and the Davidic covenant===
{{Main|Covenant (biblical)#Davidic covenant}}
David conquers the [[Jebusite]] fortress of [[Jerusalem]], and makes it his capital. He brings the [[Ark of the Covenant]] to Jerusalem, intending to build a temple. However the prophet [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] forbids him to build a temple because he has shed too much blood, but prophesies that the temple would be built by one of his sons. Nathan also prophecies that God has made a covenant with the house of David: "Your throne shall be established forever." David wins more victories over the Philistines, and the [[Moabites]]<ref name=Lemaire/> and [[Hadadezer]] of [[Zobah]] pays tribute.

===Bathsheba and Uriah the Hittite===
[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol7v.jpg|thumb|King David in robes of a Byzantine emperor, miniature from the [[Paris Psalter]]]]

With his army in the field under the command of his general [[Joab]], David remains in the capital and occupies himself by seducing  [[Bathsheba]], the wife of one of his officers, [[Uriah the Hittite]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Stassen, Glen H; Gushee, David P |title=Kingdom Ethics: Following Jesus in Contemporary Context |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LlMVrmA-b-4C&pg=PA200 |publisher=InterVarsity Press |year=2003 |page=200}}</ref> and she  becomes pregnant. David then sends a letter to Joab with instructions that his reply be carried by Uriah. When Uriah arrives at the capital David detains him, assuming that he will take the opportunity to sleep with his wife. But Uriah refuses do so while his men are sleeping in the field. So David sends him back to the front with a second message instructing Joab to arrange for Uriah to die in battle. With Uriah disposed of David marries the widow, who bears their child, but the narrative comments, "but the thing that David had done displeased the Lord."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2sam%2011;&version=47;|title=2sam 11; ESV - David and Bathsheba - In the spring of - Bible Gateway|work=Bible Gateway}}</ref>

The prophet [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]] confronts David and prophecies the punishment that shall fall upon him:  "the sword shall never depart from your house" apparently meaning that he will always be troubled by war; "the son born to you will die," and that God will "take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight."

When their child falls ill David desperately prays for his recovery with such disturbing expressions grief that when the child dies the servants are at first afraid to tell him out of concern for his sanity. But upon learning his son has died David promptly recovers himself, explaining, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, 'Who knows? The {{LORD}} may be gracious to me and let the child live.' But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me." ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|12:22–23|KJV|}})

===David's son Absalom rebels===
[[File:David Playing the Harp 1670 Jan de Bray.jpg|thumb|''David Playing the Harp'', by [[Jan de Bray]], 1670]]
David's son [[Absalom]] "stole the hearts of the people" and rebeled. David flees Jerusalem, leaving his servant [[Hushai]] behind in Absalom's court as a [[double agent]]. [[Ahitophel]], formerly David's chief advisor, advises Absalom to strike before David has time to gather his forces. Hushai persuades Absalom to wait and build up his own forces before facing his formidable father. When Ahitophel sees his council rejected he correctly surmises the cause is lost and hangs himself. Absalom has a tent pitched on the palace roof, in which he takes his father's consorts, thus fulfilling Nathan's prophecy. The rebellion ends at the battle of the [[Wood of Ephraim]]; Absalom's forces are routed, leaving him behind with his flowing locks tangled in  the branches of a [[terebinth]] tree, where he is found and killed by David’s general Joab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2018:14-15&version=ESV|title=2 Samuel 18:14-15|work=Bible Gateway}}</ref> When the news of the victory is brought to David, he is grief-stricken and laments, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!

===Death===
[[File:Medieval Royal Funeral007.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The funeral of King David, while his son [[Solomon]] watches (from a medieval manuscript)]]

With David  old and bedridden, [[Adonijah]], his eldest surviving son and natural heir, declares himself king. Bathsheba, David's favorite wife, and [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan the prophet]] go to David and obtain his agreement that Bathsheba's son [[Solomon]] should become king. David counsels Solomon to begin his reign with a massacre, naming numerous men to be purged, including his long-time general Joab who had offended him {{who|date=October 2015}} years previously.<ref name=Wright/>

===Family===
According to tradition, David was born in [[Bethlehem]], in the territory of the [[Tribe of Judah]]. His grandfather was [[Obed (biblical figure)|Obed]], whose mother was the Moabite [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] and whose grandmother was the former prostitute [[Rahab]]. David's father was [[Jesse]]. His mother is not named in the Bible, but the [[Talmud]] identifies her as [[Nitzevet]] daughter of Adael.<ref>Talmud Tractate Bava Batra 91a</ref> David had six older brothers and two sisters, [[Zeruiah]] and [[Abigail (mother of Amasa)|Abigail]].<ref>{{bibleref2|1Chronicles|2:15-16|NIV}}</ref>

David cemented his relations with various political and national groups through marriage.<ref name=Lemaire/> He had eight wives: [[Michal]], the second daughter of [[King Saul]]; [[Ahinoam]] the Jezreelite; [[Abigail]] the Carmelite, previously wife of [[Nabal]];<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Samuel|25}}</ref> [[Maachah]], daughter of [[Talmai]], king of [[Geshur]]; [[Haggith]]; [[Abital]]; [[Eglah]]; and [[Bathsheba]].

The [[Book of Chronicles]] lists his sons by various [[King David's wives|wives]] and [[concubine]]s. In [[Hebron]], David had six sons: [[Amnon]], by [[Ahinoam]]; [[Daniel (son of David)|Daniel]], by [[Abigail]]; [[Absalom]], by [[Maachah]]; [[Adonijah]], by [[Haggith]]; [[Shephatiah]], by [[Abital]]; and [[Ithream]], by [[Eglah]].<ref>{{Bibleref2|1 Chronicles|3:1–3|NIV}}</ref> By Bathsheba, his sons were [[Shammua]], Shobab, [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] and [[Solomon]]. David's sons born in Jerusalem by other wives included [[Ibhar]], [[Elishua]], [[Eliphelet]], [[Nogah]], [[Nepheg]], Japhia, [[Elishama]] and Eliada.<ref>{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel|5:14–16|NIV}}</ref> [[Jerimoth]], who is not mentioned in any of the genealogies, is mentioned as another of his sons in {{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles|11:18|NIV}}. David also had at least one daughter, [[Tamar (2 Samuel)|Tamar]], by Maachah.

Given that Nathan prophesies, in punishment for his sin with Bathsheba, that the Lord will take his wives and give them to his "neighbor", Solomon may not have been David's son at all, but later editors may have amended the story to emphasize Nathan's other statement that "the sword shall never depart from your house".<ref name=Wright/>

==Historicity==

===Archaeology===
[[Image:Tel dan inscription.png|thumb|The [[Tel Dan Stele]]]]
{{Main|Tel Dan Stele|Mesha Stele|City of David}}

Two archaeological finds, the [[Tel Dan Stele]] and the [[Mesha Stele]], have direct bearing on the question of the existence of a historical David. The first of these is an [[Arameans|Aramean]] victory [[stele]] (inscribed stone) discovered in 1993 at [[Dan (ancient city)|Tel Dan]] and dated c. 850–835 BCE: it contains the phrase {{Hebrew|ביתדוד}} (''bytdwd''), which has been interpreted as "House of David".<ref name=McKenzie>[http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/mckenzie-david.html McKenzie, Steven F., ''King David, A Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-19-513273-4]</ref> The [[Mesha Stele]] from [[Moab]], dating from approximately the same period, may also contain the name David in line 12, where the interpretation is uncertain, and in line 31, where one destroyed letter must be supplied, but apparently no other letter produces a word that makes sense in the context.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CS9DKZgzfDIC&pg=PR4|title=Identifying Biblical Persons In Northwest Semitic Inscriptions Of 1200 - 539 ...|work=google.com}}</ref>

The evidence from surface surveys indicates that Judah at the time of David was a small tribal kingdom.<ref>Finkelstein, Israel; Neil Asher Silberman''David and Solomon: In Search of the Bible's Sacred Kings and the Roots of the Western Tradition'' Simon & Schuster Ltd (16 October 2006) ISBN 978-0-7432-4362-9 p32</ref> The [[Bronze age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]] remains of the [[City of David]], the original urban core of Jerusalem identified with the reigns of David and Solomon, were investigated extensively in the 1970s and 1980s under the direction of Yigal Shiloh of the [[Hebrew University]], who failed to discover significant evidence of occupation during the 10th century BCE.<ref>See [[David Ussishkin]], "Solomon's Jerusalem: The Text and the Facts on the Ground," in: A.G.

See also Cahill, J., "David's Jerusalem, Fiction or Reality? The Archaeological Evidence Proves It," and Steiner, M., "David's Jerusalem, Fiction or Reality? It's Not There: Archaeology Proves a Negative," both in ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' 24 (July/August 1998). (These two scholars argue opposite sides of the case for a Jerusalem in keeping with the biblical portrayal).</ref> In 2005 [[Eilat Mazar]] reported the discovery of a [[Large Stone Structure]] which she claimed was David's palace,<ref>See [[Eilat Mazar]], "Did I find David's Temple?" in Biblical Archeology Review, Jan/Feb 2006</ref> but the site is contaminated and cannot be accurately dated.<ref>.http://www.aftau.org/site/DocServer/telaviv_arch_34_2.pdf?docID=2881{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref>

In December 2014, archaeologists from [[Mississippi State University]] announced the discovery of six ''[[Bulla (seal)|bullae]]'' which suggests that some type of government activity was being conducted in the 10th century, and thus support the existence of David, although the bullae do not mention David or Jerusalem or Judah or Israel and there is no way of knowing who produced them or for what purpose.<ref>[http://www.msstate.edu/newsroom/article/2014/12/msu-department-announces-major-archaeological-find/ MSU department announces major archaeological find]</ref>

In 2015 a 10-year-old Russian volunteer at Jerusalem’s Temple Mount Sifting Project found a seal from the time of King David in the 10th century BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Rare-3000-year-old-King-David-era-seal-discovered-by-Temple-Mount-Sifting-Project-419024}}</ref>

===Academic views on the biblical account===
The biblical account about David comes from the [[Books of Samuel]] and the [[Books of Chronicles]]. Chronicles merely retells Samuel from a different theological vantage point, and contains little (if any) information not available there, and the biblical evidence for David is therefore dependent almost exclusively on the material contained in the chapters from 1 Samuel 16 to 1 Kings 2.
[[Image:David-icon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Russian icon]] of St. David, the Prophet and King, 18th century ([[iconostasis]] of [[Kizhi]] [[monastery]])]]

Since [[Martin Noth]] put forward his analysis of the [[Deuteronomistic history]], biblical scholars have accepted that these two books form part of a continuous history of Israel, compiled no earlier than the late 7th century BCE, but incorporating earlier works and fragments. Samuel's account of David "seems to have undergone two separate acts of editorial slanting". The original writers show a strong bias against Saul, and in favour of David and Solomon. Many years later the Deuteronomists edited the material in a manner that conveyed their religious message, inserting reports and anecdotes that strengthened their monotheistic doctrine. Some of the materials in Samuel I and II—notably the boundary, allotment and administrative lists—are believed to be very early, since they correspond closely to what we know of the territorial conditions of the late Davidic-early Solomonic period.<ref>Norman K. Gottwald, ''Tribes of Yahweh: A Sociology of the Religion of Liberated Israel, 1250–1050 BCE,'' Continuum 1999 pp.156–157, p.162.</ref>

Beyond this, the full range of possible interpretations is available. The late [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]], in his ''History of Israel'' takes Samuel at face value. [[Donald B. Redford]], however, thinks all reconstructions from biblical sources for the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]] period are examples of "academic wishful thinking".<ref>Donald B. Redford, ''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times,'' Princeton University Press, 1992 pp.301–307, p.301.</ref> [[Thomas L. Thompson]] rejects the historicity of the biblical narrative, "The history of Palestine and of its peoples is very different from the Bible's narratives, whatever political claims to the contrary may be. An independent history of Judea during the Iron I and Iron II periods has little room for historicizing readings of the stories of I-II Samuel and I Kings."<ref>{{cite web|author=Thompson TL|title=A view from Copenhagen: Israel and the History of Palestine|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/copenhagen.shtml}}</ref> [[Amihai Mazar]] however, concludes that based on recent archeological findings, like those in [[City of David]], [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]], [[Tel Dan]], [[Tel Rehov]], [[Khirbet en-Nahas]] and others "the deconstruction of United Monarchy and the devaluation of Judah as a state in 9th century is unacceptable interpretation of available historic data". According to Mazar, based on archeological evidences, [[United Monarchy]] can be described as a "state in development".<ref>{{cite book|author=Mazar A|title=Archaeology and the Biblical Narrative: The Case of the United Monarchy|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/72454328/Amihai-Mazar---The-Great-Monarchy}}</ref>

Some studies of David have been written: [[Baruch Halpern]] has pictured David as a lifelong vassal of [[Achish]], the Philistine king of Gath;<ref>Baruch Halpern, "David's Secret Demons", 2001.[http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/1551_3721.pdf Review of Baruch Halpern's "David's Secret Demons"].</ref> [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] have identified as the oldest and most reliable section of Samuel those chapters which describe David as the charismatic leader of a band of outlaws who captures Jerusalem and makes it his capital.<ref>Finkelstein and Silberman, "David and Solomon", 2006. See review [http://www.archaeology.org/0601/reviews/kings.html "Archaeology" magazine].</ref> Steven McKenzie, Associate Professor of the Hebrew Bible at [[Rhodes College]] and author of ''King David: A Biography'', states the belief that David actually came from a wealthy family, was "ambitious and ruthless" and a tyrant who murdered his opponents, including his own sons.<ref name="McKenzie_on_David" />

Critical Bible scholarship holds that the biblical account of David's rise to power is a political apology—an answer to contemporary charges against him, of his involvement in murders and regicide.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baden |first=Joel |date=2014-07-29 |title=The Historical David: The Real Life of an Invented Hero |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=9780062188373 |access-date=2015-03-02}}</ref>

Israel Finkelstein  and Neil Asher Silberman reject the idea that David ruled over a united monarchy, suggesting instead that he ruled only as a chieftain over the southern kingdom of Judah, much smaller than the northern kingdom of Israel at that time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein|first1=Israel|last2=Silberman|first2=Neil Asher|title=The Bible Unearthed.

Jacob L. Wright, Associate Professor of Hebrew Bible at Emory University, has written that the most popular legends about David, including his killing of Goliath, his affair with Bathsheba, and his ruling of a United Kingdom of Israel rather than just Judah, are the creation of those who lived generations after him, in particular those living in the late Persian or Hellenistic period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/2014/07/wri388001.shtml|title=The Bible and Interpretation|work=bibleinterp.com}}</ref>

===David as Psalmist===
While almost half of the [[Psalms]] are headed "A Psalm of David" (though the phrase can also be translated as "to David" or "for David") and tradition identifies several with specific events in David’s life (e.g., [[Psalm 3|Psalms 3]], [[Psalm 7|7]], [[Psalm 18|18]], [[Psalm 34|34]], [[Psalm 51|51]], [[Psalm 52|52]], [[Psalm 54|54]], [[Psalm 56|56]], [[Psalm 57|57]], [[Psalm 59|59]], [[Psalm 60|60]], [[Psalm 63|63]] and [[Psalm 142|142]]),<ref>Commentary on II Samuel 22, The Anchor Bible, Vol. 9. ''II Samuel''. P. Kyle McCarter, Jr., 1984. New York: Doubleday. ISBN 0-385-06808-5</ref> the headings are late additions and no psalm can be attributed to David with certainty.<ref name="McKenzie_on_David">[http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/McKensie_020301.shtml Steven McKenzie, Associate Professor Rhodes College, Memphis, Tennessee].</ref>

Psalm 34 is attributed to David on the occasion of his escape from the Abimelech (king) [[Achish]] by pretending to be insane.<ref>Psalm 34, ''Interlinear NIV Hebrew-English Old Testament.'' Kohlenberger, J.R, 1987. Grand Rapids, Michigan:Zondervan Publishing House  ISBN 0-310-40200-X</ref> According to the narrative in 1 Samuel 21, instead of killing the man who had exacted so many casualties from him, Abimelech allows David to depart, exclaiming, "Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Samuel|21:15|NIV}}</ref>

===Judaism===
David is an important figure in Judaism. Historically, David's reign represented the formation of a coherent [[United Monarchy|Jewish kingdom]] centered in [[Jerusalem]]. David is an important figure within the context of [[Jewish messianism]]. In the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], it is written that a human descendant of David will occupy the throne of a restored kingdom and usher in a [[messianic age]].

David is also viewed as a tragic figure; his acquisition of Bathsheba, and the loss of his son are viewed as his central tragedies.

Many legends have grown around the figure of David. According to one Rabbinic tradition, David was raised as the son of his father Jesse and spent his early years herding his father's sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school. Only at his anointing by Samuel—when the oil from Samuel's flask turned to diamonds and pearls—was his true identity as Jesse's son revealed.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

David's adultery with Bathsheba was only an opportunity to demonstrate the power of repentance, and the Talmud states that it was not adultery at all, quoting a Jewish practice of divorce on the eve of battle. Furthermore, according to Talmudic sources, the death of Uriah was not to be considered murder, on the basis that Uriah had committed a capital offence by refusing to obey a direct command from the King.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=82&letter=D#260|title=DAVID - JewishEncyclopedia.com|work=jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref> However, in tractate Sanhedrin, David expressed remorse over his transgressions and sought forgiveness.  God ultimately forgave David and Bathsheba but would not remove their sins from Scripture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin|pages=107a}}</ref>

According to [[midrashim]], [[Adam]] gave up 70 years of his life for the life of David.<ref>Zohar Bereishis 91b</ref> Also, according to the [[Talmud Yerushalmi]], David was born and died on the Jewish holiday of [[Shavuot]] (Feast of Weeks). His piety was said to be so great that his prayers could bring down things from Heaven.

===Christianity===
{{See also|Genealogy of Jesus}}
The concept of the Messiah is important in Christianity. Originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment ("the anointed one", as the title [[Messiah]] had it), the "son of David" became in the last two pre-Christian centuries the apocalyptic and heavenly one who would deliver Israel and usher in a new kingdom. This was the background to the concept of Messiahship in early Christianity, which interpreted the career of Jesus "by means of the titles and functions assigned to David in the mysticism of the Zion cult, in which he served as priest-king and in which he was the mediator between God and man".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152497/David "David"] article from ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''</ref> The early Church believed that "the life of David [foreshadowed] the life of Christ; [[Bethlehem]] is the birthplace of both; the shepherd life of David points out Christ, [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|the Good Shepherd]]; the five stones chosen to slay Goliath are [[Typology (theology)|typical]] of the [[Holy Wounds|five wounds]]; the betrayal by his trusted counsellor, [[Ahitophel|Achitophel]], and the passage over the [[Kidron Valley|Cedron]] remind us of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|Sacred Passion]]. Many of the Davidic Psalms, as we learn from the New Testament, are clearly [[Typology (theology)|typical]] of the future [[Messiah]]."<ref name=corbett>John Corbett (1911) [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04642b.htm King David] ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (New York: Robert Appleton Company)</ref>
In the [[Middle Ages]], "[[Charlemagne]] thought of himself, and was viewed by his court scholars, as a 'new David'. [This was] not in itself a new idea, but [one whose] content and significance were greatly enlarged by him".<ref>{{cite book |last=McManners |first=John |title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DhpKxQT8n74C&pg=PA101 |page=101}}</ref> The linking of David to earthly kingship was reflected in later Medieval cathedral windows all over Europe through the device of the [[Tree of Jesse]], its branches demonstrating how divine kingship descended from Jesse, through his son David, to Jesus.

[[Latin liturgical rites|Western Rite]] churches (Lutheran, Roman Catholic) celebrate his feast day on 29 December, Eastern-rite on 19 December.<ref>[http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/1229.shtml Saint of the Day] for December 29 at St. Patrick Catholic Church, Washington, D.C.</ref> The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] celebrate the [[feast day]] of the "Holy Righteous Prophet and King David" on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before the [[Great Feast]] of the [[Christmas|Nativity of the Lord]]), when he is commemorated together with other [[genealogy of Jesus|ancestors of Jesus]]. He is also commemorated on the Sunday after the Nativity, together with [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and [[James, the Brother of the Lord]].

====Latter Day Saints====
In the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the [[Book of Mormon]] offers a negative commentary on David's practice of [[polygamy]]. In the [[Book of Jacob]], the [[Nephite]] nation begins to practice polygamy, justifying it by the example of David and Solomon. In response the prophet [[Jacob (Book of Mormon prophet)|Jacob]] denounces both David's taking of "many wives"<ref>"Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord." [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.24?lang=eng#23 Jacob 2:24]</ref> and the Nephites' taking of multiple wives,<ref>"Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none" [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.27?lang=eng#26 Jacob 2:27]</ref> though he stops short of denouncing polygamy altogether.<ref>"For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things." [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.30?lang=eng#29 Jacob 2:30]</ref>

Editions of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] utilized by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the largest Latter Day Saint denomination, state that of David's sexual relationships, only his relationship with Bathsheba was a sin. However, in consequence of this sin and the further sin of killing Uriah, David had "fallen from [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]]" and would not be married to any of his wives in the next life.<ref>"David’s wives and concubines were given unto him of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and, therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord." [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.39?lang=eng#38 Doctrine and Covenants 132:39]</ref>

The [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] argues that there is no contradiction between the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants because the Lord authorized David to have some wives, but not "many" wives. They see a parallel between [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.24?lang=eng#23 Jacob 2:24] and {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|17:17|KJV}}, which some rabbis interpreted as a limit of four wives per husband. When David took Bathsheba, he crossed the line into having "many" wives, which he was not authorized to do. Jacob's denunciation then becomes, not a complete denunciation of David's polygamy, but a denunciation of unauthorized indulgence in polygamy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Contradiction between Section 132 and Jacob 2 |url=http://en.fairmormon.org/Doctrine_and_Covenants/Contradiction_between_Section_132_and_Jacob_2 |publisher=[[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research|FAIR]] |date=29 March 2012}}</ref>

The [[Community of Christ]], the second-largest Latter Day Saint faction, does not accept the validity of 132nd section of the LDS Doctrine and Covenants; nor does the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], the [[Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)]], and many other smaller factions. Although the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]] accepted the validity of polygamy as an institution, they do not accept Doctrine and Covenants 132, nor do they believe that Joseph Smith instituted or taught it (they believe that [[James Strang]] was responsible for that, when he released his [[Book of the Law of the Lord]] in 1850).

===Islam===
{{Main|David in Islam}}
David ([[Arabic]] داود, ''Dāwūd'') is a highly important figure in [[Islam]] as one of the major [[prophet]]s sent by [[God]] to guide the [[Israelites]]. David is mentioned several times in the [[Qur'an]], often with his son [[Solomon]]. The actual Arabic equivalent to the Hebrew Davīd is Dawūd. In the Qur'an: David killed Goliath (2:251), Goliath was a powerful king who used to invade random kingdoms and villages. Goliath was spreading evil and corruption. When David killed Goliath, God granted him kingship and wisdom and enforces it (38:20). David is made God's "[[vicegerent]] on earth" (38:26) and God further gives David sound judgment (21:78; 37:21–24, 26) as well as the [[Psalms]], which are regarded as books of divine wisdom (4:163; 17:55). The birds and mountains unite with David in uttering praise to God (21:79; 34:10; 38:18), while God made iron soft for David ([http://quran.com/34/10, 34:10]), God also instructed David in the art of fashioning chain-mail out of iron ([http://quran.com/21/80 21:80]); an indication of the first use of [[Wrought iron]], this knowledge gave David a major advantage over his [[bronze]] and [[cast iron]]-armed opponents, not to mention the cultural and economic impact. Together with Solomon, David gives judgment in a case of damage to the fields (21:78) and David judges in the matter between two disputants in his prayer chamber (38:21–23). Since there is no mention in the Qur'an of the wrong David did to [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]] nor is there any reference to [[Bathsheba]], [[Muslim]]s reject this narrative.<ref>A-Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Wheeler, ''David''</ref>

Muslim [[tradition]] and the ''[[hadith]]'' stress David's zeal in daily prayer as well as in [[fasting]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Dawud''</ref> Qur'an commentators, historians and compilers of the numerous ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]'' elaborate upon David's concise Qur'anic narratives and specifically mention David's gift in singing his Psalms as well as his musical and vocal talents. His voice is described as having had a captivating power, weaving its influence not only over man but over all beasts and nature, who would unite with him to praise God.<ref>''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of David''</ref>

===Baha'i Faith===
In the [[Baha'i Faith]], David is described as a reflection of God and one among a long line of prophets who came in the shadow of the [[Dispensationalism|dispensation]] of Moses to develop and consolidate the process he set in motion.<ref name="manifestation">{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9  | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}</ref><ref>All You Want to Know But Didn't Think You Could Ask, Jessica Tinklenberg deVega - 2012, p 136</ref> The [[Kitáb-i-Íqán]] describes David as being "among the more exalted Manifestations who have appeared during the intervening period between the revelations of Moses and Muhammad, ever altered the law of the Qiblih".<ref>The Kitab-i-Iqan: The Book of Certitude - Page 48, Baha'u'llah - 2003</ref>

In European Christian culture of the [[Middle Ages]], David was made a member of the [[Nine Worthies]], a group of heroes encapsulating all the ideal qualities of [[chivalry]]. His life was thus proposed as a valuable subject for study by those aspiring to chivalric status. This aspect of David in the Nine Worthies was popularised firstly through literature, and was thereafter adopted as a frequent subject for painters and sculptors.

David was considered as a model ruler and a symbol of the God-ordained monarchy throughout medieval Western Europe and Eastern Christendom. David was perceived as the biblical predecessor to Christian Roman and Byzantine emperors and the name "New David" was used as an honorific reference to these rulers.<ref name=Garipzanov>{{cite book|last1=Garipzanov|first1=Ildar H.|title=The Symbolic Language of Royal Authority in the Carolingian World (c.751-877)|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004166696|pages=128, 225}}</ref> The [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] [[Bagrationi|Bagratids]] and the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Empire of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] claimed a direct [[Claim of the biblical descent of the Bagrationi dynasty|biological descent]] from him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rapp|first=Stephen H., Jr.|title=Imagining history at the crossroads: Persia, Byzantium, and the architects of the written Georgian past|date=1997|publisher=Ph.D. dissertation, University of Michigan|page =  528}}</ref> Likewise, the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Carolingian dynasty]] frequently connected themselves to David; [[Charlemagne]] himself occasionally used the name of David as his pseudonym.<ref name=Garipzanov/>

===Literature===
* [[John Dryden|Dryden]]'s long poem ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'' is an allegory that uses the story of the rebellion of [[Absalom]] against King David as the basis for his satire of the contemporary political situation, including events such as the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] (1685), the [[Popish Plot]] (1678) and the [[Exclusion Crisis]]
* [[Elmer Davis]]'s 1928 novel ''Giant Killer'' retells and embellishes the Biblical story of David, casting David as primarily a poet who managed always to find others to do the "dirty work" of heroism and kingship. In the novel, [[Elhanan son of Jair|Elhanan]] in fact killed Goliath but David claimed the credit; and [[Joab]], David's cousin and general, took it upon himself to make many of the difficult decisions of war and statecraft when David vacillated or wrote poetry instead
* [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] used the story of David and Bathsheba as the main structure for the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story ''[[The Adventure of the Crooked Man]]''. The betrayal of the Crooked Man is paralleled with David's betrayal of Uriah the Hittite, carried out in order to win Bathsheba
* [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936) refers to the story of Absalom, David's son; his rebellion against his father and his death at the hands of David's general, Joab. In addition it parallels Absalom's vengeance for the rape of his sister Tamar by his half-brother, Amnon.
* [[Gladys Schmitt]]'s 1946 novel ''David the King'' was a richly embellished biography of David's entire life. The book took a risk, especially for its time, in portraying David's relationship with Jonathan as overtly [[homoerotic]], but was ultimately panned by critics as a bland rendition of the title character
* [[Juan Bosch]], a Dominican political leader and writer, wrote ''David: Biography of a King'' in 1966, as a realistic portrayal of David's life and political career
* [[Dan Jacobson]]'s ''The Rape of Tamar'' (1970) is an imagined account, by one of David's courtiers Yonadab, of the rape of Tamar by Amnon
* In [[Thomas Burnett Swann]]'s 1974 Biblical fantasy novel ''How are the Mighty Fallen'', David and Jonathan are explicitly stated to be lovers. Moreover, Jonathan is a member of a winged semi-human race (possibly [[nephilim]]), one of several such races coexisting with humanity but often persecuted by it
* [[Malachi Martin]]'s 1980 [[Faction (literature)|factional]] novel ''King of Kings: A Novel of the Life of David'' relates the life of David, Adonai's champion in his battle with the Philistine deity Dagon
* [[Joseph Heller]] wrote a 1984 novel based on David called ''[[God Knows (novel)|God Knows]]'', published by Simon & Schuster. Told from the perspective of an aging David, the humanity—rather than the heroism—of various biblical characters is emphasized. The portrayal of David as a man of flaws such as greed, lust, selfishness, and his alienation from God, the falling apart of his family is a distinctly 20th-century interpretation of the events told in the Bible
* [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s 1993 novel ''Certain Women'' explores family, the Christian faith, and the nature of God through the story of King David's family and an analogous modern family's saga
* [[Allan Massie]] wrote ''King David'', a 1995 novel about David's career that portrays the king's relationship to Jonathan as sexual<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Kane|first1=Martin|editor1-last=Exum|editor1-first=Jo Cheryl|title=Beyond the Biblical Horizon: The Bible and the Arts|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUd28eEXGfoC&lpg=PA80&ots=yOrlciR9GO&dq=%22allan%20massie%22%20%22king%20david%22&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q=massie%20jonathan&f=false|accessdate=15 August 2015|chapter=The Biblical King David and His Artistic and Literary Afterlives}}</ref>
