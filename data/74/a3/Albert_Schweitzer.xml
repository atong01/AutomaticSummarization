Saint Paul spoke of the &quot;last times&quot;: &quot;Brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none&quot; (1 Corinthians 7:29); &quot;God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son&quot; (Hebrews 1:2); &quot;There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom&quot; (Matthew 16:28) (or, &quot;until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power&quot; (Mark 9:1); or, &quot;till they see the kingdom of God&quot; (Luke 9:27).)</paragraph><paragraph>Schweitzer continues writing in<space/><italics>The Quest of the Historical Jesus</italics><space/>that it is totally unreasonable to think that &quot;coming quickly&quot;, &quot;near&quot;, and &quot;soon&quot; could mean hundreds of years, much less, thousands of years in the future. &quot;Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near.&quot; (Revelation 1:3) &quot;And he said to me, 'These words are faithful and true'; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place.&quot; &quot;And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book.&quot; And he said to me, &quot;Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near&quot; (Revelation 22:6, 7, 10, 12). &quot;All these things shall come upon this generation&quot; (Matthew 23:36). Schweitzer concludes that the 1st-century theology, originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed Jesus, is totally incompatible with modern Christian belief.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><italics>The Quest of the Historical Jesus</italics>, Schweitzer notes the passage &quot;Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near.&quot; (Revelation 1:3) Similarly in St Peter: &quot;Christ .. Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you&quot; (1 Peter 1:20), and &quot;But the end of all things is at hand&quot; (1 Peter 4:7). &quot;Surely I come quickly&quot; (Revelation 22:20). (Again, note N.T. Wright,<space/><italics>ibid</italics>.)

Paul stands high above primitive mysticism, due to his intellectual writings, but never speaks of being one with God or being in God. Instead, he conceives of<space/><link><target>Adoption (theology)</target><part>sonship</part></link><space/>to God as &quot;mediated and effected by means of the mystical union with Christ.&quot;<template><target>Sfn</target><arg><space/>Schweitzer<space/></arg><arg><space/>1931<space/></arg><arg name="p"><space/>3</arg></template><space/>He summarizes Pauline mysticism as &quot;being in Christ&quot; rather than &quot;being in God.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Pauls imminent<space/><link><target>eschatology</target></link><space/>(from his background in<space/><link><target>Jewish eschatology</target><part>Jewish Eschatology</part></link>) causes him to believe that the kingdom of God has not yet come and that Christians are now living in the time of Christ.

Additionally, Schweitzer explains how the experience of &quot;being-in-Christ&quot; is not a &quot;static partaking in the spiritual being of Christ, but as the real co-experiencing of His dying and rising again.&quot; The &quot;realistic&quot; partaking in the mystery of Jesus is only possible within the solidarity of the Christian community.<template><target>Sfn</target><arg><space/>Schweitzer<space/></arg><arg><space/>1931<space/></arg><arg name="p"><space/>13</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>One of Schweitzer's major arguments in<space/><italics>The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle</italics><space/>is that Paul's mysticism, marked by his phrase &quot;being in Christ&quot;, gives the clue to the whole of Pauline theology.

Amid a hail of protests from his friends, family and colleagues, he resigned his post and re-entered the University as a student in a three-year course towards the degree of a Doctorate in Medicine, a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude. He planned to spread the Gospel by the example of his Christian labor of healing, rather than through the verbal process of preaching, and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of Christian teaching.</paragraph><paragraph>Even in his study of medicine, and through his clinical course, Schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher-scientist. By extreme application and hard work, he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911.

After briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut, in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron, with two 13-foot rooms (consulting room and operating theatre) and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves. The waiting room and dormitory (42 by 20 feet) were built, like native huts, of unhewn logs along a 30-yard path leading from the hospital to the landing-place.

In July 1918, after being transferred to his home in Alsace, he was a free man again. At this time Schweitzer, born a German citizen, had his parents' former (pre-1871) French citizenship reinstated and became a French citizen. Then, working as medical assistant and assistant-pastor in Strasbourg, he advanced his project on The Philosophy of Civilization, which had occupied his mind since 1900. By 1920, his health recovering, he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund-raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to Gabon. In 1922, he delivered the Dale Memorial Lectures in Oxford University, and from these in the following year appeared Volumes I and II of his great work,<space/><italics>The Decay and Restoration of Civilization</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Civilization and Ethics</italics>.

Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann, and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 1925-6, new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems.

"Oh, this 'noble' culture of ours! It speaks so piously of human dignity and human rights and then disregards this dignity and these rights of countless millions and treads them underfoot, only because they live overseas or because their skins are of different color or because they cannot help themselves. This culture does not know how hollow and miserable and full of glib talk it is, how common it looks to those who follow it across the seas and see what it has done there, and this culture has no right to speak of personal dignity and human rights...

"I will not enumerate all the crimes that have been committed under the pretext of justice. People robbed native inhabitants of their land, made slaves of them, let loose the scum of mankind upon them. Think of the atrocities that were perpetrated upon people made subservient to us, how systematically we have ruined them with our alcoholic 'gifts', and everything else we have done... We decimate them, and then, by the stroke of a pen, we take their land so they have nothing left at all...

"If all this oppression and all this sin and shame are perpetrated under the eye of the German God, or the American God, or the British God, and if our states do not feel obliged first to lay aside their claim to be 'Christian'—then the name of Jesus is blasphemed and made a mockery. And the Christianity of our states is blasphemed and made a mockery before those poor people. The name of Jesus has become a curse, and our Christianity—yours and mine—has become a falsehood and a disgrace, if the crimes are not atoned for in the very place where they were instigated. For every person who committed an atrocity in Jesus' name, someone must step in to help in Jesus' name; for every person who robbed, someone must bring a replacement; for everyone who cursed, someone must bless.

"And now, when you speak about missions, let this be your message: We must make atonement for all the terrible crimes we read of in the newspapers. We must make atonement for the still worse ones, which we do not read about in the papers, crimes that are shrouded in the silence of the jungle night..."</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Criticism of Schweitzer</heading><paragraph>Schweitzer was nonetheless still sometimes accused of being paternalistic, colonialist and racist in his attitude towards Africans, and in some ways his views did differ from that of many liberals and other critics of colonialism.

However, human consciousness holds an awareness of, and sympathy for, the will of other beings to live. An ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible.</paragraph><paragraph>Though we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it: the will-to-live constantly renews itself, for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon. Life and love are rooted in this same principle, in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so, Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied, not least in the European Middle Ages, and in the Indian<space/><link><target>Brahmin</target><trail>ic</trail></link><space/>philosophy.</paragraph><paragraph>For Schweitzer, mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral. It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism, by giving priority to<space/><link><target>Volition (psychology)</target><part>volition</part></link><space/>or ethical will as the primary meaning of life. Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization: the world-view must derive from the life-view, not vice versa. Respect for life, overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines, leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature. In contemplation of the will-to-life, respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Civilization and Ethics</italics>, Preface and Chapter II, 'The Problem of the Optimistic World-View'.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Such was the theory which Schweitzer sought to put into practice in his own life.

Then a single<space/><link><target>Microphone#Cardioid</target><part>cardioid microphone</part></link><space/>is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern.

The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side.
