'''Excalibur''' or '''Caliburn''' is the [[List of mythological objects#Swords|legendary sword]] of [[King Arthur]], sometimes [[magic sword|attributed with magical powers]] or associated with the rightful [[sovereignty]] of [[Great Britain]]. Sometimes Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone (the proof of Arthur's lineage) are said to be the same weapon, but in most versions they are considered separate. The sword was associated with the [[Arthurian legend]] very early. In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the sword is  called '''Caledfwlch'''; in [[Cornish language|Cornish]], the sword is  called '''Calesvol'''; in [[Breton language|Breton]], the sword is  called '''Kaledvoulc'h'''; in [[Latin language|Latin]], the sword is called '''Caliburnus'''.

==Forms and etymologies==
The name ''Excalibur'' ultimately comes from the ancestor of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Caledfwlch'' (and [[Breton language|Breton]] ''Kaledvoulc'h'', [[Middle Cornish]] ''Calesvol'') which is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''{{lang|cy|caled}}'' "hard" and  ''{{Lang|cy|bwlch}}'' "breach, cleft".<ref name="BromEv">R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp. 64-65.</ref> Caledfwlch appears in several early Welsh works, including the poem ''[[Preiddeu Annwfn]]'' (though it is not directly named - but only alluded to - here) and the prose tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', a work associated with the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and written perhaps around 1100. The name was later used in Welsh adaptations of foreign material such as the ''Brut''s (chronicles), which were based on [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. It is often considered to be related to the phonetically similar ''[[Caladbolg]]'', a sword borne by several figures from [[Irish mythology]], although a borrowing of ''Caledfwlch'' from Irish ''Caladbolg'' has been considered unlikely by [[Rachel Bromwich]] and D. Simon Evans. They suggest instead that both names "may have similarly arisen at a very early date as generic names for a sword"; this sword then became exclusively the property of Arthur in the British tradition.<ref name="BromEv"/><ref>T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), p. 156.</ref> 

[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], in his [[Historia Regum Britanniae]] (c. 1136), [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinised]] the name of Arthur's sword as ''Caliburnus'' (potentially influenced by the Medieval Latin spelling ''calibs'' of [[Classical Latin]] ''chalybs'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chályps'' [''χάλυψ''] "steel") and states that it was forged in the Isle of [[Avalon]]. Most Celticists consider Geoffrey's ''Caliburnus'' to be derivative of a lost [[Old Welsh]] text in which ''bwlch'' had not yet been [[Lenition|lenited]] to ''fwlch''.<ref name="Ford">P. K. Ford, "On the Significance of some Arthurian Names in Welsh" in ''Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies'' 30 (1983), pp. 268-73 at p. 271.</ref><ref>James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 64-65, 174.</ref><ref name="BromEv"/> In [[Old French]] sources this then became ''Escalibor'', ''Excalibor'' and finally the familiar ''Excalibur''.

[[Geoffrey Gaimar]], in his Old French ''L'Estoire des Engles'' (1134-1140), mentions Arthur and his sword: "this Constantine was the nephew of Arthur, who had the sword Caliburc" ("''Cil Costentin li niès Artur, Ki out l'espée Caliburc''").<ref>Hardy, T.D. and Martin, C.

''Gaimar, Havelok et Herward'', Caxton Society, London, 1850, p. 2</ref>

In [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]'' (c. 1150-1155), an Old French translation and versification of Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', the sword is called ''Calabrum'', ''Callibourc'', ''Chalabrun'', and ''Calabrun'' (with alternate spellings such as ''Chalabrum'', ''Calibore'', ''Callibor'', ''Caliborne'', ''Calliborc'', and ''Escaliborc'', found in various manuscripts of the ''Brut'').<ref>De Lincy, Roux (ed.), Wace, ''Roman de Brut'', v. II, Edouard Frère, Rouen, 1838, pp. 51, 88, 213, 215.</ref>

In [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' late 12th century Old French [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|''Perceval'']], Gawain carries the sword ''Escalibor'' and it is stated, "for at his belt hung Excalibor, the finest sword that there was, which sliced through iron as through wood"<ref>Bryant, Nigel (trans., ed.). ''Perceval: The Story of the Grail'', DS Brewer, 2006, p. 69.</ref> (''"Qu'il avoit cainte Escalibor, la meillor espee qui fust, qu'ele trenche fer come fust"''<ref>Roach, William. ''Chrétien De Troyes: Le Roman De Perceval ou Le Conte Du Graal'', Librairie Droz, 1959, p. 173.</ref>). This statement was probably picked up by the author of the ''Estoire Merlin'', or Vulgate Merlin, where the author (who was fond of fanciful folk etymologies) asserts that Escalibor "is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name which means in French 'cuts iron, steel, and wood'"<ref>Loomis, R. S. ''Arthurian Tradition and Chrétien de Troyes'', Columbia, 1949, p. 424.</ref> ("''c'est non Ebrieu qui dist en franchois trenche fer & achier et fust''"; note that the word for "steel" here, achier, also means "blade" or "sword" and comes from medieval Latin ''aciarium'', a derivative of ''acies'' "sharp", so there is no direct connection with Latin ''chalybs'' in this etymology). It is from this fanciful etymological musing that [[Thomas Malory]] got the notion that Excalibur meant "cut steel"<ref>Vinaver, Eugene (ed.) ''The works of Sir Thomas Malory'', Volume 3. Clarendon, 1990, p. 1301.</ref> ("'the name of it,' said the lady, 'is Excalibur, that is as moche to say, as Cut stele'").

==Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone==
[[File:The Boy s King Arthur-74.jpg|thumb|The [[Lady of the Lake]] offering [[King Arthur|Arthur]] Excalibur, by Alfred Kappes (1880)]]

In Arthurian romance, a number of explanations are given for Arthur's possession of Excalibur. In [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''[[Merlin#Later adaptations of the legend|Merlin]]'', Arthur obtained the throne by pulling a sword from a stone. (The story of the Sword in the Stone has an analogue in some versions of the story of [[Sigurd]], the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] proto-[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]], whose father, [[Sigmund]], draws the sword [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] out of the tree [[Barnstokkr]] where it is embedded by the Norse god [[Odin]].) In this account, the act could not be performed except by "the true king," meaning the divinely appointed king or true heir of [[Uther Pendragon]]. This sword is thought by many to be the famous Excalibur, and its identity is made explicit in the later Prose ''Merlin'', part of the [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle.<ref>Micha, Alexandre (ed.). ''Merlin: roman du XIIIe siècle'' (Geneva: Droz, 1979)</ref> The challenge of drawing a sword from a stone also appears in the Arthurian legends of [[Galahad]], whose achievement of the task indicates that he is destined to find the [[Holy Grail]]. 

However, in what is called the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], Excalibur was given to Arthur by the [[Lady of the Lake]] sometime after he began to reign. She calls the sword "Excalibur, that is as to say as Cut-steel." In the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate ''Mort Artu'']], Arthur orders [[Griflet]] to throw the sword into the enchanted lake. After two failed attempts (as he felt such a great sword should not be thrown away), he finally complies with the wounded king's request and a hand emerges from the lake to catch it, a tale which becomes attached to [[Bedivere]] instead in Malory and the English tradition.<ref>Lacy, N. J. (trans.) ''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation'', 5 vols (New York: Garland, 1992-6).</ref> Malory records both versions of the legend in his ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', naming both swords as Excalibur.<ref>Malory, Sir Thomas. ''Le Morte D'Arthur'', University of Michigan Humanities Text Initiative, 1997.

==History==
In [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] legend, Arthur's sword is known as ''Caledfwlch''. In ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', it is one of Arthur's most valuable possessions and is used by Arthur's warrior Llenlleawg the Irishman to kill the Irish king Diwrnach while stealing his magical cauldron. [[Irish mythology]] mentions a weapon ''[[Caladbolg]]'', the sword of [[Fergus mac Róich]]. Caladbolg was also known for its incredible power and was carried by some of Ireland's greatest heroes. The name, which can also mean "hard cleft" in [[Irish language|Irish]], appears in the plural, ''caladbuilc'', as a generic term for "great swords" in ''Togail Troi'' ("The Destruction of [[Troy]]"), the 10th century Irish translation of the classical tale.<ref>Thurneysen, R. "Zur Keltischen Literatur und Grammatik", ''Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie'', Volume 12, p. 281ff.</ref><ref>O'Rahilly, T.  F. ''Early Irish history and mythology'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1957, p. 68.</ref>

Though not named as Caledfwlch, Arthur's sword is described vividly in ''[[The Dream of Rhonabwy]]'' one of the tales associated with the ''[[Mabinogion]]'':
{{quote|Then they heard [[Cador|Cadwr Earl of Cornwall]] being summoned, and saw him rise with Arthur's sword in his hand, with a design of two [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]] on the golden hilt; when the sword was unsheathed what was seen from the mouths of the two chimeras was like two flames of fire, so dreadful that it was not easy for anyone to look. At that the host settled and the commotion subsided, and the earl returned to his tent.|From ''The Mabinogion'', translated by Jeffrey Gantz.<ref>Gantz, ''The Mabinogion'', p. 184.</ref>}}

In the late 15th/early 16th-century [[Middle Cornish]] play [[Beunans Ke]], Arthur's sword is called ''Calesvol'', which is etymologically an exact Middle Cornish cognate of the Welsh ''Caledfwlch''. It is unclear if the name was borrowed from the Welsh (if so, it must have been an early loan, for phonological reasons), or represents an early, pan-Brittonic traditional name for Arthur's sword.<ref>Koch, John. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 329.</ref>

Geoffrey's ''Historia'' is the first non-Welsh source to speak of the sword. Geoffrey says the sword was forged in [[Avalon]] and [[List of Latinised names|Latinises]] the name "Caledfwlch" as ''Caliburnus''. When his influential pseudo-history made it to [[Continental Europe]], writers altered the name further until it finally took on the popular form ''Excalibur'' (various spellings in the medieval Arthurian Romance and Chronicle tradition include: Calabrun, Calabrum, Calibourne, Callibourc, Calliborc, Calibourch, Escaliborc, and Escalibor<ref>Zimmer, Heinrich. "Bretonische Elemente in der Arthursage des Gottfried von Monmouth", ''Zeitschrift für französische Sprache und Literatur'', Volume 12, E. Franck's, 1890, p. 236.</ref>). The legend was expanded upon in the Vulgate Cycle, also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, and in the Post-Vulgate Cycle which emerged in its wake. Both included the work known as the ''Prose Merlin'', but the Post-Vulgate authors left out the ''Merlin'' continuation from the earlier cycle, choosing to add an original account of Arthur's early days including a new origin for Excalibur.

In several early French works, such as Chrétien de Troyes' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'' and the Vulgate ''Lancelot Proper'' section, Excalibur is used by Gawain, Arthur's nephew and one of his best knights. This is in contrast to later versions, where Excalibur belongs solely to the king.

In many versions, Excalibur's blade was engraved with phrases on opposite sides: "Take me up" and "Cast me away" (or similar). In addition, when Excalibur was first drawn, in the first battle testing Arthur's sovereignty, its blade blinded his enemies. Thomas Malory<ref>Book I, 19, from ''The Works of Sir Thomas Malory,'' Ed. [[Eugène Vinaver|Vinaver, Eugène]], 3rd ed. Field, Rev. P. J. C. (1990). 3 vol. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-812344-2, ISBN 0-19-812345-0, ISBN 0-19-812346-9. (This is taken from the [[Le Morte d'Arthur|Winchester Manuscript]]).</ref> writes: "thenne he drewe his swerd Excalibur, but it was so breyght in his enemyes eyen that it gaf light lyke thirty torchys."

Excalibur's [[scabbard]] was said to have powers of its own. Loss of blood from injuries, for example, would not kill the bearer. In some tellings, wounds received by one wearing the scabbard did not bleed at all. The scabbard is stolen by [[Morgan le Fay]] in revenge for the death of her beloved [[Accolon]] and thrown into a lake, never to be found again.

Nineteenth century poet [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]],  described the sword in full [[Romanticism|Romantic]] detail in his poem "Morte d'Arthur", later rewritten as "The Passing of Arthur", one of the ''[[Idylls of the King]]'':

{{quote|
:There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,
:And o’er him, drawing it, the winter moon,
:Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth
:And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:
:For all the haft twinkled with [[diamond]] sparks,
:Myriads of [[topaz]]-lights, and [[jacinth]]-work
:Of subtlest jewellery.}}{{Clear}}

==Arthur's other weapons==
Excalibur is by no means the only weapon associated with Arthur, nor the only sword.  Welsh tradition also knew of a dagger named Carnwennan and a spear named Rhongomyniad that belonged to him. [[Carnwennan]] ("Little White-Hilt") first appears in ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', where it was used by Arthur to slice the Black Witch in half.<ref name="BromEv"/><ref>T. Jones and G. Jones, ''The Mabinogion'' (London: Dent, 1949), p. 136.</ref> Rhongomyniad ("spear" + "striker, slayer") is also first mentioned in ''Culhwch'', although only in passing; it appears as simply ''Ron'' ("spear") in Geoffrey's ''Historia''.<ref name="BromEv"/><ref name="Ford"/>

In the ''[[Alliterative Morte Arthure]]'', a [[Middle English]] poem, there is mention of Clarent, a sword of peace meant for knighting and ceremonies as opposed to battle, which was stolen and then used to kill Arthur by [[Mordred]].<ref>[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/alstint.htm ''Alliterative Morte Arthure''], TEAMS, retrieved 26-02-2007</ref> The ''Prose Lancelot'' of the ''Vulgate Cycle'' mentions a sword called Seure, which belonged to the king but was used by Lancelot in one battle.<ref>Warren, Michelle. ''History On The Edge: Excalibur and the Borders of Britain, 1100-1300'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press) p. 212.</ref>

==Similar weapons==
There are other similar weapons described in other mythologies. In particular, [[Claíomh Solais]], which is an Irish term meaning "Sword of Light", or "Shining Sword", which appears in a number of orally transmitted Irish folk-tales.
