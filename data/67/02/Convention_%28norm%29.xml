In a<space/><link><target>social context</target></link>, a convention may retain the character of an &quot;unwritten law&quot; of custom (for example, the manner in which people greet each other, such as by shaking each other's hands).</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>physical science</target><trail>s</trail></link>, numerical values (such as constants, quantities, or scales of measurement) are called conventional if they do not represent a measured property of nature, but originate in a convention, for example an average of many measurements, agreed between the scientists working with these values.</paragraph><heading level='2'>General</heading><paragraph>A convention is a selection from among two or more alternatives, where the rule or alternative is agreed upon among participants. Often the word refers to unwritten customs shared throughout a community. For instance, it is conventional in many societies that strangers being introduced shake hands. Some conventions are explicitly legislated; for example, it is conventional in the<space/><link><target>United States</target></link><space/>and in<space/><link><target>Germany</target></link><space/>that motorists<space/><link><target>Driving on the left or right</target><part>drive on the right</part></link><space/>side of the road, whereas in<space/><link><target>New Zealand</target></link>,<space/><link><target>England</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Australia</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Mauritius</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Barbados</target></link><space/>motorists drive on the left. The standardization of time is a human convention based on the solar cycle or calendar.

Lewis's account of convention received an extended critique in<space/><link><target>Margaret Gilbert</target></link>'s<space/><italics>On Social Facts</italics><space/>(1989), where an alternative account is offered.

According to his paradigm, when conventions are considered absolute realities, they contribute to dogmatism, which in turn leads to conflict. This does not mean that conventions should be absolutely ignored as unreal and therefore useless. Instead, according to Buddhist thought, a wise person adopts a<space/><link><target>middle way</target></link><space/>without holding conventions to be ultimate or ignoring them when they are fruitful.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>David Kalupahana</target></link>,<space/><italics>Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way.</italics><space/>SUNY Press, 1986, pages 17-18.

These<space/><italics>rules</italics><space/>are not written in<space/><link><target>law</target></link><space/>or otherwise formalized. In<space/><link><target>social constructionism</target></link><space/>there is a great focus on social rules. It is argued that these rules are socially constructed, that these rules act upon every member of a society, but at the same time, are re-produced by the individuals.</paragraph><paragraph>Sociologists representing<space/><link><target>symbolic interactionism</target></link><space/>argue that social rules are created through the interaction between the members of a society. The focus on active interaction highlights the fluid, shifting character of social rules. These are specific to the social context, a context that varies through time and place. That means a social rule changes over time within the same society. What was acceptable in the past may no longer be the case. Similarly, rules differ across space: what is acceptable in one society may not be so in another.</paragraph><paragraph>Social rules reflect what is<space/><italics>acceptable</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>normal</italics><space/>behaviour in any situation.<space/><link><target>Michel Foucault</target></link>'s concept of<space/><link><target>discourse</target></link><space/>is closely related to social rules as it offers a possible explanation how these rules are shaped and change. It is the social rules that tell people what is<space/><italics>normal</italics><space/>behaviour for any specific category. Thus, social rules tell a woman how to behave in a<space/><link><target>Femininity</target><part>womanly</part></link><space/>manner, and a man, how to be<space/><link><target>Masculinity</target><part>manly</part></link>.

These rules can be ignored only if justification is clear, or can be provided. Otherwise, consequences follow. Consequences may include ignoring some other convention that has until now been followed. According to the traditional doctrine (Dicey)<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">March 2010</arg></template>, conventions cannot be enforced in courts, because they are non-legal sets of rules. Convention is particularly important in the<space/><link><target>Westminster System</target></link><space/>of government, where many of the rules are unwritten.</paragraph><heading level='2'>International law</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>International law</arg></template>The term &quot;convention&quot; is also used in<space/><link><target>international law</target></link><space/>to refer to certain formal statements of principle such as the<space/><link><target>Convention on the Rights of the Child</target></link>. Conventions are adopted by international bodies such as the<space/><link><target>International Labour Organization</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>United Nations</target></link>. Conventions so adopted usually apply only to countries that ratify them, and do not automatically apply to member states of such bodies. These conventions are generally seen as having the force of international<space/><link><target>treaty</target><part>treaties</part></link><space/>for the ratifying countries.
