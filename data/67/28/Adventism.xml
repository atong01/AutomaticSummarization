After the &quot;<link><target>Great Disappointment</target></link>&quot; of October 22, 1844 many people in the movement gave up on Adventism. Of those remaining Adventist, the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date, yet they remained expectant of the near Advent (<link><target>second coming</target></link><space/>of Jesus).<extension extension_name='ref' name="Handbook"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="ReferenceA">George Knight, ''A Brief History of Seventh-day Adventists</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Of those who retained the October 22 date, many maintained that Jesus had come not literally but &quot;spiritually&quot;, and consequently were known as &quot;spiritualizers&quot;.
