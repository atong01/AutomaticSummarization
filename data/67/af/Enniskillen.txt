'''Enniskillen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|n|ɨ|s|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|ən}}, {{etymology|ga|Inis Ceithleann|[[Cethlenn|Ceithlenn]]'s island}} {{IPAc-ga|'|i|n'|i|s'|-|'|k'|e|l'|@|N}}) is a town and [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] in [[County Fermanagh]], [[Northern Ireland]]. It is located almost exactly in the centre of the county between the Upper and Lower sections of [[Lough Erne]]. It had a population of 13,599 in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]]. It is the seat of local government for [[Fermanagh District Council]], and is also the [[county town]] of Fermanagh as well as its largest town.

== History ==
The town's name comes from the [[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Inis Ceithleann''. This refers to [[Cethlenn]], a figure in [[Irish mythology]] who may have been a goddess. Local legend has it that Ceithlenn was wounded in battle by an arrow and attempted to swim across the river Erne, which surrounds the island, but she never reached the other side so the island was named in reference to her. It has been [[anglicisation|anglicised]] many ways over the centuries — ''Iniskellen'', ''Iniskellin'', ''Iniskillin'', ''Iniskillen'', ''Inishkellen'', ''Inishkellin'', ''Inishkillin'', ''Inishkillen'', and so on.<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/?text=enniskillen&placeID=1167106 Placenames Database of Ireland]</ref>

The town's oldest building is the Maguire's stone castle, built by Hugh the Hospitable who died in 1428.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Rogers|title=Prospect of Fermanagh|publisher=Watergate Press, Enniskillen|year=1982}}</ref> An earthwork, the Skonce on the lough shore, may be the remains of an earlier motte. The castle was the stronghold of the junior branch of the [[Maguire (surname)|Maguire]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/MaguiresDuffysHibernian2-10/index.php|title=The Maguires of Fermanagh}}</ref> The first water-gate was built around 1580 by [[Cú Chonnacht Maguire]], though subsequent lowering of the level of the lough has left it without water. The strategic position of the castle made it important for the English to capture it in 1593 for their [[Plantation of Ulster]] plans which was achieved by a Captain Dowdall. Maguire then laid [[siege]] to it and defeated a relieving force at the Battle of the Ford of the Bicuits at Drumane Bridge on the [[Arney River]]. Although the defenders were relieved, Maguire was in possession of the castle from 1595–8 and it wasn't till 1607 that it was finally captured by the English.

[[File:Enniskillen - geograph.org.uk - 46534.jpg|thumb|240px|Enniskillen's main street in 2004]]

This was part of a wider campaign to bring the province of Ulster under English control; there had been a major siege of [[Enniskillen Castle]] in 1594. The [[Plantation of Ulster]] followed during which the lands of the native Irish were seized and handed over to planters loyal to the English Crown. The Maguires were supplanted by William Cole, originally from [[Devon]], who was appointed by James I to build an English settlement there.

Captain Cole was installed as Constable and strengthened the castle wall and built a "fair house" on the old foundation as the centrepoint of the county town. The first Protestant parish church was erected on the hilltop in 1627. The [[Portora Royal School|Royal Free School of Fermanagh]] was moved onto the island in 1643. The first bridges were drawbridges and permanent bridges were not installed before 1688.

By 1689 the town had grown significantly. During the conflict which resulted from the ousting of King [[James II of England|James II]] by his Protestant rival, [[William III of England|William III]], Enniskillen and [[siege of Derry|Derry]] were the focus of Williamite resistance in Ireland, including the nearby [[Battle of Newtownbutler]].<ref>[[Thomas Witherow|Witherow, Thomas]]. [http://www.libraryireland.com/Derry1689/VI-1.php "The Defence of Enniskillen"]. ''Derry and Enniskillen in the Year 1689''. Library Ireland. Retrieved 24 May 2012.</ref>

Enniskillen and Derry were the two garrisons in Ulster that were not wholly loyal to James II, and it was the last town to fall before the siege of Derry.  As a direct result of this conflict Enniskillen developed not only as a market town but also as a garrison, which became home to two regiments.

The current site of Fermanagh College (now part of the South West College) was the former Enniskillen Gaol.  Many people were tried and hanged here in the square during the times of public execution. Part of the old Gaol is still used by the college.

===Military history===
[[File:Enniskillen Castle by Paride.JPG|thumb|[[Enniskillen Castle]]]]
Enniskillen is the site of the foundation of two [[British Army]] regiments:
*[[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]
*[[The Inniskillings (6th Dragoons)]]

The town's name (with the archaic spelling) continues to form part of the title to [[The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]].

===The Troubles===
{{main|The Troubles in Enniskillen}}

Enniskillen was the site of several events during [[The Troubles]], the most notable being the [[Remembrance Day bombing]] in which 11 people were killed.

===Miscellaneous===

The Irish singer/songwriter [[Tommy Makem]] wrote a lighthearted song about the town, "[[Fare Thee Well, Enniskillen]]" {{cn||date=November 2014}}covered by [[The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]] and [[The Dubliners]].

[[The Chieftains]] sing a song that mentions Enniskillen titled "North Amerikay".

[[Jim Kerr]] of [[Simple Minds]] was so moved by the results of the [[Enniskillen bombing]] in 1987 that he wrote new words to the traditional folk song "[[She Moved Through The Fair]]" and the group recorded it with the name "[[Belfast Child]]". The recording reached No. 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Charts]], Ireland and several other countries in 1989. The single was taken from the album "[[Street Fighting Years]]" and the single version was also published with the title "Ballad of the Streets". The video to the song was shot in black and white and displays poignant footage of children and the destruction of the bombing.

The [[Irish language]] novel ''Mo Dhá Mhicí'' by Séamus Mac Annaidh is set in Enniskillen.
