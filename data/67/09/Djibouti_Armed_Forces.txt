The '''Djibouti Armed Forces''' ('''DJAF''') ({{lang-so|''Ciidanka Jabuuti''}}) are the military forces of [[Djibouti]]. They consist of the '''Djibouti National Army''' and its sub-branches the [[Djibouti Air Force]] and [[Djiboutian Navy]]. As of 2013, the Djibouti Armed Forces consists of 8,000 ground troops, which are divided into several [[regiment]]s and [[battalion]]s garrisoned in various areas throughout the country.

In 2015 General Zakaria Chiek Imbrahim was chief d'etat-major general (chief of staff) of the ''Forces armees djiboutiennes''. He assumed command in November 2013.<ref>http://www.hoa.africom.mil/story/7830/djiboutian-armed-forces-top-leader-retires-changes-command</ref>

==History==
{{main|Military history of Djibouti}}
Historically, Somali society accorded prestige to the warrior (''waranle'') and rewarded military prowess. Except for a man of religion (''wadaad''), and they were few in number, all Somali males were considered potential warriors.
Djibouti's many [[Sultan]]ates each maintained regular troops. In the early Middle Ages, the conquest of [[Shewa]] by the [[Ifat Sultanate]] ignited a rivalry for supremacy with the [[Solomonic Dynasty]].
[[File:Djibarmgen.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A Djibouti Armed Forces commander.]]
Many similar battles were fought between the succeeding [[Sultanate of Adal]] and the Solomonids, with both sides achieving victory and suffering defeat. During the protracted [[Ethiopian-Adal War]] (1529–1559), [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi]] defeated several [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Ethiopian Emperors]] and embarked on a conquest referred to as the ''Futuh Al-Habash'' ("Conquest of Abyssinia"), which brought three-quarters of [[Christian]] Abyssinia under the power of the [[Muslim]] Adal Sultanate.<ref>Saheed A. Adejumobi, ''The History of Ethiopia'', (Greenwood Press: 2006), p.178</ref><ref>Encyclopædia Britannica, inc, Encyclopædia Britannica, Volume 1, (Encyclopædia Britannica: 2005), p.163</ref> Al-Ghazi's forces and their [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] allies came close to extinguishing the ancient Ethiopian kingdom, but the Abyssinians managed to secure the assistance of [[Cristóvão da Gama]]'s [[Portugal|Portuguese]] troops and maintain their domain's autonomy. However, both polities in the process exhausted their resources and manpower, which resulted in the contraction of both powers and changed regional dynamics for centuries to come.

The [[Ogaden War]] (13 July 1977 – 15 March 1978) was a conflict fought between the [[Ethiopia|Ethiopian government]] and [[Somalia|Somali government]]. The Djibouti government supported Somalia with [[military intelligence]]. In a notable illustration of the nature of Cold War alliances, the [[Soviet Union]] switched from supplying aid to Somalia to supporting Ethiopia, which had previously been backed by the [[United States]]. This in turn prompted the U.S. to later start supporting [[Somalia]]. The war ended when Somali forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared.

The first war which involved the Djiboutian armed forces, was the [[Djiboutian Civil War]] between the Djiboutian government, supported by [[France]], and the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (''FRUD''). The war lasted from 1991 to 2001, although most of the hostilities ended when the moderate factions of FRUD signed a peace treaty with the government after suffering an extensive military setback when the government forces captured most of the rebel-held territory. A radical group continued to fight the government, but signed its own peace treaty in 2001. The war ended in a government victory, and FRUD became a political party.

Djibouti has fought in clashes against [[Eritrea]] over the [[Ras Doumeira]] peninsula, which both countries claim to be under their sovereignty. The first clash occurred in 1996 after a nearly two-months stand-off. In 1999, a political crisis occurred when both sides accused each other for supporting its enemies. In 2008, the countries clashed again when Djibouti refused to return Eritrean deserters and Eritrea responded by firing at the Djiboutian forces. In the following battles, some 44 Djiboutian troops and some estimated 100 Eritreans were killed.

In 2011, Djibouti troops also joined the [[African Union Mission to Somalia]].<ref name="Sdpaimtja">{{cite news|title=Somalia: Djibouti Peacekeepers Arrive in Mogadishu to Join Amisom|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201112211223.html|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=Garowe Online|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>

As of 2013, the Djibouti Armed Forces (DJAF) are composed of three branches: the Djibouti National Army, which consists of the Coastal Navy, the Djiboutian Air Force (Force Aerienne Djiboutienne, FAD), and the National Gendarmerie (GN). The Army is by far the largest, followed by the Air Force and Navy. The Commander-in-Chief of the DJAF is the President of Djibouti and the Minister of Defence oversees the DJAF on a day-to-day basis.

==Component forces and their organization==

===Djiboutian Army===
{{Main|Djiboutian Army}}
[[File:Djiboutian soldiers on truck.jpg|thumb|right|Djiboutian Army soldiers during Operation Able Dart 08-01 on Forward Operating in [[Ali Sabieh]].]]
As of 2013, the Djibouti Army (L'Armee de terre) has about 8,000 personnel (IISS 2013). The latter are divided into several [[regiment]]s and [[battalion]]s garrisoned in various areas throughout the country.<ref name="Pdfad">{{cite web|title=Présentation des forces armées djiboutiennes|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/politique-etrangere-de-la-france/defense-et-securite/cooperation-de-securite-et-de/revue-partenaires-securite-defense/archives-revue-freres-d-armes/les-anciens-numeros/freres-d-armes-253-dossier/dossier-republique-de-djibouti/article/presentation-des-forces-armees|publisher=Ministère des Affaires étrangères (France)|accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref> The Army has four military districts (the Tadjourah, Dikhil, Ali-Sabieh and Obock districts).<ref name=IISS_2012_432>{{cite book|last=International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS)|title=The Military Balance 2012|year=2012|publisher=IISS|location=London|page=432|issn=0459-7222}}</ref> Clashes with the [[Military of Eritrea]], in 2008, demonstrated the superior nature of the Djiboutian forces’ training and skills, but also highlighted the fact that the small military would be unable to counter the larger, if less well-equipped forces of its neighbours. The army has concentrated on mobility in its equipment purchases, suitable for patrol duties and counterattacks but ill-suited for armoured warfare. The [[Djiboutian–Eritrean border conflict|2008 border clashes]] at least temporarily swelled the ranks of the Djiboutian army, with retired personnel being recalled, but the military’s size and capabilities are much reduced since the 1990s. The official tasks of the armed forces include strengthening the country against external attack, and maintaining border security. Djiboutian troops continue to monitor its borders with [[Eritrea]], in the case of an attack.

[[Italy]] delivered 10 howitzers M-109L (in 2013), tens IVECO trucks (ACM90, cranes, tankers, etc.), some IVECO armoured car Puma 4X4 and IVECO utility vehicles VM90.

In reforming the Djiboutian Army, most of the available financial resources have been directed to the development of the Land Forces. Over the years, Djiboutian Army has established partnerships with militaries in [[France]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Morocco]] and the [[United States]]. Currently, the amount allocated to defense represents the largest single entry in the country’s budget.

===Djiboutian Navy===
[[File:Djiboutian Navy.jpg|thumb|right|Djiboutian Navy at naval base in [[Djibouti City]].]]
{{Main|Djiboutian Navy}}
The Djiboutian Navy is the naval service branch of the Djibouti Armed Forces. The Djiboutian Navy has about 1,000 regular personnel as of 2013, to protect national maritime rights and to support the nation's foreign policies. It is responsible for securing Djibouti's territorial waters and 314&nbsp;km seaboard. The force was launched two years after Djibouti gained its independence in 1977. Initially, it comprised the remnants of the Gendarmerie and was focused on port safety and traffic monitoring. This is an area known to have considerable fish stocks, sustaining an active fisheries industry. The acquisition of several boats from the US in 2006 considerably increased the navy's ability to patrol over longer distances and to remain at sea for several days at a time. Cooperation with the US and Yemeni navies is also increasing in an effort to protect and maintain the safety and security of the Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOC). In 2004
[[Italy]] delivered 2 former [[Corps of the Port Captaincies – Coast Guard|Italian Coast Guard]] ''[[:it:Classe Super Speranza|Classe 200]]'' patrol boats (ex CP 230 and CP 234 ) and 2 new type ''CP 500'' motorboats.

===Djiboutian Air Force===
{{Main|Djibouti Air Force}}
[[File:Djiboutian Mil Mi-24.jpg|thumb|A Djiboutian [[Mil Mi-24]] flying over.]]
The Djiboutian Air Force (DAF) (French: Force Aérienne du Djibouti (FAdD) was established as part of the Djibouti Armed Forces after the country obtained its independence on June 27, 1977. Its first aircraft included three Nord N.2501 Noratlas transport aircraft and an Allouette II helicopter presented to it by the French. In 1982, the Djibouti Air Force was augmented by two Aerospatiale AS.355F Ecureuil 2 helicopters and a Cessna U206G Stationair, this was followed in 1985 by a Cessna 402C Utiliner. In 1985, the Allouette II was withdrawn from use and put on display at Ambouli Air Base at Djibouti's airport. In 1987, the three N.2501 Noratlas were also retired and subsequently returned to France. New equipment came, in 1991, in the form of a Cessna 208 Caravan, followed by Russian types in the early nineties. These included four Mil Mi 2, six Mil Mi 8 and two Mil Mi 17 helicopters and a single Antonov An 28 light transport aircraft. Pilot training for the 250 men of the DAF, if necessary, is conducted in France with continued on type flight training at home. The DAF has no units of its own and forms in whole a part of the Army, its sole base is Ambouli.
