Claude Jacques summarises: &quot;Very basic historical mistakes have been made&quot; because &quot;the history of pre-Angkorean Cambodia was reconstructed much more on the basis of Chinese records than on that of [Cambodian] inscriptions&quot; and as new inscriptions were discovered, researchers &quot;preferred to adjust the newly discovered facts to the initial outline rather than to call the Chinese reports into question&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://michaelvickery.org/vickery1994what.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>"What and Where was Chenla?" - In the 1970s Claude Jacques began cautiously to move away from the established historiographical framework<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Michael Vickery<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">15 July 2015</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The notion of Chenla's centre being in modern Laos has also been contested. &quot;All that is required is that it be inland from Funan.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://michaelvickery.org/vickery1994what.pdf<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>"What and Where was Chenla?" - there is really no need to look for Chenla beyond the borders of what is present-day Cambodia.

Another inscription of a few years later, K44, 674 AD, commemorating a foundation in Kampot province under the patronage of Jayavarman I, refers to an earlier foundation in the time of King Raudravarma, presumably Rudravarman of Funan, and again there is no suggestion of political discontinuity.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>New Book of Tang</target><part>History of the T'ang</part></link><space/>asserts that shortly after 706 the country was split into Land Chenla and Water Chenla.

Sihanouk wanted the United States and its allies (South Vietnam) to keep the war away from the Cambodian border.

More than two million refugees from the war lived in Phnom Penh and other cities.</paragraph><paragraph>On New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, caused the collapse of the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia.

The Soviet Union supported a strong Vietnam to maintain a second front against China in case of hostilities and to prevent further Chinese expansion.

It was composed of Khmer Communists who had remained in Vietnam after 1975 and officials from the eastern sectorlike Heng Samrin and Hun Senwho had fled to Vietnam from Cambodia in 1978. In late December 1978, Vietnamese forces launched a full invasion of Cambodia, capturing Phnom Penh on 7 January 1979 and driving the remnants of Democratic Kampuchea's army westward toward Thailand.</paragraph><paragraph>Within the CPK, the Paris-educated leadership<link><target>Pol Pot</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Ieng Sary</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Nuon Chea</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Son Sen</target></link>were in control. A new constitution in January 1976 established Democratic Kampuchea as a Communist People's Republic, and a 250-member Assembly of the Representatives of the People of Kampuchea (PRA) was selected in March to choose the collective leadership of a State Presidium, the chairman of which became the head of state.</paragraph><paragraph>Prince Sihanouk resigned as head of state on 4 April.

It also picked a 15-member cabinet headed by Pol Pot as prime minister.

Many of those forced to evacuate the cities were resettled in newly created villages, which lacked food, agricultural implements, and medical care. Many who lived in cities had lost the skills necessary for survival in an agrarian environment. Thousands starved before the first harvest. Hunger and malnutritionbordering on starvationwere constant during those years. Most military and civilian leaders of the former regime who failed to disguise their pasts were executed.Some of the ethnicities in Cambodia, such as the<space/><link><target>Cham people</target><part>Cham</part></link><space/>suffered specific and targeted and violent persecutions.

In many areas of the country people were rounded up and executed for speaking a foreign language, wearing glasses, scavenging for food, and even crying for dead loved ones. Former businessmen and bureaucrats were hunted down and killed along with their entire families; the Khmer Rouge feared that they held beliefs that could lead them to oppose their regime. A few Khmer Rouge loyalists were even killed for failing to find enough 'counter-revolutionaries' to execute.</paragraph><paragraph>Modern research has located 20,000 mass graves from the Khmer Rouge era all over Cambodia.

Prince Sihanouk, President of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia (SNC), and other members of the SNC returned to Phnom Penh in November 1991, to begin the resettlement process in Cambodia. The UN Advance Mission for Cambodia (UNAMIC) was deployed at the same time to maintain liaison among the factions and begin demining operations to expedite the repatriation of approximately 370,000 Cambodians from Thailand.</paragraph><paragraph>On 16 March 1992, the<space/><link><target>United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia</target><part>UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia</part></link><space/>(UNTAC) arrived in Cambodia to begin implementation of the UN Settlement Plan.

Funcinpecthen entered into a coalition with the other parties that had participated in the election. The parties represented in the 120-member assembly proceeded to draft and approve a new constitution, which was promulgated 24 September 1993. It established a multiparty liberal democracy in the framework of a constitutional monarchy, with the former Prince Sihanouk elevated to King. Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen became First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively, in the Royal Cambodian Government (RGC). The constitution provides for a wide range of internationally recognised human rights.</paragraph><paragraph>On 4 October 2004, the Cambodian National Assembly ratified an agreement with the United Nations on the establishment of a tribunal to try senior leaders responsible for the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge. Donor countries have pledged the US$43 million international share of the three-year tribunal budget, while the Cambodian governments share of the budget is US$13.3 million. The tribunal started trials of senior Khmer Rouge leaders in 2008. Cambodia is also recovering from the land mines which were used heavily by the Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese; it will take approximately a decade to remove most of the land mines from Cambodia.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><paragraph><template><target>portal</target><arg>Cambodia</arg></template><template><target>Wikipedia books</target><arg>Cambodia</arg></template><template><target>columns-list</target><arg>2</arg><arg>
