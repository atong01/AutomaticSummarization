The [[Iron Age]] period of [[Southeast Asia]] begins around 500 BC and lasts until the end of the Funan era - around 500 A.D. as it provides the first concrete evidence for sustained maritime trade and socio-political interaction with India and South Asia. By the 1st century settlers have developed complex, organised societies and a varied religious cosmology, that required advanced spoken languages very much related to those of the present day. The most advanced groups lived along the coast and in the lower Mekong River valley and the delta regions in houses on stilts where they cultivated rice, fished and kept domesticated animals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/faculty/stark/pdfs/2003_AngkorBorei.pdf  |title= Art and Archaeology of Fu-Nan | publisher= Department of Anthropology  College of Social Sciences  University of Hawaii  |date= |accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/faculty/stark/pdfs/Stark_06_IPPA.pdf  |title= PRE-ANGKORIAN SETTLEMENT TRENDS IN CAMBODIA’S MEKONG DELTA AND THE LOWER MEKONG ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT - The Mekong delta played a central role in the development of Cambodia’s earliest complex polities from approximately 500 BC to AD 600... | publisher= University of Hawai’i-Manoa  |date= |accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/BIPPA/article/view/9966/0  |title= Trade and Exchange Networks in Iron Age Cambodia: Preliminary Results from a Compositional Analysis of Glass Beads - Beads made of glass and stone found at Iron Age period sites (500 BC – AD 500) in Southeast Asia are amongst the first signs for sustained trade and sociopolitical contact with South Asia...  | publisher= Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association  |date= |accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>

Chinese annals report that Funan reached its territorial climax in the early 3rd century under the rule of king Fan Shih-man, extending as far south as [[Malaysia]] and as far west as [[Burma]]. A system of [[mercantilism]] in commercial monopolies was established. Exports ranged from forest products to precious metals and commodities such as gold, elephants, ivory, rhinoceros horn, kingfisher feathers, wild spices like cardamom, lacquer, hides and aromatic wood. Under Fan Shih-man Funan maintained a formidable fleet and was administered by an advanced bureaucracy, based on a "tribute-based economy, that produced a surplus which was used to support foreign traders along its coasts and ostensibly to launch expansionist missions to the west and south".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/faculty/stark/pdfs/Stark_06_IPPA.pdf    |title= PRE-ANGKORIAN SETTLEMENT TRENDS IN CAMBODIA’S MEKONG DELTA AND THE LOWER MEKONG ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT - a tribute-based economy, that...  | publisher= Department of Anthropology, University of Hawai’i-Manoa  |date=   |accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref>

{{Main|Chenla Kingdom}}

[[Image:AncientKhmerScript.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient [[Khmer script]]]]
The History of the Chinese [[Sui dynasty]] contains records that a state called [[Chenla]] sent an embassy to China in 616 or 617 C.E.  It says, that Chenla was a vassal of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]], but under its ruler Citrasena-Mahendravarman conquered Funan and gained independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/142071/Encyclopedia_of_ancient_Asian_civilizations.pdf    |title= Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations by Charles F.

Most of the Chinese recordings on Chenla, including that of Chenla conquering Funan, have been contested since the 1970ies as they are generally based on single remarks in the Chinese annals, as author Claude Jacques emphasised the very vague character of the Chinese terms 'Funan' and 'Chenla', while more domestic epigraphic sources become available. Claude Jacques summarises:  "Very basic historical mistakes have been made" because "the history of pre-Angkorean Cambodia was reconstructed much more on the basis of Chinese records than on that of [Cambodian] inscriptions" and as new inscriptions were discovered,  researchers "preferred to adjust the newly discovered facts to the initial outline rather than to call the Chinese reports into question".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://michaelvickery.org/vickery1994what.pdf    |title= "What and Where was Chenla?" - In the 1970s Claude Jacques began cautiously to move away from the established historiographical framework | publisher= Michael Vickery  |date=   |accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref>

The notion of Chenla's centre being in modern Laos has also been contested. "All that is required is that it be inland from Funan."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://michaelvickery.org/vickery1994what.pdf   |title= "What and Where was Chenla?" - there is really no need to look for Chenla beyond the borders of what is present-day Cambodia.

Another inscription of a few years later, K44, 674 AD, commemorating a foundation in Kampot province under the patronage of Jayavarman I, refers to an earlier foundation in the time of King Raudravarma, presumably Rudravarman of Funan, and again there is no suggestion of political discontinuity.

The  [[New Book of Tang|History of the T'ang]]  asserts  that  shortly  after  706 the country was split into Land Chenla and Water Chenla.

By the late 8th century Water Chenla had become a vassal of the Sailendra dynasty of Java - the last of its kings was killed and the polity  incorporated into the Javanese monarchy around AD 790. Land Chenla acquired independence under [[Jayavarman II]] in 802 C.E.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/cambodia/history-chenla.htm    |title= Chenla - 550-800  | publisher= Global Security  |date=   |accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref>

Ancient Chinese records mention two kings, Shrutavarman and Shreshthavarman who ruled at the capital Shreshthapura located in modern day southern Laos. The immense influence on the identity of Cambodia to come was wrought by the Khmer Kingdom of [[Sambor Prei Kuk|Bhavapura]], in the modern day Cambodian city of [[Kampong Thom (city)|Kampong Thom]]. Its legacy was its most important sovereign, [[Isanavarman I|Ishanavarman]] who completely conquered the kingdom of Funan during 612-628. He chose his new capital at the [[Sambor Prei Kuk]], naming it Ishanapura.<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

The six centuries of the Khmer Empire are characterised by unparalleled technical and artistic progress and achievements, political integrity and administrative stability. The empire represents the cultural and technical apogee of the Cambodian and Southeast Asian pre-industrial civilisation.

The Khmer Empire was preceded by Chenla, a polity with shifting centres of power, which was split into Land Chenla and Water Chenla in the early 8th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mksjournal.org/mks42gordon.pdf    |title= THE JOURNAL OF THE SIAM  SOCIETY - AN  HISTORICAL  ATLAS  OF  THAILAND Vol. LII Part 1-2 1964 - The Australian National University Canberra | publisher= The Australian National University  |date=   |accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref> By the late 8th century Water Chenla was absorbed by the Malays of the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Empire]] and the Javanese of the [[Shailendra dynasty|Shailandra Empire]] and eventually incorporated into Java and [[Srivijaya]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/cambodia/history-chenla.htm    |title= Chenla - 550-800  | publisher= Global Security  |date=   |accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref> 
[[Jayavarman II]], ruler of Land Chenla, initiates a mythical Hindu [[consecration]] ceremony at [[Phnom Kulen|Mount Kulen]] (Mount Mahendra) in 802 C.E., intended to proclaim political autonomy and royal legitimacy. As he declared himself [[devaraja]] - god king, divinely appointed and uncontested, he  simultaneously declares independence from Shailandra and Srivijaya. He  established [[Hariharalaya]], the first capital of the Angkorean area near the modern town of [[Roluos]].<ref name="God and King">{{cite web |url=http://www.easternbookcorporation.com/moreinfo.php?txt_searchstring=7306 |title=God and King : The Devaraja Cult in South Asian Art & Architecture |author=Sengupta, Arputha Rani (Ed.) |year=2005 |work= |publisher= |ISBN= 8189233262|accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>

Jayavarman II's successors continued to reside north of the [[Tonlé Sap]] lake. This population centre was subject to extensive [[urban planning]], embedded in an elaborate hydraulic network of water reservoirs and canals around central monumental religious structures. The religious monuments underwent over the course of several centuries a sophisticated architectural, stylistic and aesthetic development of eventually most exquisite expression and mastery of composition.

[[File:Bakong 01.jpg|thumb|[[Bakong]], one of the earliest temple mountain in Khmer architecture]]
[[Indravarman I]] (877 - 889) and his son and successor [[Yasovarman I]] (889 - 900), who established the capital [[Yasodharapura]] ordered the construction of huge water reservoirs (barays) north of the capital. The water management network depended on elaborate configurations of channels, ponds and embankments built from huge quantities of clayey sand, the available bulk material on the Angkor plain. Dikes of the [[East Baray]] still exist today, which are more than {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide. The largest component is the West Baray, a reservoir about {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} across, containing approximately 50 million m<sup>3</sup> of water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/plape/citiesaut11/readings/Fletcher-water%20management%20in%20angkor%20Antiquity%202008.pdf    |title= The water management network of Angkor, Cambodia Roland Fletcher Dan Penny, Damián Evans, Christophe Pottier, Mike Barbetti, Matti Kummu, Terry Lustig & Authority for the Protection and Management of Angkor and the Region of Siem Reap (APSARA) Department of Monuments and Archaeology Team  | publisher= University of Washington  |date=   |accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>

Royal administration was based on the religious idea of the Shivaite Hindu state and the central cult of the sovereign as warlord and protector - the "Varman". This centralised system of governance appointed royal functionaries to provinces. The [[Jayavarman VI|Mahidharapura dynasty]] - its first king was [[Jayavarman VI]] (1080 to 1107), which originated west of the [[Dângrêk Mountains]] in the [[Mun river]] valley discontinued the old "ritual policy", genealogical traditions and crucially, [[Hinduism]] as exclusive state religion. Some historians relate the empires' decline to these religious discontinuities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://studiesofasia.wikispaces.com/file/view/EDAS8003A+Assignment+1+Khmer+civilisation+at+Angkor.pdf |title= The emergence and ultimate decline of the Khmer Empire - Many scholars attribute the halt of the development of Angkor to the rise of Theravada...   |date= | publisher= Studies Of Asia |accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/etd/ucb/text/Lowman_berkeley_0028E_11801.pdf    |title= The Descendants of Kambu: The Political Imagination of Angkorian Cambodia By Ian Nathaniel Lowman  | publisher= University of California, Berkeley  |date=   |accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>

The area that comprises the various capitals was spread out over around {{convert|1000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, it is nowadays commonly called [[Angkor]]. The combination of sophisticated wet-rice agriculture, based on an engineered irrigation system and the [[Tonlé Sap]]'s spectacular abundance in fish and aquatic fauna, as protein source guaranteed a regular food surplus. Recent Geo-surveys have confirmed that Angkor maintained the largest pre-industrial settlement complex worldwide during the 12th and 13th centuries - some three quarters of a million people lived there. Sizeable contingents of the public workforce were to be redirected to monument building and [[infrastructure]] maintenance. A growing number of researchers relates the progressive over-exploitation of the delicate local eco-system and its resources alongside large scale [[deforestation]] and resulting [[erosion]] to the empires' eventual decline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/the_journal_of_the_siam_society_vol._lxxxii_part_1-2_1994.pdf   |title= GEOHYDROLOGY  AND THE  DECLINE  OF  ANGKOR by HENG L.

Under king [[Suryavarman II]] (1113 - 1150) the empire reached its greatest geographic extent as it directly or indirectly controlled [[Indochina]], the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and large areas of northern [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. Suryavarman II commissioned the temple of [[Angkor Wat]], built in a period of 37 years, its five towers representing [[Mount Meru]] is considered to be the most accomplished expression of classical [[Khmer architecture]]. However, territorial expansion ended when Suryavarman II was killed in battle attempting to invade [[Đại Việt]]. It followed a period of dynastic upheaval and a [[Cham people|Cham]] invasion that culminated in the sack of Angkor in 1177.

King Jayavarman VII (reigned 1181–1219) is generally considered to be Cambodia's greatest King. A [[Mahayana Buddhism|Mahayana Buddhist]], he initiates his reign by striking back against [[Champa]] in a successful campaign. During his nearly forty years in power he becomes the most prolific monument builder, who establishes the city of [[Angkor Thom]] with its central temple the [[Bayon]]. Further outstanding works are attributed to him - [[Banteay Kdei]], [[Ta Prohm]], [[Neak Pean]] and Sra Srang. The construction of an impressive number of utilitarian and secular projects and edifices, such as maintenance of the extensive road network of [[Suryavarman I]], in particular the royal road to [[Phimai]] and the many rest houses, bridges and hospitals make Jayavarman VII unique among all imperial rulers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/plape/citiesaut11/readings/Hendrickson--angkor%20roads-Antiquity.pdf    |title= Historie routes to Angkor: development of the Khmer road system (ninth to thirteenth centuries AD) in mainland Southeast Asia by Mitch Hendrickson  | publisher= University of Sydney  |date=   |accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>

In August 1296, the Chinese diplomat [[Zhou Daguan]] arrived at Angkor and  remained at the court of king [[Srindravarman]] until July 1297. He wrote a detailed report on life in Angkor. His portrayal is  one of the most important sources of understanding historical Angkor as the text offers valuable information on the everyday life and the habits of the inhabitants of Angkor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thegreatkhmerempire.blogspot.com/2011/12/zhou-daguan-record-of-cambodia-siam.html    |title= Zhou Daguan-A Record of Cambodia-Siam Society Review by Milton Osborne  | publisher= The Great Khmer Empire  |date=   |accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref> 

The last Sanskrit inscription is dated 1327, and records the succession of Indrajayavarman by Jayavarman IX Parameshwara (1327 - 1336).

The empire was an agrarian state that consisted essentially of three social classes, the elite, workers and slaves. The elite included advisers, military leaders, courtiers, priests, religious ascetics and officials. Workers included agricultural labourers and also a variety of craftsman for construction projects. Slaves were often captives from military campaigns or distant villages. Coinage did not exist and the barter economy was based on agricultural produce, principally rice, with regional trade as an insignificant part of the economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://studiesofasia.wikispaces.com/file/view/EDAS8003A+Assignment+1+Khmer+civilisation+at+Angkor.pdf    |title= The emergence and ultimate decline of the Khmer Empire was paralleled with development and subsequent change in religious ideology, together with infrastructure that supported agriculture by Kay McCullough | publisher= National Academy of Science  |date=   |accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Southeast Asia in the 9th to 14th Centuries | author=David G.

==French colonial period (1863–1953)==

[[File:King Norodom.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Norodom of Cambodia]]]]
[[Image:Indochine française (1913).jpg|thumb|right|180px|French Indochina in 1913.]]
In 1863, King [[Norodom of Cambodia|Norodom]] signed an agreement with the French to establish a protectorate over his kingdom. The state gradually came under French colonial rule.

During World War II, the 1940–41 [[Franco-Thai War]] left the [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] colonial authorities in a position of weakness. The Vichy government signed an agreement with Japan to allow the Japanese military transit through French Indochina.<ref>[http://www.net4war.com/e-revue/dossiers/2gm/indochine-sgm/indochine-sgm-01.htm Jean-Philippe Liardet, ''L'Indochine française pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale''; Les accords de septembre 1940]</ref>

Meanwhile the Thai government, under the pro-Japanese leadership of Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]], took advantage of its position and invaded Cambodia's western provinces.<ref>[http://www.net4war.com/e-revue/dossiers/2gm/indochine-sgm/indochine-sgm-02.htm Jean-Philippe Liardet, ''L'Indochine française pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale''; La guerre contre le Siam, 1940-41]</ref>

Cambodia's situation at the end of the war was chaotic. The [[Free French]], under General [[Charles de Gaulle]], were determined to recover Indochina, though they offered Cambodia and the other Indochinese protectorates a carefully circumscribed measure of self-government. Convinced that they had a "[[civilizing mission]]", they envisioned Indochina's participation in a French Union of former colonies that shared the common experience of French culture.

==Administration of Sihanouk (1953–70)==
{{Main|Japanese occupation of Cambodia|Kingdom of Cambodia (1953–70)}}
On 9 March 1945, during the [[Japanese occupation of Cambodia]], young king [[Norodom Sihanouk]] proclaimed an independent Kingdom of Kampuchea, following a formal request by the Japanese. Shortly thereafter the Japanese government nominally ratified the independence of Cambodia and established a consulate in Phnom Penh.<ref>Keat Gin Ooi ''Southeast Asia: a historical encyclopedia''</ref> The new government did away with the [[Latin alphabet|romanisation]] of the [[Khmer language]] that the French colonial administration was beginning to enforce and officially reinstated the [[Khmer script]]. This measure taken by the short-lived governmental authority would be popular and long-lasting, for since then no government in Cambodia has tried to romanise the Khmer language again.<ref>David P. Chandler, ''A History of Cambodia'', Silkworm 1993</ref>
After Allied military units entered Cambodia, the Japanese military forces present in the country were disarmed and repatriated. The French were able to reimpose the colonial administration in Phnom Penh in October the same year.<ref>[http://www.country-data.com/frd/cs/cambodia/kh_appnb.html Cambodia, Appendix B - Major Political and Military Organizations]</ref>

Sihanouk's "royal crusade for independence" resulted in grudging French acquiescence to his demands for a transfer of sovereignty. A partial agreement was struck in October 1953. Sihanouk then declared that independence had been achieved and returned in triumph to [[Phnom Penh]]. As a result of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, Cambodia was able to bring about the withdrawal of the [[Viet Minh]] troops from its territory and to withstand any residual impingement upon its sovereignty by external powers.

Neutrality was the central element of Cambodian foreign policy during the 1950s and 1960s. By the mid-1960s, parts of Cambodia's eastern provinces were serving as bases for North Vietnamese Army and [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] (NVA/NLF) forces operating against South Vietnam, and the port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] was being used to supply them. As NVA/VC activity grew, the United States and [[South Vietnam]] became concerned, and in 1969, the United States began a 14-month-long series of bombing raids targeted at NVA/VC elements, contributing to destabilisation.  The bombing campaign took place no further than ten, and later twenty miles (32&nbsp;km) inside the Cambodian border, areas where the Cambodian population had been evicted by the NVA.<ref>Davidson, Phillip B. ''Vietnam at War: The History 1946–1975''. 1988. P. 593</ref> <!--Cite supports entire paragraph--> Prince Sihanouk, fearing that the conflict between communist North Vietnam and South Vietnam might spill over to Cambodia, publicly opposed the idea of a bombing campaign by the United States along the Vietnam–Cambodia border and inside Cambodian territory. However [[Peter Rodman]] claimed, "Prince Sihanouk complained bitterly to us about these North Vietnamese bases in his country and invited us to attack them". In December 1967 ''Washington Post'' journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object, unless Cambodians were killed.<ref>''The Washington Post'', 29 December 1967</ref> The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson's emissary Chester Bowles in January 1968.<ref>Stephen J. Morris ''Why Vietnam Invaded Cambodia'' (Stanford University Press. 1999). p. 44</ref> So the US had no real motivation to overthrow Sihanouk. However Prince Sihanouk wanted Cambodia to stay out of the North Vietnam–South Vietnam conflict and was very critical of the United States government and its allies (the South Vietnamese government).  Prince Sihanouk, facing internal struggles of his own, due to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, did not want Cambodia to be involved in the conflict. Sihanouk wanted the United States and its allies (South Vietnam) to keep the war away from the Cambodian border.  Sihanouk did not allow the United States to use Cambodian air space and airports for military purposes. This upset the United States greatly and contributed to their view that of Prince Sihanouk as a North Vietnamese sympathiser and a thorn on the United States.<ref>{{worldhistory|quote=P. 1012|section=4084}}</ref> However, declassified documents indicate that, as late as March 1970, the Nixon administration was hoping to garner "friendly relations" with Sihanouk.

Throughout the 1960s, domestic Cambodian politics became polarised. Opposition to the government grew within the middle class and leftists including Paris-educated leaders like [[Son Sen]], [[Ieng Sary]], and Saloth Sar (later known as [[Pol Pot]]), who led an [[insurgency]] under the clandestine Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). Sihanouk called these insurgents the [[Khmer Rouge]], literally the "Red Khmer". But the 1966 national assembly elections showed a significant swing to the right, and General [[Lon Nol]] formed a new government, which lasted until 1967. During 1968 and 1969, the insurgency worsened. However members of the government and army, who resented Sihanouk's ruling style as well as his tilt away from the United States, did have a motivation to overthrow him.

While visiting Beijing in 1970 Sihanouk was [[Cambodian coup of 1970|ousted by a military coup]] led by Prime Minister General [[Lon Nol]] and Prince Sisowath [[Sirik Matak]] in the early hours of 18 March 1970.<ref>Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' p. 197.</ref><ref>

Despite Sihanouk's allegations, there is no evidence that this coup was planned by the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref name="Shortp196">Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' (Henry Holt & Co.: New York, 2004) p. 196.</ref>  However, as early as 12 March 1970, the CIA Station Chief told Washington that based on communications from Sirik Matak, Lon Nol's cousin, that "the (Cambodian) army was ready for a coup".<ref>Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' (Henry Holt & Co.: New York, 2004) p. 195.</ref> Lon Nol assumed power after the military coup and immediately allied Cambodia with the United States. Son Ngoc Thanh, an opponent of Pol Pot, announced his support for the new government. On 9 October, the Cambodian monarchy was abolished, and the country was renamed the Khmer Republic. The new regime immediately demanded that the Vietnamese communists leave Cambodia.

Hanoi rejected the new republic's request for the withdrawal of NVA troops. In response, the United States moved to provide material assistance to the new government's armed forces, which were engaged against both CPK insurgents and NVA forces. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from North Vietnam, immediately launched armed attacks on the new government. The North Vietnamese quickly overran large parts of eastern Cambodia, reaching to within {{convert|15|mi|km}} of [[Phnom Penh]]. The North Vietnamese turned the newly won territories over to the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government, hastening the onset of [[Cambodian Civil War|civil war]].<ref name="SIHNK">{{Cite book| last = Sihanouk | first = Norodom | authorlink = Norodom Sihanouk | title = My War with the CIA: The Memoirs of Prince Norodom Sihanouk as Related to Wilfred Burchett | publisher=Pantheon Books | year = 1973| isbn = 0394485432}}</ref>

In April 1970, US President Richard Nixon announced to the American public that US and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered Cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia (see [[Cambodian Incursion]]).<ref>Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' (Henry Holt & Co.: New York, 2004) p. 204.</ref> The US had already been bombing Vietnamese positions in Cambodia for well over a year by that point. Although a considerable quantity of equipment was seized or destroyed by US and South Vietnamese forces, containment of North Vietnamese forces proved elusive.

The Khmer Republic's leadership was plagued by disunity among its three principal figures: Lon Nol, Sihanouk's cousin [[Sirik Matak]], and National Assembly leader [[In Tam]]. Lon Nol remained in power in part because none of the others were prepared to take his place. In 1972, a constitution was adopted, a parliament elected, and Lon Nol became president. But disunity, the problems of transforming a 30,000-man army into a national combat force of more than 200,000 men, and spreading corruption weakened the civilian administration and army.

The Khmer Rouge insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, aided by supplies and military support from North Vietnam. Pol Pot and [[Ieng Sary]] asserted their dominance over the Vietnamese-trained communists, many of whom were purged. At the same time, the Khmer Rouge (CPK) forces became stronger and more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973, the CPK were fighting battles against government forces with little or no North Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of Cambodia's territory and 25% of its population.

The government made three unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the insurgents, but by 1974, the CPK was operating openly as divisions, and some of the NVA combat forces had moved into South Vietnam. Lon Nol's control was reduced to small enclaves around the cities and main transportation routes. More than two million refugees from the war lived in Phnom Penh and other cities.

On New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, caused the collapse of the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia. The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on 17 April 1975, just five days after the US mission evacuated Cambodia.<ref>Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' p. 4.</ref>

The relationship between the massive carpet bombing of Cambodia by the United States and the growth of the Khmer Rouge, in terms of recruitment and popular support, has been a matter of interest to historians. Some historians have cited the US intervention and bombing campaign (spanning 1965–1973) as a significant factor leading to increased support of the Khmer Rouge among the Cambodian peasantry. However, Pol Pot biographer David Chandler argues that the bombing "had the effect the Americans wanted – it broke the Communist encirclement of Phnom Penh".<ref>Chandler, David 2000, ''Brother Number One: A Political Biography of Pol Pot'', Revised Edition, Chiang Mai, Thailand: Silkworm Books, pp. 96–7.</ref>  [[Peter Rodman]] and [[Michael Lind]] claimed that the US intervention saved Cambodia from collapse in 1970 and 1973.<ref name="Returning to Cambodia">Rodman, Peter, [http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2007/0823iraq_rodman.aspx Returning to Cambodia], Brookings Institution, 23 August 2007.</ref><ref>Lind, Michael, ''Vietnam: The Necessary War: A Reinterpretation of America's Most Disastrous Military Conflict'', Free Press, 1999.</ref>  Craig Etcheson agreed that it was "untenable" to assert that US intervention caused the Khmer Rouge victory while acknowledging that it may have played a small role in boosting recruitment for the insurgents.<ref>Etcheson, Craig, ''The Rise and Demise of Democratic Kampuchea'', Westview Press, 1984, p. 97</ref>  [[William Shawcross]], however, wrote that the US bombing and ground incursion plunged Cambodia into the chaos Sihanouk had worked for years to avoid.<ref>Shawcross, William, ''Sideshow'', Isaacs, Hardy, & Brown, pp. 92–100, 106–112.</ref>

{{refimprove section|date=November 2008}}

Immediately after its victory, the CPK ordered the evacuation of all cities and towns, sending the entire urban population into the countryside to work as farmers, as the CPK was trying to reshape society into a model that Pol Pot had conceived.

The new government sought to completely restructure Cambodian society. Remnants of the old society were abolished and religion was suppressed. Agriculture was collectivised, and the surviving part of the industrial base was abandoned or placed under state control. Cambodia had neither a currency nor a banking system.

Democratic Kampuchea's relations with Vietnam and Thailand worsened rapidly as a result of border clashes and ideological differences. While communist, the CPK was fiercely nationalistic, and most of its members who had lived in Vietnam were purged. Democratic Kampuchea established close ties with the People's Republic of China, and the Cambodian-Vietnamese conflict became part of the Sino-Soviet rivalry, with Moscow backing Vietnam. Border clashes worsened when the Democratic Kampuchea military attacked villages in Vietnam. The regime broke off relations with Hanoi in December 1977, protesting Vietnam's alleged attempt to create an Indochina Federation. In mid-1978, Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia, advancing about {{convert|30|mi|km}} before the arrival of the rainy season.

The reasons for Chinese support of the CPK was to prevent a pan-Indochina movement, and maintain Chinese military superiority in the region. The Soviet Union supported a strong Vietnam to maintain a second front against China in case of hostilities and to prevent further Chinese expansion. Since Stalin's death, relations between Mao-controlled China and the Soviet Union had been lukewarm at best. In February to March 1979, China and Vietnam would fight the brief [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] over the issue.

In December 1978, Vietnam announced the formation of the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] (KUFNS) under [[Heng Samrin]], a former DK division commander. It was composed of Khmer Communists who had remained in Vietnam after 1975 and officials from the eastern sector—like Heng Samrin and Hun Sen—who had fled to Vietnam from Cambodia in 1978. In late December 1978, Vietnamese forces launched a full invasion of Cambodia, capturing Phnom Penh on 7 January 1979 and driving the remnants of Democratic Kampuchea's army westward toward Thailand.

Within the CPK, the Paris-educated leadership—[[Pol Pot]], [[Ieng Sary]], [[Nuon Chea]], and [[Son Sen]]—were in control. A new constitution in January 1976 established Democratic Kampuchea as a Communist People's Republic, and a 250-member Assembly of the Representatives of the People of Kampuchea (PRA) was selected in March to choose the collective leadership of a State Presidium, the chairman of which became the head of state.

Prince Sihanouk resigned as head of state on 4 April. On 14 April, after its first session, the PRA announced that [[Khieu Samphan]] would chair the State Presidium for a 5-year term. It also picked a 15-member cabinet headed by Pol Pot as prime minister. Prince Sihanouk was put under virtual house arrest.

===Social and cultural implications of the regime===
Thousands starved or died of disease during the evacuation and its aftermath. Many of those forced to evacuate the cities were resettled in newly created villages, which lacked food, agricultural implements, and medical care. Many who lived in cities had lost the skills necessary for survival in an agrarian environment. Thousands starved before the first harvest. Hunger and malnutrition—bordering on starvation—were constant during those years. Most military and civilian leaders of the former regime who failed to disguise their pasts were executed.
Some of the ethnicities in Cambodia, such as the [[Cham people|Cham]] suffered specific and targeted and violent persecutions. To the point of some international sources referring to it as the "Cham genocide". Entire families and towns were targeted and attacked with the goal of significantly diminishing their numbers and eventually eliminated them.[http://diacritics.org/2010/democratic-kampucheas-genocide-of-the-cham]
Life in 'Democratic Kampuchea' was strict and brutal. In many areas of the country people were rounded up and executed for speaking a foreign language, wearing glasses, scavenging for food, and even crying for dead loved ones. Former businessmen and bureaucrats were hunted down and killed along with their entire families; the Khmer Rouge feared that they held beliefs that could lead them to oppose their regime. A few Khmer Rouge loyalists were even killed for failing to find enough 'counter-revolutionaries' to execute.

Modern research has located 20,000 mass graves from the Khmer Rouge era all over Cambodia. Various studies have estimated the death toll at between 740,000 and 3,000,000, most commonly between 1.4&nbsp;million and 2.2&nbsp;million, with perhaps half of those deaths being due to executions, and the rest from starvation and disease.<ref name="Mekong.net_deaths">{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=Bruce|title=Counting Hell: The Death Toll of the Khmer Rouge Regime in Cambodia|date = 1 April 2005|url = http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/deaths.htm|accessdate =5 July 2006}}</ref>

On 10 January 1979, after the Vietnamese army and the [[KUFNS]] invaded Cambodia, the new People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) was established with Heng Samrin as head of state. Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces retreated rapidly to the Thai border. The Khmer Rouge and the PRK began a costly struggle that played into the hands of the larger powers China, the United States and the Soviet Union. A civil war was imposed on impoverished Cambodia that displaced 600,000 Cambodians to refugee camps along the border between Thailand and Cambodia.<ref>David P.

[[Modern Cambodia#Peace efforts and the free elections|Peace efforts]] began in Paris in 1989 under the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#Transition|State of Cambodia]], culminating two years later in October 1991 in a comprehensive peace settlement. The [[United Nations]] was given a mandate to enforce a ceasefire, and deal with refugees and disarmament known as the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC).<ref name="USDOS3">US Department of State.

==Modern Cambodia (1993-present)==

On 23 October 1991, the Paris Conference reconvened to sign a comprehensive settlement giving the UN full authority to supervise a cease-fire, repatriate the displaced Khmer along the border with Thailand, disarm and demobilise the factional armies, and prepare the country for free and fair elections. Prince Sihanouk, President of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia (SNC), and other members of the SNC returned to Phnom Penh in November 1991, to begin the resettlement process in Cambodia. The UN Advance Mission for Cambodia (UNAMIC) was deployed at the same time to maintain liaison among the factions and begin demining operations to expedite the repatriation of approximately 370,000 Cambodians from Thailand.

On 16 March 1992, the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia|UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC) arrived in Cambodia to begin implementation of the UN Settlement Plan. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees began fullscale repatriation in March 1992. UNTAC grew into a 22,000-strong civilian and military peacekeeping force to conduct free and fair elections for a constituent assembly.

Over 4 million Cambodians (about 90% of eligible voters) participated in the May 1993 elections, although the Khmer Rouge or [[Party of Democratic Kampuchea]] (PDK), whose forces were never actually disarmed or demobilised, barred some people from participating. [[Norodom Ranariddh|Prince Ranariddh]]'s royalist [[Funcinpec]] Party was the top vote recipient with 45.5% of the vote, followed by Hun Sen's [[Cambodian People's Party]] and the [[Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party]], respectively. Funcinpecthen entered into a coalition with the other parties that had participated in the election. The parties represented in the 120-member assembly proceeded to draft and approve a new constitution, which was promulgated 24 September 1993. It established a multiparty liberal democracy in the framework of a constitutional monarchy, with the former Prince Sihanouk elevated to King. Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen became First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively, in the Royal Cambodian Government (RGC). The constitution provides for a wide range of internationally recognised human rights.

On 4 October 2004, the Cambodian National Assembly ratified an agreement with the United Nations on the establishment of a tribunal to try senior leaders responsible for the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge. Donor countries have pledged the US$43 million international share of the three-year tribunal budget, while the Cambodian government’s share of the budget is US$13.3 million. The tribunal started trials of senior Khmer Rouge leaders in 2008.  Cambodia is also recovering from the land mines which were used heavily by the Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese; it will take approximately a decade to remove most of the land mines from Cambodia.
