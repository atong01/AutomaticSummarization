Cameroon lies at a key point in the [[Trans-African Highway network]], with three routes crossing its territory:
* [[Trans-Sahelian Highway|Dakar-N'Djamena Highway]], connecting just over the Cameroon border with the [[Ndjamena-Djibouti Highway|N'Djamena-Djibouti Highway]]
* [[Lagos-Mombasa Highway]]
* [[Tripoli-Cape Town Highway]]
Cameroon's central location in the network means that efforts to close the gaps which exist in the network across Central Africa rely on the Cameroon's participation in maintaining the network, and the network has the potential to have a profound influence on Cameroon's regional trade. Except for the several relatively good toll roads which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained and subject to inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred. It is likely for instance that within a decade, a great deal of trade between West Africa and Southern Africa will be moving on the network through Yaoundé.

Prices of petrol rose steadily in 2007 and 2008, leading to a transport union strike in Douala on 25 February 2008. The strike quickly escalated into [[2008 Cameroonian anti-government protests|violent protests]] and spread to other major cities. The uprising finally subsided on 29 February.<ref>Nkemngu, Martin A. (11 March 2008). "[http://www.cameroon-tribune.net/article.php?lang=Fr&oled=j11032008&idart=9281&olarch= Facts and Figures of the Tragic Protests]", ''[[Cameroon Tribune]]''.

[[File:Port autonome de Douala 01.JPG|thumb|Port of Douala.]]
Of the operating maritime ports in Cameroon, [[Douala]] is the busiest and most important. Lesser ports include [[Kribi]], used chiefly for the export of [[wood]], and [[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbé]], used only for palm-oil exports. [[Garoua]], on the [[Benoué River]], is the main river port, but it is active only from July to September. In 2005, Cameroon’s merchant fleet consisted of one petroleum tanker, totalling 169,593 GRT.

* [[Douala]] - main port, railhead, and second largest city.
* [[Bonaberi]] - [[railhead]] to northwest
* [[Garoua]]
* [[Kribi]] - oil pipeline from [[Chad]]
** [[Kribi South]] - proposed iron ore export port, about 40&nbsp;km south of [[Kribi]].
* [[Tiko]]

==Pipelines==
889&nbsp;km of oil line (2008)

== Airports ==
The main international airport is the [[Douala International Airport]] and a secondary international airport at [[Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport]]. As of May 2014 Cameroon had regular international air connections with nearly every major international airport in West and Southwest Africa as well as several connections to Europe and East Africa.

In 2008 there were 34 airports, only 10 of which had paved runways.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
