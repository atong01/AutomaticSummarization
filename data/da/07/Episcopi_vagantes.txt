'''''{{lang|la|Episcopi vagantes}}''''' (singular: '''''{{lang|la|episcopus vagans}}''''', [[Latin language|Latin]] for wandering bishops or stray bishops) are those persons consecrated, in a "clandestine or irregular way," as [[Christianity|Christian]] [[bishop]]s outside the structures and [[canon law]] of the established churches; those regularly consecrated but later excommunicated, and not in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with any generally recognized [[diocese]]; and those who have in communion with them small groups that appear to exist solely for the bishop's sake.<ref name="ODCC">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Oxford dictionary of the Christian Church|title=episcopi vagantes|editor1-first=Frank L.|editor1-last=Cross|editor2-first=Elizabeth A.|editor2-last=Livingstone|edition=3rd rev.|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280290-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA558}}</ref><ref name="Brandreth1987" />{{rp|pages=1–2}} David V.

==Theological issues==
{{refimprove|date=December 2011}}
In Western Christianity it has traditionally been taught, since as far back as the time of the [[Donatist]] controversy of the fourth and fifth centuries, that any bishop can consecrate any other baptised man as a bishop provided that the bishop observes the minimum requirements for the sacramental validity of the ceremony. This means that the consecration is considered valid even if it flouts certain ecclesiastical laws, and even if the participants are [[Schism (religion)|schismatics]] or [[heresy|heretics]].

According to a theological view affirmed, for instance, by the [[International Bishops' Conference]] of the [[Old Catholic Church]] with regard to ordinations by [[Arnold Mathew]], an episcopal ordination is for service within a specific Christian church, and an ordination ceremony that concerns only the individual himself does not make him truly a bishop.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=rE3HEeoXJNsC&pg=PA197&dq=Smit+%22truly+bishops%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=npDrU8jTC4SR7AaIpIHQAQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Smit%20%22truly%20bishops%22&f=false Peter-Ben Smit, ''Old Catholic and Philippine Independent Ecclesiologies in History'' (BRILL 2011 ISBN 978-90-0420647-2), p. 197]</ref> The [[Holy See]] has not commented on the validity of this theory, but has declared with regard to ordinations of this kind carried out, for example, by [[Emmanuel Milingo]], that the Church "does not recognize and does not intend to recognize in the future those ordinations or any of the ordinations derived from them and therefore the canonical state of the alleged bishops remains that in which they were before the ordination conferred by Mr Milingo".<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/2010/gennaio%202010.pdf ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' CII (2010), p. 58]</ref> Other theologians also, notably those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], dispute the notion that such ordinations have effect, a notion that opens up the possibility of valid but irregular consecrations proliferating outside the structures of the "official" denominations.

A Catholic ordained to the episcopacy without a mandate from the Pope is automatically excommunicated<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1382]</ref> and is thereby forbidden to celebrate the sacraments, according to canon law.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4X.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1331 §1]</ref>

===Eastern Orthodox===
Vlassios Pheidas, on an official [[Church of Greece]] site, uses the canonical language of the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Orthodox tradition]], to describe the conditions in ecclesial [[praxis (Eastern Orthodoxy)|praxis]] when [[sacraments]], including [[Holy Orders]], are real, valid, and efficacious. He notes language is itself part of the [[ecclesiological]] problem.<ref name="Pheidas">{{cite web|location=|publisher=Online Cultural Center of the Church of Greece|series=Myriobiblos: The online library of the Church of Greece|work=The limits of the church in an orthodox perspective|title=Chapter I|last=Pheidas|first=Vlassios

{{quote|If [...] [[Grace (Christianity)|divine grace]] is granted to all, [...] then it stands to reason that it is bestowed also in those believers outside the Roman-Catholic Church, even if such persons belong to a [[heresy]] of [[schism (religion)|schism]]. Thus, the sacraments performed outside the Church are not only real ({{lang|gre|υποστατά}}), but also valid ({{lang|gre|έγκυρα}}), because they only lack the efficacy ({{lang|gre|ενέργεια}}) of the bestowed divine grace, which is operative through the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] only within the Roman-Catholic Church.

[...]

Through such a teaching [...] one finds himself face to face with the [...] principle of "{{lang|la|[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|extra Ecclesia nulla salus]]}}", which strictly determines the canonical limits of the Church. Thus, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], while accepting the canonical possibility of recognising the existence ({{lang|gre|υποστατόν}}) of sacraments performed outside herself, it questions their validity ({{lang|gre|έγκυρον}}) and certainly rejects their efficacy ({{lang|gre|ενεργόν}}). It is already well-known that in the ecclesial praxis, the Orthodox Church moves, according to the specific circumstances, between canonical "[[akribeia|acribeia]]" and ecclesial [[economy (religion)|economy]], recognising by economy the validity ({{lang|gre|κύρος}}) of the sacraments of those ecclesiastical bodies. Yet, such a practice of economy does not overthrow the canonical "acribeia", which also remains in force and expresses the exclusive character of orthodox ecclesiology.

This observation is really important, because it reveals that the canonical recognition ({{lang|gre|αναγνώρισις}}) of the validity of sacraments performed outside the Orthodox Church: (a) is done by economy, (b) covers only specific cases in certain given instances, and (c) refers to the validity of the sacraments only of those who join the Orthodox Church, and not of the ecclesiastical bodies to which belong those who join the Orthodox Church. There is, [...] a variety of opinions or reservations concerning this question. No one, [...] could propose or support the view that the mutual recognition of the validity of sacraments among the Churches is an ecclesiastical act consistent with orthodox ecclesiology, or an act which is not rejected by the orthodox canonical tradition. [...]

[...]

[...] the mutual recognition of the validity of certain sacraments, [...] is for an Orthodox an act of inconsistency, when it is assessed with orthodox ecclesiological principles. These ecclesiological principles manifest in a strict fashion the organic unity of the orthodox ecclesial body and differentiate those who do not belong to its body as either schismatics or heretics.

The relation of schismatics or heretics to the body of the Orthodox Church is strictly defined by the canonical tradition. However, orthodox canonical tradition and praxis appraises and classifies these ecclesiastical bodies into various categories, [...] in which some form of ecclesiality is recognised. This type of ecclesiality is not easily determined, because the orthodox tradition [...] does not recognise the efficacy of the divine grace outside the canonical boundaries of the Orthodox Church.<ref name="Pheidas" />{{rp|at=ch. 2}}}}

This applies to the validity and efficacy of the ordination of bishops and the other sacraments, not only of the [[Independent Catholic Churches]], but also of all other Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

===Anglican===
Anglican bishop [[Colin Buchanan (bishop)|Colin Buchanan]], in ''Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism'', says that the [[Anglican Communion]] has held an Augustinian view of orders, by which "the validity of Episcopal ordinations (to whichever order) is based solely upon the historic succession in which the ordaining bishop stands, irrespective of their contemporary ecclesial context."
He describes the circumstances of Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]]'s consecration as one of the reasons why this theory is "generally held".<ref name="Buchanan2006">

==History==
According to Buchanan, "the real rise of the problem" happened on the 19th century, in the "wake of the Anglo-Catholic movement", "through mischievous activities of a tiny number of independently acting bishops". They exist worldwide, he writes, "mostly without congregations", and "many in different stages of delusion and fantasy, not least in the Episcopal titles they confer on themselves"; "the distinguishing mark" to "specifically identif[y]" an ''episcopus vagans'' is "the lack of a true see or the lack of a real church life to oversee".<ref name="Buchanan2006" /> Paul Halsall, on the [[Internet History Sourcebooks Project]], did not list a single church edifice of independent bishops, in a 1996&ndash;1998 [[New York City]] building [[architecture]] survey of religious communities, which maintain bishops claiming [[apostolic succession]] and claim [[cathedra|cathedral status]] but noted there "are now literally hundreds of these '{{lang|la|episcopi vagantes}}', of lesser or greater spiritual [[wiktionary:probity|probity]].

Many ''episcopi vagantes'' claim succession from the [[Old Catholic]] See of [[Utrecht]], or from [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], or [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. A few others derive their orders from Roman Catholic bishops who have consecrated their own bishops after disputes with the [[Holy See]].

Barrett wrote that leaders "of some esoteric movements, are also priests or bishops in small non-mainstream Christian Churches"; he explains, this type of "independent or autocephalous" group has "little in common with the Church it developed from, the Old Catholic Church, and even less in common with the Roman Catholic Church" but still claims its authority from [[Apostolic succession]].<ref name="Barrett2011" />{{rp|page=56}}

Many, if not most, ''episcopi vagantes'' are associated with [[Independent Catholic Churches]]. They may be very liberal or very conservative. ''Episcopi vagantes'' may also include some conservative "[[Continuing Anglican]]s" who have broken with the [[Anglican Communion]] over various issues such as [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]] revision, the [[ordination of women]] and the ordination of unmarried, non-celibate individuals (including homosexuals).

Buchanan writes that based the criteria of having "a true see" or having "a real church life to oversee", the bishops of most forms of [[Continuing Anglican movement]] are not necessarily classified as vagantes, but "are always in danger of becoming such".<ref name="Buchanan2006" />

[[Intertextuality]] of ''{{lang|la|episcopi vagantes}}'' language. [[Jim Higgins (British politician)|Jim Higgins]] saw, in ''More Years for the Locust'', "similarities between [[Marxist]] [[obscurantism]] and an [[addiction]] to Christian [[arcane|arcana]]" and used ''{{lang|la|episcopi vagantes}}'' [[pejoratively]] as his example of "the ever-growing proliferation of sects, sectlets and insects claiming direct descent from the master" with "[[wiktionary:fissiparous|fissiparous]] tendencies". He saw [[humor]] in the ludicrous [[character (arts)|character]]s and [[farce]] in their [[title]]s.<ref name="Higgins2003">

</ref>{{bq|No sooner had the apostolic hands graced [[Arnold Mathew|[Arnold] Mathew]]'s head than he was off forming his own church. There is nothing like a Bishop's [[mitre]] and [[crozier]] to make a chap look posh and become the object of envious glances from other would-be Bishops. Where one man has ventured others will surely follow, if not always by the same route. [[Joseph René Vilatte|JR Vilatte]] and [Ulric] Vernon Herford were made Bishops by the Nestorian Church of the Malabar Coast. Thus it was that the good work continued: the new bishops built their churches and, in time, felt the need for additional bishops. Need being father to the deed, they laid their hands on suitable candidates, who often, in their turn, developed doctrinal differences which necessitated them breaking away to form their own church. With each split there was a new accretion of theological exotica. One vagrant bishop blended Catholicism with [[theosophy]] and built his cathedral around a massive [[brass]] [[funnel]] through which God sent down beneficent rays to the faithful, who stood underneath the blessed metal conduit to receive them. Another, perhaps unsure of the effectiveness of one ceremony, was consecrated on numerous occasions in various vagrant churches and when last heard of was styled [[Hugh George de Willmott Newman|Mar Georgius]], Patriarch of Glastonbury, the Episcopate of the West, and his subsidiary titles covered ten full lines of 12 point type. Among this small but sparky firmament, one with real star quality was the French "Bishop" who combined catholicism with [[Neo-Druidism|druidism]]. He conducted baptism, weather permitting, in the sea off the Normandy coast. This splendid chap styled himself, "His Whiteness the Humble Tugdual the Second".{{efn|He is identified as Jean-Pierre (Clodoald) Danyel.<ref name="Pearson2007">
