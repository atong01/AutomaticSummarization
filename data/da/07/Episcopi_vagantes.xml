Thus, the sacraments performed outside the Church are not only real ({{lang|gre|υποστατά}}), but also valid ({{lang|gre|έγκυρα}}), because they only lack the efficacy ({{lang|gre|ενέργεια}}) of the bestowed divine grace, which is operative through the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] only within the Roman-Catholic Church.

[...]

Through such a teaching [...] one finds himself face to face with the [...] principle of "{{lang|la|[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|extra Ecclesia nulla salus]]}}", which strictly determines the canonical limits of the Church. Thus, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], while accepting the canonical possibility of recognising the existence ({{lang|gre|υποστατόν}}) of sacraments performed outside herself, it questions their validity ({{lang|gre|έγκυρον}}) and certainly rejects their efficacy ({{lang|gre|ενεργόν}}). It is already well-known that in the ecclesial praxis, the Orthodox Church moves, according to the specific circumstances, between canonical "[[akribeia|acribeia]]" and ecclesial [[economy (religion)|economy]], recognising by economy the validity ({{lang|gre|κύρος}}) of the sacraments of those ecclesiastical bodies. Yet, such a practice of economy does not overthrow the canonical "acribeia", which also remains in force and expresses the exclusive character of orthodox ecclesiology.

This observation is really important, because it reveals that the canonical recognition ({{lang|gre|αναγνώρισις}}) of the validity of sacraments performed outside the Orthodox Church: (a) is done by economy, (b) covers only specific cases in certain given instances, and (c) refers to the validity of the sacraments only of those who join the Orthodox Church, and not of the ecclesiastical bodies to which belong those who join the Orthodox Church. There is, [...] a variety of opinions or reservations concerning this question. No one, [...] could propose or support the view that the mutual recognition of the validity of sacraments among the Churches is an ecclesiastical act consistent with orthodox ecclesiology, or an act which is not rejected by the orthodox canonical tradition. [...]

[...]

[...] the mutual recognition of the validity of certain sacraments, [...] is for an Orthodox an act of inconsistency, when it is assessed with orthodox ecclesiological principles. These ecclesiological principles manifest in a strict fashion the organic unity of the orthodox ecclesial body and differentiate those who do not belong to its body as either schismatics or heretics.

The relation of schismatics or heretics to the body of the Orthodox Church is strictly defined by the canonical tradition. However, orthodox canonical tradition and praxis appraises and classifies these ecclesiastical bodies into various categories, [...] in which some form of ecclesiality is recognised. This type of ecclesiality is not easily determined, because the orthodox tradition [...] does not recognise the efficacy of the divine grace outside the canonical boundaries of the Orthodox Church.<ref name">"Pheidas" />{{rp|at</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>This applies to the validity and efficacy of the ordination of bishops and the other sacraments, not only of the<space/><link><target>Independent Catholic Churches</target></link>, but also of all other Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic Church,<space/><link><target>Oriental Orthodoxy</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Assyrian Church of the East</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Anglican</heading><paragraph>Anglican bishop<space/><link><target>Colin Buchanan (bishop)</target><part>Colin Buchanan</part></link>, in<space/><italics>Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism</italics>, says that the<space/><link><target>Anglican Communion</target></link><space/>has held an Augustinian view of orders, by which &quot;the validity of Episcopal ordinations (to whichever order) is based solely upon the historic succession in which the ordaining bishop stands, irrespective of their contemporary ecclesial context.&quot;He describes the circumstances of Archbishop<space/><link><target>Matthew Parker</target></link>'s consecration as one of the reasons why this theory is &quot;generally held&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Buchanan2006"><template><target>cite encyclopedia</target><arg name="location">Lanham, MD</arg><arg name="publisher">The Scarecrow Press</arg><arg name="series">Historical Dictionaries of Religions, Philosophies, and Movements</arg><arg name="volume">62</arg><arg name="encyclopedia">Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism</arg><arg name="year">2006</arg><arg name="isbn">0810853272</arg><arg name="last">Buchanan</arg><arg name="first">Colin O</arg><arg name="authorlink">Colin Buchanan (bishop)</arg><arg name="title">Episcopus Vagans</arg><arg name="pages">166&ndash;167</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">{{date|2013-05-24}}</arg></template><space/><template><target>cite encyclopedia</target><arg name="title">Old Catholics</arg><arg name="page">335</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="accessdate">{{date|2013-05-24}}</arg></template></extension><space/>Parker was chosen by<space/><link><target>Queen regnant</target><part>Queen</part></link><space/><link><target>Elizabeth I of England</target></link><space/>to be the first<space/><link><target>Church of England</target></link><space/><link><target>Archbishop of Canterbury</target></link><space/>after the death of the previous office holder,<space/><link><target>Cardinal (Catholicism)</target><part>Cardinal</part></link><space/><link><target>Reginald Pole</target></link>, the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Smith1907"><template><target>catholic</target><arg name="inline">1</arg><arg name="volume">1</arg><arg name="last">Smith</arg><arg name="first">Sydney</arg><arg name="wstitle">Anglican Orders</arg></template></extension><space/>Buchanan notes the Roman Catholic Church also focuses on issues of intention and not just breaks in historical succession.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Buchanan2006"></extension><space/>He does not explain whether intention has an ecclesiological role, for Anglicans, in conferring or receiving sacraments.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph>According to Buchanan, &quot;the real rise of the problem&quot; happened on the 19th century, in the &quot;wake of the Anglo-Catholic movement&quot;, &quot;through mischievous activities of a tiny number of independently acting bishops&quot;.

Gina, Karen, and Rose called themselves "priests without a parish." Local clergy discussed the Washerwomen the way you discuss a calf born with two heads. [...] The cult on Colden Street. Once, a visiting Anglican priest even gave the sisters a nickname: ''{{lang|la|episcopi vagantes}}'', the "wandering bishops."

It was a title the sisters liked (the English, not the Latin). They embraced it, [...] Even had fun with it. [...] They seemed to shine like beasts of prophecy, their vitality more persuasive than any words.

There is nothing like a Bishop's [[mitre]] and [[crozier]] to make a chap look posh and become the object of envious glances from other would-be Bishops. Where one man has ventured others will surely follow, if not always by the same route. [[Joseph René Vilatte|JR Vilatte]] and [Ulric] Vernon Herford were made Bishops by the Nestorian Church of the Malabar Coast. Thus it was that the good work continued: the new bishops built their churches and, in time, felt the need for additional bishops. Need being father to the deed, they laid their hands on suitable candidates, who often, in their turn, developed doctrinal differences which necessitated them breaking away to form their own church. With each split there was a new accretion of theological exotica. One vagrant bishop blended Catholicism with [[theosophy]] and built his cathedral around a massive [[brass]] [[funnel]] through which God sent down beneficent rays to the faithful, who stood underneath the blessed metal conduit to receive them. Another, perhaps unsure of the effectiveness of one ceremony, was consecrated on numerous occasions in various vagrant churches and when last heard of was styled [[Hugh George de Willmott Newman|Mar Georgius]], Patriarch of Glastonbury, the Episcopate of the West, and his subsidiary titles covered ten full lines of 12 point type. Among this small but sparky firmament, one with real star quality was the French "Bishop" who combined catholicism with [[Neo-Druidism|druidism]]. He conducted baptism, weather permitting, in the sea off the Normandy coast.
