[[Eritrea]] has an estimated population of 5.7 million as of 2010. No reliable census data is available, the best available estimates being published by the Population Division of the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]].

Population has doubled over the past 30 years, with an accelerating growth rate estimated at close to 3.2% p.a. during 2005&ndash;2010. This rate of population growth is sustained despite a high [[emigration rate]]; the [[World Bank]] as of 2010 estimated that close to a million of Eritreans have emigrated.<ref>[http://www.worldbank.org/prospects/migrationandremittances Bilateral Estimates of Migrant Stocks in 2010] estimates 942,000 emigrants, of whom 450,000 migrated to [[Sudan]] and 290,000 to [[Ethiopia]].

==Population==
According to the 2012 revision of the UN's World Population Prospects, the total population of Eritrea was at 5.74 million in 2010 (compared to 3.27 million in 1990).
Population growth rate during 2005&ndash;2010 was estimated at 3.2% p.a.

In the 2010s, worsening conditions have fuelled migration pressure, with Eritreans trying to reach Europe illegally in boats reaching desperate proportions in 2013.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21587844-eritreans-are-taking-seas-because-worsening-conditions-home-why-they Why they leave --  Eritreans are taking to the seas because of worsening conditions at home] 12 October 2013. 
"Some 30,000 people reached Italy illegally in boats in the first nine months of 2013, three times as many as in the whole of 2012, according to [[Frontex]], [...] the largest batch came from Eritrea, a country that has supposedly been at peace for the past 13 years."

The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 41.6%, 55.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 2.5% was 65 years or older.<ref name="WPP 2010">{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm|title=World Population Prospects, the 2012 Revision|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref>

UN  medium variant population projections as of 2010 expected a radically reduced growth rate of 2.0% during the 2020s and of 1.8% during the 2030s.<ref name="WPP 2010"/>
This was corrected as too optimistic an outlook in the 2012 edition, which now expected a more pessimistic, but still declining growth rate of 2.7% during the 2020s (10.3 million in 2030) and of 2.4% during the 2030s (13 million in 2040).<ref>Based on an a-priori assumption of worldwide "convergence towards low fertility". "World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision"[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm], "[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Documentation/pdf/WPP2012_Methodology.pdf Methodology]", p. 15: 
"The 2012 Revision drew on new empirical evidence on fertility levels and trends that became available since the publication of the 2010 Revision. The empirical evidence from available surveys and the 2010 round of censuses has provided the basis for a reassessment of fertility levels and trends experienced within the last decade. In a number of countries, particularly in Africa, slower than
expected fertility declines or even stalled fertility was observed. In some cases, increases in total fertility were also recorded. This led to the decision not to apply the additional adjustment that was used in the 2010 Revision for a small number of countries at the very early  stage of their fertility transition (for example, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Somalia) or that had experienced recent fertility stalling (for example, Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). For these countries, the recent fertility decline has been much slower than typically experienced in the past decades by other countries at similar levels of fertility, and the additional adjustment would have delayed any potential future decline, implying even more population growth than already anticipated with the standard assumption."
