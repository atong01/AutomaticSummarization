== Branches of engineering ==
* [[Aerospace engineering]] &ndash; branch of engineering behind the design, construction and science of aircraft and spacecraft. It is broken into two major and overlapping branches:
** [[Aeronautical engineering]] &ndash; deals with craft that stay within Earth's atmosphere
** [[Astronautical engineering]] &ndash; deals with craft that operates outside of Earth's atmosphere
* [[Applied engineering (field)|Applied engineering]] &ndash; application of management, design, and technical skills for the design and integration of systems, the execution of new product designs, the improvement of manufacturing processes, and the management and direction of physical and/or technical functions of a firm or organization.

* [[Planetary engineering]] / [[Climate engineering]] (Geoengineering) &ndash; planetary engineering is the application of technology for the purpose of influencing the global properties of a planet. The goal of this theoretical task is usually to make other worlds habitable for life. Perhaps the best-known type of planetary engineering is terraforming, by which a planet's surface conditions are altered to be more like those of Earth.

* [[Systems engineering]] &ndash; analysis, design, and control of engineering systems. It focuses on the science and technology of industrial systems. It emphasizes the analysis and design of systems to produce goods and services efficiently.
* [[Textile engineering]] &ndash; application of scientific and engineering principles to the design and control of all aspects of fiber, textile, and apparel processes, products, and machinery. These include natural and man-made materials, interaction of materials with machines, safety and health, energy conservation, and waste and pollution control.
