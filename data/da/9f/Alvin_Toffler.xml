He met his future wife, Adelaide Elizabeth Farrell (now known as Heidi Toffler), at<space/><link><target>New York University</target></link><space/>where he was an English major and she was starting a graduate course in linguistics. Being radical students, they decided against further graduate work, moved to the<space/><link><target>Midwestern United States</target></link>, and married, spending the next five years as blue-collar workers on assembly lines while studying industrial mass production in their daily work. Heidi became a union shop steward in the aluminum foundry where she worked.

The main components of the Second Wave society are<space/><link><target>nuclear family</target></link>, factory-type education system, and the corporation.

According to Toffler, since the late 1950s, most nations have been moving away from a Second Wave Society into what he would call a Third Wave Society, one based on actionable knowledge as a primary resource. His description of this (<link><target>super-industrial society</target></link>) dovetails into other writers' concepts (like the<space/><link><target>Information Age</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Space Age</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Electronic computer</target><part>Electronic</part></link><space/>Era,<space/><link><target>Global village (term)</target><part>Global Village</part></link>,<space/><link><target>technetronic</target></link><space/>age, scientific-technological revolution), which to various degrees predicted demassification, diversity, knowledge-based production, and the acceleration of change (one of Tofflers key maxims is &quot;change is non-linear and can go backwards, forwards and sideways&quot;).</listitem></list><paragraph>In this post-industrial society, there is a wide diversity of<space/><link><target>lifestyle (sociology)</target><part>lifestyles</part></link><space/>(&quot;<link><target>subcultures</target></link>&quot;).<space/><link><target>Adhocracy</target><part>Adhocracies</part></link><space/>(fluid organizations) adapt quickly to changes.
