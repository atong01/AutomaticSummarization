Hazred could come from the Arabic word &quot;Hazrat&quot; meaning Great Lord with a twist that makes it sound like &quot;red&quot; and &quot;hazard&quot; both indicative of danger. It is also thought by some to be a corruption of sorts on the phrase &quot;All has read,&quot; to imply he has read lots, and has immense amounts of knowledge. However Abdul is a common Arabic prefix meaning &quot;Servant&quot; and &quot;Al&quot; is Arabic for &quot;the&quot;, and if &quot;hazra&quot; means &quot;he prohibited&quot;, &quot;he fenced in&quot; or &quot;Great Lord&quot;, then the name would mean &quot;Servant of the Prohibited&quot;, &quot;Servant of the Fenced in&quot;, or &quot;Servant of the Great Lord&quot; which would make sense considering his role, even if it is not a proper Arabic name.</paragraph><paragraph>Similarly, an article<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">April 2013</arg></template><space/>(written from an in-universe perspective) in the<space/><italics><link><target>Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)</target><part>Call of Cthulhu</part></link></italics><space/><link><target>tabletop role-playing game</target></link><space/>speculates that it may be a corruption of<space/><italics>Abd Al-Azrad</italics>, which it claims translates to<space/><italics>The Worshipper of the Great Devourer</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>The phrase &quot;mad Arab&quot;, sometimes with both words capitalized in Lovecraft's stories, is used so commonly before Alhazred's name that it almost constitutes a title.
