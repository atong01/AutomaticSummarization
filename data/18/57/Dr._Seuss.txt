'''Theodor Seuss Geisel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɔɪ|s}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|.|z|əl|audio=En-us-Geisel.ogg}}; March 2, 1904&nbsp;– September 24, 1991) was an American writer and illustrator best known for authoring popular [[children's books]] under the pen name '''Dr. Seuss''' ({{IPAc-en|s|uː|s}}). His work includes several of the most popular children's books of all time, selling over 600 million copies and being translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death.<ref name="Reader">{{Cite journal | title = Unforgettable Dr. Seuss | last= Bernstein |first=Peter W. | publisher = Reader's Digest Australia | year = 1992 | page = 192 | series= Unforgettable | issn= 0034-0375}}</ref>

Geisel adopted his "Dr. Seuss" pseudonym during his university studies at [[Dartmouth College]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and [[cartoonist]] for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and various other publications. He also worked as an illustrator for [[advertising campaign]]s, most notably for [[Flit]] and [[Standard Oil]], and as a [[political cartoon]]ist for the New York newspaper ''[[PM (newspaper)|PM]]''. He published his first children's book ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]'' in 1937. During [[World War II]], he worked in an animation department of the [[United States Army]] where he produced several short films, including ''[[Design for Death]]'', which later won the 1947 [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature]].<ref name=Britannica>[http://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodor-Seuss-Geisel "Theodor Seuss Geisel"] (2015). ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved July 22, 2015.</ref>

After the war, Geisel focused on his children's books, writing classics such as ''[[If I Ran the Zoo]]'' (1950), ''[[Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (1955), ''[[If I Ran the Circus]]'' (1956), ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'' (1957), ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' (1957), and ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'' (1960). He published over 60 books during his career, which have spawned numerous adaptations, including 11 television specials, four feature films, [[Seussical|a Broadway musical]], and four television series. He won the [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]] in 1958 for ''Horton Hatches the Egg'' and again in 1961 for ''And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street''. Geisel's birthday, March 2, has been adopted as the annual date for National [[Read Across America]] Day, an initiative on reading created by the [[National Education Association]].

===College===

Geisel attended [[Dartmouth College]], graduating in 1925.<ref>Minear (1999), p. 9.</ref> At Dartmouth, he joined the [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] [[fraternity]]<ref name="ucdsbio"/> and the humor magazine ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'', eventually rising to the rank of editor-in-chief.<ref name="ucdsbio"/>

While at Dartmouth, he was caught drinking [[gin]] with nine friends in his room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2009-03/Questions.html |title=Impertient Questions |accessdate=June 20, 2009 |last=Nell |first=Phillip |date=March–April 2009 |work=Humanities |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities }}</ref> As a result, Dean [[Craven Laycock]] insisted that he resign from all extracurricular activities, including the college humor magazine.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6rnHjVaTKMMC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=craven+laycock+geisel#v=onepage&q=laycock&f=false |title=Dr. Seuss & Mr. Geisel: a biography |accessdate=September 5, 2010 |last=Morgan |first=Judith|isbn=978-0-306-80736-7|date=August 1996}}</ref> To continue work on the ''Jack-O-Lantern'' without the administration's knowledge, Geisel began signing his work with the pen name "Seuss". He was encouraged in his writing by professor of rhetoric W. Benfield Pressey, whom he described as his "big inspiration for writing" at Dartmouth.<ref name="fensch-man-who-was-seuss">{{cite book | last = Fensch | first = Thomas | title = The Man Who Was Dr. Seuss | publisher = New Century Books | location = Woodlands | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-930751-11-6| page= 38}}</ref>

Upon graduating from Dartmouth, he entered [[Lincoln College, Oxford]] intending to earn a PhD in English literature.<ref name="NYTObit">{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0302.html |title=Dr. Seuss, Modern Mother Goose, Dies at 87 |last=Pace |first=Eric |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=New York City |issn=0362-4331 |date=September 26, 1991 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}</ref> At [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], he met [[Helen Palmer Geisel|Helen Palmer]] who encouraged him to give up becoming an English teacher in favor of pursuing drawing as a career.<ref name="NYTObit"/>

===Early career===
Geisel left Oxford without earning a degree and returned to the United States in February 1927,<ref>Morgan (1995), p. 57</ref> where he immediately began submitting his work to magazines, book publishers, and advertising agencies.<ref>Pease (2010), pp. 41–42</ref> Making use of his time in Europe, he pitched a series of cartoons called ''Eminent Europeans'' to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but they passed on it. His first nationally published cartoon appeared in the July 16, 1927 issue of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.<ref>Cohen (2004), pp. 72–73</ref> This single $25 sale encouraged Geisel to move from Springfield to New York City.

Later that year, Geisel accepted a job as writer and illustrator at the humor magazine ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'', and he felt financially stable enough to marry Helen.<ref>Morgan (1995), pp. 59–62</ref> His first cartoon for ''Judge'' appeared on October 22, 1927, and the Geisels were married on November 29. Geisel's first work signed "Dr. Seuss" was published in ''Judge'' about six months after he started working there.<ref>Cohen (2004), p. 86</ref>

In early 1928, one of Geisel's cartoons for ''Judge'' mentioned [[Flit]], a common bug spray at the time manufactured by [[Esso|Standard Oil of New Jersey]].<ref>Cohen (2004), p. 83</ref> According to Geisel, the wife of an advertising executive in charge of advertising Flit saw Geisel's cartoon at a hairdresser's and urged her husband to sign him.<ref>Morgan (1995), p. 65</ref> Geisel's first Flit ad appeared on May 31, 1928, and the campaign continued sporadically until 1941.<ref>Pease (2010), pp. 48–49</ref> The campaign's catchphrase "Quick, Henry, the Flit!" became a part of popular culture. It spawned a song and was used as a punch line for comedians such as [[Fred Allen]] and [[Jack Benny]]. As Geisel gained notoriety for the Flit campaign, his work was sought after and began to appear regularly in magazines such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Liberty (1924–1950)|Liberty]]'', and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.

Geisel supported himself and his wife through the [[Great Depression]] by drawing advertising for [[General Electric]], [[NBC]], [[Standard Oil]], [[Narragansett Brewing Company]], and many other companies. In 1935, he wrote and drew a short-lived comic strip called ''[[Hejji]]''.<ref name=lambiek-seuss>{{cite web|last=Lambiek Comiclopedia|title=Dr. Seuss|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/s/seuss_dr.htm}}</ref>

The increased income allowed the Geisels to move to better quarters and to socialize in higher social circles.<ref>Pease (2010), p. 49</ref> They became friends with the wealthy family of banker [[Frank A. Vanderlip]]. They also traveled extensively: by 1936, Geisel and his wife had visited 30 countries together. They did not have children, neither kept regular office hours, and they had ample money.<ref>Morgan (1995), p. 79</ref> Geisel also felt that the traveling helped his creativity.

In 1936, the couple were returning from an ocean voyage to Europe when the rhythm of the ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first book: ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thepeel.appstate.edu/fall2010/blog/id/23 |title=Ten Things You May Not Have Known About Dr. Suess |first=Andrew |last=Baker |publisher=The Peel |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref> Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the book was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers.<ref>Nel (2004), pp. 119–121</ref><ref name=lurie>{{cite web|last=Lurie|first=Alison|title=The Cabinet of Dr. Seuss|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BEkB2J-Wb4sC&oi=fnd&pg=PA68&dq=mulberry+street+seuss&ots=kPgJczMI-H&sig=qMKMGGnMF07B11_NGGU4m_0stVs#v=onepage&q=mulberry%20street%20seuss&f=false|work=Popular Culture: An Introductory Text|accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref> According to Geisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by [[Vanguard Press]].<ref>Morgan (1995), pp. 79–85</ref> Geisel wrote four more books before the US entered [[World War II]]. This included ''[[The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins]]'' in 1938, as well as ''[[The King's Stilts]]'' and ''[[The Seven Lady Godivas]]'' in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him. This was followed by ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'' in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.

===Essomarine===

Geisel gained a significant public profile through a program for motor boat lubricants produced by Standard Oil under the brand name Essomarine. He later recounted that [[Harry Bruno]], Ted Cook, and Verne Carrier worked with him for exhibits at the National Motor Boat Show called the Seuss Navy.<ref>EC Lantham, ''Dartmouth Alumni Magazine'', April 1976, p. 20.</ref>

In 1934, Geisel produced a 30-page booklet entitled ''Secrets of the Deep'', which was available by mail after June. At the January [[boat show]] for 1935, visitors filled out order cards to receive ''Secrets''. Geisel drew up a Certificate of Commission for visitors in 1936. A mock ship deck called ''SS Essomarine'' provided the scene where photos of "Admirals" were taken. That summer Geisel released a second volume of ''Secrets''. For the 1937 show, he sculpted Marine Muggs and designed a [[flag]] for the Seuss Navy.

The following year featured "Little Dramas of the Deep", a six-act play with ten characters. According to Geisel's sister, "He plans the whole show with scenery and action and then, standing in a realistic [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]], reels off a speech which combines advertising with humor." For 1939, exhibitors made available the Nuzzlepuss [[ashtray]] and illustrated tide-table calendars.

On January 11, 1940, at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], a Seuss Navy Luncheon was held. At that year's boat show, Geisel provided the Navigamarama exhibit and the ''Sea Lawyers Gazette''.

The final contribution to the Essomarine project, in 1941, was the [[mermaid]] Essie Neptune and her pet whale. The exhibit offered photos for a Happy Cruising passport.<ref>Cohen (2004), p. 122</ref>

===World War II-era work===

[[File:The Goldbrick.ogv|thumb|'The Goldbrick', Private Snafu episode written by Geisel, 1943]]
As [[World War II]] began, Geisel turned to political cartoons, drawing over 400 in two years as editorial cartoonist for the left-leaning New York City daily newspaper, ''[[PM (newspaper)|PM]]''.<ref>[[Richard H. Minear]], ''[[Dr. Seuss Goes to War: The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel]]'' p. 16. ISBN 1-56584-704-0</ref> Geisel's political cartoons, later published in ''[[Dr. Seuss Goes to War]]'', denounced [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and were highly critical of non-interventionists ("isolationists"), most notably [[Charles Lindbergh]], who opposed US entry into the war.<ref name="Goes to War">{{cite book |last=Minear |first=Richard H. |title=[[Dr. Seuss Goes to War|Dr. Seuss Goes to War: The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel]]l|year=1999 |publisher=[[The New Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=1-56584-565-X|page=9}}</ref> One cartoon<ref name=signalpic>{{Cite comic |cartoonist=Dr. Seuss|story=Waiting for the Signal from Home|title=PM|date=February 13, 1942|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dspolitic/pm/1942/20213cs.jpg}}</ref> depicted all [[Japanese Americans]] as latent traitors or [[Fifth column|fifth-columnists]], while at the same time other cartoons deplored the racism at home against [[Jews]] and blacks that harmed the war effort.

In 1942, Geisel turned his energies to direct support of the U.S. war effort. First, he worked drawing posters for the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] and the [[War Production Board]]. Then, in 1943, he joined the [[US Army|Army]] as a [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] and was commander of the Animation Department of the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], where he wrote films that included ''[[Your Job in Germany]]'', a 1945 propaganda film about peace in Europe after World War II; ''[[Our Job in Japan]]'', and the ''[[Private Snafu]]'' series of adult army training films. While in the Army, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref>Morgan (1995), p. 116</ref> ''Our Job in Japan'' became the basis for the commercially released film, ''[[Design for Death]]'' (1947), a study of [[Japanese culture]] that won the [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature]].<ref>Morgan (1995), pp. 119–20</ref> ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (1950), which was based on an original story by Seuss, won the [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film#1950s|Academy Award for Animated Short Film]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Ellin|first=Abby|title=The Return of Gerlad McBoing Boing?|accessdate=22 October 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=2 October 2005}}</ref>

===Later years===

After the war, Geisel and his wife moved to [[La Jolla, San Diego, California|La Jolla, California]]. Returning to children's books, he wrote many works, including such favorites as ''If I Ran the Zoo'', (1950), ''Horton Hears a Who!'' (1955), ''If I Ran the Circus'' (1956), ''The Cat in the Hat'' (1957), ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' (1957) and ''Green Eggs and Ham'' (1960). Although he received numerous awards throughout his career, Geisel won neither the [[Caldecott Medal]] nor the [[Newbery Medal]]. Three of his titles from this period were, however, chosen as Caldecott runners-up (now referred to as Caldecott Honor books): ''[[McElligot's Pool]]'' (1947), ''Bartholomew and the Oobleck'' (1949), and ''If I Ran the Zoo'' (1950). Dr Seuss also wrote the [[musical film|musical]] and [[fantasy film]] ''[[The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T]]'', which was released in 1953. The movie was a critical and financial failure, and Geisel never attempted another feature film. During the 1950s, he also published a number of illustrated short stories, mostly in ''[[Redbook]]'' Magazine. Some of these were later collected (in volumes such as ''The Sneetches and Other Stories'') or reworked into independent books (''If I Ran the Zoo''). A number have never been reprinted since their original appearances.

In May 1954, ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'' magazine published a report on [[illiteracy]] among school children, which concluded that children were not learning to read because their books were boring. Accordingly, William Ellsworth Spaulding, the director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin who later became its chairman, compiled a list of 348 words he felt were important for first-graders to recognize and asked Geisel to cut the list to 250 words and write a book using only those words.<ref name="new yorker 1960">{{cite web |title= Profiles: Children's Friend |last=Kahn, Jr. |first=E.

It retained the drawing style, verse rhythms, and all the imaginative power of Geisel's earlier works, but because of its simplified vocabulary, it could be read by beginning readers. ''The Cat in the Hat'' and subsequent books written for young children achieved significant international success and they remain very popular today. In 2009, ''Green Eggs and Ham'' sold 540,366 copies, ''The Cat in the Hat'' sold 452,258 copies, and ''One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish'' (1960) sold 409,068 copies—outselling the majority of newly published children's books.<ref name="Publishers Weekly 2010">{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/42533-children-s-bestsellers-2009-the-reign-continues.html |title=The Reign Continues |publisher=Publishes Weekly |first=Diane |last=Roback |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref>

Geisel went on to write many other children's books, both in his new simplified-vocabulary manner (sold as [[Beginner Books]]) and in his older, more elaborate style.

In 1956, Dartmouth awarded Geisel with an honorary doctorate. He added the “Dr.” to his penname because his father had always wanted him to practice medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefw.com/things-you-didnt-know-about-dr-seuss/ |title=15 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Dr. Seuss |publisher=Thefw.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>

On October 23, 1967, suffering from a long struggle with illnesses including cancer—as well as emotional pain over her husband's affair with Audrey Stone Dimond—Geisel's wife, Helen Palmer Geisel, committed suicide.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joyce |last=Wadler |title=PUBLIC LIVES; Mrs. Seuss Hears a Who, and Tells About It |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7D7143DF93AA15752C1A9669C8B63 |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=November 29, 2000 |accessdate=May 28, 2008}}</ref> Geisel married Dimond on June 21, 1968. Though he devoted most of his life to writing children's books, Geisel had no children of his own. He would say, when asked about this, "You have 'em; I'll entertain 'em."

Geisel received the [[Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal]] from the [[Association for Library Service to Children|professional children's librarians]] in 1980, recognizing his "substantial and lasting contributions to children's literature". At the time it was awarded every five years.<ref name=wilder>

==Illness, death and posthumous honors==

Geisel died of [[oral cancer]] on September 24, 1991, at his home in La Jolla at the age of 87.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0302.html|title=Dr. Seuss, Modern Mother Goose, Dies at 87|date=September 26, 1991|last=Pace|first=Eric|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 2, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-26/news/mn-3873_1_seuss-books|title= Theodor Geisel Dies at 87; Wrote 47 Dr. Seuss Books, Author: His last new work, 'Oh, the Places You'll Go!' has proved popular with executives as well as children|last=Gorman|first=Tom|author2=Miles Corwin|date=September 26, 1991|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 2, 2012}}</ref> He was cremated and his ashes were scattered. On December 1, 1995, four years after his death, [[University of California, San Diego]]'s University Library Building was renamed [[Geisel Library]] in honor of Geisel and Audrey for the generous contributions they made to the library and their devotion to improving literacy.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Geisel Library Building|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/about/us/geisel-building.html|publisher=UC San Diego|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref>

While Geisel was living in La Jolla, the [[United States Postal Service]] and others frequently confused him with another La Jolla resident, [[Hans Suess|Dr. Hans Suess]]. Their names have been linked together posthumously: the personal papers of Hans Suess are housed in the Geisel Library.<ref>{{cite web|title=Register of Hans Suess Papers 1875 – 1989|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/testing/html/mss0199a.html|publisher=UC San Diego|accessdate=April 10, 2012|author=Mandeville Special Collections Library}}</ref>

In 2002, the [[Dr. Seuss Memorial|Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden]] opened in his birthplace of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]; it features sculptures of Geisel and of many of his characters. On May 28, 2008, California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and First Lady [[Maria Shriver]] announced that Geisel would be inducted into the [[California Hall of Fame]], located at [[The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts]]. The induction ceremony took place December 15 and his widow Audrey accepted the honor in his place. On March 2, 2009, the [[web search engine]] [[Google]] temporarily changed its [[Google logo|logo]] to commemorate Geisel's birthday (a practice it often follows for various holidays and events).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogoscoped.com/forum/151165.html |title=Google Holiday Logos |publisher=Google |year=2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2010 }}</ref>

In 2004, U.S. children's librarians established the annual [[Theodor Seuss Geisel Award]] to recognize "the most distinguished American book for beginning readers published in English in the United States during the preceding year". It should "demonstrate creativity and imagination to engage children in reading" during years [[pre-K]] to [[grade two]].<ref>[http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/geiselaward "Welcome to the (Theodor Seuss) Geisel Award home page!"].

At his alma mater, Dartmouth, where over 90% of incoming first-year students participate in pre-registration [[Dartmouth Outing Club]] trips into the New Hampshire wilderness, it is traditional for students returning from the trips to overnight at Dartmouth's [[Moosilauke Ravine Lodge]], where they are served green eggs and ham for breakfast in honor of Dr. Seuss. On April 4, 2012, the [[Dartmouth Medical School]] renamed itself the Audrey and Theodor Geisel School of Medicine in honor of their many years of generosity to the college.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dartmouth Names Medical School in Honor of Audrey and Theodor Geisel|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/news/2012/04/04_geisel.shtml|accessdate=April 9, 2012|newspaper=Geisel School of Medicine|date=April 4, 2012}}</ref>

Dr. Seuss's honors include two Academy awards, two Emmy awards, a Peabody award, the [[Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal]], and the Pulitzer Prize.

Dr. Seuss has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], at the 6500 block of [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/dr-seuss/ |title=Dr. Seuss – Hollywood Star Walk |first=Miles |last=Corwin |first2=Tom |last2=Gorman |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=September 26, 1991 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref>

==Pen names and pronunciations==

Geisel's most famous pen name is regularly pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|(j)|uː|s}}, an [[anglicize]]d pronunciation inconsistent with his German surname (the standard German pronunciation is {{IPA-de|ˈzɔʏ̯s|}}). He himself noted that it rhymed with "voice" (his own pronunciation being {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɔɪ|s}}). Alexander Liang, one of his collaborators on the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'', wrote of it:

:You're wrong as the deuce
:And you shouldn't rejoice
:If you're calling him Seuss.
:He pronounces it Soice<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.anapsid.org/aboutmk/seuss.html |title=Theodor Seuss Geisel: Author Study |last=Kaplan |first=Melissa |work=anapsid.org |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}} ([http://www.anapsid.org/pdf/seuss.pdf Source in PDF].)</ref> (or Zoice)<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Author, Dr. Seuss, Seussville|url=http://www.seussville.com/?home#/author|location=Biography|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}</ref>

Geisel switched to the anglicized pronunciation because it "evoked a figure advantageous for an author of children's books to be associated with—[[Mother Goose]]"<ref name="new yorker 2002"/> and because most people used this pronunciation.

For books that Geisel wrote and others illustrated, he used the pen name "Theo LeSieg", starting with ''[[I Wish That I Had Duck Feet]]'', published in 1965. "LeSieg" is "Geisel" spelled backward.<ref>Morgan (1995), p. 219</ref>

Geisel also published one book, 1975's ''Because a Little Bug Went Ka-Choo!!'', a collaboration with [[Michael K. Frith]], under the name Rosetta Stone.  Frith and Geisel chose the name in honor of Geisel's second wife, Audrey, whose maiden name was Stone.<ref>Morgan (1995), p. 218</ref>

==Political views==

{{main|Political messages of Dr. Seuss}}
Geisel was a liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and a supporter of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[New Deal]]. His early political cartoons show a passionate opposition to fascism, and he urged action against it both before and after the United States entered World War II. His cartoons portrayed the fear of communism as overstated, finding greater threats in the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and those who threatened to cut the US "life line"<ref name=LifeLine /> to Stalin and the USSR, whom he once depicted as a [[Porter (carrier)|porter]] carrying "our war load".<ref name="OurWarLoad"/>

Geisel supported the [[Japanese American internment]] during [[World War II]]. His treatment of the Japanese and of Japanese Americans, between whom he often failed to differentiate, has struck many readers as a moral blind spot.<ref>[http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/1aa/1aa291.htm The Political Dr. Seuss] Springfield Library and Museums Association</ref> On the issue of the Japanese, he is quoted as saying:

{{quote|But right now, when the Japs are planting their hatchets in our skulls, it seems like a hell of a time for us to smile and warble: "Brothers!" It is a rather flabby battle cry. If we want to win, we've got to kill Japs, whether it depresses [[John Haynes Holmes]] or not. We can get palsy-walsy afterward with those that are left. |Theodor Geisel|quoted in ''[[Dr. Seuss Goes to War]]'' by Richard H. Minear<ref>Minear (1999), p. 184.</ref> }}

After the war, though, Geisel overcame his feelings of animosity, using his book ''[[Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (1954) as an [[allegory]] for the Hiroshima bombing and the American post-war [[occupation of Japan]], as well as dedicating the book to a Japanese friend.<ref name="hayley">{{cite web |title=Interview with filmmaker Ron Lamothe about ''The Political Dr. Seuss'' |url=http://www.mfh.org/lamotheinterview/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070916044241/http://www.mfh.org/lamotheinterview/ |author=Wood, Hayley and Ron Lamothe (interview) |work=MassHumanities eNews |publisher=Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities |date=August 2004 |archivedate=September 16, 2007 |accessdate=September 16, 2008 }}</ref>

In 1948, after living and working in Hollywood for years, Geisel moved to La Jolla, California, a predominantly Republican town.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lamothe|first=Ron|title=PBS Independent Lens: The Political Dr. Seuss|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55093-2004Oct22.html|accessdate=April 10, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 27, 2004}}</ref>

Shortly before the end of the 1972–74 [[Watergate scandal]], in which [[President of the United States|United States president]] [[Richard Nixon]] resigned, Geisel converted a copy of one of his famous children's books into a [[polemic]] by replacing the name of the main character everywhere it occurred.<ref name=Buchwald /> "[[Richard M. Nixon, Will You Please Go Now!]]" was published in major newspapers through the [[newspaper column|column]] of his friend [[Art Buchwald]].<ref name=Buchwald>{{cite news |first=Art |last=Buchwald |authorlink=Art Buchwald |title=Richard M.

The line "A person's a person, no matter ''how'' small!!" from ''Horton Hears a Who!'' has been used widely as a slogan by the [[pro-life]] movement in the U.S., despite the objections of Geisel's widow. In 1986, when the line was first used in such a way, he demanded a retraction and received one.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ieon3t-fSQ |title=Dr Seuss: Rhymes and Reasons (2003 documentary) Part 9 of 9 |publisher=YouTube |date=September 24, 2008 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88189147 |title=In 'Horton' Movie, Abortion Foes Hear an Ally |first=Kim |last=Masters |publisher=NPR |date=March 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref>

===In his books===

Though Geisel made a point of not beginning the writing of his stories with a moral in mind, stating that "kids can see a moral coming a mile off", he was not against writing about issues; he said that "there's an inherent moral in any story",<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bunzel |first=Peter |date=April 6, 1959 |title=The Wacky World of Dr. Seuss Delights the Child—and Adult—Readers of His Books |journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] | volume=| issue= | pages= | publisher=Time Inc. | location=Chicago | issn=0024-3019 | pmid = | doi = | bibcode = | oclc =1643958 | accessdate = | quote =Most of Geisel's books point a moral, though he insists he never starts with one. 'Kids,' he says, 'can see a moral coming a mile off and they gag at it. But there's an inherent moral in any story.'&nbsp; }}</ref> and he remarked that he was "subversive as hell".<ref>{{cite book |last=Cott |first=Jonathan |title=Pipers at the Gates of Dawn: The Wisdom of Children's Literature |edition=Reprint |year=1984 |publisher=[[Random House]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-394-50464-3 |oclc=8728388 |chapter=The Good Dr. Seuss}}</ref>

Many of Geisel's books express his views on a remarkable variety of social and political issues: ''[[The Lorax]]'' (1971), about environmentalism and [[anti-consumerism]]; "[[The Sneetches and Other Stories|The Sneetches]]" (1961), about [[racial equality]]; ''[[The Butter Battle Book]]'' (1984), about the [[arms race]]; ''[[Yertle the Turtle]]'' (1958), about [[Hitler]] and [[anti-authoritarianism]]; ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' (1957), criticizing the [[materialism]] and [[consumerism]] of the Christmas season; and ''[[Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (1954), about anti-[[isolationism]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]].<ref name="new yorker 2002"/><ref name="hayley" />

==Poetic meters== <!-- This section is linked from [[The Cat in the Hat]] -->

Geisel wrote most of his books in [[anapestic tetrameter]], a [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] employed by many poets of the English literary canon. This is often suggested as one of the reasons that Geisel's writing was so well received.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mensch |first1=Betty |last2=Freeman |first2=Alan |title=Getting to Solla Sollew: The Existentialist Politics of Dr. Seuss |year=1987 |work=[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]] |page=30 |quote=In opposition to the conventional—indeed, hegemonic—iambic voice, his metric triplets offer the power of a more primal chant that quickly draws the reader in with relentless repetition.}}</ref><ref name="of-sneetches">{{cite book |editor-last=Fensch |editor-first=Thomas |title=Of Sneetches and Whos and the Good Dr. Seuss |year=1997 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina]] |isbn=0-7864-0388-8 |oclc= 37418407}}</ref>

Anapestic tetrameter consists of four rhythmic units, [[anapest]]s, each composed of two weak syllables followed by one strong syllable (the beat); often, the first weak syllable is omitted, or an additional weak syllable is added at the end. An example of this meter can be found in Geisel's "Yertle the Turtle", from ''[[Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories]]'':

:"And to'''day''' the Great '''Yer'''tle, that '''Mar'''velous '''he'''
:Is '''King''' of the '''Mud'''. That is '''all''' he can '''see'''."<ref>{{cite book |title=Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories |author=Dr. Seuss |year=1958 |publisher=[[Random House]] |oclc=18181636 |pages= }}</ref>

Some books by Geisel that are written mainly in anapestic tetrameter also contain many lines written in [[amphibrach|amphibrachic tetrameter]], such as these from ''If I Ran the Circus'':

:"All '''rea'''dy to '''put''' up the '''tents''' for my '''cir'''cus.
:I '''think''' I will '''call''' it the '''Cir'''cus Mc'''Gur'''kus.

:"And '''NOW''' comes an '''act''' of E'''nor'''mous E'''nor'''mance!
:No '''for'''mer per'''for'''mer's per'''formed''' this per'''for'''mance!"

Geisel also wrote verse in [[trochaic tetrameter]], an arrangement of a strong syllable followed by a weak syllable, with four units per line (for example, the title of ''[[One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish|'''One''' Fish '''Two''' Fish '''Red''' Fish '''Blue''' Fish]]''). Traditionally, English trochaic meter permits the final weak position in the line to be omitted, which allows both masculine and feminine rhymes.

Geisel generally maintained trochaic meter for only brief passages, and for longer stretches typically mixed it with [[iambic tetrameter]], which consists of a weak syllable followed by a strong, and is generally considered easier to write. Thus, for example, the magicians in ''[[Bartholomew and the Oobleck]]'' make their first appearance chanting in [[trochee]]s (thus resembling the witches of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Macbeth]]''):

:"'''Shuff'''le, '''duff'''le, '''muzz'''le, '''muff'''"

then switch to [[iamb (foot)|iamb]]s for the oobleck spell:

:"Go '''make''' the '''Oob'''leck '''tum'''ble '''down'''
:On '''ev'''ery '''street''', in '''ev'''ery '''town'''!"<ref>{{cite book |title=Bartholomew and the Oobleck |author=Dr. Seuss |year=1949 |publisher=[[Random House]] |oclc=391115 |pages= }}</ref>

==Artwork==

[[File:Ted Geisel NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|At work on a drawing of [[The Grinch]] for ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'', in 1957]]

Geisel's earlier artwork often employed the shaded texture of pencil drawings or [[watercolor]]s, but in children's books of the postwar period, he generally employed the starker medium of pen and ink, normally using just black, white, and one or two colors. Later books such as ''[[The Lorax]]'' used more colors.

Geisel's figures are often rounded and somewhat droopy. This is true, for instance, of the faces of the Grinch and of the [[Cat in the Hat]]. Almost all the buildings and machinery that Geisel drew were devoid of straight lines, even when he was representing real objects. For example, ''If I Ran the Circus'' includes a droopy hoisting crane and a droopy [[steam calliope]].

Geisel evidently enjoyed drawing architecturally elaborate objects. His endlessly varied (but never rectilinear) palaces, ramps, platforms, and free-standing stairways are among his most evocative creations. Geisel also drew complex imaginary machines, such as the Audio-Telly-O-Tally-O-Count, from ''[[Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book]]'', or the "most peculiar machine" of Sylvester McMonkey McBean in ''[[The Sneetches]]''. Geisel also liked drawing outlandish arrangements of feathers or fur, for example, the 500th hat of ''Bartholomew Cubbins'', the tail of ''Gertrude McFuzz'', and the pet for girls who like to brush and comb, in ''[[One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish|One Fish Two Fish]]''.

Geisel's images often convey motion vividly. He was fond of a sort of ''voilà'' gesture, in which the hand flips outward, spreading the fingers slightly backward with the thumb up; this is done by Ish, for instance, in ''[[One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish|One Fish Two Fish]]'' when he creates fish (who perform the gesture themselves with their fins), in the introduction of the various acts of ''If I Ran the Circus'', and in the introduction of the Little Cats in ''[[The Cat in the Hat|The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]''. He was also fond of drawing hands with interlocked fingers, which looked as though the characters were twiddling their thumbs.

Geisel also follows the cartoon tradition of showing [[motion lines|motion with lines]], for instance in the sweeping lines that accompany Sneelock's final dive in ''If I Ran the Circus''. Cartoonists' lines are also used to illustrate the action of the senses (sight, smell, and hearing) in ''The Big Brag'' and even of thought, as in the moment when the Grinch conceives his awful idea.

===Recurring images===

Geisel's early work in advertising and editorial cartooning produced sketches that received more perfect realization later in the children's books. Often, the expressive use to which Geisel put an image later on was quite different from the original.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mandeville Special Collections Library, UC San Diego|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/seusscoll.html|publisher=UC San Diego|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref>

This was later rendered (with no apparent political content) as the Wumbus of ''On Beyond Zebra'' (1955). Seussian whales (cheerful and balloon-shaped, with long eyelashes) also occur in ''McElligot's Pool'', ''If I Ran the Circus'', and other books.
* Another editorial cartoon from 1941<ref name=milked-pic>{{Cite comic|cartoonist=Dr. Seuss|story=The head eats.. the rest gets milked|title=PM|date=May 19, 1941|url= http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dspolitic/pm/10519cs.jpg}}</ref> shows a long cow with many legs and udders representing the conquered nations of Europe being milked by [[Adolf Hitler]].

This theme also appeared in a ''Judge'' cartoon as one letter of a hieroglyphic message, and in Geisel's short-lived comic strip ''[[Hejji]]''. Geisel once stated that Yertle the Turtle '''''was''''' Adolf Hitler.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Chuck|title=Serious Seuss: Children's author as political cartoonist|url=http://edition.cnn.com/books/news/9910/17/dr.seuss.war/index.html|accessdate=April 9, 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=October 17, 1999}}</ref>
* Little cats A B and C (as well as the rest of the alphabet) who spring from each other's hats appeared in a [[Ford]] ad.
* The connected beards in ''Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?'' appear frequently in Geisel's work, most notably in ''Hejji'', which featured two goats joined at the beard, ''The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T'', which featured two roller-skating guards joined at the beard, and a political cartoon in which [[Nazism]] and the [[America First Committee|America First movement]] are portrayed as "the men with the Siamese Beard".
* Geisel's earliest elephants were for advertising and had somewhat wrinkly ears, much as real elephants do.<ref name=popgun-pic>{{cite web|last=Geisel|first=Theodor|title=You can't kill an elephant with a pop gun!|publisher=L.P.C.Co|url= http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dsads/bizpostcards/postcardD101.shtml}}</ref> With ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]!'' (1937) and ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'' (1940), the ears became more stylized, somewhat like [[angel]] wings and thus appropriate to the saintly Horton. During World War II, the elephant image appeared as an emblem for India in four editorial cartoons.<ref name=india>{{cite web|last=Geisel |first=Theodor |title=India List|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dspolitic/India.html}}</ref> Horton and similar elephants appear frequently in the postwar children's books.
* While drawing advertisements for [[Flit]], Geisel became adept at drawing insects with huge stingers,<ref name=flit>{{cite web|last=Geisel |first=Theordor |title=Flit kills!|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dsads/flit/flit.jpg}}</ref> shaped like a gentle S-curve and with a sharp end that included a rearward-pointing barb on its lower side. Their facial expressions depict gleeful malevolence. These insects were later rendered in an editorial cartoon as a swarm of Allied aircraft<ref name=pullwings-pic>{{Cite comic|cartoonist=Theodor Geisel|story=Try and pull the wings off these butterflies, Benito!|title=PM|date=November 11, 1942|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dspolitic/pm/1942/21111cs.jpg}}</ref> (1942), and again as the Sneedle of ''On Beyond Zebra'', and yet again as the Skritz in ''[[I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew]]''.
* There are many examples of creatures who arrange themselves in repeating patterns, such as the "Two and fro walkers, who march in five layers", and the Through-Horns Jumping Deer in ''[[If I Ran the Circus]]'', and the arrangement of birds which the protagonist of ''[[Oh, the Places You'll Go!]]'' walks through, as the narrator admonishes him to "...&nbsp;always be dexterous and deft, and never mix up your right foot with your left."

==Publications==
{{further2|[[Dr. Seuss bibliography]]}}
Over the course of his long career, Geisel wrote over 60 books. Though most were published under his well-known pseudonym, Dr. Seuss, he also authored over a dozen books as Theo LeSieg and one as Rosetta Stone. His books have topped many bestseller lists, sold over 600 million copies, and been translated into more than 20 languages.<ref name="Reader"/>In 2000, ''Publishers Weekly'' compiled a list of the [[best selling books|best-selling children's books]] of all time; of the top 100 hardcover books, 16 were written by Geisel, including ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'', at number 4, ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'', at number 9, and ''[[One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish]]'', at number 13.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20011217/28595-all-time-bestselling-children-s-books-.html |title= All-Time Bestselling Children's Books |accessdate=March 23, 2011 |last=Turvey |first=Debbie Hochman  |date=December 17, 2001 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |publisher=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xPijjVXq |archivedate=March 23, 2011}}</ref> In the years after his death in 1991, two additional books were published based on his sketches and notes: ''[[Hooray for Diffendoofer Day!]]'' and ''[[Daisy-Head Mayzie]]''. ''[[My Many Colored Days]]'', originally written in 1973, was posthumously published in 1996. In September 2011, seven stories originally published in magazines during the 1950s were released in a collection entitled ''[[The Bippolo Seed and Other Lost Stories]]''.<ref name=pw>{{cite web|title=Random Uncovers 'New' Seuss Stories|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/46659-random-uncovers-new-seuss-stories.html|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref>

Geisel also wrote a pair of books for adults: ''[[The Seven Lady Godivas]]'' (1939; reprinted 1987), a retelling of the [[Lady Godiva]] legend that included nude depictions; and ''[[You're Only Old Once!]]'' (written in 1986 when Geisel was 82), which chronicles an [[Old age|old man]]'s journey through a clinic. His last book, published the year before his death, was ''[[Oh, the Places You'll Go!]]'', which became a popular gift for graduating students.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2007-05-16-book-buzz_N.htm |title=Book buzz: Dave Barry really rocks |last1=Blais |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Memmott |first2=Carol |last3=Minzesheimer |first3=Bob |publisher=[[USA Today]] |newspaper=USA Today |date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}</ref>

==Adaptations==

[[File:Seuss Landing.jpg|thumb|right|[[Seuss Landing]] at [[Islands of Adventure]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]]]
For most of his career, Geisel was reluctant to have his characters marketed in contexts outside of his own books. However, he did allow for the creation of several animated cartoons, an art form in which he himself had gained experience during the [[Second World War]], and gradually relaxed his policy as he aged.

The first adaptation of one of Geisel's works was a cartoon version of ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'', animated at [[Warner Bros.]] in 1942. Directed by [[Robert Clampett]], it was presented as part of the [[Merrie Melodies]] series, and included a number of gags not present in the original narrative, including a fish committing suicide and a [[Katharine Hepburn]] imitation by Mayzie.

In 1959, Geisel authorized [[Revell]], the well-known plastic-model-making company, to make a series of "animals" that snapped together rather than being glued together, and could be assembled, disassembled and re-assembled "in thousands" of ways. The series was called the "Dr. Seuss Zoo" and included Gowdy the Dowdy Grackle, Norval the Bashful Blinket, Tingo the Noodle Topped Stroodle and Roscoe the Many Footed Lion. The basic body parts were the same and all were interchangeable, and so it was possible for children to combine parts from various characters in essentially unlimited ways in creating their own animal characters (Revell encouraged this by selling Gowdy, Norval and Tingo together in a "Gift Set" as well as individually). Revell also made a conventional glue-together "beginner's kit" of The Cat in the Hat.

In 1966, Geisel authorized the eminent cartoon artist [[Chuck Jones]] – his friend and former colleague from the war – to make a cartoon version of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]''; Geisel was credited as a co-producer, along with Jones, under his real name, "Ted Geisel". The cartoon, narrated by [[Boris Karloff]], who also provided the voice of the Grinch, was very faithful to the original book, and is considered a classic by many to this day; it is often broadcast as an annual [[Christmas television special]]. Jones directed an adaptation of ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' in 1970, and produced an adaptation of ''[[The Cat in the Hat (TV special)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' in 1971.

From 1972 to 1983, Geisel wrote six animated specials, which were produced by [[DePatie-Freleng]]: ''[[The Lorax (TV special)|The Lorax]]'' (1972); ''[[Dr. Seuss on the Loose]]'' (1973); ''[[The Hoober-Bloob Highway]]'' (1975); ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]'' (1977); ''[[Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You?]]'' (1980); and ''[[The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat]]'' (1982). Several of the specials were nominated for and won multiple [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] Awards.

A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Paint-on-glass animation|paint-on-glass-animated]] short film called ''[[Welcome (1986 film)|Welcome]]'' (an adaptation of ''Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose'') was made in 1986. The last adaptation of Geisel's works before he died was ''[[The Butter Battle Book]]'', a television special based on the book of the same name, directed by adult animation legend [[Ralph Bakshi]].

A television film titled ''[[In Search of Dr. Seuss]]'', released in 1994, adapted many of Seuss's stories. It uses both live-action versions and animated versions of the characters and stories featured; however, the animated portions were merely edited (and, in some cases, re-dubbed as well) versions of previous animated television specials.

After Geisel died of cancer at the age of 87 in 1991, his widow Audrey Geisel was placed in charge of all licensing matters. She approved a live-action feature-film version of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' starring [[Jim Carrey]], as well as a Seuss-themed [[Broadway theater|Broadway musical]] called ''[[Seussical]]'', and both premiered in 2000. ''The Grinch'' has had limited engagement runs on Broadway during the Christmas season, after premiering in 1998 (under the title ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas'') at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in San Diego, where it has become a Christmas tradition. In 2003, another live-action film was released, this time an adaptation of ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' that featured [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] as the title character. Audrey Geisel has spoken critically of the film, especially the casting of Myers as the Cat in the Hat, and stated that she would not allow any further live-action adaptations of Geisel's books.<ref>[[Associated Press]] (February 26, 2004). [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4362025/ Seussentenial: 100 years of Dr. Seuss]. [[msnbc.com]]. Retrieved on April 6, 2008.</ref> However, an animated [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] feature film adaptation of ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' was approved, and was eventually released on March 14, 2008, to critical acclaim.  A CGI-animated feature film adaptation of ''[[The Lorax (film)|The Lorax]]'' was released by [[Universal Studios|Universal]] on March 2, 2012 (on what would have been the 108th birthday of Seuss).

Four television series have been adapted from Geisel's work. The first, ''Gerald McBoing-Boing'', was an animated television adaptation of Geisel's 1951 cartoon [[Gerald McBoing-Boing|of the same name]] and lasted three months between 1956 and 1957. The second, ''[[The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss]]'', was a mix of live-action and puppetry by [[Jim Henson Television]], the producers of [[The Muppets]]. It aired for one season on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States, from 1996 to 1997. The third, ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing (TV series)|Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'', is a remake of the 1956 series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/arts/television/02elli.html |title=The Return of&nbsp;...

The fourth, ''[[The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!]]'', produced by Portfolio Entertainment Inc., began on August 7, 2010, in Canada and September 6, 2010, in the United States and is currently still showing.

Geisel's books and characters are also featured in [[Seuss Landing]], one of many islands at the [[Islands of Adventure]] [[theme park]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. In an attempt to match Geisel's visual style, there are reportedly "no straight lines" in Seuss Landing.<ref>Universal Orlando.com.

''The [[Hollywood Reporter]]'' has reported that [[Johnny Depp]] has agreed to produce and possibly star in a film based on Geisel's life. The film will be written by [[Keith Bunin]], produced by Depp's [[Infinitum Nihil]] production company alongside [[Illumination Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/johnny-depp-dr-seuss-universal-illumination-245072 |title=Johnny Depp to Become Dr. Seuss for Illumination and Universal (exclusive) |first1=Borys |last1=Kit |first2=Jay A. |last2=Fernandez |date=October 5, 2011 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |publisher=Prometheus Global Media, LLC }}</ref>
