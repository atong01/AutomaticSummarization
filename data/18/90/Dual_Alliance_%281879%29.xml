Also, each state promised<space/><link><target>benevolent neutrality</target></link><space/>to the other if one of them was attacked by another European power (generally taken to be<space/><link><target>French Third Republic</target><part>France</part></link>, even more so after the<space/><link><target>Franco-Russian Alliance</target></link><space/>of 1894).</paragraph><paragraph>When Austria-Hungary and Germany formed an alliance in 1879, it was one of the more surprising alliances of its time. Though German was spoken in each realm, sharing the same language and culture more often than not pushed Austria-Hungary and Germany apart, most notably in the recent<space/><link><target>Austro-Prussian War</target></link>. Additionally, the Habsburg rulers of Austria believed that the promotion of nationalism, which was favored by Germany, would destroy their empire. However, their common dislike for Russia brought the two nations together for a common cause.<extension extension_name='ref'>Martel, Gordon.<space/><italics>The Origins of the First World War</italics>.

In 1878,<space/><link><target>Russian Empire</target><part>Russia</part></link><space/>defeated the<space/><link><target>Ottoman Empire</target></link><space/>in the<space/><link><target>Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878</target><part>Russo-Turkish War</part></link>; the resulting<space/><link><target>Treaty of San Stefano</target></link><space/>gave Russia considerable influence in the<space/><link><target>Balkans</target></link>. This development outraged Austria-Hungary, who was Russia's chief competitor for influence in the Balkan region (despite being an ally of the Russians and the Germans in the<space/><link><target>Three Emperors' League</target></link>). Hence, in 1878, Bismarck called an international conference (the<space/><link><target>Congress of Berlin</target></link>) in order to sort out the problem. The<space/><link><target>Treaty of Berlin, 1878</target><part>Treaty of Berlin</part></link><space/>that resulted from the conference reversed Russia's gains from the Treaty of San Stefano and provided the Austrians with compensation in the form of<space/><link><target>Vilayet of Bosnia</target><part>Bosnia</part></link>. Despite Bismarck's attempts to play the role of an &quot;honest broker&quot; at the Congress of Berlin, Russo-German relations deteriorated following the conference. The Three Emperors' League was discontinued, and Germany and Austria-Hungary were free to ally with one another against Russia.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1881,<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Italy (18611946)</target><part>Italy</part></link><space/>lost in the competition with France to establish a colony in<space/><italics>Tunis</italics><space/>(present-day<space/><link><target>Tunisia</target></link>).

In 1915, she joined the Entente powers and declared war on Austria-Hungary, and later Germany in the subsequent year. The Dual Alliance persisted throughout the war and ended with their defeats in 1918.</paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><extension extension_name='references'></extension></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Great power diplomacy</target></template><link><target>Category:1879 in Austria-Hungary</target></link><link><target>Category:Military alliances involving Austria-Hungary</target></link><link><target>Category:19th-century military alliances</target></link><link><target>Category:1879 treaties</target></link><link><target>Category:Military alliances involving the German Empire</target></link><link><target>Category:1879 in Germany</target></link><link><target>Category:AustriaGermany relations</target></link></paragraph></article>
