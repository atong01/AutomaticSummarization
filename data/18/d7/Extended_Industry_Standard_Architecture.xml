The<space/><link><target>IBM Personal Computer/AT</target><part>PC/AT</part></link>, introduced in 1984, had three 8-bit slots and five 16-bit slots, all running at the system clock speed of 6&amp;nbsp;MHz in the earlier models and 8&amp;nbsp;MHz in the last version of the computer. The 16-bit slots were a superset of the 8-bit configuration, so<space/><italics>most</italics><space/>8-bit cards were able to plug into a 16-bit slot (some cards used a &quot;skirt&quot; design that physically interfered with the extended portion of the slot) and continue to run in 8-bit mode. One of the key reasons for the success of the IBM PC (and the PC clones that followed it) was the active ecosystem of third-party expansion cards available for the machines. IBM was restricted from patenting the bus, and widely published the bus specifications.</paragraph><paragraph>As the PC-clone industry continued to build momentum in the mid- to late-1980s, several problems with the bus began to be apparent. First, because the &quot;AT slot&quot; (as it was known at the time) was not managed by any central standards group, there was nothing to prevent a manufacturer from &quot;pushing&quot; the standard. One of the most common issues was that as PC clones became more common, PC manufacturers began ratcheting up the processor speed to maintain a competitive advantage. Unfortunately, because the ISA bus was originally locked to the processor clock, this meant that some 286 machines had ISA buses that ran at 10, 12, or even 16&amp;nbsp;MHz. In fact, the first system to clock the ISA bus at 8&amp;nbsp;MHz was the turbo 8088 clones that clocked the processors at 8&amp;nbsp;MHz. This caused many issues with incompatibility, where a true IBM-compatible third-party card (designed for an 8&amp;nbsp;MHz or 4.77&amp;nbsp;MHz bus) might not work in a higher speed system (or even worse, would work unreliably). Most PC makers eventually decoupled the slot clock from the system clock, but there was still no standards body to &quot;police&quot; the industry.</paragraph><paragraph>As companies like<space/><link><target>Dell</target></link><space/>modified the AT bus design,<extension extension_name='ref' name="lewis19880424"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/24/business/the-executive-computer-introducing-the-first-ps-2-clones.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Introducing the First PS/2 Clones<space/></arg><arg name="work">The New York Times<space/></arg><arg name="date">1988-04-24<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">6 January 2015<space/></arg><arg name="author">Lewis, Peter H.</arg></template></extension><space/>the architecture was so well entrenched that no single clone manufacturer had the leverage to create a standardized alternative, and there was no compelling reason for them to cooperate on a new standard. Because of this, when the first<space/><link><target>Intel 80386</target><part>386</part></link>-based system (the<space/><link><target>Compaq Deskpro</target></link><space/>386) hit the market in 1986, it still supported 16-bit slots. Other 386 PCs followed suit, and the AT (later ISA) bus remained a part of most systems even into the late 1990s. Some of the 386 systems had proprietary 32-bit extensions to the ISA bus.</paragraph><paragraph>Meanwhile, IBM began to worry that it was losing control of the industry it had created. In 1987, IBM released the<space/><link><target>IBM Personal System/2</target><part>PS/2</part></link><space/>line of computers, which included the<space/><link><target>Micro Channel architecture</target><part>MCA</part></link><space/>bus.

However, in an effort to reassert its dominant role, IBM patented the bus, and placed stringent licensing and royalty policies on its use. A few manufacturers did produce licensed MCA machines (most notably<space/><link><target>NCR Corporation</target><part>NCR</part></link>), but overall the industry balked at IBM's restrictions.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Steve Gibson (computer programmer)</target><part>Steve Gibson</part></link><space/>proposed that clone makers adopt<space/><link><target>NuBus</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="lemmons198708"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1987-08/1987_08_BYTE_12-09_Prolog_and_386_Hardware_Software#page/n9/mode/2up<space/></arg><arg name="title">Editorial<space/></arg><arg name="work">BYTE<space/></arg><arg name="date">August 1987<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">6 November 2013<space/></arg><arg name="author">Lemmons, Phil<space/></arg><arg name="pages">6</arg></template></extension><space/>Instead. a group (the &quot;Gang of Nine&quot;), led by Compaq, created a new bus, which was named the Extended (or Enhanced) Industry Standard Architecture, or &quot;EISA&quot;.

Every EISA system shipped with an EISA configuration utility; this was usually a slightly customized version of the standard utilities written by the EISA chipset makers.

Many manufacturers, including those in the &quot;Gang of Nine&quot;, researched the possibility of using MCA. For example, Compaq actually produced prototype DeskPro systems using the bus. However, these were never put into production, and when it was clear that MCA had lost, Compaq allowed its MCA license to expire (the license actually cost relatively little; the primary costs associated with MCA, and at which the industry revolted, were royalties to be paid per system shipped).</paragraph><preblock><preline></preline></preblock><paragraph>On the other hand, when it became clear to IBM that Micro Channel was dying, IBM actually licensed EISA for use in a few server systems. As a final jab at their competitor, Compaq (leader of the EISA consortium) didn't cash the first check sent by IBM for the EISA license. Instead, the check was framed and put on display in the company museum at Compaq's main campus in Houston, Texas.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">January 2012</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><paragraph><template><target>div col</target><arg name="colwidth">20em</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Industry Standard Architecture</target></link><space/>(ISA)</listitem><listitem><link><target>Micro Channel architecture</target></link><space/>(MCA)</listitem><listitem><link><target>NuBus</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>VESA Local Bus</target></link><space/>(VESA)</listitem><listitem><link><target>Peripheral Component Interconnect</target></link><space/>(PCI)</listitem><listitem><link><target>Accelerated Graphics Port</target></link><space/>(AGP)</listitem><listitem><link><target>PCI Express</target></link><space/>(PCIe)</listitem><listitem><link><target>List of device bandwidths</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Amiga Zorro II</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>PCI-X</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>PC/104</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>CompactPCI</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>MiniPCI</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>PC card</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Low Pin Count</target></link><space/>(LPC)</listitem><listitem><link><target>Universal Serial Bus</target></link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>div col end</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.geekdot.com/category/knowledge-base/eisa-bus'>The Intel EISA chipset explained</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.techfest.com/hardware/bus/eisa.htm'>EISA bus technical summary</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.intel.com/design/archives/periphrl/index.htm'>Intel EISA Controllers</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102652375'>Intel 82350 EISA chip family<space/></link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>FOLDOC</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Computer-bus</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Authority control</target></template><link><target>Category:Computer buses</target></link><link><target>Category:IBM PC compatibles</target></link><link><target>Category:Motherboard expansion slot</target></link></paragraph></article>
