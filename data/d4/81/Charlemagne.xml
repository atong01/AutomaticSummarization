In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by Irene. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.</arg><arg>[[John Julius Norwich]]</arg><arg>Byzantium: The Early Centuries, pg. 378</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>For the Pope, then, there was &quot;no living Emperor at the that time&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Norwich 379,</extension><space/>though<space/><link><target>Henri Pirenne</target></link><extension extension_name='ref'><italics>Mohammed and Charlemagne</italics>, pg. 234n</extension><space/>disputes this saying that the coronation &quot;was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople.&quot; Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one.

According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a &quot;commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction&quot;; and the emperor &quot;was entitled to the obedience of Christendom.&quot; According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his policy was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by far-flung theories.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire<space/></arg><arg name="title">Holy Roman Empire<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Britannica.com<space/></arg><arg name="date">14 January 2013<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">14 January 2014</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>According to Werner Ohnsorge, for a long time it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual &quot;sons&quot; of the Byzantines. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century, to the pride of the Franks in the eighth century was provoking and insulting. Charles came to the realization that the great Roman emperor, who claimed to be the head of the world hierarchy of states, in reality was no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself &quot;Basileus&quot; (translated literally as &quot;king&quot;). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: &quot;Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be king of the Franks and wished only for the greatness of his Frankish people. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his youngest, only surviving son, Louis, as emperor without recourse to Rome and only with the acclamation of his Franks, also the form in which this acclamation was offered was no longer Roman, but Frankish-Christian; thus demonstrating both independence from Rome, and a Frankish understanding of empire different from Rome's.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Ohnsorge, Werner, '&#39;Das Zweikaiserproblem im früheren Mittelalter.

His authority was now extended over church and state. He could discipline clerics, control ecclesiastical property and define orthodox doctrine.
