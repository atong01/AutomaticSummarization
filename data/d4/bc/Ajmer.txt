{{Main|History of Ajmer}}

[[File:Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Jahangir receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on his return from the Mewar campaign]]

According to Rajputana Gazetteer, Ajmer was held by Rajputs until about 700 years ago. Ajmer ([[Sanskrit]] अजय-मेरु ''Ajayameru'' meaning "Invincible Mountain") was founded in the late 7th century A.D. by Ajayraj Singh [[Chauhan]]. Chauhan clan is a branch of [[Rajput]] . The Chauhan dynasty ruled Ajmer in spite of repeated invasions by [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Muslim]] armies  from [[Central Asia]] across the north of [[India]]. Ajmer was conquered by [[Muhammad of Ghor]], founder of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], in 1193. However, the Chauhan rulers were able to gain autonomy upon the payment of a heavy tribute to him. Ajmer regained independence under the ruler of [[Mewar]] in 1365. In 1509, control of Ajmer was disputed between the [[Maharaja]]s of Mewar and [[Marwar]] unitil it was conquered by the Marwar in 1532. In 1553, the state was ruled by the Hindu Emperor [[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]],  popularly known as [[Hemu]], who was killed in 1556 in the [[Second Battle of Panipat]]. The city was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]] in 1559. In the early 1700s century, control passed to the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]].

In 1818 the British forced the Marathas to cede the city for 50,000 rupees whereupon it became part of the province of Ajmer-Marwar, which consisted of the districts of Ajmer and Merwara and were physically separated by the territory of the Rajputana Agency. Ajmer-Marwar was directly administered by the British Raj, by a commissioner who was subordinate to the Governor-General's agent for Rajputana. Ajmer-Marwar remained a province of India until 1950, when it became the [[Ajmer State]].

Ajmer state became part of Rajasthan state on 1 November 1956.

== Geography ==

Ajmer is surrounded by the [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli Mountains]]. The city is sied on the lower slopes of the Taragarh Hill in the [[Aravalli Range]]. It is situated almost in the centre of Rajasthan. To the north of the city is a large artificial lake, called [[Ana Sagar lake|Anasagar]] with a marble structure known as Baradari. Ajmer is protected from the [[Thar desert]] by the massive rocks of Nagpathar range.

Ajmer is also antipodal to the Chilean remote island of [[Isla Sala y Gómez]].

[[File:Panoramic view of Anasagar.jpg|thumb|Baradari on Lake Anasagar]]
*'''The [[Ajmer Sharif Dargah]]''': It is a shrine of Khwaja [[Moinuddin Chishti]] which is situated at the foot of the Taragarh hill, and consists of several white marble buildings arranged around two courtyards, including a massive gate donated by the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]] and the Akbari Mosque, built by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]]. It contains the domed tomb of the saint. [[Akbar]] and his queen used to come here by foot on pilgrimage from [[Agra]] every year in observance of a vow when he prayed for a son. The large pillars called "Kose ('Mile') Minar", erected at intervals of two miles (3&nbsp;km) along the entire way between Agra and Ajmer mark the places where the royal pilgrims halted every day. It has been estimated that around 125,000 pilgrims visit the site every day.

*'''Taragarh Fort''': The fort guarding Ajmer, was the seat of the [[Chauhan]] rulers and was originally believed to be built by [[Mughals|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar]].<ref name=Madan/> It is reputed to be one of the oldest hill forts in India and the world. It was built by King Ajaypal Chauhan on the summit of Taragarh Hill and overlooks Ajmer. The battlements run along the top of the hill. The walls are two miles (3&nbsp;km) in circumference and the fort can only be approached by way of a very steep slope. When it fell to the [[British Raj]], the fort was dismantled on the orders of [[Lord William Bentinck]] and was converted into a sanatorium for the British troops stationed at the garrison town of [[Nasirabad, India|Nasirabad]].
*'''Adhai Din Ka Jhonpda''': A [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] [[Hindu]] temple built in 1153 and converted into a mosque by [[Qutubuddin Aibak]] in 1193, is situated on the lower slope of Taragarh hill. Aikbak's successor, Shams al-Din [[Iltutmish]] added to the mosque. It is noted for its double-depth calligraphy inscriptions, in the [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] and [[Kufic]] scripts. Apart from the mosque, called Jama [[Iltutmish]] (pronounced ''Altamash'' locally), nearly the whole of the ancient temple has fallen into ruins, but the relics are still unsurpassed as examples of Hindu architecture and sculpture. Forty columns support the roof, but no two are alike and the ornaments are exceptional in their decorations.<ref>[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=7605 Arhai-din-ka Jhompra Mosque] archnet.org.</ref>
*'''Magazine''': The city's Museum, was once the residence of Prince [[Jahangir|Salīm]], the son of the Emperor [[Akbar]], and presently houses a collection of Mughal and [[Rajput]] armour and sculpture.

*'''[[Mayo College]]''': College was founded in 1875 by [[Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo|Lord Mayo]], [[Viceroy of India]]. The architecture of the school buildings is in the same style as royal [[Architecture of Rajasthan|Rajasthani architecture]].
