'''Colossae''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|ɒ|s|i}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[wikt:Κολοσσαί|Κολοσσαί]]) was an ancient city of [[Phrygia]], on the [[Lycus (river of Phrygia)|Lycus]], which is a tributary of the [[Maeander River]]. It was situated about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} South East of [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]], and near the great road from [[Ephesus]] to the [[Euphrates]]. It has never been excavated.

Some sources distinguish Colossae from nearby '''Chonae''' (Χῶναι) now called [[Honaz]], which they attribute to the Middle Ages; others say these were successive names for the same city.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:id=colossae-geo William Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'' (1854), entry "Colossae"]</ref><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04131a.htm Sophrone Pétridès, "Colossae" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1908)]</ref>

==Old Times==
In 396 BC, during the [[Persian Wars]], the satrap [[Tissaphernes]] was lured to Colossae and slain by an agent of the party of [[Cyrus the Younger]]. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] tells that the wool of Colossae gave its name (''colossinus'') to the colour of the [[cyclamen]] flower. During the [[Hellenistic]] period, the town was of some mercantile importance, although by the 1st century it had dwindled greatly in size and significance.

It does not appear from his [[Epistle to the Colossians]] that [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] had visited this city, for it only speaks of him having heard of their faith ({{bibleverse||Col.|1:4|ESV}}) and since he tells [[Philemon of Colossae|Philemon]] of his hope to visit it upon being freed from prison (see [[Philemon 1:22]]). To judge from the Letter to the Colossians, [[Epaphras]] was a person of some importance in the Christian community there ({{bibleverse||Col.|1:7|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Col.|4:12|KJV}}), and tradition presents him as its first bishop. Tradition also gives Philemon as the second bishop of the see. The first historically documented bishop is Epiphanius, who was not personally at the [[Council of Chalcedon]], but whose metropolitan bishop Nunechius of [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]], the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Phrygia Pacatiana]] signed the acts on his behalf.

In [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, Colossae fell into decay (possibly due to an earthquake) and the town of Chonae arose near its ruins. The first recorded bishop of Chonae was Cosmas, who signed the acts of the [[Trullan Council]] of 692 as bishop of "Colossae or Chonae". A successor of his, named Theodosius or Dositheus, was mentioned as participating in the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 as bishop of "Chonae or Colossae". In about 858-860 the bishopric was elevated to the rank of autocephalous archdiocese and later to that of [[metropolitan see]], but without [[suffragan]]s. It is not mentioned in documents later than the end of the 14th century.<ref>Michel Lequien, [http://books.google.com/books?id=0agp0mJFG_sC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 813-818</ref><ref>Raymond Janin, v.

The town was the birthplace of the Byzantine Greek writers [[Nicetas Choniates|Nicetas]] and [[Michael Choniates]]. In 1206–1230, it was ruled by [[Manuel Maurozomes]].

In Byzantine and Russian art, the theme of the ''Miracle of the Archangel Michael at Chonae'' (''Τὸ ἐν Χωναῖς/Χῶναις Θαῦμα τοῦ Ἀρχαγγέλου Μιχαήλ'') is intimately linked with the site.  [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Sacred Tradition|tradition]] tells that the [[paganism|pagans]] directed the stream of a river against the sanctuary of St. Michael there to destroy it, but [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] appeared and split the rock by lightning to give a new bed to the stream, diverting the flow away from the church and sanctifying forever the waters which came from the gorge. The Orthodox celebrate a feast in commemoration of this event on 6 September. The [[Chudov Monastery|Monastery of the Miracle]] (Chudov Monastery) in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], where the Russian [[Tsar]]s were [[baptism|baptized]], was dedicated to the Feast of the Miracle at Kona.

The 5th- to 7th-century texts that refer to the miracle at Chonae formed the basis of specific paradigms for "properly approaching" angelic intermediaries for more effective prayers within the Christian culture.<ref>''Subtle bodies: representing angels in Byzantium'' by Glenn Peers 2001 Univ of Calif Press ISBN 0-520-22405-1 page 144 [http://books.google.com/books?id=kaonEi_dCJIC&pg=PA143&dq=Chonae+michael+miracle+university+california&hl=en&ei=CTq-Tsy6EczqOa-SpdMB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref>
