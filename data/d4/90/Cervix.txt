The '''cervix''' or '''cervix uteri''' (''{{lang-la|neck of the uterus}}'') is the lower part of the [[uterus]] in the [[human female reproductive system]]. In a non-pregnant woman, the cervix is usually between 2 and 3&nbsp;cm long and roughly cylindrical in shape. The narrow, central [[Canal of the cervix|cervical canal]] runs along its entire length, connecting the [[uterine cavity]] and the [[lumen (biology)|lumen]] of the [[vagina]]. The opening into the uterus is called the [[Internal orifice of the uterus|internal os]] and the opening into the vagina is called the [[external os]]. The lower part of the cervix, known as the [[vaginal portion of the cervix]] (or ectocervix), bulges into the top of the vagina. The cervix has been documented anatomically since at least the time of [[Hippocrates]], over 2,000 years ago.

The cervical canal is a passage through which [[sperm]] must travel to fertilize an [[egg cell]] after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including [[cervical cap]]s and [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|cervical diaphragm]]s aim to block or prevent the passage of sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the [[Creighton model]] and [[Billings method]], due to its changes in consistency throughout the [[menstrual period]]. During vaginal [[childbirth]], the cervix must flatten and [[Cervical dilation|dilate]] to allow the [[fetus]] to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use the extent of the dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.

The endocervical canal is lined with a single [[columnar epithelia|layer of column-shaped cells]], while the ectocervix is covered with [[stratified squamous|multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells]]. The two types of [[epithelium|epithelia]] meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, which can lead to [[cancer of the cervix]]. [[Exfoliative cervical cytology|Cervical cytology]] tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and [[HPV vaccines|HPV vaccination]].<!-- <ref name=NCI2011/> --> HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.<ref name=NCI2011>{{cite web|title=Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccines|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/prevention/HPV-vaccine| website=National Cancer Institute|location=Bethesda, MD | date=29 December 2011| accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>

They are often effaced after pregnancy.<ref name="Gardner69"/><!-- cites previous five sentences -->

The ectocervix has a convex, elliptical surface and is divided into anterior and posterior lips. The size and shape of the external opening and the ectocervix can vary according to age, hormonal state, and whether natural or normal [[childbirth]] has taken place. In women who have not had a vaginal delivery, the external os is a small circular opening, and in women who have had a vaginal delivery, the external os is slit-like.<ref name=Blaustein2002>{{cite book|title=Blaustein's Pathology of the Female Genital Tract |edition=5th |page=207 |publisher=Spinger |year=2002 |editor-first=R.

After menstruation and directly under the influence of [[estrogen]], the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed.

=== Development ===

As a component of the female [[reproductive system]], the cervix is derived from the two [[paramesonephric duct]]s (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of [[human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]]. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single [[urogenital]] canal that will become the [[vagina]], cervix and [[uterus]].<ref>{{cite book|author= Schoenwolf, Gary C.; Bleyl, Steven B.; Brauer, Philip R.; Francis-West, Philippa H. |title=Larsen's human embryology|year=2009|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-443-06811-9|chapter="Development of the Urogenital system"|edition=4th}}</ref> The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in [[fetus|fetal life]], twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty.<ref name=ELLIS2011 /> Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the [[urogenital sinus]] and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct.

Some methods of [[fertility awareness]], such as the [[Creighton Model FertilityCare System|Creighton model]] and the [[Billings ovulation method|Billings method]] involve estimating a woman's periods of fertility and infertility by observing physiological changes in her body.  Among these changes are several involving the quality of her cervical mucus: the sensation it causes at the vulva, its elasticity (''[[Spinnbarkeit]]''), its transparency, and the presence of [[Fern test|ferning]].<ref name="Weschler"/>

=== Cervical mucus ===

Several hundred glands in the endocervix produce 20–60&nbsp;mg of cervical [[mucus]] a day, increasing to 600&nbsp;mg around the time of ovulation. It is viscous as it contains large proteins known as [[mucin]]s. The viscosity and water content varies during the [[menstrual cycle]]; mucus is composed of around 93% water, reaching 98% at midcycle. These changes allow it to function either as a barrier or a transport medium to spermatozoa. It contains electrolytes such as calcium, sodium, and potassium; organic components such as glucose, amino acids, and soluble proteins; trace elements including zinc, copper, iron, manganese, and selenium; free fatty acids; enzymes such as [[amylase]]; and [[prostaglandins]].<ref name=CERVIX2006>{{cite book|last=Sharif|first=Khaldoun|author2=Olufowobi, Olufemi |title=The Cervix|editor=Jordan, Joseph; Singer, Albert; Jones, Howard; Shafi, Mahmood |publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA | date=2006|edition=2nd|pages=157–68 |chapter=The structure chemistry and physics of human cervical mucus|isbn=978-1-4051-3137-7}}</ref><!-- cites four previous sentences --> Its consistency is determined by the influence of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. At midcycle around the time of [[ovulation]]—a period of high estrogen levels— the mucus is thin and serous to allow sperm to enter the uterus, and is more alkaline and hence more hospitable to sperm.<ref name=BRANNIGAN2008 /> It is also higher in electrolytes, which results in the "ferning" pattern that can be observed in drying mucus under low magnification; as the mucus dries, the salts crystallize, resembling the leaves of a fern.<ref name = Weschler>|page=58-59</ref> The mucus has stretchy character described as ''Spinnbarkeit'' most prominent around the time of ovulation.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anderson,=Matthew; Karasz, Alison |title=Are Vaginal Symptoms Ever Normal?

A [[cervical mucus plug]], called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. This provides a protective seal for the uterus against the entry of pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties.

=== Childbirth ===

The cervix plays a major role in [[childbirth]]. As the [[fetus]] descends within the uterus in preparation for birth, the [[Presentation (obstetrics)|presenting part]], usually the head, rests on and is supported by the cervix.<ref name=WILLIAMS2005/> As labour progresses, the cervix becomes softer and shorter, begins to dilate, and rotates to face anteriorly.<ref name=GOLDENBERG2008 /> The support the cervix provides to the fetal head starts to give way when the uterus begins its [[Uterine contraction|contractions]]. During childbirth, the [[Cervical dilation|cervix must dilate]] to a diameter of more than {{convert|10|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} to accommodate the head of the fetus as it descends from the uterus to the vagina. In becoming wider, the cervix also becomes shorter, a phenomenon known as [[cervical effacement|effacement]].<ref name=WILLIAMS2005 />

Along with other factors, midwives and doctors use the extent of cervical dilation to assist decision making during [[Stages of labor|childbirth]].<ref name=NICE-labour><NICE (2007).

=== Contraception ===

Several methods of [[contraception]] involve the cervix. [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|Cervical diaphragm]]s are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted by a woman prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against the walls of the vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing [[fertilisation]]. [[Cervical cap]]s are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with [[spermicide]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=NSW|first=Family Planning|title=Contraception : healthy choices : a contraceptive clinic in a book|year=2009|publisher=UNSW Press|location=Sydney, New South Wales|isbn=978-1-74223-136-5|pages=27–37|edition=2nd}}</ref> In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trussell|first=James|title=Contraceptive failure in the United States|journal=Contraception|year=2011|volume=83|issue=5|pages=397–404|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.01.021|pmid=21477680|pmc=3638209}}</ref> Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trussell|first=J|author2=Strickler, J |author3=Vaughan, B |title=Contraceptive efficacy of the diaphragm, the sponge and the cervical cap.|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|date=May–Jun 1993|volume=25|issue=3|pages=100–05, 135|pmid=8354373|doi=10.2307/2136156}}</ref> Most types of [[progestogen-only pill]]s are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the endocervical canal.<ref name=FPA-POP>{{cite web|title=Your Guide to the progesterone-one pill |url=http://www.fpa.org.uk/sites/default/files/progestogen-only-pill-your-guide.pdf |publisher=Family Planning Association (UK)|accessdate=9 November 2014 |pages=3–4 |isbn=978-1-908249-53-1}}</ref> In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation.<ref name=FPA-POP/> In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s, work mainly by preventing [[ovulation]].<ref name=FPA-COC/> They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.<ref name=FPA-COC>{{cite web|title=Your Guide to the combined pill |url=http://www.fpa.org.uk/sites/default/files/the-combined-pill-your-guide.pdf |publisher=Family Planning Association (UK) |accessdate=9 November 2014 |page=4 |date =January 2014 |isbn=978-1-908249-50-0}}</ref>

Potentially precancerous changes in the cervix can be detected by [[cervical screening]], using methods including a [[Pap smear]] (also called a cervical smear), in which [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells are scraped from the surface of the cervix and [[cytopathology|examined under a microscope]].<ref name=HARRISONS2010B/> The [[Colposcopy|colposcope]], an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925.

A cheap, cost-effective and practical alternative in poorer countries is [[Cervical screening#Visual inspection to detect pre-cancer or cancer|visual inspection with acetic acid]] (VIA).<ref name="who fact sheet"/> Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs in these regions can be difficult, due to the need for trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.<ref name=sherris>{{cite journal |author=Sherris, Jacqueline; Wittet, Scott; Kleine, Amy; Sellors, John; Luciani, Silvana; Sankaranarayanan, Rengaswamy; Barone, Mark A. |title=Evidence-based, alternative cervical cancer screening approaches in low-resource settings |journal=Int Perspect Sex Reprod Health |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=147–54 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19805020 |doi=10.1363/ifpp.35.147.09 }}</ref>

Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a [[Speculum (medical)|speculum]], which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.<ref name=HARRISONS2010>{{cite book|editor-first=Anthony S. |editor-last=Fauci |displayeditors=etal |others=Editors of previous edition: T.

==History==
The name of the cervix comes from {{lang-la|cervix}} (neck) from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root ''ker-'', referring to a "structure that projects". Thus, the word cervix is linguistically related to the [[English language|English]] word "[[wikt:horn|horn]]", the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for "head" (sar), the Greek word for "head" ({{lang-el|''koryphe''}}), and the Welsh word for "deer" ({{lang-cy|carw}}).<ref name=ETYCERVIX2014>{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Cervix|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cervix&allowed_in_frame=0|work=Etymology Online|accessdate=19 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Horn|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=horn&allowed_in_frame=0|work=Etymology Online|accessdate=19 March 2014}}</ref>

The cervix was documented in anatomical literature in at least the time of [[Hippocrates]], although there was some variation in early writers, who used the term to refer to both the cervix and the internal uterine orifice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Galen/Johnston|title=Galen: On Diseases and Symptoms|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-139-46084-2|page=247}}</ref> The first attested use of the word to refer to the cervix of the uterus was in 1702.<ref name= ETYCERVIX2014 />
