(Cheers.) But liberty does not consist in making others do what you think right, (Hear, hear.) The difference between a free Government and a Government which is not free is principally thisthat a Government which is not free interferes with everything it can, and a free Government interferes with nothing except what it must. A despotic Government tries to make everybody do what it wishes; a Liberal Government tries, as far as the safety of society will permit, to allow everybody to do as he wishes. It has been the tradition of the Liberal party consistently to maintain the doctrine of individual liberty. It is because they have done so that England is the place where people can do more what they please than in any other country in the world...It is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do, what they shall think, what they shall drink, when they shall go to bed, what they shall buy, and where they shall buy it, what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them, against which the Liberal party have always protested.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics>The Times</italics><space/>(31 December 1872), p. 5.</extension></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The political terms of &quot;modern&quot;, &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;new&quot; Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on self-help and freedom of choice.<extension extension_name='ref'>W.

After a brief Conservative government (during which the<space/><link><target>Reform Act 1867</target><part>Second Reform Act</part></link><space/>was passed by agreement between the parties) Gladstone won a huge victory at the 1868 election and formed the first Liberal government.

The Irish Home Rule bill gave all owners of Irish land a chance to sell to the state at a price equal to 20 years' purchase of the rents and allowing tenants to purchase the land. Irish nationalist reaction was mixed, Unionist opinion was hostile, and the election addresses during the 1886 election revealed English radicals to be against the bill also. Among the Liberal rank and file, several Gladstonian candidates disowned the bill, reflecting fears at the constituency level that the interests of the working people were being sacrificed to finance a rescue operation for the landed elite.<extension extension_name='ref'>Graham D.

This intrigue finally led Harcourt and Morley to resign their positions in 1898 as they continued to be at loggerheads with Rosebery over Irish home rule and issues relating to imperialism.

Asquith, Edward Grey, and Richard Burdon Haldane forming a clique dubbed the &quot;Liberal Imperialists&quot; that supported the government in the prosecution of the war. On the other side, more radical members of the party formed a Pro-Boer faction that denounced the conflict and called for an immediate end to hostilities. Quickly rising to prominence among the Pro-Boers was David Lloyd George, a relatively new MP and a master of rhetoric, who took advantage of having a national stage to speak out on a controversial issue to make his name in the party. Harcourt and Morley also sided with this group, though with slightly different aims. Campbell-Bannerman tried to keep these forces together at the head of a moderate Liberal rump, but in 1901 he delivered a speech on the government's &quot;methods of barbarism&quot; in South Africa that pulled him further to the left and nearly tore the party in two. The party was saved after Salisbury's retirement in 1902 when his successor, Arthur Balfour, pushed a series of unpopular initiatives such as a new education bill and Joseph Chamberlain called for a new system of protectionist tariffs. Campbell-Bannerman was able to rally the party around the traditional liberal platform of free trade and land reform and led them to<space/><link><target>United Kingdom general election, 1906</target><part>the greatest election victory</part></link><space/>in their history.

Several Cabinet ministers resigned, and Asquith, the master of domestic politics, proved a poor war leader. Lloyd George and Churchill, however, were zealous supporters of the war, and gradually forced the old peace-orientated Liberals out. The poor British performance in the early months of the war forced Asquith to invite the Conservatives into a coalition (on 17 May 1915). This marked the end of the last all-Liberal government. This coalition fell apart at the end of 1916, when the Conservatives withdrew their support from Asquith and gave it instead to Lloyd George, who became Prime Minister at the head of a coalition government largely made up of Conservatives. Asquith and his followers moved to the opposition benches in Parliament and the Liberal Party was split once again.<extension extension_name='ref'>Trevor Wilson,<space/><italics>The Downfall of the Liberal Party: 1914-1935</italics><space/>(1966)</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Wilson argues that Lloyd George abandoned many liberal principles in his single-minded crusade to win the war at all costs. That brought him and like-minded Liberals into a coalition with the Conservatives, largely on the ground long occupied by Conservatives: they were not oriented toward world peace or liberal treatment of Germany, nor discomfited by aggressive and authoritarian measures of state power. More deadly to the future of the Party, says Wilson, was its repudiation by ideological Liberals, who decided sadly that it no longer represented their principles. Finally the presence of the vigorous new Labour Party on the left gave a new home to voters disenchanted with the Liberal Party.<extension extension_name='ref'>Wilson,<space/><italics>The Downfall of the Liberal Party: 1914-1935</italics><space/>(1966) pp 23-48</extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:David Lloyd George.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part><link><target>David Lloyd George</target></link></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom general election, 1918</target><part>1918 general election</part></link><space/><link><target>David Lloyd George</target><part>Lloyd George</part></link>, &quot;the Man Who Won the War&quot;, led his coalition into another<space/><italics><link><target>khaki election</target></link></italics>, and won a sweeping victory over the Asquithian Liberals and the newly emerging<space/><link><target>Labour Party (UK)</target><part>Labour Party</part></link>.

Asquith and most of his colleagues lost their seats. Lloyd George still claimed to be leading a Liberal government, but he was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party. In 1922 the Conservative backbenchers rebelled against the continuation of the coalition, citing in particular the<space/><link><target>Chanak Crisis</target></link><space/>over<space/><link><target>Turkey</target></link><space/>and Lloyd George's corrupt sale of honours, amongst other grievances, and Lloyd George was forced to resign.

In 1922 Labour became the official opposition. A reunion of the two warring factions took place in 1923 when the new Conservative Prime Minister<space/><link><target>Stanley Baldwin</target></link><space/>committed his party to protective tariffs, causing the Liberals to reunite in support of free trade. The party gained ground in the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom general election, 1923</target><part>1923 general election</part></link><space/>but ominously made most of its gains from Conservatives whilst losing ground to Labour a sign of the party's direction for many years to come. The party remained the third largest in the House of Commons, but the Conservatives had lost their majority. There was much speculation and fear about the prospect of a Labour government, and comparatively little about a Liberal government, even though it could have plausibly presented an experienced team of ministers compared to Labour's almost complete lack of experience, as well as offering a middle ground that could obtain support from both Conservatives and Labour in crucial Commons divisions. But instead of trying to force the opportunity to form a Liberal government, Asquith decided instead to allow Labour the chance of office, in the belief that they would prove incompetent and this would set the stage for a revival of Liberal fortunes at Labour's expense. It was a fatal error.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:UK popular vote.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>left</part><part>Share of the vote received by Conservatives (blue), Whigs/Liberals/Liberal Democrats (orange), Labour (red) and others (grey) in general elections since 1832.<extension extension_name='ref'>Table 2.01 &quot;Summary Results of General Elections 18322005 (UK)&quot;,<space/><italics>British electoral facts, 18322006</italics>, by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, 7th edition, 2007, ISBN 978-0-7546-2712-8, p. 59.</extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/<space/></arg><arg name="title">Election 2010 Results<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">BBC News</arg></template></extension><space/>Following success as the successor to the Whig party, the party's share of the popular vote plummeted after the First World War as it lost votes to the new Labour party and fractured into groups such as the National and Coalition Liberals.</part></link>Labour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the left.<space/><link><target>Ramsay MacDonald</target></link><space/>was forced into a<space/><link><target>united Kingdom general election, 1924</target><part>snap election in 1924</part></link>, and although his government was defeated, he achieved his objective of virtually wiping the Liberals out as many more radical voters now moved to Labour, whilst moderate middle-class Liberal voters concerned about socialism moved to the Conservatives. The Liberals were reduced to a mere forty seats in Parliament, only seven of which had been won against candidates from both parties; and none of these formed a coherent area of Liberal survival. The party seemed finished, and during this period some Liberals, such as Churchill, went over to the Conservatives, while others went over to Labour. (Several Labour ministers of later generations, such as<space/><link><target>Michael Foot</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Tony Benn</target></link>, were the sons of Liberal MPs.)</paragraph><paragraph>Asquith died in 1928 and the enigmatic figure of Lloyd George returned to the leadership and began a drive to produce coherent policies on many key issues of the day.

The Liberals gained ground, but once again it was at the Conservatives' expense whilst also losing seats to Labour. Indeed, the urban areas of the country suffering heavily from unemployment, which might have been expected to respond the most to the radical economic policies of the Liberals, instead gave the party its worst results. By contrast most of the party's seats were won either due to the absence of a candidate from one of the other parties or in rural areas on the &quot;<link><target>Celtic fringe</target></link>&quot;, where local evidence suggests that economic ideas were at best peripheral to the electorate's concerns. The Liberals now found themselves with 59 members, holding the balance of power in a Parliament where Labour was the largest party but lacked an overall majority. Lloyd George offered a degree of support to the Labour government in the hope of winning concessions, including a degree of electoral reform to introduce the<space/><link><target>Instant-runoff voting</target><part>alternative vote</part></link>, but this support was to prove bitterly divisive as the Liberals increasingly divided between those seeking to gain what Liberal goals they could achieve, those who preferred a Conservative government to a Labour one and vice versa.<extension extension_name='ref'>Charles Loch Mowat,<space/><italics>Britain between the Wars, 19181940</italics><space/>(1955)</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The last majority Liberal Government in Britain was elected in 1906.The years preceding the First World War were marked by worker strikes and civil unrest and saw many violent confrontations between civilians and the police and armed forces.

Soon, however, the Liberals faced another divisive crisis when a National Government was proposed to fight the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom general election, 1931</target><part>1931 general election</part></link><space/>with a mandate for tariffs. From the outside, Lloyd George called for the party to abandon the government completely in defence of free trade, but only a few MPs and candidates followed. Another group under<space/><link><target>John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon</target><part>Sir John Simon</part></link><space/>then emerged, who were prepared to continue their support for the government and take the Liberal places in the Cabinet if there were resignations. The third group under<space/><link><target>Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel</target><part>Sir Herbert Samuel</part></link><space/>pressed for the parties in government to fight the election on separate platforms. In doing so the bulk of Liberals remained supporting the government, but two distinct Liberal groups had emerged within this bulk the<space/><link><target>National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)</target><part>Liberal Nationals</part></link><space/>(officially the &quot;National Liberals&quot; after 1947) led by Simon, also known as &quot;Simonites&quot;, and the &quot;Samuelites&quot; or &quot;official Liberals&quot;, led by Samuel who remained as the official party. Both groups secured about 34 MPs but proceeded to diverge even further after the election, with the Liberal Nationals remaining supporters of the government throughout its life. There were to be a succession of discussions about them rejoining the Liberals, but these usually foundered on the issues of free trade and continued support for the National Government. The one significant reunification came in 1946 when the Liberal and Liberal National party organisations in London merged.</paragraph><paragraph>The official Liberals found themselves a tiny minority within a government committed to<space/><link><target>protectionism</target></link>. Slowly they found this issue to be one they could not support. In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of<space/><link><target>Cabinet collective responsibility</target><part>collective responsibility</part></link><space/>to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs. Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over the introduction of the<space/><link><target>Ottawa Conference</target><part>Ottawa Agreement</part></link><space/>on<space/><link><target>Imperial Preference</target></link>. However, they remained sitting on the government benches supporting it in Parliament, though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the government. Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete opposition. By this point their number of MPs was severely depleted. In the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom general election, 1935</target><part>1935 general election</part></link>, just 17 Liberal MPs were elected, along with Lloyd George and three followers as &quot;<link><target>Independent Liberals (UK, 1931)</target><part>independent Liberals</part></link>&quot;. Immediately after the election the two groups reunited, though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old party. Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labour. Yet there were a few recruits, such as<space/><link><target>Clement Davies</target></link>, who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during the<space/><link><target>World War II</target><part>Second World War</part></link><space/>and who would lead it after the war.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Near extinction</heading><paragraph>Samuel had lost his seat in the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom general election, 1935</target><part>1935 election</part></link><space/>and the leadership of the party fell to<space/><link><target>Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso</target><part>Sir Archibald Sinclair</part></link>.

Grimond also sought an intellectual revival of the party, seeking to position it as a non-socialist radical alternative to the Conservative government of the day. In particular he canvassed the support of the young post-war university students and recent graduates, appealing to younger voters in a way that many of his recent predecessors had not, and asserting a new strand of Liberalism for the post-war world.</paragraph><paragraph>The new middle-class suburban generation began to find the Liberals' policies attractive again. Under Grimond (who retired in 1967) and his successor,<space/><link><target>Jeremy Thorpe</target></link>, the Liberals regained the status of a serious third force in British politics, polling up to 20% of the vote but unable to break the duopoly of Labour and Conservative and win more than fourteen seats in the Commons.
