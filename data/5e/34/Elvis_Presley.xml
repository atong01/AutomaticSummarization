His music career began there in 1954, when he recorded a song with producer<space/><link><target>Sam Phillips</target></link><space/>at<space/><link><target>Sun Records</target></link>. Accompanied by guitarist<space/><link><target>Scotty Moore</target></link><space/>and bassist<space/><link><target>Bill Black</target></link>, Presley was an early popularizer of<space/><link><target>rockabilly</target></link>, an uptempo,<space/><link><target>Backbeat (music)</target><part>backbeat</part></link>-driven fusion of<space/><link><target>country music</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>rhythm and blues</target></link>.<space/><link><target>RCA Victor</target></link><space/>acquired his contract in a deal arranged by<space/><link><target>Colonel Tom Parker</target></link>, who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, &quot;<link><target>Heartbreak Hotel</target></link>&quot;, was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. He was regarded as the leading figure of<space/><link><target>rock and roll</target></link><space/>after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the<space/><link><target>African-American Civil Rights Movement</target><part>Civil Rights Movement</part></link>, made him enormously popularand controversial.</paragraph><paragraph>In November 1956, he made his film debut in<space/><italics><link><target>Love Me Tender (film)</target><part>Love Me Tender</part></link></italics>. In 1958, he was drafted into military service. He resumed his recording career two years later, producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and their accompanying soundtrack albums, most of which were critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special<space/><italics><link><target>Elvis (1968 TV program)</target><part>Elvis</part></link></italics>, which led to an extended<space/><link><target>Las Vegas Valley</target><part>Las Vegas</part></link><space/>concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours.

In the 1970s, his most heavily promoted and best-selling LP releases tended to be concert albums.
