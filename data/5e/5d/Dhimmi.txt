Under [[sharia]], the dhimmi communities were usually subjected to their own special laws, rather than some of the laws which were applicable only to the Muslim community. For example, the [[Jews|Jewish]] community in Medina was allowed to have its own [[beit din|Halakhic courts]],<ref name="Cohen"/> and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]] allowed its various dhimmi communities to rule themselves under separate legal courts. These courts did not cover cases that involved religious groups outside of their own community, or capital offences. Dhimmi communities were also allowed to engage in certain practices that were usually forbidden for the Muslim community, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork.<ref>Al-Misri, ''Reliance of the Traveler'' (edited and translated by [[Nuh Ha Mim Keller]]), p. 608.

Historically, dhimmi status was originally applied to [[Jews]], [[Christian]]s, and [[Sabians]]. This status later also came to be applied to [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]], [[Hindu]]s, and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].<ref>The [[Chach Nama]] English translation by Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg.

The overwhelming majority of moderate Muslims reject the dhimma system as ahistorical, in the sense that it is inappropriate for the age of nation-states and democracies.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Khaled Abou El Fadl|Abou El Fadl]]|first1=[[Khaled Abou El Fadl|Khaled]]|title=The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists|date=January 23, 2007|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0061189036|page=214}}</ref>

==The "dhimma contract"==
Based on [[Quran]]ic verses and Islamic traditions, classical sharia distinguishes between Muslims, followers of other [[Abrahamic religions]], and [[Paganism|pagans]] or people belonging to other [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] religions. As [[monotheism|monotheists]], Jews and Christians have traditionally been considered "[[People of the Book]]," and afforded a special status known as ''dhimmi'' derived from a theoretical contract—"dhimma" or "residence in return for taxes". There are parallels for this in [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Halakha|Jewish law]].<ref>[[H. Patrick Glenn|Glenn, H. Patrick]] (2007).

Classical sharia incorporated the [[religious law]]s and courts of [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Judaism|Jews]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]], as seen in the early [[caliphate]], [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.<ref name=Weeramantry-138>{{Harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=138}}</ref><ref name=Sachedina>{{cite book|title=The Islamic Roots of Democratic Pluralism|author=Sachedina, Abdulaziz Abdulhussein |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-513991-7|ref=harv}}</ref> In medieval Islamic societies, the ''[[qadi]]'' (Islamic judges) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily chose to be judged according to Islamic law, thus the dhimmi communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the sharia law, as with the Jews who would have their own [[beit din|rabbinical courts]].<ref name="Cohen">{{cite book|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R.

Oaths sworn by dhimmis in these courts were tailored to their beliefs.<ref name="al-Qattan-99">{{cite journal |author=al-Qattan, Najwa |title=Dhimmis in the Muslim Court: Legal Autonomy and Religious Discrimination |journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]] |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=429–444 |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |year=1999 |issn=00207438 |doi=10.1017/S0020743800055501 |ref=harv}}</ref>

Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in certain practices (such as the consumption of alcohol and pork) that were usually forbidden by Islamic law. Zoroastrian "self-marriages", that were considered incestuous under sharia, were also tolerated. [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] (1292–1350) opined that non-Muslims were entitled to such practices since they could not be presented to sharia courts and the religious minorities in question held it permissible. This ruling was based on the precedent that the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]] did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming into contact with Zoroastrians and knowing about this practice.<ref>Jackson, Sherman A.

However, the classical dhimma contract is no longer enforced. Western influence has been instrumental in eliminating the restrictions and protections of the dhimma contract, thereby contributing to the current state of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims living in Islamic lands.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The Jews of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0EbKFRxrT4C|year=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3 |page=184}}</ref>

According to law professor [[H. Patrick Glenn]] of [[McGill University]], "[t]oday it is said that the dhimmi are 'excluded from the specifically Muslim privileges, but on the other hand they are excluded from the specifically Muslim duties' while (and here there are clear parallels with western public and private law treatment of aliens—Fremdenrecht, la condition de estrangers), '[f]or the rest, the Muslim and the dhimmi are equal in practically the whole of the law of property and of contracts and obligations'."<ref>[[H.

===The dhimma contract and sharia law===
{{Main|Sharia}}
The dhimma contract is an integral part of traditional Islamic sharia law. From the 9th century AD, the power to interpret and refine law in traditional Islamic societies was in the hands of the scholars (''[[ulama]]''). This separation of powers served to limit the range of actions available to the ruler, who could not easily decree or reinterpret law independently and expect the continued support of the community.<ref>Basim Musallam, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World'', edited by [[Francis Robinson]]. Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 176.</ref> Through succeeding centuries and empires, the balance between the ulema and the rulers shifted and reformed, but the balance of power was never decisively changed.<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 3'', 1961, pp. 105–108.</ref> At the beginning of the 19th century, the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]] introduced an era of European world hegemony that included the domination of most of the lands of Islam.<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 3'', 1961, pp. 176–177.</ref><ref>Sarah Ansari, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World edited by [[Francis Robinson]]''.

Muslim states, sects, schools of thought and individuals differ as to exactly what sharia law entails.<ref>Otto, Jan Michiel. ''Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries: Tensions and Opportunities for Dutch and EU Foreign Policy ''. Amsterdam University Press, 2008, p. 7.</ref> In addition, Muslim states today utilize a spectrum of legal systems. Most states have a mixed system that implements certain aspects of sharia while acknowledging the supremacy of a constitution. A few, such as Turkey, have declared themselves secular.<ref>Otto, ''Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries'', 2008, pp. 8–9.</ref> Local and customary laws may take precedence in certain matters, as well.<ref>Otto, ''Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries'', 2008, p. 29.</ref> Islamic law is therefore polynormative,<ref>Otto, ''Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries'', 2008, p. 10.</ref> and despite several cases of regression in recent years, the trend is towards modernization and liberalization.<ref>Otto, ''Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries'', 2008, p. 18.</ref> Questions of human rights and the status of minorities cannot be generalized with regards to the Muslim world. They must instead be examined on a case-by-case basis, within specific political and cultural contexts, using perspectives drawn from the historical framework.<ref>Otto, ''Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries'', 2008, pp. 37–39.</ref>

===The end of the dhimma contract===
The status of the dhimmi "was for long accepted with resignation by the Christians and with gratitude by the Jews" but the rising power of Christendom and the radical ideas of the French Revolution caused a wave of discontent among Christian dhimmis.<ref>{{cite book|last= Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The Jews of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0EbKFRxrT4C|year=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3}} p. 62</ref> The continuing and growing pressure from the European powers combined with pressure from Muslim reformers gradually relaxed the inequalities between Muslims and non-Muslims.<ref>{{cite book|last= Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The Jews of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0EbKFRxrT4C|year=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3}} summary of pp. 62–66. See p. 62 (second paragraph), p. 65 (third paragraph)</ref>

The collection of the jizya tax from non-Muslims was widespread throughout the history of Islam. In the mid-19th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] significantly relaxed the restrictions and taxes placed on its non-Muslim residents under [[Ottomanism]]. These relaxations occurred gradually as part of the [[Tanzimat]] reform movement, which began in 1839 with the accession of the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultan]], [[Abdülmecid I]].

On November 3, 1839, the [[Edict of Gülhane]] (Hatt-i Sharif of Gulhane) edict was put forth by the Sultan, in part proclaiming the principle of equality among all subjects regardless of religion. Part of the motivation for this was a desire to gain support from the [[British Empire]], whose help was needed in a [[Egyptian–Ottoman War (1839–41)|conflict with Egypt]].

On February 18, 1856, the [[Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856]] (Hatt-i Humayan) was issued, building upon the 1839 edict. It came about partly as a result of pressure from and the efforts of the ambassadors of Great Britain, France, and Austria, whose respective countries were needed as allies in the [[Crimean War]]. It again proclaimed the principle of equality between Muslims and non-Muslims, and produced many specific reforms to this end. For example, the jizya tax was abolished and non-Muslims were allowed to join the army.<ref>Lapidus (1988), p. 599</ref><ref>Lapidus (2002), p. 495</ref>

===Views of contemporary Islamic scholars on the status of dhimmis in an Islamic society===
* The Iranian Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] indicates, in his book ''[[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist]]'', that non-Muslims should be required to pay the [[Tax per head|poll tax]], in return for which they would profit from the protection and services of the state; they would, however, be excluded from all participation in the political process.<ref>Hukuma Islamiyya, n.p. (Beirut), n.d., pp. 30ff.; Vilayat-i Faqih, n.p., n.d., pp. 35ff.; English version (from the Arabic), ''Islamic Government'' (U.S. Joint Publications Research Service 72663, 1979), pp. 22ff.; French version (from the Persian), Pour un gouvernement islamique (Paris, 1979), pp. 31ff. Another version in Hamid Algar, ''Islam and Revolution: Writings and Declarations of Imam Khomeini'' (Berkeley, 1981), pp. 45ff.</ref> [[Bernard Lewis]] remarks about Khomeini that one of his main grievances against the Shah, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], was that his legislation allowed the theoretical possibility of non-Muslims exercising political or judicial authority over Muslims.<ref>Bernard Lewis, ''[[The Jews of Islam]]'' notes on page 3</ref>
* [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei]], a prominent 20th century [[Shia Islam|Shia]] scholar, commenting on a ''[[hadith]]'' that claims that the verse 9:29<ref>Quran 9:29—"Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture—fight until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled."</ref> had "abrogated" other verses asking for good behaviour toward dhimmis, states that "abrogation" could be understood either in its terminological sense or its literal sense. If "abrogation" is understood in its terminological sense, Muslims should deal with dhimmis strictly in a good and decent manner.<ref>[http://www.shiasource.com/al-mizan/ Tafsir al-Mizan] on verses 2:83–88, Allameh Tabatabaei</ref>
* [[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]], a well-known Pakistani Muslim theologian, writes in ''[[Mizan]]'' that certain directives of the Quran were specific only to Muhammad against peoples of his times, besides other directives, the campaign involved asking the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for jizya and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for exemption from death punishment and for military protection as the dhimmis of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and [[Sahabah|his companions]], there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam.<ref>[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]], ''[[Mizan]]'', Chapter: The Islamic Law of Jihad, Dar ul-Ishraq, 2001. OCLC: 52901690 [http://www.studying-islam.org/articletext.aspx?id=771]</ref><ref>"Misplaced Directives", [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/ ''Renaissance''], [[Al-Mawrid Institute]], Vol. 12, No. 3, March 2002.[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/martitl2y2.html]</ref>
* The Iranian Shia jurist Grand Ayatollah [[Naser Makarem Shirazi]] states in ''the selection of the [[Tafsir Nemooneh]]'' that the main philosophy of jizya is that it is only a financial aid to those Muslims who are in the charge of safeguarding the security of the state and dhimmis' lives and properties on their behalf<ref>[http://library.tebyan.net/books1/1016.htm ''Selection of Tafsir Nemooneh''], Grand Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi, p. 10, volume 2, on verse 9:29 {{wayback|url=http://library.tebyan.net/books1/1016.htm |date=20061118113944 }}</ref>
* Legal scholar [[L. Ali Khan]] points to the [[Dhimmi#Constitution of Medina|Constitution of Medina]] as a way forward for Islamic states in his 2006 paper titled ''The Medina Constitution''. He suggests this ancient document, which governed the status of religions and races in the first Islamic state, can serve as a basis for the protection of minority rights, equality, and religious freedom in the modern Islamic state.<ref>Khan, Ali, ''Commentary on the Constitution of Medina'' in ''Understanding Islamic Law: From Classical to Contemporary'', Edited by Aminah Beverly McCloud and Hisham Ramadan, Alta Mira Press, 2006, pp. 205–208.</ref><ref>Paper available at SSRN, click to download: http://ssrn.com/abstract=945458</ref>
* [[Tariq Ramadan]], Professor of Islamic Studies at the [[University of Oxford]], advocates the inclusion of academic disciplines and Islamic society, along with traditional Islamic scholars, in an effort to reform Islamic law and address modern conditions. He speaks of remaining faithful to the higher objectives of sharia law. He posits universal rights of dignity, welfare, freedom, equality and justice in a [[Religious pluralism|religiously]] and [[Cultural pluralism|culturally pluralistic]] Islamic (or other) society, and proposes a dialogue regarding the modern term "citizenship," although it has no clear precedent in classical [[fiqh]]. He further includes the terms "non-citizen", "foreigner", "resident" and "immigrant" in this dialogue, and challenges not only Islam, but modern civilization as a whole, to come to terms with these concepts in a meaningful way with regards to problems of racism, discrimination and oppression.<ref>Ramadan, Tariq, ''Radical Reform: Islamic Ethics and Liberation'', Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 268–271.</ref>

==Dhimmi communities==

Jews and Christians living under early Muslim rule were considered dhimmis, a status that was later also extended to other non-Muslims like Hindus. They were allowed to "practise their religion, subject to certain conditions, and to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy" and guaranteed their personal safety and security of property, in return for paying tribute and acknowledging Muslim rule.<ref>Lewis (1984), pp. 10, 20.</ref> Islamic law and custom prohibited the enslavement of free dhimmis within lands under Islamic rule.<ref>Lewis (2002), p.92</ref> Taxation from the perspective of dhimmis who came under the Muslim rule, was "a concrete continuation of the taxes paid to earlier regimes"<ref name="Cahen">Cl. Cahen in ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', Jizya article</ref> (but lower under the Muslim rule<ref>Lewis 1984 p.18</ref><ref name="Lewis p57"/>). They were also exempted from the [[zakat]] tax paid by Muslims. The dhimmi communities living in Islamic states had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who had their own [[beit din|Halakhic courts]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R. Cohen]]|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fgbib5exskUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cohen+Under+Crescent+and+Cross&q|accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref> The dhimmi communities had their own leaders, courts, personal and religious laws,<ref name="Lewis 1984, p. 27">Lewis (1984), p. 27</ref> and "generally speaking, Muslim tolerance of unbelievers was far better than anything available in Christendom, until the rise of secularism in the 17th century".<ref name="Buntzie Ellis Churchill 2008, pp. 146">Bernard Lewis and Buntzie Ellis Churchill, ''Islam: The Religion and the People'', Wharton School Publishing, 2008, p. 146.</ref> "Muslims guaranteed freedom of worship and livelihood, provided that they remained loyal to the Muslim state and paid a poll tax".<ref name="World " /> "Muslim governments appointed Christian and Jewish professionals to their bureaucracies",<ref name="World " /> and thus, Christians and Jews "contributed to the making of the Islamic civilization".<ref name="World " />

However, dhimmis faced social and symbolic restrictions,<ref name="Lewis 1984, p. 26">Lewis (1984), p. 26</ref> and a pattern of stricter, then more lax, enforcement developed over time.<ref name="Lewis 1984 pp. 49–51">Lewis (1984) pp. 49–51.</ref> [[Marshall Hodgson]], a historian of Islam, writes that during the era of the High Caliphate (7th–13th Centuries), zealous Shariah-minded Muslims gladly elaborated their code of symbolic restrictions on the dhimmis.<ref name="Hodgson p488">{{Cite book|title=The Venture of Islam: The classical age of Islam|author=Marshall G.S.

From an Islamic legal perspective, the pledge of protection granted dhimmis the freedom to practice their religion and spared them [[forced conversion]]s. The dhimmis also served a variety of useful purposes, mostly economic, which was another point of concern to jurists.<ref>Lewis (1984)</ref> Religious minorities were free to do whatever they wished in their own homes, but could not "publically engage in illicit sex in ways that threaten public morals".<ref>{{cite book|title=Islam and the Blackamerican: Looking Toward the Third Resurrection|author=Sherman A.

One example was the Zoroastrian practice of [[incest]]uous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion. This ruling was based on the precedent that Muhammad did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming in contact with them and having knowledge of their practices.<ref>Jackson, p. 144</ref>

The Arabs generally established garrisons outside towns in the conquered territories, and had little interaction with the local dhimmi populations for purposes other than the collection of taxes. The conquered Christian, Jewish, Mazdean and Buddhist communities were otherwise left to lead their lives as before.<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 1'', 1958, pp. 227–229.</ref>

===Christians===
Local Christians in Syria, Iraq, and Egypt were [[Non-Chalcedonianism|non-Chalcedonians]] and many may have felt better off under early Muslim rule than under that of the [[Greek Orthodox Church|orthodox Greeks]] of [[Constantinople]].<ref name="conseq" >Lewis (1984), pp. 17–18; Stillman (1979), p. 27.</ref>

In 1095, [[Pope Urban II]] urged western European Christians to [[First Crusade|come to the aid]] of the Christians of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The subsequent [[Crusades]] brought [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Christians into contact with Orthodox Christians whose beliefs they discovered to differ from their own perhaps more than they had realized, and whose position under the rule of the Muslim [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was less uncomfortable than had been supposed. Consequently, the Eastern Christians provided perhaps less support to the Crusaders than had been expected.<ref name=autogenerated2>Courbage and Fargues (1995), pp. 44–46.</ref> When the Arab East came under Ottoman rule in the 16th century, Christian populations and fortunes rebounded significantly. The Ottomans had long experience dealing with Christian and Jewish minorities, and were more tolerant towards religious minorities than the former Muslim rulers, the [[Mamluk]]s of [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]].<ref name=autogenerated5>Courbage and Fargues (1995), pp. 57–58.</ref> By the 19th century, European pressure on the Ottomans had forced them to remove all dhimma restrictions on their religious minorities.

===Jews===
Accustomed to survival in adverse circumstances after many centuries of discrimination and persecution within the Roman Empire, both pre-Christian and Christian, Jews saw the Islamic conquests as just another change of rulers.

[[María Rosa Menocal]], argues that the Jewish dhimmis living under the caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to [[al-Andalus]], where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practice faith and trade were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on proselytization.<ref>[http://www.twbookmark.com/books/52/0316566888/press_release.html The Ornament of the World by María Rosa Menocal]</ref>

[[Bernard Lewis]] states:

{{Quote|Generally, the Jewish people were allowed to practice their religion and live according to the laws and scriptures of their community. Furthermore, the restrictions to which they were subject were social and symbolic rather than tangible and practical in character. That is to say, these regulations served to define the relationship between the two communities, and not to oppress the Jewish population.<ref name=lewis>Lewis, Bernard W (1984). ''The Jews of Islam''</ref>|}}

{{Quote|The legal and security situation of the Jews in the Muslim world was generally better than in Christendom, because in the former, Jews were not the sole "infidels", because in comparison to the Christians, Jews were less dangerous and more loyal to the Muslim regime, and because the rapidity and the territorial scope of the Muslim conquests imposed upon them a reduction in persecution and a granting of better possibility for the survival of members of other faiths in their lands.<ref>{{cite book |title=On Jewish History in the Middle Ages|last=Ben-Sasson |first=Haim Hillel |year=1969 |location=Tel Aviv |page=36}} Quoted in Mark R. Cohen's ''Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages'', Princeton University Press (1995), pp. xvii–xviii (Cohen's translation).</ref> |}}

According to the French historian [[Claude Cahen]], Islam has "shown more toleration than Europe towards the Jews who remained in Muslim lands."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Cahen |first=Claude |editor=[[P.

Comparing the treatment of Jews in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval Christian Europe]], [[Mark R. Cohen]] notes that, in contrast to Jews in Christian Europe, the "Jews in Islam were well integrated into the economic life of the larger society",<ref name=mark.r.cohen>{{cite book|first=Mark |last=Cohen |title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X}}</ref> and that they were allowed to practice their religion more freely than they could do in Christian Europe.<ref name=mark.r.cohen/>

According to the scholar Mordechai Zaken, [[tribal chief]]tains (also known as aghas) in tribal Muslim societies such as the Kurdish society in [[Kurdistan]] would tax their Jewish subjects. The Jews were in fact civilians protected by their chieftains in and around their communities; in return they paid part of their harvest as dues, and contributed their skills and services to their patron chieftain.<ref>[[Mordechai Zaken]], ''[[Jewish Subjects and their tribal chieftains in Kurdistan]]: A Study in Survival'', Brill: Leiden and Boston, 2007.</ref>

===Hindus and Buddhists===
By the 10th century, the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] of [[Central Asia]] had brought Islam to the mountains north of the [[Indic plains]].<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 2'', 1961, p. 275.</ref> It was not long before they swept south across the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The [[Indus River|Indus basin]] held a substantial Buddhist population in addition to the ruling Hindu castes, and most converted to Islam over the next two centuries.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} At the end of the 12th century, the Muslims advanced quickly into the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Ganges Plain]].<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 2'', 1961, p. 276.</ref> In one decade, a Muslim army led by Turkic slaves consolidated resistance around [[Lahore]] and brought northern India, as far as [[Bengal]], under Muslim rule.<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 2'', 1961, p. 278.</ref> From these Turkic slaves would come sultans, including the founder of the [[Delhi Sultanate|sultanate of Delhi]]. Muslims and dhimmis alike participated in urbanization and urban prosperity.<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 2'', 1961, p. 279.</ref>

By the 15th century, Islamic and Hindu civilization had evolved in a complementary manner, with the Muslims taking the role of a ruling caste in Hindu society. Nevertheless, the Muslims retained their Islamic identities, and were in some ways regarded by Hindus in much the same light as their own lowest castes.<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 2'', 1961, pp. 555–556.</ref>

In the 16th century, India came under the influence of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ([[Mongols]]). [[Babur]], a ruler of the Mongol Timuri empire, established a foothold in the north which paved the way for further expansion by his successors.<ref>MHodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 3'', 1961, pp. 24–25.</ref> Until it was eclipsed by European hegemony in the 18th century, the Timuri [[Mughal emperors|Moghul emperors]] oversaw a period of coexistence and tolerance between Hindus and Muslims. The emperor [[Akbar]] has been described as a universalist. He sought to establish tolerance and equality between all communities and religions, and instituted far reaching social and religious reforms.<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 3'', 1961, pp. 65–67.</ref> Not all the Mughal emperors endorsed the ideals espoused by Akbar, indeed [[Aurangzeb]] was inclined towards a more fundamentalist approach.<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 3'', 1961, p. 60.</ref>

==Restrictions==
There were a number of restrictions on dhimmis. In a modern sense the dhimmis would be described as second-class citizens.<ref name=Majid>{{cite book |first=Majid |last=Khadduri |authorlink=Majid Khadduri |year=2010 |title=War and Peace in the Law of Islam |isbn=9781616190484 |pages=196–198}}</ref>

Although dhimmis were allowed to perform their religious rituals, they were obliged to do so in a manner not conspicuous to Muslims. Display of non-Muslim religious symbols, such as crosses or icons, was prohibited on buildings and on clothing (unless mandated as part of distinctive clothing). Loud prayers were forbidden, as were the ringing of church bells and the blowing of the [[shofar]].<ref>Karsh 29.</ref> They were also not allowed to build or repair churches without Muslim consent.<ref name="World " /> Moreover, dhimmis were not allowed to seek converts among Muslims.<ref name="Griffith">{{cite book |title=The Church in the Shadow of the Mosque: Christians and Muslims in the World of Islam |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Sidney H. Griffith |year=2010 |isbn=0691146284}}</ref> In the [[Mamluk]] Egypt, where non-Mamluk Muslims were not allowed to ride horses and camels, dhimmis were prohibited even from riding donkeys inside cities.<ref>Stillman (1979), p. 471</ref> Sometimes, Muslim rulers issued regulations requiring dhimmis to attach distinctive signs to their houses.<ref>Al-Tabari, ''Ta'rikh al-Rusul wa 'l-Muluk'', translated in Stillman (1979), p. 167.</ref>

Most of the restrictions were social and symbolic in nature,<ref name="Lewis 1984, p. 26">Lewis (1984), p. 26</ref> and a pattern of stricter, then more lax, enforcement developed over time.<ref name="Lewis 1984 pp. 49–51"/> The major financial disabilities of the dhimmi were the jizya poll tax and the fact dhimmis and Muslims could not inherit from each other.<ref name="Lewis 1984, p. 26"/> That would create an incentive to convert if someone from the family had already converted.<ref name="World ">{{cite book |title=Introducing World Christianity |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |author=Heather J. Sharkey |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4443-4454-7 |page=10}}</ref> The jurists and scholars of Islamic sharia law called for humane treatment of the dhimmis.<ref>Lewis (1984), p. 16.</ref>

===Jizya tax===
{{Main|Jizya}}
Payment of the ''jizya'' obligated Muslim authorities to protect dhimmis in civil and military matters. Sura 9 ([[At-Tawba]]), [[At-Tawba 29|verse 29]] stipulates that ''jizya'' be exacted from non-Muslims as a condition required for jihad to cease.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Failure to pay the ''jizya'' could result in the pledge of protection of a dhimmi's life and property becoming void, with the dhimmi facing the alternatives of conversion, enslavement, death or imprisonment, as advocated by [[Abu Yusuf]], the chief ''[[qadi]]'', or religious judge, of [[Abbasid]] caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] who ruled over much of modern-day [[Iraq]].<ref name="lewis1415">Lewis (1984), pp. 14–15.</ref>

Lewis notes there are varying opinions among scholars as to how much of a burden jizya was.<ref name="lewis1415"/> According to [[Norman Stillman]]: "''jizya'' and ''[[kharaj]]'' were a crushing burden for the non-Muslim peasantry who eked out a bare living in a subsistence economy."<ref>Stillman (1979), p. 28</ref> Both agree that ultimately, the additional taxation on non-Muslims was a critical factor that drove many dhimmis to leave their religion and accept Islam.<ref name=autogenerated1>Lewis (1984), p. 17–18; Stillman (1979), p. 18</ref> However, in some regions the jizya on populations was significantly lower than the zakat, meaning dhimmi populations maintained an economic advantage.<ref>Klorman (2007), p. 94</ref> According to Cohen, taxation, from the perspective of dhimmis who came under Muslim rule, was "a concrete continuation of the taxes paid to earlier regimes".<ref name="Cahen"/> Lewis observes that the change from Byzantine to Arab rule was welcomed by many among the dhimmis who found the new yoke far lighter than the old, both in taxation and in other matters, and that some, even among the Christians of Syria and Egypt, preferred the rule of Islam to that of Byzantines.<ref name="Lewis p57">Lewis (2002) p. 57</ref> In some places, for example Egypt, the jizya was a [[tax incentive]] for Christians to convert to Islam.<ref name="World " />

The importance of dhimmis as a source of revenue for the Muslim community is illuminated in a letter ascribed to Umar I and cited by Abu Yusuf: "if we take dhimmis and share them out, what will be left for the Muslims who come after us? By God, Muslims would not find a man to talk to and profit from his labors."<ref>Lewis (1984), pp. 30–31.</ref>

Most Islamic scholars agree that jizya must be levied only upon adult males. In an important early account, [[Malik ibn Anas]]' ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik]]'' reports that the jizya was collected from non-Muslim men only, and additional taxes were to be levied against dhimmis who travelled on business:
{{Quote|"The [[sunnah]] is that there is no jizya due from women or children of people of the Book, and that jizya is only taken from men who have reached puberty. The people of dhimma ... do not have to pay any zakat. ... This is because zakat is imposed on the Muslims to purify them and to be given back to their poor, whereas jizya is imposed on the people of the Book to humble them."|Malik ibn Anas|''Muwatta Imam Malik''<ref>{{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=yes|17|24|46|}}</ref>}}

The early Islamic scholars took a relatively humane and practical attitude towards the collection of ''jizya'', compared to the 11th century commentators writing when Islam was under threat both at home and abroad.<ref name="Lewis 1984 p. 15">Lewis (1984), p. 15.</ref>

The jurist Abu Yusuf, the chief judge of the caliph Harun Al-Rashid, rules as follows regarding the manner of collecting the jizya <ref name="Lewis 1984 p. 15" />

{{Quote|No one of the people of the dhimma should be beaten in order to exact payment of the jizya, nor made to stand in the hot sun, nor should hateful things be inflicted upon their bodies, or anything of that sort. Rather they should be treated with leniency.}}

In the border provinces, dhimmis were sometimes recruited for military operations. In such cases, they were exempted from jizya for the year of service.<ref>"Djizya (i)", ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' Online</ref>

===Administration of law===
Religious pluralism existed in medieval Islamic law and [[Islamic ethics|ethics]]. The religious laws and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as exemplified in the [[Caliphate]], [[Al-Andalus]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and Indian subcontinent.<ref name=Weeramantry-138>{{cite book|last=Weeramantry|first=Judge Christopher G.|title=Justice Without Frontiers: Furthering Human Rights|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-411-0241-8|page=138}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Islamic Roots of Democratic Pluralism|first=Abdulaziz Abdulhussein|last=Sachedina|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-513991-7}}</ref> In medieval Islamic societies, the qadi (Islamic judges) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily chose to be judged according to Islamic law. The dhimmi communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who had their own Halakha courts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R. Cohen]]|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fgbib5exskUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cohen+Under+Crescent+and+Cross&q|accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref>

Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems. However, dhimmis frequently attended the Muslim courts in order to record property and business transactions within their own communities. Cases were taken out against Muslims, against other dhimmis and even against members of the dhimmi's own family. Dhimmis often took cases relating to marriage, divorce or inheritance to the Muslim courts so these cases would be decided under sharia law. Oaths sworn by dhimmis in the Muslim courts were sometimes the same as the oaths taken by Muslims, sometimes tailored to the dhimmis' beliefs.<ref name="al-Qattan-99">al-Qattan (1999)</ref>

Muslim men could generally marry dhimmi women who are considered People of the Book, however Islamic jurists rejected the possibility any non-Muslim man might marry a Muslim woman.<ref>Al-Mawardi (2000), p. 161; Friedmann (2003), p. 161; Lewis (1984), p. 27.</ref> Bernard Lewis notes that "similar position existed under the laws of Byzantine Empire, according to which a Christian could marry a Jewish woman, but a Jew could not marry a Christian woman under pain of death".<ref name="Lewis 1984, p. 27"/>

==Relevant texts==

===Quranic verses as a basis for Islamic policies toward dhimmis===
Lewis states
* The phrase "Let there be no compulsion in religion: ...", from ''[[sura]]'' 2 ([[Al-Baqara]]), ''[[ayah]]'' 256,<ref>{{cite quran|2|256|s=ns}}</ref> has sometimes been interpreted in the Islamic legal and theological traditions to mean followers of other religions should not be forced to adopt Islam <ref name="Lewis14">Lewis (1984) p. 13</ref> - however, it is often interpreted as also meaning, on the face of the words used (as they are not qualified), that Muslims should not be punished where they adopt another, or no, religious belief; a hadith records an instance of this, where Mohammed imposed no punishment
* The phrase "Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion.", from sura 109 ([[Al-Kafirun]]), ayah 6,<ref>{{cite quran|109|6|s=ns}}</ref> has been used as a "proof-text for pluralism and coexistence".<ref name="Lewis14" />
* In sura 2 (Al-Baqara) the verse 62<ref>{{cite quran|2|62|s=ns}}</ref> has served to justify the tolerated position accorded to the followers of Christianity, Judaism, and Sabianism under Muslim rule.<ref name="Lewis14" />

===Hadith===
{{See also|Jizya#Hadith sources}}

A hadith by Muhammad, "Whoever killed a Mu'ahid (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling).",<ref>{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|83|49}}</ref> is considered to be a foundation for the protection of the People of the Book in Muslim ruled countries.<ref>[http://khilaafah.com/systems/belief/non-muslim/khilafah_4.html Rights of Non-Muslims Under Islamic Governance<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Majid Khadduri]] cites a similar hadith in regard to the status of the dhimmis: "Whoever wrongs one with whom a compact (treaty) has been made ''[i.e., a dhimmi]'' and lays on him a burden beyond his strength, I will be his accuser."<ref>Majid Khadduri: ''War and Peace in the Law of Islam'', p. 175</ref>

===Constitution of Medina===
A precedent for the dhimma contract was established with the agreement between Muhammad and the Jews after the [[Battle of Khaybar]], an oasis near [[Medina]]. [[Khaybar]] was the first territory attacked and conquered by Muslims. When the Jews of Khaybar surrendered to Muhammad after a siege, Muhammad allowed them to remain in Khaybar in return for handing over to the Muslims one half their annual produce.<ref name="Lewis">Lewis (1984), pp. 10–11</ref>

After Mecca was brought under Islamic rule, deputations from tribes across [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] came to make terms with Muhammad and the Muslims. The [[Constitution of Medina]], a formal agreement between Muhammad and all the significant tribes and families of Medina (including Muslims, Jews and pagans), declared that non-Muslims in the [[Ummah]] had the following rights:<ref>Ahmed (1979), pp. 46–7.</ref>
# The security (''dhimma'') of God is equal for all groups,<ref>Article 15, as quoted in Ahmed (1979), pp. 46–47.</ref>
# Non-Muslim members have equal political and cultural rights as Muslims. They will have autonomy and freedom of religion.<ref>Article 25, as quoted in Ahmed (1979), pp. 46–47.</ref>
# Non-Muslims will take up arms against the enemy of the [[Ummah]] and share the cost of war. There is to be no treachery between the two.<ref>Article 37, as quoted in Ahmed (1979), pp. 46–47.</ref>
# Non-Muslims will not be obliged to take part in religious wars of the Muslims.<ref>Article 45, as quoted in Ahmed (1979), pp. 46–47.</ref>

===Pact of Umar===
{{Main|Pact of Umar}}
The [[Pact of Umar]],<ref>also in some texts, Omar</ref> traditionally believed to be between caliph [[Umar]] and the conquered Jerusalem Christians in the seventh century, was another source of regulations pertaining to dhimmis. However, Western [[orientalism|orientalists]] doubt the authenticity of the pact, arguing it is usually the victors and not the vanquished who impose rather than propose, the terms of peace, and that it is highly unlikely that the people who spoke no Arabic and knew nothing of Islam could draft such a document. Academic historians believe the Pact of Umar in the form it is known today was a product of later jurists who attributed it to Umar in order to lend greater authority to their own opinions. The similarities between the Pact of Umar and the [[Theodosian dynasty|Theodosian]] and [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian Codes]] of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] suggest that perhaps much of the Pact of Umar was borrowed from these earlier codes by later Islamic jurists. At least some of the clauses of the pact mirror the measures first introduced by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Umar II]] or by the early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphs.<ref>Lewis (1984), pp. 24–25.</ref>

==Cultural interactions and cultural differences==
During the Middle Ages, local associations known as ''[[futuwwa]]'' clubs developed across the Islamic lands. There were usually several futuwwah in each town. These clubs catered to varying interests, primarily sports, and might involve distinctive manners of dress and custom. They were known for their hospitality, idealism and loyalty to the group. They often had a militaristic aspect, purportedly for the mutual protection of the membership. These clubs commonly crossed social strata, including among their membership local notables, dhimmi and slaves – to the exclusion of those associated with the local ruler, or [[Emir|amir]].<ref>[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''[[The Venture of Islam]] Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 2''. [[The University of Chicago]], 1961, pp. 126–127.</ref>

Muslims and Jews were sometimes partners in trade, with the Muslim taking days off on Fridays and Jews taking off on Saturdays.<ref>[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''[[The Venture of Islam]] Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol. 1''. [[The University of Chicago]], 1961, p. 302.</ref>

Andrew Wheatcroft describes how some social customs such as different conceptions of dirt and cleanliness made it difficult for the religious communities to live close to each other, either under Muslim or under Christian rule.<ref>Wheatcroft (2003) p. 73.</ref>

== In modern times ==

The dhimma and the jizya poll tax are no longer imposed in Muslim majority countries.<ref name=iwt738>{{cite book|title=Islam in the World Today|date=2010|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801445712|page=738|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-dM4hPlxMw8C&pg=PA738|author=Werner Ende|author2=Udo Steinbach }}</ref> In the 21st century, jizya is widely regarded as being at odds with contemporary secular conceptions of citizen's civil rights and equality before the law, although there have been occasional reports of religious minorities in conflict zones and areas subject to political instability being forced to pay jizya.<ref name=ipt-p283>{{cite book|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691134840|pages=283–284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q1I0pcrFFSUC&pg=PA283|author=Matthew Long (jizya entry author)}}</ref>

In 2009 it was claimed that a group of militants that referred to themselves as the [[Taliban]] imposed the ''jizya'' on Pakistan's minority [[Sikhs in Pakistan|Sikh community]] after occupying some of their homes and kidnapping a Sikh leader.<ref>http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090417/world.htm#6</ref>

As late as 2013, in Egypt ''jizya'' was reportedly being imposed by the Muslim Brotherhood on 15,000 Christian Copts of Dalga village.<ref>http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/10/egypts-muslim-brotherhood-convert-islam-or-pay-jiz/, http://www.aina.org/news/20130913143703.htm</ref>

In February 2014, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) announced that it intended to extract jizya from Christians in the city of [[Raqqa]], Syria, which it controls. Christians who refused to accept the dhimma contract and pay the tax would have to either convert to Islam or die. Wealthy Christians would have to pay half an ounce of gold, the equivalent of USD 664 twice a year; middle-class Christians would have to pay half that amount and poorer ones would be charged one-fourth that amount.<ref name="raqqa">{{cite web|url=http://world.time.com/2014/02/28/al-qaeda-in-syria-extorts-christians/|title=Al-Qaeda Rebels in Syria Tell Christians to Pay Up or Die}}</ref> In June, the [[Institute for the Study of War]] reported that ISIL claims to have collected jizya and fay.<ref name="ISWJune30">{{cite web|last1=Caris|first1=Charlie|title=The Islamic State Announces Caliphate|url=http://iswiraq.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/the-islamic-state-announces-caliphate.html|publisher=Institute for the Study of War|accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref> On July 18, 2014 the ISIL ordered the Christians in [[Mosul]] to accept the dhimma contract and pay the Jizya or convert to Islam.
