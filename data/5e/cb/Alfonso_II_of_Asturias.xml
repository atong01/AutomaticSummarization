The events of his reign are in reality almost unknown. Poets of a later generation invented the story of the secret marriage of his sister Ximena to Sancho, count of Saldana, and the feats of their son<space/><link><target>Bernardo del Carpio</target></link>. Bernardo is the hero of a<space/><italics><link><target>cantar de gesta</target></link></italics><space/>(<italics>chanson de geste</italics>) written to please the anarchical spirit of the nobles.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Andalusian raids into Asturias</heading><paragraph>On accession to the throne, son of<space/><link><target>Abd ar-Rahman I</target></link><space/><link><target>Hisham I of Crdoba</target><part>Hisham I</part></link><space/>commenced a string of military campaigns to the eastern Pyrenees and to the north-west. In 794 a raid spearheaded by Abd al-Karim dealt a major military blow to Alfonso II on the eastern fringes of the Kingdom of Asturias (Cantabria and Castile). The Asturian king asked then for the assistance of the<space/><link><target>Basque people</target><part>Basque</part></link><space/>Frankish vassal Belasco, master of<space/><link><target>lava</target></link><space/>and bordering regions at the time. Abd al-Karim campaigned deeper west into Asturias, and pillaged the region, while his brother Abd al-Malik ventured into the western Asturian lands.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Relations with Charlemagne and the Papacy</heading><paragraph>Confronted with heavy fire, Alfonso II reached out to<space/><link><target>Charlemagne</target></link>'s Franks. He sent delegations to<space/><link><target>Toulouse</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Aix-la-Chapelle</target></link><space/>in 796, 797, and 798. These diplomacy efforts may have aimed to strengthen his legitimacy and the government structures of Asturias against ongoing internal unresttroubles in Galiciaand external attacks of the Ibn Mugait brothers, i.e. generals Abd al-Karim and Abd al-Malik.</paragraph><paragraph>Alfonso was acknowledged as a king by Charlemagne and the Pope, and Asturias as a kingdom for the first time. The king showed an interest in the Frankish cult of Saint Martin of Tours, and most notably he encouraged Carolingian Church influence into Asturias. Not surprisingly, during Alfonso's reign the alleged resting-place of St. James was revealed. Alfonso's envoys to Charlemagne's courts may have also dealt with the<space/><link><target>adoptionist</target></link><space/>controversy, which had brought Bermudo's kingdom into Charlemagne's view. It seems that Carolingian support did much to spur his military raid into Andalusian territory up to<space/><link><target>Lisbon</target></link>. The Andalusian city in turn was captured and sacked by his troops in 798.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Later events</heading><paragraph>In 825 he defeated Cordovan forces at<space/><link><target>Narn</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Anceo</target></link><space/>(825) and, thanks to these victories, the &quot;repopulation&quot; of parts of<space/><link><target>Gallaecia</target><part>Galicia</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Len (province)</target><part>Len</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>Castile (historical region)</target><part>Castile</part></link><space/>was started&amp;mdash;charter granting that confirmed the possession of the territories.</paragraph><paragraph>Alfonso also moved the capital from<space/><link><target>Pravia</target></link>, where Silo had located it, to<space/><link><target>Oviedo</target></link>, the city of his father's founding and his birth.
