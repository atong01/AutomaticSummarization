The son of a<space/><link><target>pottery</target><part>potter</part></link><space/>who had moved to Syracuse in about 343 BC, he learned his father's trade, but afterwards entered the army. In 333 BC he married the<space/><link><target>widow</target></link><space/>of his patron Damas, a distinguished and wealthy citizen.

In 310 BC he made a desperate effort to break through the<space/><link><target>blockade</target></link><space/>and attack the enemy in<space/><link><target>Africa</target></link>. In Africa he concluded the treaty with<space/><link><target>Ophellas</target></link>, ruler of<space/><link><target>Cyrenaica</target></link>. After several victories he was at last completely defeated (307 BC) and fled secretly to Sicily.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Chisholm</arg><arg>1911</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>After concluding peace with Carthage in 306 BC, Agathocles styled himself king of Sicily in 304 BC, and established his rule over the<space/><link><target>Greece</target><part>Greek</part></link><space/>cities of the island more firmly than ever. A peace treaty with Carthage left him in control of Sicily east of the<space/><link><target>Halycus</target><part>Halycus River</part></link>. Even in his old age he displayed the same restless energy, and is said to have been contemplating a fresh attack on Carthage at the time of his death.</paragraph><paragraph>His last years were plagued by ill-health and the turbulence of his grandson<space/><link><target>Archagathus (grandson of Agathocles of Syracuse)</target><part>Archagathus</part></link>, at whose instigation he is said to have been<space/><link><target>poison</target><trail>ed</trail></link>; according to others, he died a natural death. He was a born leader of mercenaries, and, although he did not shrink from cruelty to gain his ends, he afterwards showed himself a mild and popular &quot;tyrant.&quot; Agathocles restored the Syracusan democracy on his death bed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king.</paragraph><paragraph>Agathocles was married three times. His first wife was the widow of his patron Damas by whom he had two sons:<space/><link><target>Archagathus (son of Agathocles of Syracuse)</target><part>Archagathus</part></link><space/>and Agathocles, who were both murdered in 307 BC. His second wife was Alcia and they had a daughter called<space/><link><target>Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)</target><part>Lanassa</part></link>, who married as the second wife of King<space/><link><target>Pyrrhus of Epirus</target></link>. His third wife was the<space/><link><target>Ptolemaic dynasty</target><part>Greek Ptolemaic Princess</part></link><space/><link><target>Theoxena of Syracuse</target><part>Theoxena</part></link>, who was the second daughter of<space/><link><target>Berenice I of Egypt</target><part>Berenice I</part></link><space/>from her first husband<space/><link><target>Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)</target><part>Philip</part></link><space/>and was a stepdaughter of<space/><link><target>Ptolemy I Soter</target></link>. Theoxena bore Agathocles two children:<space/><link><target>Archagathus of Libya</target><part>Archagathus</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Theoxena of Egypt</target><part>Theoxena</part></link>. Theoxena survived Agathocles. He had further descendants from his second and third marriage.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Legacy</heading><paragraph>Agathocles was cited as an example &quot;Of Those Who By Their Crimes Come to Be Princes in Chapter VIII of<space/><link><target>Niccol Machiavelli</target></link>s treatise on politics,<space/><italics><link><target>The Prince</target></link></italics><space/>(1513). He was described as behaving as a criminal at every stage of his career. However, he came to &quot;glory&quot; as much as he did brutality by repelling invading Carthaginians and winning the loyalty of the denizens of his land. However, many later disapproved of his actions, including to an extent Machiavelli, who claimed<space/><template><target>quote</target><arg>It cannot be called prowess to kill fellow-citizens, to betray friends, to be treacherous, pitiless, irreligious. ... Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain. Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickednesses do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men.<ref>''The Prince'', Chapter VIII</ref></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Machiavelli goes on to reason that Agathocles' success, in contrast to other criminal tyrants, was due to his ability to mitigate his crimes by limiting them to those that<space/><template><target>quote</target><arg>are applied at one blow and are necessary to one's security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects.</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Notes</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Attribution</defkey></listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>EB1911</target><arg name="wstitle">Agathocles</arg><arg name="volume">1</arg></template></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.third-millennium-library.com/readinghall/GalleryofHistory/AGATHOCLES/DOOR.html'>THE HISTORY OF AGATHOCLES by H.
