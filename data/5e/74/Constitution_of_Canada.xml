In 1784, the two provinces were divided; Nova Scotia was split into Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island (rejoined to Nova Scotia in 1820), Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick, while Quebec was split into Lower Canada (southern Quebec) and Upper Canada (southern through lower northern Ontario). The winter of 183738 saw rebellion in both of the Canadas, with the result they were rejoined as the<space/><link><target>Province of Canada</target></link><space/>in 1841. This was reversed by the<space/><link><target>British North America Act</target></link><space/>in 1867 which established the Dominion of Canada.</paragraph><paragraph>Initially, on 1 July 1867, there were four provinces in confederation as &quot;One dominion under the name of Canada&quot;:<space/><link><target>Canada West</target></link><space/>(former<space/><link><target>Upper Canada</target></link>, now<space/><link><target>Ontario</target></link>),<space/><link><target>Canada East</target></link><space/>(former<space/><link><target>Lower Canada</target></link>, now<space/><link><target>Quebec</target></link>),<space/><link><target>Nova Scotia</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>New Brunswick</target></link>.

Newfoundland never ratified the statute, so it was still subject to imperial authority when its entire system of government and economy collapsed in the mid-1930s. Canada did ratify the statute, but had requested an exception because the Canadian federal and provincial governments could not agree on an amending formula for the Canadian constitution. It would be another 50 years before this was achieved. In the interim, the British parliament periodically passed enabling acts with respect to amendments to Canada's constitution; this was never anything but a<space/><link><target>Rubber stamp (politics)</target><part>rubber stamp</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/prb0004-e.htm<space/></arg><arg name="title">INTERNATIONAL TREATIES: CANADIAN PRACTICE<space/></arg><arg name="first">Daniel<space/></arg><arg name="last">Dupras<space/></arg><arg name="date">3 April 2000<space/></arg><arg name="work">Depository Services Program<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Public Works and Government Services Canada<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">17 December 2010<space/></arg><arg name="quote">"In 1931, under the Statute of Westminster, Canada and a number of other British dominions, acquired full independence(4) and with it authority to act internationally with all the attributes of a sovereign state.

Footnote 4:"Except with respect to amendments to Canada’s Constitution, which remained under the British Parliament’s jurisdiction until 1982."</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>patriation</target></link><space/>of the Canadian constitution was achieved in 1982 when the British parliament, with the assent of the Canadian parliament, passed the<space/><link><target>Canada Act 1982</target><part>Canada Act, 1982</part></link>, which included in its schedules the<space/><link><target>Constitution Act, 1982</target></link>, the United Kingdom thus formally absolving itself of any remaining responsibility for, or jurisdiction over, Canada. In a formal ceremony on<space/><link><target>Parliament Hill</target></link><space/>in Ottawa, Queen<space/><link><target>Elizabeth II</target></link><space/>proclaimed both acts as law on 17 April 1982. Constitution Act, 1982, included the<space/><link><target>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</target></link>. Prior to the charter, there were various statutes which protected an assortment of civil rights and obligations, but nothing was enshrined in the constitution until 1982. The charter has thus placed a strong focus upon individual and collective rights of the people of Canada.</paragraph><paragraph>Enactment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms has also fundamentally changed much of Canadian constitutional law. The<space/><link><target>Magna Carta</target></link>, which has constitutional status in Canada, was occasionally called into service in legal argument. Since 1982, however, the arguments have been easier to make, because lawyers have been able to cite the relevant sections of the constitution rather than rely upon legal abstraction. The act also codified many previously oral constitutional conventions and has made amendment of the constitution significantly more difficult. Previously, the Canadian federal constitution could be amended by solitary act of the Canadian or British parliaments, by formal or informal agreement between the federal and provincial governments, or even simply by adoption as ordinary custom of an oral convention or unwritten tradition that was perceived to be the best way to do something. Since the act, amendments must now conform to certain specified provisions in the written portion of the Canadian constitution.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Constitution Act, 1867</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Constitution Act, 1867</arg></template>This was an Act of the British parliament, originally called the British North America Act 1867. It outlined Canada's system of government, which combines Britain's Westminster model of parliamentary government with division of sovereignty (<link><target>Canadian federalism</target><part>federalism</part></link>). Although it is the first of 20<space/><link><target>British North America Acts</target></link>, it is still the most famous of these and is understood to be the document of Canadian Confederation. With the patriation of the Constitution in 1982, this Act was renamed<space/><italics>Constitution Act, 1867</italics>. In recent years, the 1867 document has mainly served as the basis on which the division of powers between the provinces and federal government have been analyzed.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Constitution Act, 1982</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Constitution Act, 1982</arg></template>Endorsed by all provincial governments except that of Quebec (led by<space/><link><target>Ren Lvesque</target></link>), this was the formal Act of Parliament that effected Canada's full political independence from the<space/><link><target>United Kingdom</target></link>. Part V of this act established an amending formula for the Canadian constitution, the lack of which (due to more than 50 years of disagreement between the federal and provincial governments) was the only reason Canada's constitutional amendments still required approval by the British parliament after ratification of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.</paragraph><paragraph>The Act was enacted as a schedule to the Canada Act 1982, a British Act of Parliament which was introduced at the request of a joint address to the Queen by the Senate and House of Commons of Canada. As a bilingual act of parliament, the Canada Act 1982 has the distinction of being the only legislation in French that has been passed by an English or British parliament since Norman French (<link><target>Law French</target></link>) ceased to be the language of government in England. In addition to enacting the Constitution Act, 1982, the Canada Act 1982 provides that no further British Acts of Parliament will apply to Canada as part of its law, finalizing Canada's legislative independence.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</arg></template>As noted above, this is Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Charter is the constitutional guarantee of the civil rights and liberties of every citizen in Canada, such as freedom of expression, of religion, and of mobility. Part II addresses the rights of Canada's Aboriginal people.</paragraph><paragraph>It is written in plain language in order to ensure accessibility to the average citizen. It only applies to government and government actions with the intention to prevent government from creating laws that are unconstitutional.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Amending formula</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Amendments to the Constitution of Canada</arg></template>Instead of the usual parliamentary procedure, that includes the monarch's formal<space/><link><target>Royal Assent</target></link><space/>for enacting legislation, amendments to the Constitution Act, 1982 must be done in accordance with Part V of the Constitution Act, 1982, which provides for five different amending formulae. Amendments can be brought forward under section 46(1) by any province or either level of the federal government. The general formula is set out in section 38(1), known as the &quot;7/50 formula&quot;, requires: (a) assent from both the House of Commons and the Senate; (b) the approval of two-thirds of the provincial legislatures (at least seven provinces) representing at least 50% of the population (effectively, this would include at least Quebec or Ontario, as they are the most populous provinces). This formula specifically applies to amendments related to the proportionate representation in Parliament, powers, selection, and composition of the Senate, the Supreme Court and the addition of provinces or territories.</paragraph><paragraph>The other amendment formulae are for exceptional cases as provided by in the act. In the case of an amendment related to the<space/><link><target>Monarchy of Canada</target><part>Office of the Queen</part></link>, the use of either official language (subject to section 43), the amending formula itself, or the composition of the Supreme Court, the amendment must be adopted by unanimous consent of all the provinces in accordance with section 41. In the case of an amendment related to provincial boundaries or the use of an official language within a province alone, the amendment must be passed by the legislatures affected by the amendment (section 43). In the case of an amendment that affects the federal government only, the amendment does not need approval of the provinces (section 44). The same applies to amendments affecting the provincial government alone (section 45).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Vandalism of the proclamation paper</heading><paragraph>In 1983, Peter Greyson, an art student, entered Ottawa's National Archives (known today as<space/><link><target>Library and Archives Canada</target></link>) and poured red paint mixed with glue over a copy of the proclamation of the 1982 constitutional amendment. He said he was displeased with the federal government's decision to allow United States missile testing in Canada and had wanted to &quot;graphically illustrate to Canadians&quot; how wrong he believed the government to be.
