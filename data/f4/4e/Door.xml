Similar exterior structures are called<space/><link><target>gate</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Typically, doors have an interior side that faces the inside of a space and an exterior side that faces the outside of that space. While in some cases the interior side of a door may match its exterior side, in other cases there are sharp contrasts between the two sides, such as in the case of the<space/><link><target>vehicle door</target></link>. Doors normally consist of a panel that swings on hinges or that slides or spins inside of a space.</paragraph><paragraph>When open, doors admit<space/><link><target>people</target></link>,<space/><link><target>animals</target></link>,<space/><link><target>ventilation (architecture)</target><part>ventilation</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>light</target></link>. The door is used to control the physical<space/><link><target>atmosphere</target></link><space/>within a space by enclosing the<space/><link><target>air draft</target><trail>s</trail></link>, so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled. Doors are significant in preventing the spread of<space/><link><target>fire</target></link>. They also act as a barrier to<space/><link><target>noise</target></link>. Many doors are equipped with locking mechanisms to allow entrance to certain people and keep out others. As a form of courtesy and civility, people often knock before opening a door and entering a room.</paragraph><paragraph>Doors are used to screen areas of a building for aesthetics, keeping formal and utility areas separate.

The Hildesheim design affected the concept of<space/><link><target>Gniezno Doors</target><part>Gniezno door</part></link><space/>in Poland. Of others in South Italy and Sicily, the following are the finest: in Sant Andrea,<space/><link><target>Amalfi</target></link><space/>(1060);<space/><link><target>Salerno</target></link><space/>(1099);<space/><link><target>Canosa</target></link><space/>(1111);<space/><link><target>Troia (FG)</target><part>Troia</part></link>, two doors (1119 and 1124);<space/><link><target>Ravello</target></link><space/>(1179), by Barisano of Trani, who also made doors for<space/><link><target>Trani</target></link><space/>cathedral; and in<space/><link><target>Monreale</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Duomo di Pisa</target><part>Pisa</part></link><space/>cathedrals, by Bonano of Pisa. In all these cases the hanging stile had pivots at the top and bottom. The exact period when the hinge was substituted is not quite known, but the change apparently brought about another method of strengthening and decorating doors, viz, with wrought-iron bands of infinite varieties of design. As a rule three bands from which the ornamental work springs constitute the hinges, which have rings outside the hanging stiles fitting on to vertical tenons run into the masonry or wooden frame. There is an early example of the 12th century in<space/><link><target>Lincoln Cathedral</target><part>Lincoln</part></link>; in France the metal work of the doors of<space/><link><target>Notre Dame de Paris</target><part>Notre Dame</part></link><space/>at Paris is perhaps the most beautiful in execution, but examples are endless throughout France and England.</paragraph><paragraph>Returning to Italy, the most celebrated doors are those of the<space/><link><target>Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)</target></link>, which together with the door frames are all in bronze, the borders of the latter being perhaps the most remarkable: the modeling of the figures, birds and foliage of the south doorway, by<space/><link><target>Andrea Pisano</target></link><space/>(1330), and of the east doorway by<space/><link><target>Lorenzo Ghiberti</target><part>Ghiberti</part></link><space/>(14251452), are of great beauty; in the north door (14021424) Ghiberti adopted the same scheme of design for the paneling and figure subjects in them as Andrea Pisano, but in the east door the rectangular panels are all filled, with bas-reliefs, in which Scripture subjects are illustrated with innumerable figures, these being probably the gates of Paradise of which<space/><link><target>Michelangelo</target></link><space/>speaks.</paragraph><paragraph>The doors of the mosques in<space/><link><target>Cairo</target></link><space/>were of two kinds; those which, externally, were cased with sheets of bronze or iron, cut out in decorative patterns, and incised or inlaid, with bosses in relief; and those in wood, which were framed with interlaced designs of the square and diamond, this latter description of work being<space/><link><target>Copt</target><trail>ic</trail></link><space/>in its origin.

The selfbolting door principle can be used both for hinged doors as for rotating doors, as well as up-and-over doors (in the latter case, the bolts are then placed at top and bottom rather than at the sides).</paragraph><paragraph><bold>French doors</bold><space/>are derived from an original French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels would be in a casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel at the bottom of the door.

The doors can slide in either direction along one axis on parallel overhead tracks, sliding past each other. They are most commonly used in closets, in order to access one side of the closet at a time. The doors in a bypass unit will overlap slightly when viewed from the front, in order not to have a visible gap between them.</paragraph><paragraph>Doors which slide between two wall panels are called<space/><bold><link><target>pocket door</target><trail>s</trail></link></bold>.</paragraph><paragraph>Sliding glass doors are common in many houses, particularly as an entrance to the backyard.

High Speed Clean Room Doors are used in Pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames. They guarantee the tightness of all accesses. The powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges. Therefore, they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded. High-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings, generally more than 200000 a year. They need to be built with heavy duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function. The door curtain was originally made of PVC, but was later also developed in aluminium and acrylic glass sections.

Such doors pose a substantial fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards in the event of an emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a switch mechanism, disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the closed position, power is restored.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Rebated doors</bold>, a term chiefly used in Britain, are double doors having a lip or overlap (i.e. a<space/><link><target>Rabbet</target></link>) on the vertical edge(s) where they meet.

Without the door stop damage might be done to the wall. They may either absorb the force of a moving door, or hold the door in place to prevent unintended motion.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Door guards</heading><paragraph>The purpose of door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger trapping devices, or finger guards) is to reduce the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.</paragraph><paragraph>There are various levels of door protection. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear hinge pin side of the door unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.Which level of protection is appropriate should be determined by a<space/><link><target>risk assessment</target></link><space/>of the door.</paragraph><paragraph>There is also handle-side door protection, which prevents the door from slamming shut on the frame, which can cause injury to fingers/hands.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Safety doors</heading><paragraph>A safety door prevents finger injuries near the hinges without the use of door guards. Rather than cover the danger area, the approach is to change the shape of the door so that an accessible gap does not form in the first place. This is achieved by adding a perfectly circular (&quot;bull-nose&quot; shaped) extension to the door, which moves in and out of a cavity as the door opens and closes. This prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges either inside or outside. These doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees, so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open (or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a<space/><link><target>doorstop</target></link>).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Glass doors</heading><paragraph><link><target>Arcadia door</target><part>Glass doors</part></link><space/>pose the risk of unintentional collision if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all.
