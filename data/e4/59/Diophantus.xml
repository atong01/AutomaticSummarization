Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that [[Ptolemy]] and Diophantus, [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] and [[Hypatia]] were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privaleged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become "Hellenized," to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist."</arg></template></extension><space/>and the author of a series of books called<space/><italics><link><target>Arithmetica</target></link></italics>, many of which are now lost.

Editions of Arithmetica exerted a profound influence on the development of algebra in Europe in the late sixteenth and through the 17th and 18th centuries. Diophantus and his works have also influenced<space/><link><target>Arab mathematics</target></link><space/>and were of great fame among Arab mathematicians. Diophantus' work created a foundation for work on algebra and in fact much of advanced mathematics is based on algebra. As far as we know Diophantus did not affect the lands of the Orient much and how much he affected India is a matter of debate.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The father of algebra?</heading><paragraph>Diophantus is often called the father of algebra&quot; because he contributed greatly to number theory, mathematical notation, and because Arithmetica contains the earliest known use of syncopated notation.<extension extension_name='ref'>Carl B.

For this, and other, reasons mathematical historian<space/><link><target>Kurt Vogel</target></link><space/>writes: Diophantus was not, as he has often been called, the father of algebra. Nevertheless, his remarkable, if unsystematic, collection of indeterminate problems is a singular achievement that was not fully appreciated and further developed until much later.<extension extension_name='ref'>Harald Kittel,<space/><italics>bersetzung: ein internationales Handbuch zur bersetzungsforschung</italics>, Volume 2 p. 1123, 1124</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Diophantine analysis</heading><paragraph><template><target>see also</target><arg>Diophantine equation</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Today, Diophantine analysis is the area of study where integer (whole-number) solutions are sought for equations, and Diophantine equations are polynomial equations with integer coefficients to which only integer solutions are sought. It is usually rather difficult to tell whether a given Diophantine equation is solvable. Most of the problems in Arithmetica lead to quadratic equations. Diophantus looked at 3 different types of quadratic equations:<space/><extension extension_name='math'>ax^2 + bx = c</extension>,<space/><extension extension_name='math'>ax^2 = bx + c</extension>, and<space/><extension extension_name='math'>ax^2 + c = bx</extension>. The reason why there were three cases to Diophantus, while today we have only one case, is that he did not have any notion for zero and he avoided negative coefficients by considering the given numbers<space/><extension extension_name='math'>a, b, c</extension><space/>to all be positive in each of the three cases above. Diophantus was always satisfied with a rational solution and did not require a whole number which means he accepted fractions as solutions to his problems. Diophantus considered negative or irrational square root solutions &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;meaningless&quot;, and even &quot;absurd&quot;. To give one specific example, he calls the equation<space/><extension extension_name='math'>4 = 4x + 20</extension><space/>'absurd' because it would lead to a negative value for<space/><italics>x</italics>. One solution was all he looked for in a quadratic equation. There is no evidence that suggests Diophantus even realized that there could be two solutions to a quadratic equation. He also considered simultaneous quadratic equations.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Mathematical notation</heading><paragraph>Diophantus made important advances in mathematical notation, becoming the first person known to use algebraic notation and symbolism. Before him everyone wrote out equations completely. Diophantus introduced an algebraic symbolism that used an abridged notation for frequently occurring operations, and an abbreviation for the unknown and for the powers of the unknown. Mathematical historian Kurt Vogel states:<extension extension_name='ref'>Kurt Vogel,<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830901182.html'>&quot;Diophantus of Alexandria.&quot;</link><space/>in Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, Encyclopedia.com, 2008.</extension><extension extension_name='blockquote'>The symbolism that Diophantus introduced for the first time, and undoubtedly devised himself, provided a short and readily comprehensible means of expressing an equation... Since an abbreviation is also employed for the word equals, Diophantus took a fundamental step from verbal algebra towards symbolic algebra.</extension>Although Diophantus made important advances in symbolism, he still lacked the necessary notation to express more general methods. This caused his work to be more concerned with particular problems rather than general situations. Some of the limitations of Diophantus' notation are that he only had notation for one unknown and, when problems involved more than a single unknown, Diophantus was reduced to expressing &quot;first unknown&quot;, &quot;second unknown&quot;, etc. in words. He also lacked a symbol for a general number n. Where we would write<space/><extension extension_name='math'>(12 + 6n)/(n^2 -3)</extension>, Diophantus has to resort to constructions like : ... a sixfold number increased by twelve, which is divided by the difference by which the square of the number exceeds three.</paragraph><paragraph>Algebra still had a long way to go before very general problems could be written down and solved succinctly.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>ErdsDiophantine graph</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Diophantus II.VIII</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Polynomial Diophantine equation</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>Notes</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target><arg name="colwidth">60em</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>Allard, A. &quot;Les scolies aux arithmtiques de Diophante d'Alexandrie dans le Matritensis Bibl.Nat.4678 et les Vatican Gr.191 et 304&quot;<space/><italics>Byzantion</italics><space/>53.
