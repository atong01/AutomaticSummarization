'''Draco''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|r|eɪ|k|oʊ}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Δράκων}}, ''Drakōn''; fl. c. 7th century BC) was the first recorded [[legislator]] of [[Athens]] in [[Ancient Greece]]. He replaced the prevailing system of [[oral law]] and [[blood feud]] by a written [[Code (law)|code]] to be enforced only by a court. Draco's written law became known for its harshness, with the adjective "'''draconian'''" referring to similarly unforgiving rules or laws.

== Life ==
During the 39th [[Olympiad]], in 622 or 621 BC, Draco established the legal code with which he is identified.

Little is known about his life. He may have belonged to the Greek nobility of Attica, with which the 10th-century [[Suda]] text records him as contemporaneous, prior to the period of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]. It also relates a [[folklore|folkloric]] story of his death in the [[Aegina|Aeginetan]] theatre.<ref>Cobham, Ebenezer. [http://books.google.com/books?oe=UTF-8&id=fzoFAAAAYAAJ ''The Reader's Handbook of Allusions, References, Plots and Stories''], p. 451.</ref> In a traditional ancient Greek show of approval, his supporters "threw so many hats and shirts and cloaks on his head that he suffocated, and was buried in that same theatre".<ref>Suidas. "[http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?login=guest&enlogin=guest&db=REAL&field=adlerhw_gr&searchstr=delta,1495&filter=CD-Unicode {{lang|grc|Δράκων}}]".  ''Suda On Line''.

==Draconian constitution==
{{main|Draconian constitution}}
The [[law]]s ({{lang|grc|θεσμοί}} - ''thesmoi'') he laid down were the first written [[Constitution of the Athenians|constitution of Athens]]. So that no one would be unaware of them, they were posted on wooden tablets ({{lang|grc|ἄξονες}} - ''axones''), where they were preserved for almost two centuries, on [[stele]]s of the shape of [[tetrahedron|three-sided pyramids]] ({{lang|grc|κύρβεις}} - ''kyrbeis''). {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The tablets were called ''axones'', perhaps because they could be pivoted along the pyramid's axis, to read any side.
The constitution featured several major innovations:
*Instead of oral laws known to a special class, arbitrarily applied and interpreted, all laws were written, thus made known to all literate citizens (who could appeal to the [[Areopagus]] for injustices): "...&nbsp;the constitution formed under Draco, when the first code of laws was drawn up." ([[Aristotle]]: [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/athemain.asp Athenian Constitution], [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/athe5.asp Part 5, Section 41])
*The laws distinguish between [[murder]] and [[involuntary homicide]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The laws, however, were particularly harsh. For example, any [[debt]]or whose status was lower than that of his [[Credit (finance)|credit]]or was forced into slavery.<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=2GbgfLmCR-YC&pg=PA117 Morris Silver. "Economic Structures of Antiquity". Ed. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995. ISBN 9780313293801. P. 117 ]</ref> The punishment was more lenient for those owing a debt to a member of a lower class. The [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] was the punishment for even minor [[offence (law)|offences]], such as "stealing a cabbage".<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=RTOx0OMpEfYC&pg=PA160 J. David Hirschel,&nbsp;William O. Wakefield. "Criminal Justice in England and the United States". Ed. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995. ISBN 9780275941338. P. 160 ]</ref> Concerning the liberal use of the death penalty in the Draconic code, [[Plutarch]] states: "It was a lot for himself{{clarifyme|date=October 2015}}, when asked why he had fixed the punishment of death for most offences, answered that he considered these lesser crimes to deserve it, and he had no greater punishment for more important ones."<ref>Plutarch (translation by Stewart; Long, George). [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14033/14033-h/14033-h.htm#LIFE_OF_SOLON ''Life of Solon'', XVII].  [[gutenberg.org]].</ref>

All his laws were repealed by [[Solon]] in the early 6th century BC, with the exception of the homicide law.<ref>Aristotle, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Ath.+Pol.+7.1 ''Athenian Constitution'', 7.1].</ref>

==Law of Homicide==
After much debate among the Athenians, it was decided to revise the laws, including the homicide law, in 409 BC.<ref>[http://www.ledonline.it/Dike/allegati/Dike3_Volonakis.pdf].</ref> The homicide law is a highly fragmented inscription, but it does state that it is up to the victim's relatives to prosecute a killer. According to the preserved part of the inscription, unintentional homicides received a sentence of exile. It is not clear whether Draco's law specified the punishment for intentional homicide. In 409 BC, intentional homicide was punished by death, but Draco's law begins καὶ ἐὰμ μὲ ‘κ [π]ρονοί[α]ς [κ]τ[ένει τίς τινα, φεύγ]ε[ν], which is ambiguous and difficult to translate. One possible translation offers 'Even if a man not intentionally kills another, he is exiled',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gagarin|first1=Michael|title=Drakon and early Athenian homicide law|date=1981|publisher=Yale U.P.|location=New York|isbn=0300026277}}</ref> which leads to the presumption that exile must have been the normal penalty for intentional homicide at the time Draco wrote his law.

==Council of Four Hundred==
Draco introduced the lot-chosen Council of Four Hundred  <ref>Aristotle. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0046%3Achapter%3D4%3Asection%3D3 ''The Athenian Constitution'', 4.3].</ref>&mdash;distinct from the [[Areopagus]]&mdash;which evolved in later constitutions to play a large role in [[Athenian democracy]]. Aristotle notes that Draco, while having the laws written, merely legislated for an existing unwritten Athenian constitution,<ref>Aristotle. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058&query=section%3D%2347&layout=&loc=2.1274a ''Politics'', 1274a].</ref> such as setting exact qualifications for eligibility for office.

Draco extended the [[suffrage|franchise]] to all free men who could furnish themselves with a set of military equipment. They elected the Council of Four Hundred from among their number; nine [[Archon]]s and the Treasurers were drawn from persons possessing an unencumbered property of not less than ten ''minas'', the generals (''strategoi'') and commanders of cavalry (''hipparchoi'') from those who could show an unencumbered property of not less than a hundred ''minas'', and had children born in lawful wedlock over ten years of age. Thus, in the event of their death, their estate could pass to a competent heir. These officers were required to hold to account the ''prytanes'' (councillors), ''strategoi'' (generals) and ''hipparchoi'' (cavalry officers) of the preceding year until their accounts had been audited. "The Council of Areopagus was guardian of the laws, and kept watch over the magistrates to see that they executed their offices in accordance with the laws. Any person who felt himself wronged might lay an information before the Council of Areopagus, on declaring what law was broken by the wrong done to him. But, as has been said before, loans were secured upon the persons of the debtors, and the land was in the hands of a few."<ref>Aristotle, ''Constitution'', §4.</ref>
