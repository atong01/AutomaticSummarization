They also made it available to high schools in the<space/><link><target>Hanover, New Hampshire</target><part>Hanover</part></link><space/>area, and put a considerable amount of effort into promoting the language.

While many advanced programmers still scoffed at its use, VB met the needs of small businesses efficiently wherever processing speed was less of a concern than ease of development.

More powerful versions had floating-point arithmetic, and variables could be labelled with names six or more characters long. There were some problems and restrictions in early implementations; for example, Applesoft allowed variable names to be several characters long, but only the first two were significant, thus it was possible to inadvertently write a program with variables &quot;LOSS&quot; and &quot;LOAN&quot;, which would be treated as being the same; assigning a value to &quot;LOAN&quot; would silently overwrite the value intended as &quot;LOSS&quot;.
