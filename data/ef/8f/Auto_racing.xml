The main aim of an individual event is to set the fastest time in a set number of laps or time limit. The finishing order is determined by race time, with the fastest time in first place, second-fastest in second place and so on. Any driver failing to complete a race for any reason is deemed &quot;retired&quot;, or, more commonly, &quot;out&quot;. Retired drivers will have their positions determined by the order in which those retired, with the first to retire finishing last, the next second-last and so on. In most events, a driver's final race position may be classified if he/she completes a certain amount of the race distance, usually just short of completing the full race (for example, in Formula One, a driver's race position is classified if he/she completes 90% of the full race distance). There are numerous different categories of auto racing, each with different rules and regulations, such as compulsory pit stops and car regulations, for all cars and drivers to comply. The continuous exposure of a driver to vibration and G forces to years of automobile racing may have a substantial effect on the high incidence of musculoskeletal disorders.<space/><extension extension_name='ref' name="2W"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><heading level='3'>The first race</heading><paragraph><template><target>more footnotes</target><arg name="date">May 2015</arg></template>The first prearranged match race of two self-powered road vehicles over a prescribed route occurred at 4:30 A.M. on August 30, 1867, between<space/><link><target>Ashton-under-Lyne</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Old Trafford</target></link>, a distance of eight miles.

Ingels took a small chainsaw engine and mounted it to a simple tube-frame chassis weighing less than 100&amp;nbsp;lb. Ingels, and everyone else who drove the kart, were startled at its performance capabilities. The sport soon blossomed in Southern California, and quickly spread around the world. Although often seen as the entry point for serious racers into the sport,<space/><link><target>kart racing</target></link>, or karting, can be an economical way for amateurs to try racing and is also a fully fledged international sport in its own right. A large proportion of professional racing drivers began in karts, often from a very young age, such as<space/><link><target>Michael Schumacher</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Fernando Alonso</target></link>. Several former motorcycle champions have also taken up the sport, notably<space/><link><target>Wayne Rainey</target></link>, who was paralysed in a racing accident and now races a hand-controlled kart.

During countless physiological (and psychological) evaluations of professional racing drivers, the two characteristics that stand out are racers' near-obsessive need to control their surroundings (the psychological aspect), and an unusual ability to process fast-moving information (physiological). In this, researchers have noted a strong correlation between racers' psychological profiles and those of fighter pilots. In tests comparing racers to members of the general public, the greater the complexity of the information processing matrix, the greater the speed gap between racers and the public. Due partly to the performance capabilities of modern racing cars, racing drivers require a high level of fitness, focus and the ability to concentrate at high levels for long periods in an inherently difficult environment. The racing drivers mainly complain about pains in the lumbar, shoulder and neck regions.<space/><extension extension_name='ref' name="2W"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In particular, racing cars such as<space/><link><target>formula racing</target><part>formula cars</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>sports prototype</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>that generate a substantial amount of<space/><link><target>downforce</target></link><space/>are able to corner at speeds that impose extremely large<space/><link><target>g-force</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>on drivers.<extension extension_name='ref' name="LATimes1985"><template><target>citation</target><arg name="title"><space/>Driving a Race Car Takes Strength and Stamina : These Athletes Travel in Fast Lane but Keep Fit
