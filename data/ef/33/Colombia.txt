The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous peoples]] including the [[Muisca]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]], and [[Tairona]]. The Spanish arrived in 1499 and initiated a period of [[Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations|conquest and colonization]] ultimately creating the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], with its capital at [[Bogotá]].<ref name="LABLAA6">{{cite web|author=Nicolás del Castillo Mathieu|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/marzo1992/marzo3.htm|title=La primera vision de las costas Colombianas, Repaso de Historia|work=Revista Credencial|date=March 1992|accessdate=29 February 2008|language=Spanish}}</ref> Independence from Spain was won in 1819, but by 1830 "[[Gran Colombia]]" had collapsed with the secession of Venezuela and Ecuador.

Colombia is ethnically diverse, its people descending from the original [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|native]] inhabitants, [[Spanish people|Spanish]] colonists, [[African Colombian|Africans]] originally brought to the country as slaves, and 20th-century [[European diaspora|immigrants from Europe]] and the [[Arab diaspora in Colombia|Middle East]], all contributing to a diverse cultural heritage.<ref name = "Colombia is ethnically diverse"/> This has also been influenced by Colombia's varied geography, and the imposing landscape of the country has resulted in the development of very strong regional identities. The majority of the urban centres are located in the highlands of the [[Andes|Andes mountains]], but Colombian territory also encompasses [[Amazon rainforest]], [[Los Llanos (South America)|tropical grassland]] and both Caribbean and Pacific coastlines.

== Etymology ==
The name "Colombia" is derived from the last name of [[Christopher Columbus]] ({{lang-it|Cristoforo Colombo}}, {{lang-es|Cristóbal Colón}}). It was conceived by the Venezuelan revolutionary [[Francisco de Miranda]] as a reference to all the New World, but especially to those under the Spanish and Portuguese rule. The name was later adopted by the [[Greater Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] of 1819, formed out of the territories of the old [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (modern-day Colombia, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, and northwest Brazil).<ref name="LABLAA5">{{cite web|author=Carlos Restrepo Piedrahita|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/febrero1992/febrero2.htm|title=El nombre "Colombia", El único país que lleva el nombre del Descubrimiento|work=Revista Credencial|date=February 1992|accessdate=29 February 2008|language=Spanish}}</ref>

When Venezuela and Ecuador parted ways, the [[Cundinamarca Province|Cundinamarca]] region that remained became a new country – the [[Republic of New Granada]]. In 1858 New Granada officially changed its name to the [[Granadine Confederation]], then in 1863 the [[United States of Colombia]], before finally adopting its present name – the Republic of Colombia – in [[1886]].<ref name="LABLAA5"/>

To refer to this country, the Colombian government uses the terms ''Colombia'' and ''República de Colombia''.

Due to its location, the present territory of Colombia was a corridor of early human migration from [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Caribbean]] to the [[Andes]] and [[Amazonia|Amazon]]. The oldest archaeological finds are from the [[Pubenza archaeological site|Pubenza]] and [[El Totumo archaeological site|El Totumo]] sites in the Magdalena Valley 100&nbsp;km southwest of Bogotá.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Correal|first=Urrego G.|title=Nuevas evidencias culturales pleistocenicas y megafauna en Colombia|journal=Boletin de Arqueologia|year=1993|issue=8|pages=3–13}}</ref>  These sites date from the [[Paleoindian]] period (18,000–8000 BCE).  At [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]] and other sites, traces from the [[Archaic period in South America|Archaic Period]] (~8000–2000 BCE) have been found.  Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in the regions of [[El Abra]] and [[Tequendama archeological site|Tequendama]] in [[Cundinamarca Department (1820)|Cundinamarca]]. The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas, found at [[San Jacinto archaeological site|San Jacinto]], dates to 5000 – 4000 BCE.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hoopes|first=John|title=Ford Revisited: A Critical Review of the Chronology and Relationships of the Earliest Ceramic Complexes in the New World, 6000-1500 B.C.

By 10,500 BCE, the territory of what is now Colombia was inhabited by [[aboriginal people]]. Nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes existed near present-day Bogotá (at El Abra and Tequendama sites) which traded with one another and with cultures living in the [[Magdalena River]] Valley.<ref>Van der Hammen, T. and Correal, G. 1978: "Prehistoric man on the Sabana de Bogotá: data for an ecological prehistory"; Paleography, Paleoclimatology, Paleoecology 25:179–190</ref> Between 5000 and 1000 BCE, hunter-gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies; fixed settlements were established, and pottery appeared. Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE, groups of [[Amerindian]]s including the [[Muisca]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]], and [[Tairona]] developed the political system of "[[cacicazgo]]s" with a pyramidal structure of power headed by [[Cacique Nutibara Bloc|caciques]]. The Muiscas inhabited mainly the area of what is now the [[Departments of Colombia|Departments]] of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] and [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] high plateau (''[[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]''). They farmed maize, potato, quinoa and cotton, and traded gold, emeralds, blankets, ceramic handicrafts, coca and salt with neighboring nations. The Taironas inhabited northern Colombia in the isolated [[Andes]] mountain range of [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]].<ref>Broadbent, Sylvia 1965: Los Chibchas: organización socio-política.

In 1717 the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] was originally created, and then it was temporarily removed, to finally be reestablished in 1739. The Viceroyalty had Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalties of New Spain]] or [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] and correspond mainly to today's Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama. So, Bogotá became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World, along with [[Lima]] and [[Mexico City]], though it remained somewhat backward compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical ways.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141103045601/http://institucional.us.es/tamericanistas/uploads/revista/13/RUIZ-RIVERA..pdf|title= Reformismo local en el nuevo Reino de Granada.

The 18th-century priest, botanist and mathematician [[José Celestino Mutis]] was delegated by Viceroy [[Antonio Caballero y Góngora]] to conduct an inventory of the nature of the New Granada.

Since the beginning of the periods of conquest and colonization, there were several rebel movements against Spanish rule, but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation. The last one that sought outright [[Colombian Declaration of Independence|independence from Spain]] sprang up around 1810, following the independence of [[St. Domingue]] (present-day Haiti) in 1804, which provided some support to the eventual leaders of this rebellion: [[Simón Bolívar]] and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]].<ref>McFarlane, Anthony.

Soon after, Colombia achieved some degree of political stability, which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, a period known as ''[[La Violencia]]'' ("The Violence").

Colombia entered the [[Korean War]] when [[Laureano Gómez]] was elected as President. It was the only Latin American country to join the war in a direct military role as an ally of the United States.

From 1953 to 1964 the violence between the two political parties decreased first when [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]] deposed the President of Colombia in a [[coup d'état]] and negotiated with the guerrillas, and then under the [[military junta]] of General [[Gabriel París Gordillo]].

After Rojas' deposition, the [[Colombian Conservative Party]] and Colombian Liberal Party agreed to create the "[[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]]", a coalition which would jointly govern the country. Under the deal, the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices. The National Front ended "La Violencia", and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress. In the end, the contradictions between each successive Liberal and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political problems continued, and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the [[FARC]], [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]], [[Popular Liberation Army|EPL]], [[Movimiento Armado Quintin Lame|MAQL]] and [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] to fight the government and political apparatus.

Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] [[Low intensity conflict|low-intensity]] armed conflict between the [[Military Forces of Colombia|government forces]], [[Guerrilla movements in Colombia|left-wing guerrilla groups]] and [[Paramilitarism in Colombia|right-wing paramilitaries]].

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Colombia}}
{{See also|Geology of Colombia|List of national parks of Colombia|List of rivers in Colombia}}
[[File:Mapa de Colombia (relieve).svg|thumbnail|Relief Map.]]
The geography of Colombia is characterized by its six main [[Natural regions of Colombia|natural regions]] that present their own unique characteristics, from the [[Andes|Andes mountain range]] region shared with Ecuador and Venezuela; the [[Pacific Coast|Pacific coastal region]] shared with Panama and Ecuador; the Caribbean coastal region shared with Venezuela and Panama; the ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]]'' (plains) shared with Venezuela; the [[Amazon Rainforest]] region shared with Venezuela, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador; to the [[Insular Region (Colombia)|insular area]], comprising islands in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.<ref name="Geography of Colombia">{{cite web |url= http://www.colombia-sa.com/geografia/geografia-in.html|title= Natural regions of Colombia and description of the three branches of the andes cordillera|publisher = colombia-sa.com |accessdate= 7 March 2014}}</ref>

Colombia is bordered to the northwest by [[Panama]]; to the east by [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]]; to the south by [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]];<ref name = "Land borders">{{cite web|url= http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/en/colombia/sovereignty/land|title= The Republic of Colombia shares land borders with five (5) countries |publisher = cancilleria.gov.co}}</ref> it established its maritime boundaries with neighboring countries through seven agreements on the Caribbean Sea and three on the Pacific Ocean.<ref name = "Maritime borders">{{cite web|url= http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/en/colombia/sovereignty/maritime|title= Maritime borders|publisher = cancilleria.gov.co}}</ref> It lies between latitudes [[12th parallel north|12°N]] and [[4th parallel south|4°S]], and longitudes [[67th meridian west|67°]] and [[79th meridian west|79°W]].

Part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]], a region of the world subject to earthquakes and [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]],<ref name="Ring of Fire">{{cite web |url= http://seisan.ingeominas.gov.co/RSNC/index.php/material-educativo|title= Colombia is part of the Ring of Fire|publisher = seisan.ingeominas.gov.co |accessdate= 7 March 2014|language= Spanish}}</ref>  Colombia is dominated by the Andes (which contain the majority of the country's urban centres). Beyond the [[Colombian Massif]] (in the south-western departments of [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] and [[Nariño Department|Nariño]]) these are divided into three branches known as ''cordilleras'' (mountain ranges): the [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Cordillera Occidental]], running adjacent to the Pacific coast and including the city of [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]]; the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Cordillera Central]], running between the [[Cauca River|Cauca]] and [[Magdalena River]] valleys (to the west and east respectively) and including the cities of [[Medellín]], [[Manizales]], [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]] and [[Armenia, Quindío|Armenia]]; and the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]], extending north east to the [[Guajira Peninsula]] and including Bogotá, [[Bucaramanga]] and [[Cúcuta]].<ref name="Geography of Colombia"/>

Peaks in the Cordillera Occidental exceed {{convert|4700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Oriental they reach {{convert|5000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. At {{convert|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Bogotá is the highest city of its size in the world.<ref name="Geography of Colombia"/>

East of the Andes lies the [[savanna]] of the ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]]'', part of the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River basin]], and, in the far south east, the [[jungle]] of the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Together these lowlands comprise over half Colombia's territory, but they contain less than 3% of the population. To the north the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean coast]], home to 20% of the population and the location of the major port cities of [[Barranquilla]] and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], generally consists of low-lying plains, but it also contains the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountain range, which includes the country's tallest peaks ([[Pico Cristóbal Colón]] and [[Pico Simón Bolívar]]), and the [[La Guajira Desert]]. By contrast the narrow and discontinuous [[Pacific Region of Colombia|Pacific coastal lowlands]], backed by the [[Baudó Mountains|Serranía de Baudó]] mountains, are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation. The principal Pacific port is [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]].<ref name="Geography of Colombia"/>

The main rivers of Colombia are [[Magdalena River|Magdalena]], [[Cauca River|Cauca]], [[Guaviare Department|Guaviare]], [[Atrato River|Atrato]], [[Meta River|Meta]], [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]] and [[Caquetá River|Caquetá]]. Colombia has four main drainage systems: the Pacific drain, the Caribbean drain, the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin.

{{Main|Climate of Colombia}}
Colombians customarily describe their country in terms of the climatic zones. Below {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation is the [[tierra caliente]] (hot land), where temperatures are above {{convert|24|°C|°F|1}}.

The majority of the population can be found in the [[tierra templada]] (temperate land, between {{convert|1001|and|2000|m|ft|0|sp=us}}), where temperatures vary between {{convert|17|and|24|°C|°F|1}} and the [[tierra fría]] (cold land, {{convert|2001|and|3000|m|ft|0|sp=us}}).
<ref name="Thermal floors"/>

In the tierra fría mean temperatures range between {{convert|12|and|17|°C|°F|1}}. Beyond the tierra fría lie the alpine conditions of the forested zone and then the treeless grasslands of the [[páramo]]s. Above {{convert|4000|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, where temperatures are below freezing, is the [[tierra helada]], a zone of permanent snow and ice.<ref name="Thermal floors"/>

Each department has a local government with a governor and assembly directly elected to four-year terms, and each municipality is headed by a mayor and council. There is a popularly elected local administrative board in each of the ''corregimientos'' or ''comunas''.<ref name="Administrative divisions">{{cite web|url= http://www.dane.gov.co/Divipola/|title= Codificación de la División Político-Administrativa de Colombia (Divipola)|language= Spanish|publisher = dane.gov.co|accessdate = 15 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="Concerning the territorial organization">Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title XI – Concerning the territorial organization)</ref><ref>Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title XI – Concerning the territorial organization – Chapter 3 – Concerning the municipal regime – Article 318)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Herrera Llanos|first= W |year= 2011|title= Régimen municipal en Colombia (Continuación del tema sobre Organización Territorial)|publisher= Universidad del Norte|page=27|accessdate= 9 March 2014}}</ref>

In addition to the capital four other cities have been designated [[Districts of Colombia|districts]] (in effect special municipalities), on the basis of special distinguishing features. These are [[Barranquilla]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Santa Marta]] and [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]]. Some departments have local administrative subdivisions, where towns have a large concentration of population and municipalities are near each other (for example in Antioquia and Cundinamarca). Where departments have a low population (for example Amazonas, Vaupés and Vichada), special administrative divisions are employed, such as "department ''corregimientos''", which are a hybrid of a municipality and a ''corregimiento''.<ref name="Administrative divisions"/><ref name="Concerning the territorial organization"/>

Historically an agrarian economy, Colombia urbanised rapidly in the 20th century, by the end of which just 17% of the workforce were employed in agriculture, generating just 6.1% of GDP; 21% of the workforce were employed in industry and 62% in services, responsible for 37.3% and 56.6% of GDP respectively.<ref name="CIAWFB"/><ref name ="Colombianeconomy">{{cite web| url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/ayudadetareas/economia/econo106.htm |publisher=banrepcultural.org | title= Colombian economy |language= spanish|accessdate=16 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/cuentas-economicas/cuentas-trimestrales|publisher= dane.gov.co|title= NACIONALES TRIMESTRALES -PIB-  Composición del PIB Colombiano por demanda y Composición del PIB Colombiano Oferta|language= spanish|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref><ref name = "GDPCOLOMBIA">{{cite web| url= http://www.dinero.com/economia/articulo/composicion-economia-colombiana-2015/214054 |publisher= dinero.com | title= How is the Colombian economy made up?|language= spanish|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref>

Colombia's [[market economy]] grew steadily in the latter part of the 20th century, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an average rate of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998. The country suffered a [[recession]] in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the [[Great Depression]]), and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 6.9% in 2007, one of the [[List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate|highest rates of growth]] in Latin America.<ref name="Colombia’s GDP growth">{{cite web|url= http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG/countries/CO?display=graph|title= Colombia’s GDP growth|publisher= World Bank|accessdate = 9 March 2014}}</ref>  According to [[International Monetary Fund]] estimates, in 2012 Colombia's GDP (PPP) was US$500&nbsp;billion ([[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|28th in the world]] and third in South America).

Colombia is projected to have a population of 50.9&nbsp;million by 2020. These trends are reflected in the country's age profile. In 2005 over 30% of the population was under 15 years old, compared to just 5.1% aged 65 and over.

The population is concentrated in the [[Andean Region of Colombia|Andean highlands]] and along the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean coast]]. The nine eastern lowland departments, comprising about 54% of Colombia's area, have less than 3% of the population and a density of less than one person per square kilometer (two persons per square mile). Traditionally a rural society, [[Urbanization|movement to urban areas]] was very heavy in the mid-20th century, and Colombia is now one of the most urbanized countries in Latin America. The urban population increased from 31% of the total in 1938 to 60% in 1975, and by 2014 the figure stood at 76%.<ref name="Country Study">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/colombia/36.htm |title=Colombia: A Country Study |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/Highlights/WUP2014-Highlights.pdf |title= World Urbanization Prospects|publisher= un.org |accessdate= 10 May 2015}}</ref> The population of Bogotá alone has increased from just over 300,000 in 1938 to approximately 8 million today.

Colombian art has over 3,000 years of history. Colombian artists have captured the country's changing political and cultural backdrop using a range of styles and mediums. There is archeological evidence of ceramics being produced earlier in Colombia than anywhere else in the Americas, dating as early as 3,000 BCE.<ref name="donquijote.org">{{cite web| url= http://www.donquijote.org/culture/colombia/art/ |publisher= donquijote.org | title= Colombian Art|accessdate= 22 August 2013}}</ref>

The earliest examples of gold craftsmanship have been attributed to the Tumaco people <ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/gold-museum/tumaco |publisher= banrepcultural.org | title= Tumaco: People and Gold on the Pacific Coast|accessdate= 22 August 2013}}</ref> of the Pacific coast and date to around 325 BCE. Roughly between 200 BCE and 800 CE, the [[San Agustín, Huila|San Agustín culture]], masters of [[Stonemasonry|stonecutting]], entered its “classical period".  They erected raised [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] centres, [[sarcophagi]], and large stone [[monolith]]s depicting [[anthropomorphic]] and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphhic]] forms out of [[Rock (geology)|stone]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/744|publisher= UNESCO| title= San Agustín Archaeological Park|accessdate= 22 August 2013}}</ref>

Colombian art has followed the trends of the time, so during the 16th to 18th centuries, [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Spanish Catholicism]] had a huge influence on Colombian art, and the popular [[baroque]] style was replaced with [[rococo]] when the Bourbons ascended to the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]]. More recently, Colombian artists [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martínez|Santiago Martínez Delgado]] started the Colombian Murial Movement in the 1940s, featuring the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] features of [[Art Deco]].<ref name="donquijote.org"/>

Since the 1950s, the Colombian art started to have a distinctive point of view, reinventing traditional elements under the concepts of the 20th century. Examples of this are the Greiff [[portrait]]s by [[Ignacio Gómez Jaramillo]], showing what the Colombian art could do with the new techniques applied to typical Colombian themes. Carlos Correa, with his [[paradigm]]atic “Naturaleza muerta en silencio” (silent dead nature), combines geometrical [[Abstraction (art)|abstraction]] and [[cubism]]. [[Alejandro Obregón]] is often considered as the father of modern Colombian painting, and one of the most influential artist in this period, due to his originality, the painting of Colombian landscapes with [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] and [[Expressionism|expressionist]] use of animals, (specially the [[Andean condor]]). [[Fernando Botero]] and [[Omar Rayo]] are probably the most widely known Colombian artists in the international scene.<ref name="donquijote.org"/>

The Colombian sculpture from the sixteenth to 18th centuries was mostly devoted to [[Religious art|religious depictions]] of ecclesiastic art, strongly influenced by the Spanish schools of [[sacred]] sculpture. During the early period of the Colombian republic, the national artists were focused in the production of sculptural portraits of politicians and public figures, in a plain [[neoclassicist]] trend. During the 20th century, the Colombian sculpture began to develop a bold and innovative work with the aim of reaching a better understanding of national sensitivity.<ref name="Colombian sculptors">{{cite web |url= http://www.colombia.com/cultura/resenas/escultura.asp |title= Colombian sculptors|publisher = colombia.com|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013}}</ref>

Colombian architecture is mainly derived of adapting European styles to local conditions, and Spanish influence, especially [[Andalusia]]n, can be easily seen.  The [[Teatro de Cristóbal Colón|Teatro Colón]] in Bogotá is a lavish example of Colombian architecture from the Republican period, and the [[Primatial Cathedral of Bogotá|Archbishopric Cathedral]] also in the capital, was made in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassic style]] in 1792, by Colombian architect Domingo de Petrés. [[Rogelio Salmona]], whose works are noted for their use of red brick and natural shapes, is a widely renowned Colombian architect.<ref name="donquijote.org"/>

Theater was introduced in Colombia during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] in 1550 through [[zarzuela]] companies. Colombian theater is supported by the Ministry of Culture and a number of private and state owned organizations. The Ibero-American Theater Festival of Bogotá is the cultural event of the highest importance in Colombia and one of the biggest theater festivals in the world.<ref name = "Theater Festival">{{cite web|url= http://www.festivaldeteatro.com.co/|title = Theater Festival |publisher= The Ibero-American Theater Festival of Bogotá |accessdate= 26 September 2013}}</ref> Other important theater events are: The Festival of Puppet The Fanfare (Medellín), The Manizales Theater Festival, The Caribbean Theatre Festival (Santa Marta) and The Art Festival of Popular Culture "Cultural Invasion" (Bogotá).<ref name="Theatre in Colombia">{{cite web| url= http://www.iti-worldwide.org/amt/countries/p_COLOMBIA.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080821123228/http://www.iti-worldwide.org/amt/countries/p_COLOMBIA.html | archivedate= 2008-08-21 |publisher= iti-worldwide.org |title= Main performing arts festivals|accessdate= 9 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="theatrical production">{{cite web| url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/colhoy/colo11.htm|publisher= banrepcultural.org |title= Theater of Colombia|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013}}</ref>

==Health==
{{Main|Health care in Colombia}}
[[Life expectancy at birth]] in 2000 was 74 years; the life expectancy increased to 78 years by 2012.<ref name="Life expectancy at birth"/> Health standards in Colombia have improved very much since the 1980s, healthcare reforms have led to the massive improvements in the healthcare systems of the country. Although this new system has widened population coverage by the social and health security system from 21% (pre-1993) to 96% in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/colombia/noticias/ministra-dice-cobertura-en-salud-fue-96|title = Ministra de Salud dice que la cobertura en este sector subió al 96%|language=Spanish|accessdate = 18 August 2013 |publisher= elpais.com.co}}</ref> health disparities persist, with the poor continuing to suffer less attention in their medical procedures.

Through [[Medical tourism|health tourism]], many people from over the world travel from their places of residence to other countries in search of medical treatment and the attractions in the countries visited. Colombia is projected as one of Latin America’s main destinations in terms of health tourism due to the quality of its health care professionals, a good number of institutions devoted to health, and an immense inventory of natural and architectural sites. Cities such as Bogotá, Cali and Medellín are the most visited in cardiology procedures, neurology, dental treatments, stem cell therapy, ENT, ophthalmology and joint replacements among others for the medical services of high quality.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mymedholiday.com/country/colombia|publisher = mymedholiday.com |title= Colombia Medical Tourism |accessdate= 8 March 2014}}</ref>

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Colombia}}

The educational experience of many Colombian children begins with attendance at a preschool academy until age five (''Educación preescolar''). Basic education (''Educación básica'') is compulsory by law.<ref>Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title II – Concerning rights, guarantees, and duties – Chapter 2 – Concerning social, economic and cultural rights – Article 67)</ref> It has two stages: Primary basic education (''Educación básica primaria'') which goes from first to fifth grade – children from six to ten years old, and Secondary basic education (''Educación básica secundaria''), which goes from sixth to ninth grade. Basic education is followed by Middle vocational education (''Educación media vocacional'') that comprises the tenth and eleventh grades. It may have different vocational training modalities or specialties (academic, technical, business, and so on.) according to the curriculum adopted by each school.

After the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years, a high-school diploma is awarded. The high-school graduate is known as a  ''bachiller'', because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally considered together as a unit called ''bachillerato'' (sixth to eleventh grade). Students in their final year of middle education take the [[ICFES Examination|ICFES test]] (now renamed Saber 11) in order to gain access to higher education (''Educación superior'').  This higher education includes undergraduate professional studies, technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies. Technical professional institutions of Higher Education are also opened to students holder of a qualification in Arts and Business. This qualification is usually awarded by the [[National Service of Learning (Colombia)|SENA]] after a two years curriculum.<ref>[http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=COL Vocational Education in Colombia, UNESCO-UNEVOC]</ref>

''Bachilleres'' (high-school graduates) may enter into a professional undergraduate career program offered by a university; these programs last up to five years (or less for technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies), even as much to six to seven years for some careers, such as medicine. In Colombia, there is not an institution such as college; students go directly into a career program at a university or any other educational institution to obtain a professional, technical or technological title. Once graduated from the university, people are granted a (professional, technical or technological) diploma and licensed (if required) to practice the career they have chosen. For some professional career programs, students are required to take the Saber-Pro test, in their final year of undergraduate academic education.<ref name="sistema educativo">{{cite web|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070629194012/http://menweb.mineducacion.gov.co/nnormas/normas_basicas_4.swf|title= Ministerio de Educación de Colombia, Estructura del sistema educativo |date= 29 June 2007}}</ref>

Public spending on education as a proportion of gross domestic product in 2013 was 4.9%. This represented 16.9% of total government expenditure. The primary and secondary gross enrolment ratios stood at 114.9% and 93% respectively. School-life expectancy was 13.5 years. A total of 93.6% of the population aged 15 and older were recorded as literate, including 98.2% of those aged 15–24.<ref name="UNESCO">{{cite web|url= http://www.uis.unesco.org/DataCentre/Pages/country-profile.aspx?regioncode=40520&code=COL|title=UNESCO Institute for Statistics Colombia Profile |accessdate= 24 February 2015}}</ref>
