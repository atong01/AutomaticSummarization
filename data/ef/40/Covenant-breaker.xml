Since it would be impossible for the Bah' Faith to unite the world if it were itself disunited, the role of the covenant as the guarantor of the unity of the Bah' community becomes inextricably linked with the goal of world unity: &quot;It is evident that the axis of oneness of the world of humanity is the power of the Covenant and nothing else.&quot; (TDP 49, cf GPB 239, SWA 208-9).<extension extension_name='ref' name="bahai-library1"><link type='external' href='http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant'>Covenant, The, and Covenant-breaker</link></extension>Being declared a Covenant-breaker is done by the head of the Faith &amp;mdash; which since 1963 refers to the elected nine-member<space/><link><target>Universal House of Justice</target></link>, the governing body of the Bah's. Bah's avoid association with them, even if the Covenant-breaker is a family member. The authority to declare a Bah' a Covenant-breaker resides solely with the head of the Bah' Faith.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Definition</heading><paragraph>Covenant-breaking does not refer to attacks from non-Bah's or former Baha'is. Rather, it is in reference to internal campaigns of opposition where the Covenant-breaker is challenging the unity of the Faith, causing internal division, or by claiming or supporting an alternate succession of authority or administrative structure. The central purpose of the covenant is to prevent schism and dissension.<extension extension_name='ref' name="bahai-library1"></extension>In a letter to an individual dated 23 March 1975, the Universal House of Justice wrote:<template><target>quote</target><arg>When a person declares his acceptance of Bahá'u'lláh as a Manifestation of God he becomes a party to the Covenant and accepts the totality of His Revelation. If he then turns round and attacks Bahá'u'lláh or the Central Institution of the Faith he violates the Covenant. If this happens every effort is made to help that person to see the illogicality and error of his actions, but if he persists he must, in accordance with the instructions of Bahá'u'lláh Himself, be shunned as a Covenant-breaker.</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The term 'Covenant-breaker' or, in Arabic 'naqid al-mithaq' [pl. Naqidu 'l-mithaq], was first used by<space/><link><target>`Abdu'l-Bah</target></link><space/>to describe the partisans of his brother<space/><link><target>Mrz Muhammad `Al</target></link>, who challenged his leadership.

For example, a Bah' who refuses to follow guidance on treatment of Covenant-breakers is at risk of being named one. One article<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant'>The Covenant, and Covenant-breaker</link>, by Moojan Momen</extension><space/>originally written for the Bah' Encyclopedia, characterized Covenant-breakers that have emerged in the course of Bah' history as belonging to one of four categories:</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>Leadership challenge: These are persons who dispute the authority and legitimacy of the head of the religion and advance claims either for themselves or for another. The main examples of these are<space/><link><target>Mrz Muhammad `Al</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Mason Remey</target><part>Charles Mason Remey</part></link>.</listitem><listitem>Dissidence: Those who actively disagree with the policies and actions of the head of the faith without, however, advancing an alternative claim for leadership. This group consisted mostly of opponents of the Bah' administration such as<space/><link><target>Ruth White (Bah' author)</target><part>Ruth White</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Mirza Ahmad Sohrab</target></link>.</listitem><listitem>Disobedience: Those who disobey certain direct instructions from the head of the religion. Mostly the instruction in question is to cease to associate with a Covenant-breaker. Examples of this type include most of the descendants of `Abdu'l-Bah during Shoghi Effendi's time.</listitem><listitem>Apostates who maliciously attack the Bah' Faith. Examples include<space/><link><target>vrih</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Nk</target></link>.</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Excluded categories of people</heading><paragraph>Shoghi Effendi wrote to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada in 1957:<template><target>quote</target><arg>People who have withdrawn from the Cause because they no longer feel that they can support its Teachings and Institutions sincerely, are not Covenant-breakers -- they are non-Bahá'ís and should just be treated as such. Only those who ally themselves actively with known enemies of the Faith who are Covenant-breakers, and who attack the Faith in the same spirit as these people, can be considered, themselves, to be Covenant-breakers.<ref>Shoghi Effendi, Messages to Canada, p. 64</ref></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Beyond this, many other relationships to the Bah' Faith exist, both positive and negative. Covenant-breaking does not apply to most of them. The following is a partial list of those who could not rightly be termed Covenant-breakers:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Members of other religions or no religion--with or without any particular relationship to the Bah' Faith.</listitem><listitem>Bah's who simply leave the religion. (see above)</listitem><listitem>Bah's who, in the estimation of the head of the religion have insufficiently understood the nature of the covenant from the start.

Since Covenant-breaking presumes that one has submitted oneself to a covenant and then broken it, and Bbs never recognized or swore allegiance to Bah'u'llh, they are not Covenant-breakers.</paragraph><paragraph>Followers of<space/><link><target>Subh-i-Azal</target></link>, Bah'u'llh's half-brother who tried to poison him, engaged in active opposition to Bah's, and Shoghi Effendi did inform Bah's that they should avoid contact with his descendants, writing that &quot;No intelligent and loyal Baha'i would associate with a descendant of Azal, if he traced the slightest breath of criticism of our Faith, in any aspect, from that person. In fact these people should be strenuously avoided as having an inherited spiritual disease -- the disease of Covenant-breaking!&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>Shoghi Effendi, From letter dated 9 December 1948 to an individual believer</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Covenant-Breaking in Shoghi Effendi's immediate family</heading><paragraph>Through the influence of<space/><link><target>Bah'u'llh's family</target><part>Bahiyyih Khanum</part></link>, the eldest daughter of<space/><link><target>Bah'u'llh</target></link>, everyone in the household initially rallied around<space/><link><target>Shoghi Effendi</target></link><space/>after the death of<space/><link><target>`Abdu'l-Bah</target></link>. For several years his brother Husayn and several cousins served him as secretaries. The only ones publicly opposing him were Mirza Muhammad-Ali and his followers, who were declared Covenant-breakers by `Abdu'l-Bah. Contrary to `Abdu'l-Bah's specific instruction, certain family members established illicit links with those declared Covenant-breakers by `Abdu'l-Bah. After Bahiyyih Khanum died in 1932, Shoghi Effendi's eldest sister--Ruhangiz --married a son of<space/><link><target>Bah'u'llh's family</target><part>Siyyid Ali Afnan</part></link>. Bah'u'llh's son-in-law was, thus, a long-standing enemy of `Abdu'l-Bah (who had declared him a Covenant-breaker.) Through Ruhangiz's efforts, Shoghi Effendi's other sister and his cousin Thurayya also married sons of Siyyid Ali Afnan. Presumably being faced with a choice between shunning their disobedient family members and being themselves disobedient to `Abdu'l-Bah and Shoghi Effendi, his cousins, aunts and uncles chose the latter.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Ruhi Afnan</heading><paragraph>After years of silence on these developments, cables sent by<space/><link><target>Shoghi Effendi</target></link><space/>on 2 November 1941 provide background to developments among family members.

There was an absence of a valid descendant of Bah'u'llh who could qualify under the terms of `Abdu'l-Bah's will. Later the<space/><link><target>Universal House of Justice</target></link>, initially elected in 1963, made a ruling on the subject that it was not possible for another Guardian to be appointed.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1960 Remey, a Hand of the Cause himself, retracted his earlier position, and claimed to have been coerced. He claimed to be the successor to Shoghi Effendi. He and the small number of people who followed him were expelled from the Faith by the Hands of the Cause. Those close to Remey claimed that he went senile in old age, and by the time of his death he was largely abandoned, with his most prominent followers fighting amongst themselves for leadership. [Citation needed.]</paragraph><paragraph>The largest group of the remaining followers of Remey, members of the so called &quot;<link><target>Orthodox Bah' Faith</target></link>&quot;, believe that legitimate authority passed from Shoghi Effendi to Mason Remey to Joel Marangella. [Citation needed.] They, therefore, regard the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, Israel to be illegitimate, and its members and followers to be Covenant-breakers. [Citation needed.]</paragraph><paragraph>The present descendants of expelled members of Bah'u'llh's family have not specifically been declared Covenant-breakers, though they mostly do not associate themselves with the Bah' religion. [Citation needed.] A small group of Bah's in Northern New Mexico believe that these descendants are eligible for appointment to the Guardianship and are waiting for such a direct descendant of Bah'u'llh to arise as the rightful Guardian.</paragraph><paragraph>There is also a small group in Montana, originally formed around the personality of Leland Jensen, who claimed a status higher than that of the Guardian. His failed apocalyptic predictions and unsuccessful efforts to reestablish the Guardianship and the administration were apparent by his death in 1996. A dispute among Jensen's followers over the identity of the Guardian resulted in another division in 2001.[Citation needed.]</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Covenant of Bah'u'llh</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Abd al-Hosayn Ayati</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Takfir</target></link>, a similar concept in Islam</listitem></list><heading level='2'>Notes</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">`Abdu'l-Bahá
