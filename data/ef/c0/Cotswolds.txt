The '''Cotswolds''' is an area in south central England containing the Cotswold Hills, a range of rolling hills which rise from the meadows of the upper Thames to an [[escarpment]], known as the Cotswold Edge, above the [[Severn Valley]] and Evesham Vale. The area is defined by the [[bedrock]] of [[Jurassic]] [[limestone]] that creates a type of [[grassland]] habitat rare in the UK and that is quarried for the golden coloured Cotswold stone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=AONB|title=Cotswolds – an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|work=cotswoldsaonb.org.uk|publisher=Cotswolds Conservation Board}}</ref> It contains unique features derived from the use of this mineral; the predominantly rural landscape contains stone-built villages, historical towns and stately homes and gardens.

The Cotswolds are roughly 25 miles (40&nbsp;km) across and 90 miles (145&nbsp;km) long, stretching south-west from just south of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] to just south of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. It lies across the boundaries of several English counties; mainly [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Oxfordshire]], and parts of [[Wiltshire]], Somerset, [[Worcestershire]] and [[Warwickshire]]. The hills give their name to the [[Cotswold (district)|Cotswold]] local-government district in Gloucestershire, which administers a large part of the area. The highest point of the region is [[Cleeve Hill]] at {{convert|1083|ft|m|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/mountaindetails.php?rf=2869|title=Hill Bagging: Cleeve Hill|publisher=Hill Bagging: the online version of the Database of British and Irish Hills|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref> just to the north of [[Cheltenham]].

==History==
There is evidence of Neolithic settlement from burial chambers on Cotswold Edge, and there are remains of Bronze and Iron Age forts.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gNgfAz70nOQC&pg=PR7#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=vii|title=Slow Cotswolds|author= Carolione Mills|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|date= 15 April 2011}}</ref> Later the Romans built villas, such as at Chedworth,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mswynZFMtqgC&pg=PA90#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=90|title=Discovering Roman Britain|publisher=New Holland Publishers|date= 2008|author=Andrew McCloy, Andrew Midgley}}</ref> settlements such as Gloucester, and paved the Celtic path later known as [[Fosse Way]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/10367457/Roman-roads-were-actually-built-by-the-Celts-new-book-claims.html|title='Roman' roads were actually built by the Celts, new book claims|author= Hayley Dixon|journal=The Telegraph|date=9 October 2013}}</ref>

During the Middle Ages, the Cotswolds became prosperous from the wool trade with the continent, with much of the money made from wool directed towards the building of churches. The area still preserves numerous large, handsome Cotswold Stone "wool churches". The affluent area in the 21st century has attracted wealthy Londoners and others who own second homes here or have chosen to retire to the Cotswolds.

The name Cotswold is popularly attributed the meaning "sheep enclosure in rolling hillsides",<ref>{{cite web|title=The Kingscote, Gloucestershire area|url=http://www.kingscotepark.co.uk/index.asp?page=6913|publisher=Kingscote Park|accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=apcmAAAAMAAJ | title= Local etymology: a derivative dictionary of geographical names | first= Richard Stephen  | last= Charnock | publisher= Houlston and Wright | year= 1859 | page= 76}}</ref> incorporating the term, ''[[The Wolds|wold]]'', meaning hills. However, the [[English Place-Name Society]] has for many years accepted that the term Cotswold is derived from ''Codesuualt'' of the 12th century or other variations on this form, the etymology of which was given, 'Cod's-wold', which is 'Cod's high open land'.<ref>Smith, A. H. (1964) ''The Place-Names of Gloucestershire,'' part 1: "The Rivers and Road-names, the East Cotswolds," Cambridge, p.2</ref> Cod was interpreted as an Old English personal name, which may be recognised in further names: [[Cutsdean]], Codeswellan, and Codesbyrig, some of which date back to the eighth century AD.<ref>Smith A. H. 1964 The Place-Names of Gloucestershire part 2: The North and West Cotswolds, Cambridge pp. 7–8</ref> It has subsequently been noticed that "Cod" could derive philologically from a Brittonic female cognate ''"Cuda"'', a hypothetical [[mother goddess]] in [[Celtic mythology]] postulated to have been worshipped in the Cotswold region.<ref>Yeates, S. J. (2008) ''The Tribe of Witches: The Religion of the Dobunni and the Hwicce'', pp. 11–18</ref><ref>Yeates, S. J.

==Geography==
[[File:Bibury Cottages in the Cotswolds - June 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Bibury]], a typical Cotswold village]]

The spine of the Cotswolds runs southwest to northeast through six counties, particularly Gloucestershire, west Oxfordshire and south western Warwickshire. The northern and western edges of the Cotswolds are marked by steep [[escarpment]]s down to the [[River Severn|Severn valley]] and the [[River Avon (Warwickshire)|Warwickshire Avon]]. This feature, known as the Cotswold escarpment, or sometimes the Cotswold Edge, is a result of the uplifting (tilting) of the limestone layer, exposing its broken edge.<ref name="cotsstone">{{cite web|url=http://thecotswoldgateway.co.uk/cotswoldstone.htm|title=Cotswold Stone|publisher=Cotswold Gateway|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref> This is a [[cuesta]], in geological terms. The [[dip slope]] is to the southeast. On the eastern boundary lies the city of [[Oxford]] and on the west is [[Stroud, England|Stroud]]. To the southeast, the upper reaches of the [[Thames Valley]] and towns such as [[Lechlade]], [[Tetbury]] and [[Fairford]] are often considered to mark the limit of this region. To the south the Cotswolds, with the characteristic uplift of the Cotswold Edge, reach beyond [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and towns such as [[Chipping Sodbury]] and [[Marshfield, Gloucestershire|Marshfield]] share elements of Cotswold character.

The area is characterised by attractive small towns and villages built of the underlying Cotswold stone (a yellow [[oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]]).<ref name="cotsstone"/> This limestone is rich in [[fossil]]s, particularly of fossilised [[sea urchin]]s. Cotswold towns include [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]], [[Burford]], [[Chipping Norton]], [[Dursley]], [[Moreton-in-Marsh]], [[Northleach]], [[Stow-on-the-Wold]], [[Stroud]] and [[Winchcombe]]. [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Cheltenham]], [[Cirencester]], [[Gloucester]] and [[Stroud]] are larger urban centres that border on, or are virtually surrounded by, the Cotswold AONB.

The town of [[Chipping Campden]] is notable for being the home of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], founded by [[William Morris]] at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/history|title=History |publisher=Court Barn Museum|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> William Morris lived occasionally in [[Broadway Tower, Worcestershire|Broadway Tower]], a folly, now part of a country park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldswebsite.com/broadway-tower.htm|title=Broadway Tower|publisher=Cotswold website|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref> Chipping Campden also is known for the annual [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]], a celebration of sports and games dating back to the early 17th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=862|title=Origins of Robert Dover's Games |publisher=Olympick Games|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref>

==Cotswold stone==
[[Image:oolite.png|thumb|130px|left|Typical Cotswold stone]]

Cotswold stone is a yellow [[oolite|oolitic]] [[Jurassic]] [[limestone]]. This limestone is rich in [[fossil]]s, particularly of fossilised [[sea urchin]]s. When weathered, the colour of buildings made or faced with this stone is often described as honey or golden.<ref>{{cite book | title=Cotswold stone | author=Freda Derrick | publisher=Chapman & Hall | year=1948 }}</ref> The stone varies in colour from north to south, being honey coloured in the north and north east of the region, as shown in Cotswold villages such as [[Stanton, Gloucestershire|Stanton]] and [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]]; golden coloured in the central and southern areas, as shown in [[Dursley]] and [[Cirencester]]; and pearly white in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswold.gov.uk/visitors/attractions/cotswold-stone/|title=Cotswold stone|work=cotswold.gov.uk|publisher=Cotswold District Council}}</ref> The rock outcrops at places on the Cotswold Edge; small quarries are common. The exposures are rarely sufficiently compact to be good for [[rock-climbing]]. However, an exception is Castle Rock, on [[Cleeve Hill]], above [[Bishop's Cleeve]], near [[Cheltenham]].

==Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty==
{{wide image|Cotswolds Panorama Fields.jpg|780px|align-cap=center|Rolling hills and farm fields that typify the Cotswolds landscape}}

The Cotswolds were designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) in 1966, with an expansion on 21 December 1990 to {{convert|1990|km2|sqmi|0}}. In 1991, all AONBs were measured again using modern methods. The official area of the Cotswolds AONB was increased to {{convert|2038|km2|sqmi|0}}. In 2000, the government confirmed that AONBs had the same landscape quality and status as [[National Parks]].<ref name="aonb">{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=AONB|title=AONB|publisher=Cotswolds AONB|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref>
The Cotswolds AONB, which is the largest in [[England and Wales]], stretches from the border regions of South Warwickshire and Worcestershire, through West Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire, and takes in parts of Wiltshire, [[Bath and North East Somerset]] in the south.
Gloucestershire County Council is responsible for sixty-three percent of the AONB.<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/aonb/cotswolds.aspx Cotswolds] ''[[Natural England]]''</ref>

The Cotswolds Conservation Board has the task of conserving and enhancing the AONB. Established under statute in 2004 as an independent public body, the Board carries out a range of work from securing funding for 'on the ground' conservation projects, to providing a strategic overview of the area for key decision makers, such as planning officials. The Board is funded by [[Natural England]] and the seventeen local authorities that are covered by the AONB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=ccb|title=Cotswolds Conservation Board|publisher=Cotswolds AONB|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref>

While the beauty of the Cotswolds AONB is intertwined with that of the villages that seem almost to grow out of the landscape, the Cotswolds were primarily designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] for the rare limestone grassland habitats as well as the old growth [[beech]] woodlands that typify the area. These habitat areas are also the last refuge for many other flora and fauna, with some so endangered that they are protected under the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]]. [[Cleeve Hill]], and its associated commons, is a fine example of a limestone grassland and it is one of the few locations where the [[Duke of Burgundy butterfly]] may still be found in abundance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Natural Areas – 55 Cotswolds|url=http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/science/natural/NA_Details.asp?NA_Id=55|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref>

The uniqueness and value of the Cotswolds is shown in the fact that five European [[Special Area of Conservation|Special Areas of Conservation]], three [[National Nature Reserves in England|National Nature Reserves]] and more than eighty [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] are within the Cotswolds AONB.<ref>{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cotswold AONB|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=aonb|publisher=Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref>

The Cotswold Voluntary Wardens Service was established in 1968 to help conserve and enhance the area, and now has more than 300 wardens.

The [[Cotswold Way]] is a long-distance footpath, just over {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} long, running the length of the AONB, mainly on the edge of the Cotswold escarpment with views over the [[Severn Valley (England)|Severn Valley]] and the Vale of [[Evesham]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/Cotswold/text.asp?PageId=2 | title= Cotswold Way&nbsp;– About this trail | work= National Trail | accessdate= 14 July 2015 }}</ref>

==Places of Interest==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Sudeley Castle Secret Garden.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''"Secret Garden"'' at Sudeley Castle]]
Pictured right is the Garden of [[Sudeley Castle]] at [[Winchcombe]]. The present structure was built in the 15th century and may have been on the site of a 12th-century castle. It is situated north of the Spa town of [[Cheltenham]] which has much Georgian architecture of some merit. Close by on the A4135 in Beaverston village is the ancient fortress known as [[Beverston Castle]] founded in 1229 by [[Maurice de Gaunt]]. Within the Cotswold area lies [[Calcot Manor]] which can be accessed on the A4135 road from Beaverston and is located some {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} west of [[Tetbury]]. The Manor house building was established in about 1300 AD by Henry of Kingswood as a tithe barn.

[[Tetbury|Tetbury Market House]] is perhaps worth a mention as it was built in 1655. During the [[Middle Ages]], Tetbury became an important market for Cotswold wool and yarn. [[Chavenage House]] is an Elizabethan era manor house 2.4 kilometres (1.5&nbsp;mi) northwest of Tetbury. Of some interest is [[Chedworth Roman Villa]]. Recent excavations have revealed more of the structure and mosaics, which are now excellently presented.  It is located just off the Roman road known as the Fosse Way, and 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) north of the important town of Corinium Dobunnorum (Cirencester). [[Cirencester Abbey]] was founded as an Augustinian monastery in 1117 and [[Malmesbury Abbey]] was one of the few English houses with a continual history from the 7th century through to the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

An unusual house in this area is [[Quarwood]] a Victorian Gothic house in [[Stow-on-the-Wold]], Gloucestershire. The grounds, covering {{convert|42|acre}}, include parkland, fish ponds, paddocks, garages, woodlands and seven cottages. Another is [[Woodchester Mansion]], an unfinished, Gothic revival mansion house in Woodchester Park near Nympsfield in Woodchester, Gloucestershire. [[Newark Park]] is a Grade I listed country house of Tudor origins located near the village of Ozleworth, [[Wotton-under-Edge]], Gloucestershire. The house sits in an estate of {{convert|300|ha|acre|-2|order=flip}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cotswolds.info/castles-romans-shakespeare-blenheim.shtml#newark_park |title=Historic Places to Visit |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2015 |website=cotswolds.info |publisher=Cotswolds.Info LLP |access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> at the southern end of the Cotswold escarpment.

Of the many Manor houses built in the area [[Owlpen Manor]] is a Tudor Grade I listed manor house of the Mander family, situated in the village of Owlpen in the [[Stroud]] district of [[Gloucestershire]]. Moving further north, [[Broadway Tower, Worcestershire|Broadway Tower]] is a folly on Broadway Hill, near the village of Broadway, in the English county of Worcestershire. To the south of the Cotswolds is [[Corsham Court]] an English country house in a park designed by [[Capability Brown]] situated in the town of [[Corsham]], 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) west of Chippenham, Wiltshire.

==Transport==
[[File:Cotswold roads 1933.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Cotswolds roads from 1933]]

The Cotswolds lie between the [[M5 motorway|M5]], [[M40 motorway|M40]] and [[M4 motorway]]s. The main non-motorway roads through the area are the [[A46 road|A46]]: [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]&nbsp;– [[Stroud]]&nbsp;– [[Cheltenham]]; the [[A419 road|A419]]: [[Swindon]]&nbsp;– [[Cirencester]]&nbsp;– Stroud; the [[A429 road|A429]]: Cirencester&nbsp;– [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]&nbsp;– [[Moreton-in-Marsh]]; and the [[A40 road|A40]]: [[Oxford]]&nbsp;– [[Burford]]&nbsp;– Cheltenham. These all roughly follow the routes of ancient roads, some laid down by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]], such as [[Ermin Way]] and the [[Fosse Way]].

The area is bounded by two major rail routes: in the south by the main [[Great Western Main Line|Bristol–Bath–London High Speed line]] (including the [[South Wales Main Line]]) and in the west by the [[Cross Country Route|Bristol–Birmingham main line]]. In addition, the [[Cotswold Line]] runs through the Cotswolds from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Worcester Shrub Hill|Worcester]], and the [[Golden Valley Line]] runs from Swindon via [[Stroud railway station|Stroud]] to [[Gloucester railway station|Gloucester]], carrying high speed and local services.

Mainline, high-speed rail services to the big cities run from railway stations such as [[Bath railway station|Bath]], [[Swindon railway station|Swindon]], [[Oxford]], [[Cheltenham Spa railway station|Cheltenham]] and [[Worcester Shrub Hill|Worcester]]. Mainline trains run by [[First Great Western]] to [[London Paddington]] also are available from [[Kemble railway station|Kemble station]] near Cirencester, [[Kingham railway station|Kingham station]] near Stow-on-the-Wold, [[Charlbury railway station|Charlbury station]] and [[Moreton-in-Marsh railway station|Moreton-in-Marsh station]].

Additionally, there is the [[Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway]], a steam heritage railway serving the Cotswolds from [[Cheltenham Racecourse railway station|Cheltenham]] to [[Winchcombe railway station|Winchcombe]], [[Toddington railway station|Toddington]] and Laverton.  The line is being extended to Broadway.

Cheltenham, which is located just west of the Cotswolds, is a hub for [[National Express Group|National Express]] coach services. There are local bus services across the area, but some are infrequent.

The [[River Thames]] flows from the Cotswolds and is navigable from [[Inglesham]] and [[Lechlade|Lechlade-on-Thames]] downstream to [[Oxford]].

==In culture==

The Cotswold region has inspired several notable English composers. In the early 1900s, [[Herbert Howells]] and [[Ivor Gurney]] used to take long walks together over the hills, and Gurney urged Howells to make the landscape, including the nearby [[Malvern Hills]], the inspiration for his future work. Accepting, in 1916, Howells wrote his first major piece, the ''Piano Quartet in A minor,'' inspired by the magnificent view of the [[Malvern Hills|Malverns]]; he dedicated it to "the hill at Chosen ([[Churchdown]]) and Ivor Gurney who knows it".<ref>[http://webspace.webring.com/people/th/hauntedtv/long_remembered_hills.htm  Long Remembered Hills] How the English composers Ivor Gurney and Herbert Howells were influenced by the Gloucestershire countryside.</ref> Another contemporary of theirs, [[Gerald Finzi]], lived in nearby [[Painswick]].

[[Gustav Holst]] titled his Symphony in F major, Op.8 H47 ''The Cotswolds''. The composer [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] composed his opera ''"Hugh the Drover"'' from 1913 to 1924, which depicts life in a Cotswold village and incorporates local folk melodies.

The film ''[[Better Things (film)|Better Things]]'' (2008), directed by Duane Hopkins, is set in a small Cotswold village. The fictional detective [[Agatha Raisin]] lives in the fictional village of [[Carsely]] in the Cotswolds. The [[Chipping Norton set]] are based in the Cotswolds.
