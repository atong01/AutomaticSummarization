However, because of their differences over the doctrines of divine<space/><link><target>predestination</target></link><space/>and election, many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other. In short, the difference can be seen ultimately by whether God allows His desire to save all to be resisted by an individual's will (in the Arminian doctrine) or if God's grace is irresistible and limited to only some (in Calvinism). Put another way, is God's sovereignty shown, in part, through His allowance of free decisions? Some Calvinists assert that the Arminian perspective presents a synergistic system of Salvation and therefore is not only by grace, while Arminians firmly reject this conclusion. Many consider the theological differences to be crucial differences in doctrine, while others find them to be relatively minor.<extension extension_name='ref'>Gonzalez, Justo L.<space/><italics>The Story of Christianity, Vol. Two: The Reformation to the Present Day</italics><space/>(New York: Harpercollins Publishers, 1985; reprint Peabody: Prince Press, 2008) 180</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>History of Calvinistâ€“Arminian debate</arg><arg>Free will in theology</arg></template><link><target>File:Jacobus Arminius 02 IV 13 2 0026 01 0309 a Seite 1 Bild 0001.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Portrait of<space/><link><target>Jacobus Arminius</target></link>, from ''Kupferstich aus Theatrum Europaeum'' by Matthaeus Merian in 1662</part></link>Jacobus Arminius was a Dutch pastor and theologian in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

When Arminius died before he could satisfy Holland's State General's request for a 14-page paper outlining his views, the Remonstrants replied in his stead crafting the<space/><link><target>Five articles of Remonstrance</target></link>. After some political maneuvering, the Dutch Calvinists were able to convince<space/><link><target>Maurice de Nassau</target><part>Prince Maurice of Nassau</part></link><space/>to deal with the situation.

This<space/><link><target>Synod of Dort</target></link><space/>was open primarily to Dutch Calvinists (Arminians were excluded) with Calvinist representatives from other countries, and in 1618 published a condemnation of Arminius and his followers as heretics.

The emerging Baptist movement in 17th-century England, for example, was a microcosm of the historic debate between Calvinists and Arminians. The first Baptistscalled &quot;<link><target>General Baptists</target></link>&quot; because of their confession of a &quot;general&quot; or unlimited atonement, were Arminians.<extension extension_name='ref'>Gonzalez, Justo L.<space/><italics>The Story of Christianity, Vol. 2: The Reformation to the Present Day</italics><space/>(HarperCollins Publishers, 1985; reprint Peabody: Prince Press, 2008) 225226</extension><space/>The Baptist movement originated with Thomas Helwys, who left his mentor John Smyth (who had moved into shared belief and other distinctives of the Dutch Waterlander Mennonites of Amsterdam) and returned to London to start the first English Baptist Church in 1611. Later General Baptists such as John Griffith, Samuel Loveday, and<space/><link><target>Thomas Grantham (Baptist)</target><part>Thomas Grantham</part></link><space/>defended a Reformed Arminian theology that reflected more the Arminianism of Arminius than that of the later Remonstrants or the English Arminianism of Arminian<space/><link><target>Puritans</target></link><space/>like John Goodwin or Anglican Arminians such as<space/><link><target>Jeremy Taylor</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Henry Hammond</target></link>. The General Baptists encapsulated their Arminian views in numerous confessions, the most influential of which was the Standard Confession of 1660. In the 1640s the Particular Baptists were formed, diverging strongly from Arminian doctrine and embracing the strong Calvinism of the Presbyterians and Independents. Their robust Calvinism was publicized in such confessions as the London Baptist Confession of 1644 and the Second London Confession of 1689. Interestingly, the London Confession of 1689 was later used by Calvinistic Baptists in America (called the Philadelphia Baptist Confession), whereas the Standard Confession of 1660 was used by the American heirs of the English General Baptists, who soon came to be known as<space/><link><target>Free Will Baptists</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>This same dynamic between Arminianism and<space/><link><target>Calvinism</target></link><space/>can be seen in the heated discussions between friends and fellow<space/><link><target>Methodist</target></link><space/>ministers<space/><link><target>John Wesley</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>George Whitefield</target></link>. Wesley was a champion of Arminian teachings, defending his<space/><link><target>soteriology</target></link><space/>in a periodical titled<space/><italics>The Arminian</italics><space/>and writing articles such as<space/><italics>Predestination Calmly Considered</italics>. He defended Arminianism against charges of<space/><link><target>semi-Pelagianism</target></link>, holding strongly to beliefs in<space/><link><target>original sin</target></link><space/>and total depravity.

This seems to fit with Arminius other statements on the need for perseverance in faith. For example: &quot;God resolves to receive into favor those who repent and believe, and to save in Christ, on account of Christ, and through Christ, those who persevere [in faith], but to leave under sin and wrath those who are impenitent and unbelievers, and to condemn them as aliens from Christ&quot; (<italics>Works of Arminius</italics>, 2:465; cf. 2:466).

William Nichols notes: &quot;Arminius spoke nearly the same modest words when interrogated on this subject in the last Conference which he had with Gomarus [a Calvinist], before the states of Holland, on the 12th of Aug. 1609, only two months prior to his decease&quot; (<italics>Works of Arminius</italics>, 1:665). B.J. Oropeza says, &quot;Although Arminius denied having taught final apostasy in his<space/><italics>Declaration of Sentiments</italics>, in the<space/><italics>Examination of the Treatise of Perkins on the Order and Mode of Predestination</italics><space/>he writes that a person who is being 'built' into the church of Christ may resist the continuation of this process. Concerning the believers, 'It may suffice to encourage them, if they know that no power or prudence can dislodge them from the rock, unless they of their own will forsake their position.' [<italics>Works of Arminius</italics>, 3:455, cf. 1:667] A believing member of Christ may become slothful, give place to sin, and gradually die altogether, ceasing to be a member. [<italics>Works of Arminius</italics>, 3:458] The covenant of God (Jeremiah 23) 'does not contain in itself an impossibility of defection from God, but a promise of the gift of fear, whereby they shall be hindered from going away from God so long as that shall flourish in their hearts.'

But whether they are capable, through negligence, of forsaking again the first beginnings of their life in Christ, of again returning to this present evil world, of turning away from the holy doctrine which was delivered them, of losing a good conscience, of becoming devoid of grace, that must be more particularly determined out of the Holy Scripture, before we ourselves can teach it with full persuasion of our minds.

Open theists claim that the future is not completely determined (or &quot;settled&quot;) because people have not made their free decisions yet. God therefore knows the future partially in possibilities (human free actions) rather than solely certainties (divinely determined events). As such, open theists resolve the issue of human<space/><link><target>free will</target></link><space/>and God's sovereignty by claiming that God is sovereign because he does not ordain each human choice, but rather works in cooperation with his creation to bring about his will. This notion of sovereignty and freedom is foundational to their understanding of<space/><link><target>love</target></link><space/>since open theists believe that love is not genuine unless it is freely chosen.

These Arminians reject the concept of individual election entirely, preferring to understand the doctrine in corporate terms. According to this corporate election, God never chose individuals to elect to salvation, but rather He chose to elect the believing church to salvation. Dutch Reformed theologian Herman Ridderbos says &quot;[The certainty of salvation] does not rest on the fact that the church belongs to a certain &quot;number&quot;, but that it belongs to Christ, from before the foundation of the world.

Pastor and theologian Dr. Brian Abasciano claims &quot;What Paul says about Jews, Gentiles, and Christians, whether of their place in Gods plan, or their election, or their salvation, or how they should think or behave, he says from a corporate perspective which views the group as primary and those he speaks about as embedded in the group.
