From 1982 to 1986 he served as deputy to the Bavarian secretary of the state and then as minister of state from 1982 to 1988.

The<space/><link><target>Social Democratic Party of Germany</target><part>SPD</part></link><space/>had mounted a huge comeback, and the CDU/CSU was narrowly defeated (though both the SPD and CDU/CSU had 38.5% of the vote, the SPD was ahead by a small 6,000 vote margin, winning 251 seats to the CDU/CSU's 248).<space/><link><target>Gerhard Schrder</target></link><space/>was re-elected as chancellor by the parliament in a coalition with the<space/><link><target>Alliance '90/The Greens</target><part>Greens</part></link>, who had increased their vote share marginally. Many commentators faulted Stoiber's reaction to the<space/><link><target>2002 European floods</target><part>floods</part></link><space/>in eastern Germany, in the run-up to the election, as a contributory factor in his party's poor electoral result and defeat. In addition, Schrder distinguished himself from his opponent by taking an active stance against the upcoming<space/><link><target>United States</target></link>-led<space/><link><target>2003 invasion of Iraq</target><part>Iraq War</part></link>. His extensive campaigning on this stance was widely seen as swinging the election to the SPD in the weeks running up to the election.</paragraph><paragraph>Stoiber subsequently led the CSU to an absolute majority in the<space/><link><target>Bavarian_state_election,_2003</target><part>Bavarian_state_election_2003</part></link>, for the third time in a row, winning this time 60,7% of the votes and a two-thirds majority in the Landtag.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Controversies</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Vladimir Putin with Edmund Stoiber-1.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Stoiber and<space/><link><target>Vladimir Putin</target></link></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Stoiber is known for backing<space/><link><target>Vladimir Putin</target></link><space/>and there have been comparisons to<space/><link><target>Gerhard Schrder</target></link>.

He enjoys considerably more support in his home state of Bavaria than in the rest of Germany, where CDU chairwoman<space/><link><target>Angela Merkel</target></link><space/>is more popular. This has its reasons: Merkel supports a kind of<space/><link><target>Fiscal conservatism</target></link>, but a more<space/><link><target>Liberalism</target><part>liberal</part></link><space/><link><target>Social policy</target></link>. Stoiber, on the other hand favors a more conservative approach to both fiscal and social matters, and while this ensures him the religious vote, strongest in Bavaria, it has weakened his support at the national level.</paragraph><paragraph>Stoiber, as a minister in the state of Bavaria, is widely known for advocating a reduction in the number of<space/><link><target>asylum seekers</target></link><space/>Germany accepts, something that prompted critics to label him<space/><link><target>xenophobic</target></link>, anti-Turkish and anti-Islam. In the late 1990s he criticized the incoming Chancellor Schrder for saying that he would work hard in the interest of Germans<space/><italics>and</italics><space/>people living in Germany. Stoiber's remarks drew heavy criticism in the press. He is a staunch opponent of<space/><link><target>Turkey</target></link>'s integration into the<space/><link><target>European Union</target></link>, claiming that its non-Christian culture would dilute the Union.</paragraph><paragraph>During the run-up to the German<space/><link><target>German federal election, 2005</target><part>general election</part></link><space/>in 2005, which was held ahead of schedule, Stoiber created controversy through a campaign speech held in the beginning of August 2005 in the federal state of<space/><link><target>Baden-Wrttemberg</target></link>. He said, &quot;I do not accept that the East [of Germany] will again decide who will be Germany's chancellor. It cannot be allowed that the frustrated determine Germany's fate.&quot; People in the new federal states of Germany (the former<space/><link><target>German Democratic Republic</target></link>) were offended by Stoiber's remarks. While the CSU attempted to portray them as &quot;misinterpreted&quot;, Stoiber created further controversy when he claimed that &quot;if it was like Bavaria everywhere, there wouldn't be any problems. Unfortunately, not everyone in Germany is as intelligent as in Bavaria.&quot; The tone of the comments was exacerbated by a perception by some within Germany of the state of Bavaria as &quot;arrogant&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Many, including members of the CDU, attribute Stoiber's comments and behavior as a contributing factor to the CDU's losses in the 2005 general election. He was accused by many in the CDU/CSU of offering &quot;half-hearted&quot; support to Angela Merkel, with some even accusing him of being reluctant to support a female candidate from the East. (This also contrasted unfavorably with Merkel's robust support for his candidacy in the<space/><link><target>German federal election, 2002</target><part>2002 election</part></link>.) He has insinuated that votes were lost because of the choice of a female candidate. He came under heavy fire for these comments from press and politicians alike, especially since he himself lost almost 10% of the Bavarian vote a dubious feat in itself as Bavarians tend to consistently vote conservatively. Nonetheless, a poll has suggested over 9% may have voted differently if the conservative candidate was a man from the West, although this does not clearly show if such a candidate would have gained or lost votes for the conservatives.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Plan to enter federal cabinet 2005 and resignation 2007</heading><paragraph>He was slated to join<space/><link><target>Angela Merkel</target></link>'s first grand coalition cabinet as<space/><link><target>Federal Minister for Economics and Labour (Germany)</target><part>Economics minister</part></link>. However, on 1 November 2005, he announced his decision to stay in Bavaria, due to personal changes on the SPD side of the coalition (<link><target>Franz Mntefering</target></link><space/>resigned as SPD chairman) and an unsatisfactory apportionment of competences between himself and designated Science minister<space/><link><target>Annette Schavan</target></link>. Stoiber also resigned his seat in the 16th Bundestag, being a member from 18 October to 8 November.</paragraph><paragraph>Subsequently, criticism grew in the CSU, where other polticians had to scale back their ambitions after Stoiber's decision to stay in Bavaria. On 18 January 2007, he announced his decision to stand down from the posts of minister-president and party chairman by 30 September.<space/><link><target>Gnther Beckstein</target></link>, then Bavarian state minister of the interior, succeeded him as minister-president and<space/><link><target>Erwin Huber</target></link><space/>as party chairman, defeating<space/><link><target>Horst Seehofer</target></link><space/>at a convention at 18 September 2007 with 58,1% of the votes.
