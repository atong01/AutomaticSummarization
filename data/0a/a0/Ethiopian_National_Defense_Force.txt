The '''Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF)''' is the military of [[Ethiopia]]. Civil direction of the military is carried out through the [[Ministry of Defense (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Defense]], which oversees the ground forces, air force, as well as the [[Defense Industry Sector (Ethiopia)|Defense Industry Sector]]. The current defense minister is [[Siraj Fergessa]].<ref name="moinfo.gov.et">http://moinfo.gov.et/English/publication.php?Main_Page_Number=2541&Doc_Type=English</ref>

The size of the ENDF has fluctuated significantly since the end of the [[Ethiopia-Eritrea war]] in 2000. In 2002 the Ethiopian Defense Forces had a strength of approximately 400,000 troops.<ref name="Ethiopian armed forces">
{{cite web|title=Ethiopia Armed Forces|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Ethiopia-ARMED-FORCES.html|publisher=Nations Encyclopedia}}</ref> This was roughly the same number maintained during the [[Derg]] regime that fell to the rebel forces in 1991. However, that number was later reduced, and in January 2007, during the [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|War in Somalia]], Ethiopian forces were said to comprise about 300,000 troops.<ref name="ETHIOPIAN-FORCES-EAGER-TO-LEARN-FROM-US-SOLDIERS">{{cite web|title=Ethiopian army eager to learn from U.S. soldiers|url=http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=41521&archive=true|publisher=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|date=2007-01-07|accessdate=2007-01-14 }}</ref> In 2012, the IISS estimated that the ground forces had 135,000 personnel and the air force 3,000.<ref name=IISS2012>IISS Military Balance 2012, 434-5.</ref>
 
As of 2012, the ENDF consists of two separate branches: the Ground Forces and the [[Ethiopian Air Force]].<ref name=IISS2012 /> Ethiopia has [[Ethiopian Defense Industry|several defence industrial organisations]] that produce and overhaul different weapons systems. Most of these were built under the Derg regime which planned a large [[military industrial complex]]. The ENDF relies on voluntary military service of people above 18 years of age. Although there is no compulsory military service, armed forces may conduct call-ups when necessary and compliance is compulsory.<ref name="CIA handbook">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2024.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>

Being a landlocked country, Ethiopia today has no [[navy]]. Ethiopia acquired a coastline on the [[Red Sea]] in 1950 and created the [[Ethiopian Navy]] in 1955. [[Eritrea]]'s independence in 1991 left Ethiopia landlocked again, but the Ethiopian Navy continued to operate from foreign ports until it finally was disbanded in 1996.

==History of the Army==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2009}}
The Ethiopian army's origins and military traditions date back to the earliest [[history of Ethiopia]]. Due to Ethiopia's location between the Middle East and Africa, it has long been in the middle of Eastern and Western politics, and has been subject to foreign invasion and aggression.In 1579, the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s attempt to expand from a coastal base at [[Massawa]] was defeated.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The [[Army of the Ethiopian Empire]] was also able to defeat the Egyptians in 1868 at Gura, led by Ethiopian Emperor [[Yohannes IV]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Clapham wrote in the 1980s that the "Abyssinians [had suffered] from a 'superiority complex' which may be traced to Gundet, Gura and Adwa".<ref>Clapham, Christopher 1987. ''Transformation and Continuity in Revolutionary Ethiopia''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Crabites, Pierre.</ref>

In accordance with the order of the emperor of Ethiopia, Directly [[Nikolay Leontiev]] organized the first battalion of the regular Ethiopian army in February 1899. Leontiev formed the first regular battalion, the kernel of which became the company of volunteers from the former [[Senegal]] shooters, which he chose and invited from Western Africa, with training of the Russian and French officers. The first Ethiopian military orchestra was organized at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proza.ru/2011/06/29/667|title= Count Leontiev is spy or adventurer...|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_biography/71087/%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2|title= Nikolay Stepanovich Leontiev|work=Словари и энциклопедии на Академике|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>

===Battle of Adwa===
The [[Battle of Adowa]] is the best known victory of Ethiopian forces over invaders. It maintained Ethiopia's existence as an independent state. Fought on 1 March 1896 against the Kingdom of Italy near the town of [[Adwa]], it was the decisive battle of the First Italo–Ethiopian War. Assisted by all of the major nobles of Ethiopia including, [[Negus]], [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam]], [[Ras Makonnen]], [[Ras Mengesha Yohannes]], and Ras [[Mikael of Wollo]], Emperor [[Menelek II of Ethiopia]] struck a powerful blow against the Italians.

The Ethiopian army had been able to execute the strategic plan of Menelik's headquarters, despite a [[feudal]] system of organization and adverse circumstances. A special role was played by the Russian military advisers and the volunteers of Leontiev's mission.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1895/feb/28/russian-mission-to-abyssinia RUSSIAN MISSION TO ABYSSINIA].</ref><ref>[http://www.300.years.spb.ru/eng/3_spb_3.html?id=64 Who Was Count Abai?].</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sworld.com.ua/index.php/ru/history/world-history-and-the-history-of-ukraine/768-vinogradova-kv|title=The activities of the officer the Kuban Cossack army N.S.

The first problem was the quality of its arms, as the Italian and British colonial authorities were able to sabotage the transportation of 60,000 to 100,000 modern [[Berdan rifles]] from Russia into landlocked Ethiopia.<ref>[http://www.vostlit.nfo/Texts/Dokumenty/Aethiopien/Artamonov/framepred.htm] Leonid Artamonov, a Russian general, geographer and traveler, military adviser of Menelik II, as one of Russian officers of volunteers attached to the forces of Ras Tessema (wrote: Through Ethiopia to the White Nile).</ref>

Secondly, the Ethiopian army was based on a feudal system of organization, and as a result, nearly the entire army was a peasant militia. Russian military experts advising Menelik II suggested trying to achieve full battle collision with Italians, to neutralize the superior firepower of their opponent and potentially nullify their problems with arms, training, and organization, rather than engaging in a campaign of harassment.<ref name="samizdat.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.samizdat.com/armies.html|title=- WITH THE ARMIES OF MENELIK II by Alexander K. Bulatovich|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> In the battle that ensued wave upon wave of Menelik's warriors successfully attacked the Italians.

===Boundary confrontation against the British colonialists 1896&ndash;1899===
After the successful colonial capture of the Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, the British expansion against Ethiopia became a real danger, which diminished only after the start of the [[Second Boer War]] in 1899. The Ethiopian army became more effective against British colonial forces. The numerous expeditions of Ethiopian forces stopped colonial expansion. As the Russian [[Alexander Bulatovich]], one of the Russian military advisers and a participant in the expedition of the legendary army of Ras Wolde Giyorgis, wrote:

<blockquote>"Many consider the Abyssinian army to be undisciplined. They think that it is not in any condition to withstand a serious fight with a well-organized European army, claiming that the recent war with Italy doesn't prove anything. I will not begin to guess the future, and will say only this. Over the course of four months, I watched this army closely. It is unique in the world. And I can bear witness to the fact that it is not quite so chaotic as it seems at first glance, and that on the contrary, it is profoundly disciplined, though in its own unique way. For every Abyssinian, war is normal business, and military skills and rules of army life in the field enter in the flesh and blood of each of them, just as do the main principles of tactics. On the march, each soldier knows how to arrange necessary comforts for himself and to conserve his strength; but on the other hand, when necessary, he shows such endurance and is capable of action in conditions which are difficult even to imagine. 
You see remarkable expediency in all the actions and skills of this army; and each soldier has an amazingly intelligent attitude toward managing the mission of the battle. 
Despite such qualities, because of its impetuousness, it is much more difficult to control this army than a well-drilled European army, and I can only marvel at and admire the skill of its leaders and chiefs, of which there is no shortage."<ref name="samizdat.com"/></blockquote>

In obedience to the agreement with Russia and the order of Menelik II, First Ethiopian officers began to be trained at the First Russian cadet school in 1901. 30 to 40 Ethiopian officers were trained in Russia from 1901 until 1913.

===Under Haile Selassie I===
[[File:Ethiopian camel troops.jpg|thumb|right|Ethiopian troops transporting supplies by camel through vegetation during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].]]
{{Further|Ethiopian Order of Battle Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia}}

Modernization of the army took place under the regency of Tafari Mekonnen, who later reigned as Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]]. He created an [[Imperial Bodyguard]], the ''[[Kebur Zabagna]]'', in 1917 from the earlier ''[[Mahal Safari]]'' who had traditionally attended the Ethiopian Emperor. Its elite were trained at the French [[military academy]] at [[École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] or by Belgian military advisers. He also created his own military school at [[Oletta Military Academy|Holeta]] in January 1935.<ref name="Ethiopia-Military-Tradition-in-National-Life">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+et0163) Ethiopia Military Tradition in National Life] [[Library of Congress]]</ref>

Ethiopian military aviation efforts were initiated in 1929, when Tafari Mekonnen hired two French pilots and purchased four French biplanes.<ref>Library of Congress Country Study, 1991</ref> By the time of the Italian invasion of 1935, the air force had four pilots and thirteen aircraft.

However, these efforts were not sufficient nor instituted in enough time to stop the rising tide of [[Italian fascism]]. Ethiopia lost its independence in the [[Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] of 1935-36. The country regained its independence after the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|1941 East African Campaign]] of [[World War II]] with the intervention of forces from the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. After the Italians had been driven from the country, a British Military Mission to Ethiopia, under Major General Stephen Butler, was established to reorganise the Ethiopian Army.<ref>Ayele, 2014, 7.</ref> The Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 1944 removed the BMME from the jurisdiction of [[East Africa Command]] at Nairobi and made it responsible to the Ethiopian Minister of War.<ref>Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay, 2006, 148. Heads of the British Military Mission to Ethiopia were 1941-1943: Major General Stephen Seymour BUTLER, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., Reserve of Officers (b. 1880 - d. 1964); April 1943 – 1949: Major General Algernon Edward COTTAM, O.B.E., M.C. (b. 1893 - d. 1964).</ref>

Ethiopia bought twenty [[AH-IV]] tankettes from Sweden in the late 1940s. They arrived in [[Djibouti]] on 9 May 1950 after which they were carried by rail to [[Addis Ababa]]. They were used until the 1980s when they participated in the fighting against Somalia.<ref>Kliment, Charles K.; Francev, Vladimír (1997). Czechoslovak Armored Fighting Vehicles. Atglen, PA: Schiffer.

===Korean War===
[[Image:Ethiopian soldiers Korea1951.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ethiopian soldiers in the [[Korean War]], 1951]]

In keeping with the principle of [[collective security]], for which Haile Selassie was an outspoken proponent, Ethiopia sent a contingent under General [[Mulugeta Buli]], known as the [[Kagnew Battalion]], to take part in the [[Korean War]]. It was attached to the American [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]], and fought in a number of engagements including the [[Battle of Pork Chop Hill]].<ref>As described at the [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/lmak27455/Ethiopian_Korean_War_Veterans/help.html&date=2009-10-26+01:54:23 Ethiopian Korean War Veterans] website.</ref> 3,518 Ethiopian troops served in the war, where 121 were killed and 536 wounded during the [[Korean War]].<ref name="US-FORCES-ALLIES-KOREA-FACTSHEET">{{cite web|title=U.S. Forces/Allies in the Korean War: Factsheet|url=http://korea50.army.mil/history/factsheets/allied.shtml|accessdate=2007-02-15|publisher=[[United States Army]] }}</ref>

On May 22, 1953, a U.S.-Ethiopian Mutual Defence Assistance Agreement was signed. A U.S. [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] was dispatched to Ethiopia, and began its work by reorganising the army into three divisions. On 25 September 1953, Selassie created the Imperial Ministry of National Defence that unified the Army, Air Force, and Navy.<ref>David Hamilton Shinn, Thomas P. Ofcansky, 'Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia,' illustrated, Scarecrow Press, 2004, ISBN 0810849100, 40.</ref> The First, Second, and Third Divisions were established with their headquarters at [[Addis Ababa]], [[Asmara]], and [[Harar]], respectively.<ref>Ayele, 'The Ethiopian Army,' 2014, 10.</ref> By 1956, the three divisions had a total of 16,832 troops. In May 1959, he established the Imperial Territorial Army as a reserve force that provided military training to civil servants.

In 1960 the U.S. Army Area Handbook for Ethiopia described the very personalised command arrangements then used by the Emperor:<ref>George Lipsky, U.S. Army Area Handbook for Ethiopia, American University (Washington, D.C.), Washington [Dept. of the Army] for sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U. S. Govt. Print. Office, 1964, 2d ed., 608.</ref>
<blockquote>The Emperor is by constitutional provision Commander-in-Chief, and to him are reserved all rights respecting the size of the forces and their organisation and command, together with the power to appoint, promote, transfer and dismiss military officers. He seeks the advice and consent of Parliament in declaring war. Traditionally, he assumes personal command of the forces in time of war.'</blockquote>

The Office of the Chief of Staff of the Imperial Ethiopian Armed Forces directed the Commanders of the Army, Air Force, and Navy, and the three army divisions were directly responsible to the Commander of the Army.<ref>Lipsky, 1964, 608-9.</ref> The three divisions seemingly included the Third Division in the [[Ogaden]], seen as a hardship post.<ref>Shinn, Ofcansky, 2004, 280.</ref> While technically the Imperial Bodyguard ([[Kebur Zabagna]]) was responsible to the Army Commander, in reality its commander received his orders directly from the Emperor.

''Balambaras'' [[Abebe Aregai]] was one of the noted patriotic resistance leaders of Shoa (central Ethiopia) that rose to preeminence in the post-liberation period.<ref>[http://forumonpublicpolicy.com/summer09/archivesummer09/getahun.pdf Solomon Addis Getahun, Ethiopia in the New Millennium: Issues of Democratic Governance], accessed July 2012.</ref> He became ''Ras,'' a general and minister of defence of the Imperial Ethiopian Armed Forces until his death in the [[1960 Ethiopian coup attempt]].

[[Aman Mikael Andom]] commanded the Third Division during the [[Ogaden War]] of 1964. He later became chief of staff of the Armed Forces in July 1974, and then Minister of Defence.<ref>Shinn, Ofcansky, 2004, 26.</ref> He then became chairman of the Derg from September to December 1974.

Emperor Haile Selassie divided the Ethiopian military into separate commands. The US Army Handbook for Ethiopia notes that each service was provided with training and equipped from different foreign countries "to assure reliability and retention of power."<ref name="Ottaway-45">Cited in Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 45.</ref> The military consisted of the following: Imperial Bodyguard (also known as the "First Division", 8,000 men); three army divisions; services which included the Airborne, Engineers, and Signal Corps; the Territorial Army (5,000 men); and the police (28,000 men).<ref name=Ottaway-45/>

Among reported U.S. equipment deliveries to Ethiopia were 120 [[M59 armored personnel carrier|M59]] and 39 [[M75 armored personnel carrier|M75]] armoured personnel carriers.

By July 1975 the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] was listing a mechanised division in addition to three infantry divisions,(IISS 75-76, p.&nbsp;42) and it appears that there were five divisions active by the time of the 1977 Ogaden War. With significant Soviet assistance, after that point force sizes grew rapidly.

==Seizure of power by the Derg 1974 and aftermath==
The Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police, and Territorial Army, or the Derg ([[Amharic language|Amharic]] "Committee"), was officially announced 28 June 1974 by a group of military officers to maintain law and order due to the powerlessness of the civilian government following widespread [[mutiny]] in the armed forces of Ethiopia earlier that year. Its members were not directly involved in those mutinies, nor was this the first military committee organized to support the administration of Prime Minister [[Endelkachew Makonnen]]: [[Alem Zewde Tessema]] had established the [[Armed Forces Coordinated Committee]] 23 March. However, over the following months radicals in the Ethiopian military came to believe he was acting on behalf of the hated aristocracy, and when a group of notables petitioned for the release of a number of government ministers and officials who were under arrest for corruption and other crimes, three days later the Derg was announced.<ref>Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 52</ref>

The Derg, which originally consisted of soldiers at the capital, broadened its membership by including representatives from the 40 units of the [[Ethiopian Army]], [[Ethiopian Air Force|Air Force]], [[Ethiopian Navy|Navy]], [[Kebur Zabagna]] (Imperial Guard), [[Territorial Army (Ethiopia)|Territorial Army]] and [[Law enforcement in Ethiopia|Police]]: each unit was expected to send three representatives, who were supposed to be privates, NCOs and junior officers up to the rank of major. According to Bahru Zewde, "senior officers were deemed too compromised by close association to the regime."<ref name=Bahru-234>Bahru Zewde, 2000, p. 234</ref>

The committee elected Major [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its chairman and Major [[Atnafu Abate]] as its vice-chairman.  The Derg was initially supposed to study the grievances of various military units, and investigate abuses by senior officers and staff, and to root out corruption in the military. In the months following its founding, the power of the Derg steadily increased. In July 1974 the Derg obtained key concessions from the Emperor, [[Haile Selassie]], which included the power to arrest not only military officers, but government officials at every level.  Soon both former Prime Ministers [[Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte-Wold]], and [[Endelkachew Makonnen]], along with most of their cabinets, most regional governors, many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court found themselves imprisoned.

When the Derg gained control of Ethiopia, they lessened their reliance on the West. Instead they began to draw their equipment and their sources for organisational and training methods from the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Comecon]] countries, especially [[Cuba]]. During this period, Ethiopian forces were often locked in [[counter-insurgency]] campaigns against various [[guerrilla]] groups. They honed both conventional and guerrilla tactics during campaigns in Eritrea, and the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] that toppled Ethiopian former military dictator [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] in 1991 and also by repelling an invasion launched by [[Somalia]] in the 1977–1978 [[Ogaden War]].<ref>See Gebru Tareke, The Ethiopia-Somalia War of 1977 Revisited, [[The International Journal of African Historical Studies]], Vol. 33, No. 3 (2000), pp. 635-667.</ref>

The Ethiopian army grew considerably under the Derg (1974–1987), and the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] under Mengistu (1987–1991), especially during the latter regime. Gebru Tareke describes the organization of the Ethiopian military in early 1990, a year before Mengistu fled the country:
: Ethiopian ground forces comprised four revolutionary armies organized as task forces, eleven corps, twenty-four infantry divisions, and four mountain divisions, reinforced by five mechanised divisions, two airborne divisions, and ninety-five brigades, including four mechanised brigades, three artillery brigades, four tank brigades, twelve special commando and paracommando brigades &ndash; including the Spartakiad, which became operational in 1987 under the preparation and guidance of North Koreans &ndash; seven [[Multiple rocket launcher|BM-rocket]] battalions, and ten brigades of paramilitary forces.<ref>Gebru Tareke, ''The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 120</ref>

Estimated forces under arms increased dramatically:<ref name="ETHIOPIA-ARMY-LOC"/>
* 1974: 41,000 (Ethiopian Revolution)
* 1977: 53,500 ([[Ogaden War]])
* 1979: 65,000
* 1991: 230,000 (overthrow of Mengistu)

Cuba provided a significant influx of military advisors and troops over this period, with the largest escalation during the Ogaden War with Somalia, supported by a Soviet airlift:<ref name="ETHIOPIA-CUBA">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+et0178) Ethiopia: Cuba] [[Library of Congress]] Country Studies</ref>

* 1978: 12,000
* 1984: 3,000
* 1989: All forces withdrawn

===1991 Order of Battle===

By 1991, the Ethiopian army under the Mengistu government had grown in size, but the regime was overcome by the [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ, former [[EPLF]]), [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF), [[Oromo Liberation Front]] (OLF) and other opposition factions during a decades long civil war. Mengistu's People's Militia had also grown to about 200,000 members. The mechanized forces of the army comprised 1,200 [[T-54/55]], 100 [[T-62]] tanks, and 1,100 [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs), but readiness was estimated to be only about 30 percent operational, because of the withdrawal of financial support, lack of maintenance expertise and parts from the Soviet Union, Cuba and other nations.<ref name="ETHIOPIA-ARMY-LOC">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+et0167) Ethiopia: Army] [[Library of Congress]] Country Studies</ref>
[[Image:T-55s civil war.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Ethiopian [[T-62]] tanks at the end of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]].]]
The army commands consisted of the following:

* First Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Harar]])
* Second Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Asmera]])
* Third Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Kombolcha]])
* Fourth Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Nekemte]])
* Fifth Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Gondar]])

To these armies were assigned the operational forces of the army, comprising:

* 31 [[infantry]] [[Division (military)|division]]s
* 32 [[tank]] [[battalion]]s
* 40 [[artillery]] [[battalion]]s
* 12 [[air defence]] [[battalion]]s
* 8 [[commando]] [[brigade]]s

===From 1991===
After the defeat of the military government in 1991, the provisional government disbanded the former national army and relied on its own guerrilla fighters for national security.<ref name=LOCEth2005>Library of Congress Federal Research Division, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Ethiopia.pdf Country Profile: Ethiopia, April 2005], accessed July 2012</ref> In 1993, however, the Tigrayan-led government announced plans to create a multi-ethnic defence force. This process entailed the creation of a new professional army and officer class and the demobilization of many of the irregulars who had fought against the military government. With the collapse of the Soviet Union Ethiopia again turned to the Western powers for alliance and assistance. However, many Tigrayan officers remained in command positions. This transformation was still underway when war with [[Eritrea]] broke out in 1998, a development that saw the ranks of the armed forces swell along with defense expenditures.

Although the armed forces have significant battlefield experience, their militia orientation has complicated the transition to a structured, integrated military.<ref name=LOCEth2005 /> Ranks and conventional units were only adopted in 1996. A United States-assisted effort to restructure the armed forces was interrupted by mobilisation for the war with Eritrea.

====The Ethiopia-Eritrea war====
[[Image:Afrimil-ethiopiansoldier.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Soldier of Ethiopian National Defense Force, 2006.]]
The former allies EPRDF and PFDJ (former EPLF) led their countries Ethiopia and Eritrea, respectively, into the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] of 1998.  The war was fought over the disputed region of Badme. During the course of the war, some commanders and pilots from the former army and air force were recalled to duty. These officers helped turn the tide decisively against Eritrea in 2000. Following the war's end, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission, a body founded by the UN, established that the Badme region had in fact belonged to Eritrea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/NewLinks/eebcarbitration/|title=Recent Additions|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> Although the two countries are now at peace, Ethiopia rejected the results of the international court's decision, and continued to occupy Badme. Most observers agree that Ethiopia's rejection of international law, coupled with the high numbers of soldiers maintained on the border by each side &ndash; a debilitatingly high number, particularly for the Eritrean side &ndash; means that the two countries are effectively still in conflict.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

After the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] in 2001, the Ethiopian army began to train with the U.S. [[Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) established in [[Djibouti]]. Ethiopia allowed the US to station military advisors at [[Camp Hurso]].<ref name="US-TRAINERS-PREPARE-ETHIOPIANS-TO-FIGHT">{{cite news|url=http://stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=41429&archive=true|title=U.S. trainers prepare Ethiopians to fight|publisher=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|date=2006-12-30|accessdate=2007-01-14 }}</ref> Part of the training at Camp Hurso has included U.S. Army elements, including 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry, training the 12th, 13th and 14th Division Reconnaissance Companies, which from July 2003 were being formed into a new Ethiopian anti-terrorism battalion.<ref>Memo: Meritorious Unit Commendation for 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry, 2d Brigade, 10th Mountain Division (LI), Fort Drum, NY 13602, from 2nd Brigade, 10th MD(LI), 21 January 2004, downloaded from Internet and accessed mid September 2007.</ref>

====Somalia====
Ethiopian troops helped drive the [[Islamic Courts Union]] out of Mogadishu in Somalia. In December 2006, the ENDF entered Somalia to confront the Islamic Courts Union, initially winning the [[Battle of Baidoa]]. This led to the seizure of Mogadishu by Ethiopian troops and TFG militias, and subsequent heavy fighting there. After the Islamists split into two groups, moderate Islamists led by Sheikh Ahmed signed a UN backed peace deal with the TFG and established a larger government in Mogadishu. Ethiopian troops withdrew as part of the terms of the peace deal. Government forces have been engaged in battle against Ogaden insurgents led by the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]].

[[Gabre Heard]] commanded the forces in Somalia. As of 2014, the Ethiopian troops in Somalia are being integrated into the [[AMISOM]] peacekeeping force. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201311131037.html|title=Somalia: Ethiopia Decides to Join Amisom Force in Somalia|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiiraan.com/news4/2013/Nov/52023/somali_war_expertise_and_superior_combat_kits_to_boost_anti_terror_campaign.aspx|title=Hiiraan Online: Somali war expertise and superior combat kits to boost anti-terror campaign|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>

==Ground Forces==
The [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] estimated in the Military Balance 2009 that the army comprised 4 Military Regional Commands; (Northern (HQ [[Mekele]].<ref>http://www.ena.gov.et/EnglishNews/2008/Jul/24Jul08/63634.htm</ref>), Western, Central, and Eastern) each acting as corps HQ.<ref>IISS Military Balance 2009, p.301</ref> There was also a Support Command and a strategic reserve of 4 divisions and 6 specialist brigades centred on Addis Ababa.

Each of the four corps comprised a headquarters and an estimated one mechanised division and between 4-6 infantry divisions.

In 2014 the regional commanders were listed by dissident sources as:
*Central Command, Major General [[Yohannes Woldegiorgis]]
*Northern Command, Major General [[Gebrat Ayele]]
*Western Command, Major General [[Birhanu Julla]]
*Eastern Command, Major General [[Abraha Woldemariam]]<ref>http://www.masreja.com/tplf-military-commanders-and-officers/lieutenant-general-abraha-woldemariam-quarter/</ref>

The modern ENDF has a wide mix of equipment. Many of its major weapons systems stem from the Communist era and are of Soviet and Eastern bloc design. The [[United States]] was Ethiopia's major [[arms industry|arms supplier]] from the end of the Second World War until 1977, when Ethiopia began receiving massive arms shipments from the Soviet Union.<ref>[[Library of Congress Country Studies]], [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+et0175%29 Ethiopia: Foreign Military Assistance]</ref> These shipments, including armored patrol boats, transport and jet fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks, trucks, missiles, artillery, and small arms have incurred an unserviced Ethiopian debt to the former Soviet Union estimated at more than $3.5 billion.

Ethiopia made significant purchases of arms from Russia in late 1999 and early 2000 before the May 2000 United Nations arms embargo went into effect.<ref name=LOCEth2005 /> It is likely that much of that equipment suffered battle damage in the war with Eritrea. Thus, raw numbers alone will probably overstate the capacity of the ENDF.

==Peacekeeping==

Ethiopia has served in various [[United Nations]] and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions. These have included [[Ivory Coast]],<ref name="Ethiopian peacekeeping in Africa">{{cite web|url=http://ethiopia.usembassy.gov/pr1208.html|title=Ethiopian peacekeeping in Africa|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref><ref name="Ethiopian peacekeeping missions">[http://www.ena.gov.et/EnglishNews/2008/Apr/17Apr08/55692.htm Ethiopian peacekeeping missions]</ref> on the Burundi border,<ref name="Ethiopian peacekeeping in Africa"/><ref>[http://www.capitalethiopia.com/archive/2008/april/week3/in_briefs.htm Ethiopian peacekeeping missions in Burundi]</ref> and in Rwanda.

Two major Ethiopian missions are in Liberia and Darfur. The [[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL) was established by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1509]], of 19 September 2003, to support the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the peace process, protect United Nations staff, facilities and civilians, support humanitarian and human rights activities; as well as assist in national security reform, including national police training and formation of a new, restructured military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unmil/index.html|title=UNMIL in Liberia|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> In November 2007, nearly 1,800 Ethiopian troops serving with the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) were presented with UN Peacekeeping medals for their "invaluable contribution to the peace process."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nazret.com/blog/index.php?title=ethiopia_ethiopian_troops_awarded_un_pea&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1|title=Ethiopian troops awarded UN peacekeeping medals|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> 
Up to three Ethiopian battalions used to constitute Sector 4 of the UN Mission, covering the southern part of the country.

Many thousands of Ethiopian peacekeepers are involved in the joint African Union/United Nations Hybrid operation in Darfur, western Sudan. The Security Council authorized a UNAMID force of about 26,000 uniformed personnel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29348&Cr=unamid&Cr1=|title=More Ethiopian troops arrive in Darfur bolstering peacekeeping operation|date=17 December 2008|work=UN News Service Section|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unamid/index.html|title=UNAMID|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>

Ethiopia also provides the entire force for the UN's Abyei mission, the [[United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei]]. An Ethiopian officer commands the force.
