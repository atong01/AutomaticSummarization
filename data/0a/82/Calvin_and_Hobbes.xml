Watterson had negotiated the deal to allow himself more creative freedom in the Sunday comics:</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='blockquote'><paragraph>I took a sabbatical after resolving a long and emotionally draining fight to prevent<space/><italics>Calvin and Hobbes</italics><space/>from being merchandised. Looking for a way to rekindle my enthusiasm for the duration of a new contract term, I proposed a redesigned Sunday format that would permit more panel flexibility. To my surprise and delight, Universal responded with an offer to market the strip as an unbreakable half page (more space than I'd dared to ask for), despite the expected resistance of editors.</paragraph><paragraph>To this day, my syndicate assures me that some editors liked the new format, appreciated the difference, and were happy to run the larger strip, but I think it's fair to say that this was not the most common reaction. The syndicate had warned me to prepare for numerous cancellations of the Sunday feature, but after a few weeks of dealing with howling, purple-faced editors, the syndicate suggested that papers could reduce the strip to the size tabloid newspapers used for their smaller sheets of paper. ... I focused on the bright side: I had complete freedom of design and there were virtually no cancellations.</paragraph><paragraph>For all the yelling and screaming by outraged editors, I remain convinced that the larger Sunday strip gave newspapers a better product and made the comics section more fun for readers. Comics are a visual medium. A strip with a lot of drawing can be exciting and add some variety. Proud as I am that I was able to draw a larger strip, I don't expect to see it happen again any time soon. In the newspaper business, space is money, and I suspect most editors would still say that the difference is not worth the cost. Sadly, the situation is a vicious circle: because there's no room for better artwork, the comics are simply drawn; because they're simply drawn, why should they have more room?<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>#CITEREFWatterson2001</target><part>Watterson (2001)</part></link>, p. 15</extension></paragraph></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Animation</heading><paragraph>Watterson did consider allowing Calvin and Hobbes to be animated, and has expressed admiration for the art form of animation. In a 1989 interview in<space/><italics><link><target>The Comics Journal</target></link></italics><space/>he said:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quotation</target><arg name="If you look at the old cartoons by [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]], you'll see that there are a lot of things single drawings just can't do. Animators can get away with incredible distortion and exaggeration ... because the animator can control the length of time you see something. The bizarre exaggeration barely has time to register, and the viewer doesn't ponder the incredible license he's witnessed.

In a comic strip, you just show the highlights of action—you can't show the buildup and release ... or at least not without slowing down the pace of everything to the point where it's like looking at individual frames of a movie, in which case you've probably lost the effect you were trying to achieve. In a comic strip, you can suggest motion and time, but it's very crude compared to what an animator can do.

Do we allow our work to be hyped and exploited by a market that's simply hungry for the next new thing? Do we participate in a system that turns high art into low art so it's better suited for mass consumption?

Of course, when an artist goes commercial, he makes a mockery of his status as an outsider and free thinker. He buys into the crass and shallow values art should transcend. He trades the integrity of his art for riches and fame.

She is polite and studious, and likes to play house or host tea parties with her stuffed animals. However, she is also depicted playing imaginary games with Calvin in which she is a high-powered lawyer or politician and he is her<space/><link><target>househusband</target></link>. Though both of them hate to admit it, Calvin and Susie have quite a bit in common. For example, Susie is shown on occasion with a stuffed bunny rabbit named &quot;<link><target>Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes#Mr. Bun</target><part>Mr. Bun</part></link>.&quot; Susie also has a mischievous (and sometimes aggressive) streak, which can be seen when she subverts Calvin's attempts to cheat on school tests by feeding him incorrect answers, or clobbers Calvin when he attacks her with snowballs. Susie also regularly bests Calvin in confrontations such as their water balloon and snowball fights, employing guile or force. Hobbes often openly expresses romantic feelings for Susie, much to Calvin's disgust. Calvin starts a &quot;club&quot; (of which he and Hobbes are the only members) that he calls G.R.O.S.S. (<bold>G</bold>et<space/><bold>R</bold>id<space/><bold>O</bold>f<space/><bold>S</bold>limy Girl<bold>S</bold>), and while holding &quot;meetings&quot; in Calvin's treehouse or in the &quot;box of secrecy&quot; in Calvin's room, they usually come up with some way to annoy or socially maim Susie, most of which backfire on them completely. In one instance, Calvin steals one of Susie's dolls for ransom, only to have Susie retaliate by nabbing Hobbes. Watterson admits that Calvin and Susie have a nascent crush on each other, and that Susie is inspired by the type of woman whom Watterson himself found attractive and eventually married.<extension extension_name='ref' name="watterson1995"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Secondary characters</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Calvin also interacts with a handful of secondary characters.

She takes advantage of his parents' desperation to leave the house and the fact that no one else will babysit for Calvin by demanding advances and raises. She is also probably the only character in the strip whom Calvin really fears, as she does not mince words or actions to get Calvin to behave or go to bed on time. Watterson put her in a Sunday strip early on, never thinking of her as a regular character. But Rosalyn's intimidation of Calvin surprised Watterson, so she came back several times. At one point she was Calvin's swimming instructor, though he was only shown to attend one lesson. In Rosalyn's last story, she is revealed to have in common with Calvin a sense of imagination, and the two of them play Calvinball with Hobbes.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Moe</heading><paragraph>Moe is, according to Calvin, a &quot;six-year-old who shaves&quot; and a stereotypical<space/><link><target>Bullying</target><part>bully</part></link><space/>who picks on Calvin (both physically and emotionally) and calls him names. Moe is the only regular character whose speech is shown in an unusual font as his frequently monosyllabic dialogue is shown in crude, lower-case letters.

She usually wears either a polka-dotted dress or a brown dress, and is another character who serves as a foil to Calvin's mischief. Calvin, when in his Spaceman Spiff persona, sees Miss Wormwood as a slimy, often dictatorial alien. Calvin refers to Miss Wormwood's indigestion (&quot;It's really gross how she drinks<space/><link><target>Maalox</target></link><space/>straight from the bottle&quot;), her medication (&quot;I wonder if her doctor knows she mixes all those prescriptions&quot;) and her smoking habit (&quot;Rumor has it she's up to two packs a day, unfiltered&quot;). Miss Wormwood reacts to Calvin's behavior by tightly shutting her eyes and thinking &quot;Five years until retirement&quot; repeatedly. Watterson describes her as &quot;an unhappy person&quot; due to her belief in the value of education.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>#CITEREFWatterson1995</target><part>Watterson (1995)</part></link>, p. 25</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Mr. Spittle</heading><paragraph>Mr. Spittle is the school principal to whose office Miss Wormwood threatens to send Calvin for his pranks for spanking.

Uncle Max was originally meant as a character who could increase the possibilities of the strip: as Watterson noted, &quot;Calvin could go visit Uncle Max...&quot;.

Later, he is snatched by the pushy dame's &quot;hired goon&quot; (Calvin's father having a talk with him). He made his debut when Calvin donned a<space/><link><target>fedora</target></link><space/>to hide a haircut Hobbes had given him. These strips are drawn in elaborate, shadowy black-and-white that evoke<space/><link><target>film noir</target></link>. Watterson did not attempt Tracer Bullet stories often, due the time-consuming way the strip needed to be drawn and inked.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>#CITEREFWatterson1995</target><part>Watterson (1995)</part></link>, p. 132</extension></listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem>As &quot;Stupendous Man&quot; he pictures himself as a superhero in disguise, wearing a mask and a cape made by his mother, and narrating his own adventures.

When Hobbes asks if Stupendous Man has ever won any battles, Calvin says all his battles are &quot;moral victories.&quot; Stupendous Man's nemeses include &quot;Mom-Lady&quot; (Calvin's mom), &quot;Annoying Girl&quot; (Susie Derkins), &quot;Crab Teacher&quot; (Miss Wormwood), and &quot;Baby-Sitter Girl&quot; (Rosalyn). Some of the &quot;super powers&quot; of the villains have been revealed: Mom-Lady has a &quot;mind scrambling eyeball ray&quot; that wills the victim to &quot;do her nefarious bidding,&quot; and Baby Sitter Girl has a similar power of using a &quot;psycho beam&quot; which weakens &quot;Stupendous Man's stupendous will&quot;. The &quot;powers&quot; of Annoying Girl and Crab Teacher are unknown. Calvin often tries to pretend he and &quot;Stupendous Man&quot; are two different people, but it never seems to work. Stupendous Man has multiple &quot;superpowers&quot;, including, but not limited to, super strength, the ability to fly, various vision powers (such as &quot;high-speed vision&quot;) and a stomach of steel.</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Cardboard boxes</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Scientific Progress Goes Boink (Calvin and Hobbes).jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>200px</part><part>Calvin duplicating himself using a cardboard box, as seen on the cover of ''Scientific Progress Goes &quot;Boink&quot;''</part></link>Calvin has had several adventures involving corrugated<space/><link><target>cardboard box</target><trail>es</trail></link>, which he adapts for many different uses.

In this way, a cardboard box can be used not only for its conventional purposes (a storage container for water balloons, for example), but also as a flying<space/><link><target>Time travel</target><part>time machine</part></link>, a duplicator or, with the attachment of a few wires and a colander, a &quot;Cerebral Enhance-o-tron.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>In addition, Calvin uses a cardboard box as a desk when he is attempting to sell things.

He uses the snowman for social commentary, revenge, or pure enjoyment. Examples include Snowman Calvin being yelled at by Snowman Dad to shovel the snow; one snowman eating snowcones taken from a second snowman, who is lying on the ground with an ice-cream scoop in his back; a snowman house of horror; and snowmen representing the people he hates. &quot;The ones I<space/><italics>really</italics><space/>hate are small, so they'll melt faster,&quot; he says. There was even an occasion on which Calvin accidentally brought a snowman to life and it made itself and a small army into &quot;deranged mutant killer monster snow goons.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Calvin's snow art is often used as a commentary on art in general. For example, Calvin has complained more than once about the lack of originality in other people's snow art and compared it with his own grotesque snow sculptures. In one of these instances, Calvin and Hobbes claim to be the sole guardians of high culture; in another, Hobbes admires Calvin's willingness to put artistic integrity above marketability, causing Calvin to reconsider and make an ordinary snowman.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Wagon and sled</heading><paragraph>Calvin and Hobbes frequently ride downhill in a<space/><link><target>wagon</target></link>,<space/><link><target>sled</target></link>, or<space/><link><target>toboggan</target></link>, depending on the season, as a device to add some physical comedy to the strip and because, according to Watterson, &quot;it's a lot more interesting ... than talking heads.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="Tenth_p104"><link><target>#CITEREFWatterson1995</target><part>Watterson (1995)</part></link>, p. 104.</extension><space/>While the ride is sometimes the focus of the strip,<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>#CITEREFWatterson2005</target><part>Watterson (2005)</part></link>, vol. 2, pp. 233, 325.

The club was founded in the garage of their house. To clear space for its activities, Calvin and (purportedly) Hobbes push Calvin's parents' car, causing it to roll into a ditch (but not suffer damage); the incident necessitates changing the club's location to Calvin's treehouse. They hold meetings to attempt to annoy Susie Derkins. Notable actions include planting a fake secret tape near her in attempt to draw her in to a trap, trapping her in a closet at their house, and creating elaborate water balloon traps. Calvin gave himself and Hobbes important positions in the club, Calvin being &quot;Dictator-for-Life&quot; and Hobbes being &quot;President-and-First-Tiger&quot;. They go into Calvin's treehouse for their club meetings and often get into fights during them. The password to get into the treehouse is intentionally long and difficult, which has on at least one occasion ruined Calvin's plans. (Because Hobbes can climb the tree without the rope, he got to think up the password, which heaps praise upon tigers.) An example of this can be seen in the comic strip where Calvin, rushing to get into the treehouse to throw things at a passing Susie Derkins, insults Hobbes, who is in the treehouse and thus has to let down the rope. Hobbes forces Calvin to say the password for insulting him. By the time Susie arrives, in time to hear Calvin saying some of the password, causing him to stumble, Calvin is on &quot;<italics>Verse Seven:</italics><space/>Tigers are perfect/the E-pit-o-me/of good looks and grace/and quiet..uh..um..dignity&quot;.
