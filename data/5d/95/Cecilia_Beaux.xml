Beaux learned to play the piano but preferred singing. The musical atmosphere later proved an advantage for her artistic ambitions. Beaux recalled, &quot;They understood perfectly the spirit and necessities of an artist's life.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 20</extension><space/>In her early teens, she had her first major exposure to art during visits with Willie to the nearby<space/><link><target>Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts</target></link>, one of America's foremost art schools and museums. Though fascinated by the narrative elements of some of the pictures, particularly the Biblical themes of the massive paintings of<space/><link><target>Benjamin West</target></link>, at this point Beaux had no aspirations of becoming an artist.<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 25</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Her childhood was a sheltered though generally happy one.

Drinker became Beaux's role model, and she continued lessons with Drinker for a year. She then studied for two years with the painter Francis Adolf Van der Wielen, who offered lessons in perspective and drawing from casts during the time that the new<space/><link><target>Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts</target></link><space/>was under construction. Given the bias of the<space/><link><target>Victorian age</target></link>, female students were denied direct study in anatomy and could not attend drawing classes with live models (who were often prostitutes) until a decade later.<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 37</extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:New England Woman Cecilia Beaux.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>200px</part><part>''New England Woman''.

She also gave private art lessons and produced decorative art and small portraits. Her own studies were mostly self-directed.

However, she did not find technical illustration suitable for a career (the extreme exactitude required gave her pains in the &quot;solar plexus&quot;).

His progressive teaching philosophy, focused on anatomy and live study (and allowed the female students to partake in segregated studios), eventually led to his firing as director of the Academy. She did not ally herself with Eakins' ardent student supporters, and later wrote, &quot;A curious instinct of self-preservation kept me outside the magic circle.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 59</extension><space/>Instead, she attended costume and portrait painting classes for three years taught by the ailing director<space/><link><target>Christian Schussele</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 55</extension><space/>Beaux won the<space/><link><target>Mary Smith Prize</target></link><space/>at the<space/><link><target>Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts</target></link><space/>exhibitions in 1885, 1887, 1891, and 1892.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Penn Academy"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts</arg><arg name="title">Catalogue of the Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="year">1914</arg><arg name="pages">10–11</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>After leaving the Academy, the 24-year-old Beaux decided to try her hand at<space/><link><target>porcelain painting</target></link><space/>and she enrolled in a course at the National Art Training School.

Though Beaux admired Eakins more and thought his painting skill superior to Sartain's, she preferred the latter's gentle teaching style which promoted no particular aesthetic approach.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Carter, p. 65">Carter, p. 65</extension><space/>Unlike Eakins, however, Sartain believed in<space/><link><target>phrenology</target></link><space/>and Beaux adopted a lifelong belief that physical characteristics correlated with behaviors and traits.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Carter, p. 65"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Beaux attended Sartain's classes for two years, then rented her own studio and shared it with a group of women artists who hired a live model and continued without an instructor. After the group disbanded, Beaux set in earnest to prove her artistic abilities. She painted a large canvas in 1884,<space/><italics>Les Derniers Jours d'Enfance</italics>, a portrait of her sister and nephew whose composition and style revealed a debt to<space/><link><target>James McNeill Whistler</target></link><space/>and whose subject matter was akin to<space/><link><target>Mary Cassatt</target></link>'s mother-and-child paintings.<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 67</extension><space/>It was awarded a prize for the best painting by a female artist at the Academy, and further exhibited in Philadelphia and New York. Following that seminal painting, she painted over 50 portraits in the next three years with the zeal of a committed professional artist. Her invitation to serve as a juror on the hanging committee of the Academy confirmed her acceptance amongst her peers.<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 69</extension><space/>In the mid-1880s, she was receiving commissions from notable Philadelphians and earning $500 per portrait, comparable to what Eakins commanded.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Carter, p. 70">Carter, p. 70</extension><space/>When her friend Margaret Bush-Brown insisted that<space/><italics>Les Derniers</italics><space/>was good enough to be exhibited at the famed<space/><link><target>Paris Salon</target></link>, Beaux relented and sent the painting abroad in the care of her friend, who managed to get the painting into the exhibition.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Carter, p. 70"></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Clemenceau Beaux 1920.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>200px</part><part><link><target>Georges Clemenceau</target></link><space/>by Cecilia Beaux (1920)</part></link></paragraph><heading level='3'>Paris</heading><paragraph>At 32, despite her clear success in Philadelphia, Beaux decided that she still needed to advance her skills.

There she trained at the<space/><link><target>Acadmie Julian</target></link>, the largest art school in Paris, and at the<space/><link><target>Acadmie Colarossi</target></link>, receiving weekly critiques from established masters like<space/><link><target>Tony Robert-Fleury</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>William-Adolphe Bouguereau</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 77</extension><space/>She wrote, &quot;Fleury is much less benign than Bouguereau and don't temper his severitieshe hinted of possibilities before me and as he rose said the nicest thing of all, 'we will do all we can to help you'I want these mento know me and recognize that I can do something.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 82</extension><space/>Though advised regularly of Beauxs progress abroad and to &quot;not be worried about any indiscretions of ours&quot;, her Aunt Eliza repeatedly reminded her niece to avoid the temptations of Paris, &quot;Remember you are first of all a Christian then a woman and last of all an Artist.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 84</extension></paragraph><paragraph>When Beaux arrived in Paris, the<space/><link><target>Impressionism</target><part>Impressionists</part></link>, a group of artists who had begun their own series of independent exhibitions from the official Salon in 1874, were beginning to lose their solidarity. Also known as the &quot;Independents&quot; or &quot;Intransigents&quot;, the group which at times included<space/><link><target>Degas</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Monet</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Alfred Sisley</target><part>Sisley</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Caillebotte</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Pissarro</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Renoir</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Berthe Morisot</target></link>, had been receiving the wrath of the critics for several years. Their art, though varying in style and technique, was the antithesis of the type of Academic art in which Beaux was trained and of which her teacher William-Adolphe Bouguereau was a leading master. In the summer of 1888, with classes in summer recess, Beaux worked in the fishing village of<space/><link><target>Concarneau</target></link><space/>with the American painters Alexander Harrison and Charles Lasar. She tried applying the plein-air painting techniques used by the Impressionists to her own landscapes and portraiture, with little success.<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 87</extension><space/>Unlike her predecessor<space/><link><target>Mary Cassatt</target></link>, who had arrived near the beginning of the Impressionist movement 15 years earlier and who had absorbed it, Beaux's artistic temperament, precise and true to observation, would not align with Impressionism and she remained a realist painter for the rest of her career, even as<space/><link><target>Czanne</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Matisse</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Gauguin</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Picasso</target></link><space/>were beginning to take art into new directions.<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 91</extension><space/>Beaux mostly admired classic artists like<space/><link><target>Titian</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Rembrandt</target></link>.

All three aunts had died and she needed an emotional break from Philadelphia and New York. She managed to find new subjects for portraiture, working in the mornings and enjoying a leisurely life the rest of the time. She carefully regulated her energy and her activities to maintain a productive output, and considered that a key to her success. On why so few women succeeded in art as she did, she stated, &quot;Strength is the stumbling block. They (women) are sometimes unable to stand the hard work of it day in and day out. They become tired and cannot reenergize themselves.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Carter, p. 149</extension></paragraph><paragraph>While Beaux stuck to her portraits of the elite, American art was advancing into urban and social subject matter, led by artists such as<space/><link><target>Robert Henri</target></link><space/>who espoused a totally different aesthetic, &quot;Work with great speed..Have your energies alert, up and active.
