The '''Apicomplexa''' (also called '''Apicomplexia''') are a large [[phylum]] of [[parasitic]] [[protist]]s. Most of them possess a unique form of [[organelle]] that comprises a type of [[plastid]] called an [[apicoplast]], and an ''apical complex'' structure. The organelle is an adaptation that the organism applies in penetration of a host cell.

The Apicomplexa are unicellular and spore-forming.  All species are [[obligate parasite|obligate]] [[parasitism#types|endoparasite]]s of animals,<ref>{{cite book |author=Jadwiga Grabda |title=Marine fish parasitology: an outline |page=8 |year=1991 |publisher=VCH |isbn=0-89573-823-6 }}</ref> except ''Nephromyces'', a [[symbiosis|symbiont]] in marine animals, originally classified as a [[chytrid]] fungus.<ref>Saffo, M.

''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', 107(37), 16190-16195.</ref> Motile structures such as [[flagellum|flagella]] or [[pseudopod]]s are present only in certain [[gamete]] stages.

The Apicomplexa are a diverse group that includes organisms such as the [[coccidia]], [[gregarine]]s, [[piroplasm]]s, [[haemogregarine]]s, and [[Plasmodiidae|plasmodia]]. The various members of the superphylum Apicomplexa cause a range of diseases, including:
* [[Babesiosis]] (''[[Babesia]]'')
* [[Malaria]] (''[[Plasmodium]]'')
and
* [[Coccidiosis]] in various forms, including:
** [[Cryptosporidiosis]] (''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]'')
** [[Cyclosporiasis]] (''[[Cyclospora cayetanensis]]'')
** [[Isosporiasis]] (''[[Isospora belli]]'')
** [[Toxoplasmosis]] (''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'')

The name of the taxon Apicomplexa derives from two [[Latin]] words — ''apex'' (top) and ''complexus'' (infolds) — and refers to a set of [[organelle]]s in the [[sporozoite]]. The Apicomplexa comprise the bulk of what used to be called the Sporozoa, a group of parasitic protozoans, in general without flagella, cilia, or pseudopods. Most of the Apicomplexa are motile however, by use of a [[gliding motility|gliding mechanism]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stefan H.I. Kappe1 |title=Apicomplexan gliding motility and host cell invasion: overhauling the motor model |journal=Trends in Parasitology |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=13–6 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14700584|doi=10.1016/j.pt.2003.10.011 |url=http://www.cell.com/trends/parasitology/abstract/S1471-4922(03)00287-3|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Sometimes, the name Sporozoa is taken as a synonym for the Apicomplexa, or occasionally as a subset.

==General features of the Apicomplexa==
All members of this phylum have an infectious stage — the sporozoite — which possesses three distinct structures in an apical complex. The apical complex consists of a set of spirally arranged [[microtubule]]s (the conoid), a secretory body (the [[rhoptry]]) and one or more [[polar ring]]s. Additional slender electron-dense secretory bodies ([[microneme]]s) surrounded by one or two polar rings may also be present. This structure gives the phylum its name.

A further group of spherical organelles is distributed throughout the cell rather than being localized at the [[apical complex]] and are known as the dense granules. These typically have a mean diameter of about 0.7 μm. Secretion of the dense-granule content takes place after parasite invasion and localization within the [[parasitophorous vacuole]] and persists for several minutes.

Other morphological findings that are common to all members of this phylum include:
*The [[nucleus (cell)|nucleus]] is [[haploid]].
*[[Flagella]] are found only in the motile gamete. These are posteriorly directed and vary in number (usually one to three).
*[[Basal body|Basal bodies]] are present. Although hemosporidians and piroplasmids have normal triplets of [[microtubule]]s in their basal bodies, coccidians and gregarines have nine singlets. 
*The [[mitochondria]] have tubular [[cristae]].
*A [[Golgi apparatus]] is present.
*[[Centriole]]s, [[chloroplast]]s, ejectile organelles, and inclusions are absent.
*Colourless [[plastid]]s are present in some species.
*The cell is surrounded by a [[pellicle (biology)|pellicle]] of three membrane layers (the alveolar structure) penetrated by micropores.

Replication:
*[[Mitosis]] is usually closed, with an intranuclear spindle; in some species, it is open at the poles.
*Cell division is usually by [[schizogony]].
*[[Meiosis]] occurs in the [[zygote]].

Mobility:

Apicomplexans have a unique gliding capability which enables them to cross through tissues and enter and leave their host cells. This gliding ability is made possible by the use of adhesions and small static myosin motors.

Other features common to this phylum are a lack of cilia, sexual reproduction, use of micropores for feeding, and the production of oocysts containing sporozoites as the infective form.

Most apicomplexans have an [[apicoplast]], (a nonphotosynthetic plastid) and [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]]  and [[nuclear genome]]s, although ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' species and [[gregarines]] are possible exceptions, as they are thought to have lost their plastids after the diverging [[last common ancestor]] of apicomplexans.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==General features of the subgroups==
[[File:Parasite140105-fig3 Toxoplasmosis in a bar-shouldered dove - TEM of 2 tachyzoites.tif|thumb|Two tachyzoites of ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', transmission electron microscopy]]

Within this phylum are three groups — coccidians, gregarines, and haemosporidians. The coccidians and gregarines appear to be relatively closely related.

''Perkinsus '', while once considered a member of the Apicomplexa, has been moved to a new phylum —[[Perkinsozoa]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Norén|first1=Fredrik|last2=Moestrup|first2=Øjvind|last3=Rehnstam-Holm|first3=Ann-Sofi|title=Parvilucifera infectans norén et moestrup gen. et sp. nov.

===Gregarines===
The gregarines are generally parasites of [[annelid]]s, [[arthropod]]s, and mollusks. They are often found in the [[Gut (anatomy)|gut]]s of their hosts, but may invade the other tissues. In the typical gregarine lifecycle, a [[trophozoite]] develops within a host cell into a schizont. This then divides into a number of [[merozoite]]s by [[schizogony]]. The [[merozoite]]s are released by lysing the host cell, which in turn invade other cells. At some point in the apicomplexan lifecycle, [[gametocytes]] are formed. These are released by lysis of the host cells, which group together. Each gametocyte forms multiple [[gamete]]s. The gametes fuse with another to form [[oocyst]]s. The oocysts leave the host to be taken up by a new host.

===Coccidians===
In general, coccidians are parasites of [[vertebrate]]s. Like gregarines, they are commonly parasites of the [[epithelial]] cells of the gut, but may infect other tissues.

The coccidian lifecycle involves merogony, gametogony, and sporogony. While similar to that of the gregarines it differs in [[zygote]] formation. Some trophozoites enlarge and become [[macrogamete]], whereas others divide repeatedly to form [[microgamete]]s (anisogamy). The microgametes are motile and must reach the macrogamete to fertilize it. The fertilized macrogamete forms a zygote that in its turn forms an oocyst that is normally released from the body. Syzygy, when it occurs, involves markedly anisogamous gametes. The lifecycle is typically haploid, with the only diploid stage occurring in the zygote, which is normally short-lived.

The main difference between the coccidians and the gregarines is in the gamonts. In the coccida these are small, intracellular and without [[epimerite]]s or [[mucron]]s. In the gregarines, these are large, extracellular, and possess epimerites or mucrons. A second difference between the coccidia and the gregarines also lies in the gamonts. In the coccidian, a single gamont becomes a macrogametocyte, whereas in the gregarines, the gamonts give rise to multiple gametocytes.

===Haemosporidia===
The Haemosporidia have more complex lifecycles that alternate between an arthropod and a vertebrate host. The trophozoite parasitises [[erythrocyte]]s or other tissues in the vertebrate host. Microgametes and macrogametes are always found in the blood. The gametes are taken up by the insect vector during a blood meal. The microgametes migrate within the gut of the insect vector and fuse with the macrogametes. The fertilized macrogamete now becomes an [[ookinete]], which penetrates the body of the vector. The ookinete then transforms into an oocyst and divides initially by meiosis and then by mitosis (haplontic lifecycle) to give rise to the [[sporozoite]]s. The sporozoites escape from the oocyst and migrate within the body of the vector to the salivary glands where they are injected into the new vertebrate host when the insect vector feeds again.

[[File:Parasite140105-fig3 Toxoplasmosis in a bar-shouldered dove - TEM of 2 tachyzoites.tif|thumb|Two tachyzoites of ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', transmission electron microscopy]]

Most members have a complex lifecycle, involving both asexual and sexual reproduction.  Typically, a host is infected via an active invasion by the parasites (similar to [[entosis]]), which divide to produce [[sporozoite]]s that enter its cells.  Eventually, the cells burst, releasing [[merozoites]], which infect new cells.  This may occur several times, until gamonts are produced, forming gametes that fuse to create new cysts.  Many variations occur on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.

The apical complex includes [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s called [[rhoptries]] and [[microneme]]s, which open at the anterior of the cell.  These secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells.  The tip is surrounded by a band of [[microtubule]]s, called the polar ring, and among the Conoidasida is also a funnel of tubulin proteins called the conoid.<ref name=coccidiaworld>{{cite web |url=http://biology.unm.edu/biology/coccidia/home.html|title=The Coccidia of the World| last = Duszynski1| first = Donald W. | first2 = Steve J. |last2=Upton |first3=Lee |last3=Couch| publisher = Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, and Division of Biology, Kansas State University| date = 2004-02-21| format = Online database }}</ref>   Over the rest of the cell, except for a diminished mouth called the micropore, the membrane is supported by vesicles called alveoli, forming a semirigid pellicle.

The presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the [[alveolate]]s. Several related flagellates, such as ''[[Perkinsus marinus|Perkinsus]]'' and ''[[Colpodella]]'', have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here, but most appear to be closer relatives of the [[dinoflagellate]]s.  They are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups.

Another similarity is that many apicomplexan cells contain a single [[plastid]], called the [[apicoplast]], surrounded by either three or four membranes.  Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and heme biosynthesis, and it appears to be necessary for survival.  In general, plastids are considered to have a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates, and evidence points to an origin from [[red algae]] rather than [[green alga|green]].<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1481 | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | pages = 1481–1493 | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Patrick J.

==Parasitology and genomics==

Many of the apicomplexan parasites are important pathogens of human and domestic animals. In contrast to [[bacteria]]l pathogens, these apicomplexan parasites are [[eukaryotes|eukaryotic]] and share many metabolic pathways with their animal hosts. This makes therapeutic target development extremely difficult – a drug that harms an apicomplexan parasite is also likely to harm its human host. At present, no effective [[vaccine]]s are available for most diseases caused by these parasites. Biomedical research on these parasites is challenging because it is often difficult, if not impossible, to maintain live parasite cultures in the laboratory and to genetically manipulate these organisms. In recent years, several of the apicomplexan species have been selected for [[genome sequencing]]. The availability of genome sequences provides a new opportunity for scientists to learn more about the [[evolution]] and biochemical capacity of these parasites. The predominant source of this genomic information is the [[EuPathDB]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://eupathdb.org |title=EuPathDB |work= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref> family of websites, which currently provides specialised services for ''[[Plasmodium]]'' species ([[PlasmoDB]]),<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bahl | first1 = A. | last2 = Brunk | first2 = B. | last3 = Crabtree | first3 = J. | last4 = Fraunholz | first4 = M.

=== Blood-borne genera ===

{{Cleanup-rewrite|2=section|date=February 2015}}
Within the Apicomplexa are three suborders of parasites: 
* suborder [[Adeleorina]] — eight genera
* suborder [[Haemosporina]] — all genera in this suborder
* suborder [[Eimeriorina]] — two genera (''[[Lankesterella]]'' and ''[[Schellackia]]'')

Within the Adelorina are species that infect [[invertebrate]]s and others that infect [[vertebrate]]s. The Eimeriorina — the largest suborder in this phylum — the lifecycle involves both sexual and asexual stages. The asexual stages reproduce by schizogony. The male gametocyte produces a large number of gametes and the zygote gives rise to an oocyst, which is the infective stage. The majority are monoxenous (infect one host only), but a few are heteroxenous (lifecycle involves two or more hosts).

The number of families in this later suborder is debated, with the number of families being between one and 20 depending on the authority and the number of genera being between 19 and 25.

== Evolution ==

All members of this phylum are parasitic and evolved from a free-living ancestor. This lifestyle is presumed to have evolved at the time of the divergence of dinoﬂagellates and apicomplexans.<ref name=Kuvardina2002>{{cite journal |author=Kuvardina ON, Leander BS, Aleshin VV, Myl'nikov AP, Keeling PJ, Simdyanov TG |title=The phylogeny of colpodellids (Alveolata) using small subunit rRNA gene sequences suggests they are the free-living sister group to apicomplexans |journal=J.

Many Coccidiomorpha have an [[intermediate host]], as well as a primary host, and the evolution of hosts proceeded in different ways and at different times in these groups. For some coccidiomorphs, the original host has become the intermediate host, whereas in others it has become the definitive host. In the genera ''[[Aggregata]]'', ''[[Atoxoplasma]]'', ''[[Cystoisospora]]'', ''[[Schellackia]]'', and ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', the original is now definitive, whereas in ''[[Akiba (protozoa)|Akiba]]'', ''[[Babesiosoma]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', ''[[Haemogregarina]]'', ''[[Haemoproteus]]'', ''[[Hepatozoon]]'', ''[[Karyolysus]]'', ''[[Leucocytozoon]]'', ''[[Plasmodium]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', and ''[[Theileria]]'', the original hosts are now intermediate.

Similar strategies to increase the likelihood of transmission have evolved in multiple genera. Polyenergid [[oocyst]]s and tissue cysts are found in representatives of the orders [[Protococcidiorida]] and [[Eimeriida]]. [[Hypnozoite]]s are found in ''[[Karyolysus lacerate]]'' and most species of ''[[Plasmodium]]''; transovarial transmission of parasites occurs in lifecycles of ''[[Karyolysus]]'' and ''[[Babesia]]''.

Horizontal gene transfer appears to have occurred early on in this phylum's evolution with the transfer of a histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) [[Histone#Chromatin regulation|modifier]], Set8, from an animal host to the ancestor of apicomplexans.<ref name=Kishore2013>{{cite journal |author=Kishore SP, Stiller JW, Deitsch KW |title=Horizontal gene transfer of epigenetic machinery and evolution of parasitism in the malaria parasite ''Plasmodium falciparum'' and other apicomplexans |journal=BMC Evol.

==Taxonomy==
{{further|wikispecies:Apicomplexa}}

===History===
The first Apicomplexa protozoan was seen by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], who in 1674 saw [[oocyst]]s of ''[[Eimeria stiedae]]'' in the [[gall bladder]] of a [[rabbit]]. The first member of the [[phylum]] to be named (by Dufour in 1828) was ''[[Gregarina ovata]]'' in [[earwig]]s. Since then, many more have been identified and named. During 1826–1850, 41 species and six genera of Apicomplexa were named. In 1951–1975, 1873 new species and 83 new genera were added.

The older taxon Sporozoa was created by [[Rudolf Leuckart|Leuckart]] in 1879<ref>Leuckart, R. (1879). ''Die menschlichen Parasiten''. 2nd ed. Vol. 1.</ref> and adopted by [[Otto Bütschli|Bütschli]] in 1880.<ref>Bütschli, O. (1880-82). ''Dr. H.G. Bronn's Klassen und Ordnungen des Thier-Reichs''. Erster Band: Protozoa. Abt. I, Sarkodina und Sporozoa, [https://archive.org/details/drhgbronnsklasse0101bron].</ref> Through history, it grouped with the current Apicomplexa many unrelated groups. For example, [[Kudo system|Kudo (1954)]] included in the Sporozoa species of the [[Ascetosporea]] ([[Rhizaria]]), [[Microsporidia]] ([[Fungi]]), [[Myxozoa]] ([[Animalia]]) and ''[[Helicosporidium]]'' ([[Chlorophyta]]), while Zierdt (1978) included the genus ''[[Blastocystis]]'' ([[Stramenopiles]]).<ref>Perez-Cordon, G. et al.

More recently, other groups were excluded from Apicomplexa, e.g., ''[[Perkinsus]]'' and ''[[Colpodella]]'' (now in Protalveolata).

The field of classifying Apicomplexa is in flux and classification has changed throughout the years since it was formally named in 1970.<ref name="Levine1970" />

By 1987, a comprehensive survey of the phylum was completed: in all, 4516 species and 339 genera had been named. They consisted of:{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* Subclass [[Gregarinasida]] with 1624 named species and 231 named genera
* Family [[Haemogregarinidae]] with 399 species and four genera
* Order [[Eimeriorida]] with 1771 species and 43 genera
* Order [[Haemosporasina]] with 444 species and nine genera
* Order [[Piroplasmorida]] with 173 species and 20 genera
* Others (105 species and 32 genera)

Although considerable revision of this phylum has been done (the order Haemosporidia now has 17 genera rather than 9),  these numbers seems likely to be still approximately correct.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Jacques Euzéby (1988)===
[[Jacques Euzéby]] in 1988<ref name="Euzéby1988">{{cite book |last=Euzéby |first=J. |title=Apicomplexa, 2: Hémosporidioses, Fascicule 1: Plasmodiidés, Haemoproteidés "Piroplasmes" (caractères généraux) |publisher=Fondation Marcel Merieux |series=Protozoologie Médicale Comparée |year=1988 |isbn=2901773737 |volume=3 |oclc=463445910}}</ref> created a new class [[Haemosporidiasina]] by merging subclass [[Piroplasmasina]] and suborder [[Haemospororina]].
*Subclass [[Gregarinasina]] (the gregarines)
*Subclass [[Coccidiasina]]
** Suborder [[Adeleorina]] (the adeleorins)
** Suborder [[Eimeriorina]] (the eimeriorins)
*Subclass [[Haemosporidiasina]]
** Order [[Achromatorida]]
** Order [[Chromatorida]]

The division into Achromatorida and Chromatorida, although proposed on morphological grounds, may have a biological basis, as the ability to store [[haemozoin]] appears to have evolved only once.<ref name=Martinsen2008>{{cite journal |author=Martinsen ES, Perkins SL, Schall JJ |title=A three-genome phylogeny of malaria parasites (Plasmodium and closely related genera): evolution of life-history traits and host switches |journal=Mol.

===Roberts and Janovy (1996)===
Roberts and Janovy in 1996 divided the phylum into the following subclasses and suborders (omitting classes and orders):<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=L. |last2=Janovy |first2=J. |title=Foundations of Parasitology |publisher=Wm. C. Brown |location=Dubuque IA |year=1996 |isbn=0697260712 |oclc=33439613 |edition=5th }}</ref>
*Subclass [[Gregarinasina]] (the gregarines)
*Subclass [[Coccidiasina]]
** Suborder [[Adeleorina]] (the adeleorins)
** Suborder [[Eimeriorina]] (the eimeriorins)
** Suborder [[Haemospororina]] (the haemospororins)
*Subclass [[Piroplasmasina]] (the piroplasms)
These form the following five taxonomic groups:
# The gregarines are, in general, one-host parasites of invertebrates.
# The adeleorins are one-host parasites of invertebrates or vertebrates, or two-host parasites that alternately infect haematophagous (blood-feeding) invertebrates and the blood of vertebrates.
# The eimeriorins are a diverse group that includes one host species of invertebrates, two-host species of invertebrates, one-host species of vertebrates and two-host species of vertebrates. The eimeriorins are frequently called the coccidia. This term is often used to include the adeleorins.
# Haemospororins, often known as the malaria parasites, are two-host Apicomplexa that parasitize blood-feeding [[dipteran]] flies and the blood of various tetrapod vertebrates.
# Piroplasms where all the species included are two-host parasites infecting ticks and vertebrates.

===Perkins (2000)===
This scheme is taken from Perkins et al.<ref name=Perkins2000>{{cite book |author=Perkins FO, Barta JR, Clopton RE, Peirce MA, Upton SJ  |chapter=Phylum Apicomplexa |editor=Lee JJ, Leedale GF, Bradbury P |title=An Illustrated guide to the Protozoa : organisms traditionally referred to as protozoa, or newly discovered groups |publisher=Society of Protozoologists |edition=2nd |year=2000 |oclc=704052757 |isbn=1891276220  |pages=190–369 |volume=1}}</ref> It is outdated as the [[Perkinsidae]] have since been recognised as a sister group to the dinoflagellates rather that the Apicomplexia. The remainder of the scheme appears to be valid:  
*Class [[Aconoidasida]]
*:''Conoid present only in the [[ookinete]] of some species''
::*Order [[Haemospororida]]
:::''Macrogamete and microgamete develop separately. Syzygy does not occur. Ookinete has a conoid. Sporozoites have three walls. Heteroxenous: alternates between vertebrate host (in which merogony occurs) and invertebrate host (in which sporogony occurs). Usually blood parasites, transmitted by blood-sucking insects.''
::*Order [[Piroplasmorida]]
*Class [[Conoidasida]]
**Subclass [[Gregarinasina]]
***Order [[Archigregarinorida]]
***Order [[Eugregarinorida]]
****Suborder [[Adeleorina]]
****Suborder [[Eimeriorina]]
***Order [[Neogregarinorida]]
**Subclass [[Coccidiasina]]
***Order [[Agamococcidiorida]]
***Order [[Eucoccidiorida]]
***Order [[Ixorheorida]]
***Order [[Protococcidiorida]]
*Class [[Perkinsasida]]
::*Order [[Perkinsorida]]
:::*Family [[Perkinsidae]]

The name [[Protospiromonadida]] has been proposed for the common ancestor of the Gregarinomorpha and Coccidiomorpha.<ref name=Krylov1992>{{cite journal |author=Krylov MV |title=[The origin of heteroxeny in Sporozoa] |language=Russian |journal=Parazitologia |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=361–8 |year=1992 |pmid=1297964 }}</ref>
