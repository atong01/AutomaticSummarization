The conclusions of many trials and numerous [[systematic review]]s of acupuncture are largely inconsistent.<ref name=Ernst2009/> An overview of [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane reviews]] found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions, and they suggest it may be effective for only chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting, postoperative nausea/vomiting, and idiopathic headache.<ref name=Ernst2009/> An overview of high-quality Cochrane reviews suggests that acupuncture may alleviate certain kinds of pain.<ref name=Lee2011/> A systematic review of systematic reviews found that for reducing pain, real acupuncture was no better than sham acupuncture and concluded that there is little evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for reducing pain.{{refn |group=n |name= Madsen2009 |Placebo or sham acupuncture is a form of acupuncture that uses non-penetrating needles or needling at non-acupuncture points.<ref>{{harvnb|Madsen|2009|page=a3115}}</ref>}}<ref name="Ernst 2011"/> The evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits.<ref name=Wang-2008/> Some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to [[placebo]].<ref name=Ernst2006/> A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias.<ref name=Madsen2009/>

In traditional acupuncture, the acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition used. In TCM, the four diagnostic methods are: inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation. Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.<ref name=Cheng1987/> Auscultation and olfaction involves listening for particular sounds (such as wheezing) and attending to body odor.<ref name=Cheng1987/> Inquiring involves focusing on the "seven inquiries": chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and [[menses]] and [[leukorrhea]].<ref name=Cheng1987/> Palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender ''"A-shi"'' points and feeling the left and right radial pulses.<ref name=Cheng1987>[[#Cheng1987|Cheng]], 1987, chapter 12.</ref>

=== Needles ===
[[File:Acupuncture Needles.jpg|thumb|right|Acupuncture needles]]
[[File:Japanese kudabari.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional and modern Japanese guiding tube needles]]
The most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture).<ref name=Berman2010/> Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel, making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking.<ref name=Hicks2005/> Needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination.<ref name=Hicks2005/> Reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications.<ref name=Hicks2005>{{cite book |author=Angela Hicks |edition=1 |pages=41 |title=The Acupuncture Handbook: How Acupuncture Works and How It Can Help You |publisher=[[Piatkus Books]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0749924720}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Collinge, William J. |title=The American Holistic Health Association Complete guide to alternative medicine |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=0-446-67258-0 |oclc=}}</ref> Needles vary in length between {{convert|13|to|130|mm|in}}, with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer needles in areas with thicker tissues; needle diameters vary from 0{{convert|.16|mm|3|abbr=on}} to 0{{convert|.46|mm|3|abbr=on}},<ref name=Aung116>[[#Aung2007|Aung & Chen]], 2007, p.

Apart from the usual filiform needle, other needle types include three-edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles.<ref name=Aung116/> Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a 17th-century invention adopted in China and the West). Korean acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand.<ref name=Dummies>{{cite book | pages=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=b6_1FOwC_GYC&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q&f=false 126–128] | title=Complementary Medicine For Dummies | last=Young | first=J | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | year=2007 | isbn=0470519681}}</ref>

=== Needling technique ===

==== Insertion ====

The skin is sterilized and needles are inserted, frequently with a plastic guide tube. Needles may be manipulated in various ways, including spinning, flicking, or moving up and down relative to the skin. Since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin, a quick insertion of the needle is recommended.<ref name=Aung2007>[[#Aung2007|Aung & Chen]], 2007, p. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&pg=PA113#v=onepage&q&f=false 113–114].</ref> Often the needles are stimulated by hand in order to cause a dull, localized, aching sensation that is called ''de qi'', as well as "needle grasp," a tugging feeling felt by the acupuncturist and generated by a mechanical interaction between the needle and skin.<ref name=Berman2010/> Acupuncture can be painful.<ref>{{cite journal | first1=B. Y. | last2=Cobbin | first2=D. M. | title=Investigating the effects of three needling parameters (manipulation, retention time, and insertion site) on needling sensation and pain profiles: A study of eight deep needling interventions | journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume=2013 | page=136763 | year=2013 | author1=Loyeung | doi=10.1155/2013/136763 | pmc=3789497 | pmid=24159337}}</ref> The skill level of the acupuncturist may influence how painful the needle insertion is, and a sufficiently skilled practitioner may be able to insert the needles without causing any pain.<ref name=Aung2007/>

==== ''De-qi'' sensation ====

''De-qi'' ({{zh|s=得气|p=dé qì}}; "arrival of qi") refers to a sensation of [[paresthesia|numbness]], distension, or electrical tingling at the needling site which might radiate along the corresponding [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridian]]. If ''de-qi'' can not be generated, then inaccurate location of the [[acupoint]], improper depth of needle insertion, inadequate manual manipulation, or a very weak constitution of the patient can be considered, all of which are thought to decrease the likelihood of successful treatment. If the ''de-qi'' sensation does not immediately occur upon needle insertion, various manual manipulation techniques can be applied to promote it (such as "plucking", "shaking" or "trembling").<ref name="AungChen2007">{{cite book|author1=Steven Aung|author2=William Chen|title=Clinical Introduction to Medical Acupuncture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC|accessdate=20 September 2012|date=10 January 2007|publisher=Thieme|isbn=9781588902214|page=116}}</ref>

Once ''de-qi'' is achieved, further techniques might be utilized which aim to "influence" the ''de-qi''; for example, by certain manipulation the ''de-qi'' sensation allegedly can be conducted from the needling site towards more distant sites of the body.<!---is this threading?---> Other techniques aim at "tonifying" ({{zh|s=补|p=bǔ}}) or "sedating" ({{zh|s=泄|p=xiè}}) ''qi''.<ref name="AungChen2007"/> The former techniques are used in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Basic principles of pattern discrimination|deficiency]] patterns, the latter in excess patterns.<ref name="AungChen2007"/> ''De qi'' is more important in Chinese acupuncture, while Western and Japanese patients may not consider it a necessary part of the treatment.<ref name=Dummies/>

=== Moxibustion and cupping ===

A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews (internationally and without language restrictions) found that serious complications following acupuncture continue to be reported.<ref name="Ernst 2011"/> Between 2000 and 2009, ninety-five cases of [[serious adverse event]]s, including five [[deaths]], were reported.<ref name="Ernst 2011"/> Many such events are not inherent to acupuncture but are due to [[Medical malpractice|malpractice]] of acupuncturists.<ref name="Ernst 2011"/> This might be why such complications have not been reported in surveys of adequately-trained acupuncturists.<ref name="Ernst 2011"/> Most such reports are from Asia, which may reflect the large number of treatments performed there or it might be because there are a relatively higher number of poorly trained Asian acupuncturists.<ref name="Ernst 2011"/> Many serious adverse events were reported from developed countries.<ref name="Ernst 2011"/> This included Australia, Austria, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.<ref name="Ernst 2011"/> The number of adverse effects reported from the UK appears particularly unusual, which may indicate less under-reporting in the UK than other countries.<ref name="Ernst 2011"/> Reports included 38 cases of infections and 42 cases of organ trauma.<ref name="Ernst 2011"/> The most frequent adverse events included [[pneumothorax]], and [[bacterial infection|bacterial]] and [[viral infection]]s.<ref name="Ernst 2011"/>

==== Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese-language ====

A 2010 systematic review of the Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related adverse events including pneumothorax, fainting, [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, most of which were due to improper technique.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 adverse events.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Prospective surveys show that mild, transient acupuncture-associated adverse events ranged from 6.71% to 15%.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly 0.024%.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidences]] among 229,230 patients.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Infections, mainly [[hepatitis]], after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), chylothorax, injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction, local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.<ref name=Zhang-2010/>

==== Children and pregnancy ====

When used on children, acupuncture is safe when administered by well-trained, licensed practitioners using sterile needles; however, a 2011 review found there was limited research to draw definite conclusions about the overall safety of pediatric acupuncture.<ref name="Adams 2011"/> The same review found 279 adverse events, of which 25 were serious.<ref name="Adams 2011"/> The adverse events were mostly mild in nature (e.g. bruising or bleeding).<ref name="Adams 2011"/> The prevalence of mild adverse events ranged from 10.1% to 13.5%, an estimated 168 incidences among 1,422 patients.<ref name="Adams 2011"/> On rare occasions adverse events were serious (e.g. [[cardiac rupture]] or [[hemoptysis]]); many might have been a result of substandard practice.<ref name="Adams 2011">{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=D|last2=Cheng|first2=F|last3=Jou|first3=H|last4=Aung|first4=S|last5=Yasui|first5=Y|last6=Vohra|first6=S|title=The safety of pediatric acupuncture: a systematic review|journal=Pediatrics|date=Dec 2011|volume=128|issue=6|pages=e1575–e1587|pmid=22106073|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1091}}</ref> The incidence of serious adverse events was 5 per one million, which included children and adults.<ref name="Adams 2011"/> When used during pregnancy, the majority of adverse events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient, with few serious adverse events.<ref name=Park-2014/> The most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain, followed by bleeding.<ref name=Park-2014/> Although two deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death) were reported, there was a lack of acupuncture associated maternal mortality.<ref name=Park-2014/> Limiting the evidence as certain, probable or possible in the causality evaluation, the estimated incidence of adverse events following acupuncture in pregnant women was 131 per 10,000.<ref name=Park-2014>{{cite journal |author=Park J1, Sohn Y, White AR, Lee H |title=The safety of acupuncture during pregnancy: a systematic review |journal=Acupunct Med |date=February 2014 |pmid=24554789 |doi=10.1136/acupmed-2013-010480 |type=Systematic review |volume=32 |issue=3 |pmc=4112450 |pages=257–266}}</ref> Although acupuncture is not contraindicated in pregnant women, some specific acupuncture points are particularly sensitive to needle insertion; these spots, as well as the [[abdomen|abdominal region]], should be avoided during pregnancy.<ref name=Berman2010/>

Acupuncture may have been practiced during the [[Neolithic]] era, near the end of the [[stone age]], using sharpened stones called [[Bian Stones|Bian shi]].<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|70}} Many Chinese texts from later eras refer to sharp stones called "plen", which means "stone probe", that may have been used for acupuncture purposes.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|70}} The ancient Chinese medical text, Huangdi Neijing, indicates that sharp stones were believed at-the-time to cure illnesses at or near the body's surface, perhaps because of the short depth a stone could penetrate.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|71}} However, it is more likely that stones were used for other medical purposes, such as puncturing a growth to drain its [[pus]].<ref name=White-Ernst/><ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/> The ''[[Mawangdui]]'' texts, which are believed to be from the 2nd century BC, mention the use of pointed stones to open [[abscess]]es, and moxibustion, but not for acupuncture.<ref name="Prioreschi2004"/> It is also speculated that these stones may have been used for bloodletting, due to the ancient Chinese belief that illnesses were caused by demons within the body that could be killed or released.<ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42">{{cite book | last=Singh | first=S. | last2=Ernst | first2=E. | title=Trick Or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine | publisher=W.

====Belief systems====
Several different and sometimes conflicting belief systems emerged regarding acupuncture. This may have been the result of competing schools of thought.<ref name=White-Ernst/> Some ancient texts referred to using acupuncture to cause bleeding, while others mixed the ideas of blood-letting and spiritual ch'i energy. Over time, the focus shifted from blood to the concept of puncturing specific points on the body, and eventually to balancing Yin and Yang energies as well.<ref name="Prioreschi2004"/> According to Dr. David Ramey, no single "method or theory" was ever predominantly adopted as the standard.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Inaccurate acupuncture history|first=D.W. |last=Ramey|journal=Rheumatology|volume=43|issue=12|page=1593|doi=10.1093/rheumatology/keh363}}</ref> At the time, scientific knowledge of medicine was not yet developed, especially because in China dissection of the deceased was forbidden, preventing the development of basic anatomical knowledge.<ref name=White-Ernst/>

It is not certain when specific acupuncture points were introduced, but the autobiography of Pien Chhio from around 400–500&nbsp;BC references inserting needles at designated areas.<ref name="abc"/> [[Bian Que]] believed there was a single acupuncture point at the top of one's skull that he called the point "of the hundred meetings."<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|83}} Texts dated to be from 156–186&nbsp;BC document early beliefs in channels of life force energy called meridians that would later be an element in early acupuncture beliefs.<ref name=Ramey/>

Ramey and Buell said the "practice and theoretical underpinnings" of modern acupuncture were introduced in the ''The Yellow Emperor's Classic'' (Huangdi Neijing) around 100&nbsp;BC.<ref name=Prioreschi2004>{{cite book | last = Prioreschi | first = P | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=MJUMhEYGOKsC&pg=PA147 147–148] | year = 2004 | isbn = 1888456019 | publisher = Horatius Press | title = A history of Medicine, Volume 2 }}</ref><ref name=Ramey/> It introduced the concept of using acupuncture to manipulate the flow of life energy (''qi'') in a network of meridian (channels) in the body.<ref name=Ramey/><ref name="Epler">{{cite journal | last1 = Epler Jr | first1 = D.

Some of the sites acupuncturists use needles at today still have the same names as those given to them by the ''Yellow Emporer's Classic''.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|93}} Numerous additional documents were published over the centuries introducing new acupoints.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|101}} By the 4th century AD, most of the acupuncture sites in use today had been named and identified.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|101}}

===Early development in China===

====Establishment and growth====
In the first half of the 1st century AD, acupuncturists began promoting the belief that acupuncture's effectiveness was influenced by the time of day or night, the lunar cycle, and the season.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|140-141}} The Science of the Yin-Yang Cycles (''Yün Chhi Hsüeh'') was a set of beliefs that curing diseases relied on the alignment of both heavenly (thien) and earthly (ti) forces that were attuned to cycles like that of the sun and moon.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|140-141}} There were several different belief systems that relied on a number of celestial and earthly bodies or elements that rotated and only became aligned at certain times.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|140-141}} According to Needham and Gwei-djen, these "arbitrary predictions" were depicted by acupuncturists in complex charts and through a set of special terminology.<ref name="abc"/>

Acupuncture needles during this period were much thicker than most modern ones and often resulted in infection. Infection is caused by a lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle, or needling in the wrong place, or at the wrong time.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|102-103}} Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a [[cauterizing]] effect at the injection site.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|104}} Nine needles were recommended in the ''Chen Chiu Ta Chheng'' from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|102-103}}

Other belief systems were based on the idea that the human body operated on a rhythm and acupuncture had to be applied at the right point in the rhythm to be effective.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|140-141}} In some cases a lack of balance between Yin and Yang were believed to be the cause of disease.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|140-141}}

In the 1st century AD, many of the first books about acupuncture were published and recognized acupuncturist experts began to emerge. The ''Zhen Jiu Jia Yi Jing'', which was published in the mid-3rd century, became the oldest acupuncture book that is still in existence in the modern era.<ref name="abc"/> Other books like the ''Yu Kuei Chen Ching'', written by the Director of Medical Services for China, were also influential during this period, but were not preserved.<ref name="abc"/> In the mid 7th century, [[Sun Simiao]] published acupuncture-related diagrams and charts that established standardized methods for finding acupuncture sites on people of different sizes and categorized acupuncture sites in a set of modules.<ref name="abc"/>

Acupuncture became more established in China as improvements in paper led to the publication of more acupuncture books. The Imperial Medical Service and the Imperial Medical College, which both supported acupuncture, became more established and created medical colleges in every province.<ref name="abc"/>{{rp|129}} The public was also exposed to stories about royal figures being cured of their diseases by prominent acupuncturists.<ref name="abc"/>{{rp|129–135}} By time ''The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion'' was published during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644&nbsp;AD), most of the acupuncture practices used in the modern era had been established.<ref name=White-Ernst/>

Korea is believed to be the first country in Asia that acupuncture spread to outside of China.<ref name="abc"/> Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by emperor [[Dangun]], though it is more likely to have been brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture in 514&nbsp;AD.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|262-263}} Acupuncture use was commonplace in Korea by the 6th century.

Acupuncture began to spread to Europe in the second half of the 17th century. Around this time the surgeon-general of the [[Dutch East India Company]] met Japanese and Chinese acupuncture practitioners and later encouraged Europeans to further investigate it.<ref name="abc"/>{{RP|264-265}} He published the first in-depth description of acupuncture for the European audience and created the term "acupuncture" in his 1683 work ''De Acupunctura''.<ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42">{{cite book | last=Singh | first=S. | last2=Ernst | first2=E. | title=Trick Or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine | publisher=W.

By the 19th century, acupuncture had become commonplace in many areas of the world.<ref name=abc/>{{RP|295}} Americans and Britains began showing interest in acupuncture in the early 20th century.<ref name=White-Ernst/> Western practitioners abandoned acupuncture's traditional beliefs in spiritual energy, [[pulse diagnosis]], and the cycles of the moon, sun or the body's rhythm. Diagrams of the flow of spiritual energy, for example, conflicted with the West's own anatomical diagrams. It adopted a new set of ideas for acupuncture based on tapping needles into nerves.<ref name=White-Ernst/><ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/><ref name="Jackson 2011 p. 610"/> In Europe it was speculated that acupuncture may allow or prevent the flow of electricity in the body, as electrical pulses were found to make a frog's leg twitch after death.<ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42"/>

The West eventually created a belief system based on Travell trigger points that were believed to inhibit pain. They were in the same locations as China's spiritually identified acupuncture points, but under a different nomenclature.<ref name=White-Ernst/> The first elaborate Western treatise on acupuncture was published in 1683 by [[Willem ten Rhijne]].<ref name="Barnes 2005 p. 75">{{cite book | last=Barnes | first=L.L. | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&pg=PA75 | accessdate=July 14, 2015 | page=75}}</ref>

==== Modern era ====
[[File:Nixon Mao 1972-02-29.png|thumb|[[Richard Nixon]] meets with [[Mao Zedong]] in Beijing, February 21, 1972.]]
In China, the popularity of acupuncture rebounded in 1949 when [[Mao Zedong]] took power and sought to unite China behind traditional cultural values. It was also during this time that many Eastern medical practices were consolidated under the name [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] (TCM).<ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/>

New practices were adopted in the 20th century, such as using a cluster of needles,<ref name=abc/>{{RP|164}} electrified needles, or leaving needles inserted for up to a week.<ref name=abc/>{{RP|164}} A lot of emphasis developed on using acupuncture on the ear.<ref name=abc/>{{RP|164}} Acupuncture research organizations were founded in the 1950s and acupuncture services became available in modern hospitals.<ref name=White-Ernst/> China, where acupuncture was believed to have originated, was increasingly influenced by Western medicine.<ref name=White-Ernst/> Meanwhile, acupuncture grew in popularity in the US. The US Congress created the Office of Alternative Medicine in 1992 and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) declared support for acupuncture for some conditions in November 1997. In 1999, the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] was created within the NIH. Acupuncture became the most popular alternative medicine in the US.<ref name=Wang2008/>

Politicians from the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] said acupuncture was superstitious and conflicted with the party's commitment to science.<ref name=Crozier1968/> Communist Party Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] later reversed this position,<ref name=Crozier1968>{{cite book |author=Crozier RC |title= Traditional medicine in modern China: science, nationalism, and the tensions of cultural change |edition=1 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |location= Cambridge |year=1968 |isbn=978-0674901056 |oclc= }}{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}</ref> arguing that the practice was based on scientific principles.<ref name=Taylor2011>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=K | title=Chinese Medicine in Early Communist China, 1945–63: a Medicine of Revolution | year=2005 | isbn=041534512X | publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |page=109}}</ref>

==Regulation==
{{Main|Regulation of acupuncture}}
There are various government and trade association regulatory bodies for acupuncture in the United Kingdom, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Japan, Canada, and in European countries and elsewhere. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that before being licensed or certified, an acupuncturist receive 200 hours of specialized training if they are a physician and 2,500 hours for non-physicians; many governments have adopted similar standards.<ref name="PybusCairns2004"/>

In China, the practice of acupuncture is regulated by the Chinese Medicine Council that was formed in 1999 by the Legislative Council. It includes a licensing exam and registration, as well as degree courses approved by the board.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong's traditional Chinese medicine laws 'putting public at risk'|date=23 July 2007|first=Mark|last=O'Neill|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/601500/hong-kongs-traditional-chinese-medicine-laws-putting-public-risk|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref> Canada has acupuncture licensing programs in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Quebec; standards set by the Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada are used in provinces without government regulation.<ref name="Ramsay2009">{{cite book|author=Cynthia Ramsay|title=Unnatural Regulation: Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy in Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4Y5oPvK4QVwC&pg=PA43|year=2009|publisher=The Fraser Institute|pages=43|id=GGKEY:0KK0XUSQASK}}</ref> Regulation in the US began in the 1970s<ref name="Bauer2011">{{cite book|author=L.
