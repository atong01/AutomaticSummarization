In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline;<space/><link><target>Joe DiMaggio</target></link><space/>received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement. Contrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for<space/><link><target>Lou Gehrig</target></link>, other than to hold a special one-man election for him. There was no waiting period at that time and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season, but the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was<space/><link><target>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</target><part>terminally ill</part></link>, making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.</paragraph><paragraph>If a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 20 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following the most recent changes to the election process for that body made in 2010, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballotboth long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives).

The Committee members most of whom were Hall members were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer<space/><link><target>Mike Schmidt</target></link><space/>noted, &quot;The same thing happens every year.

The items had been lent to the<space/><link><target>Baseball Commissioner</target></link>'s office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner's office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of Joe Reichler, an assistant to Commissioner<space/><link><target>Bowie Kuhn</target></link>, who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.<extension extension_name='ref' name="James-HoFItemSale"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">James</arg><arg name="first">Bill</arg><arg name="authorlink">Bill James</arg><arg name="title">[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?|The Politics of Glory]]</arg><arg name="publisher">Macmillan Publishing Company</arg><arg name="year">1994</arg><arg name="location">New York</arg><arg name="pages">295–298</arg><arg name="isbn">0-02-510774-7</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Non-induction of banned players</heading><paragraph>Following the banning of<space/><link><target>Pete Rose</target></link><space/>from MLB, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's permanent suspension list, such as Rose or<space/><link><target>Shoeless Joe Jackson</target></link>.
