And that is exactly what we are not going to do... Unfortunately garbage collection has a suboptimal impact on performance. Garbage can build up in your applications and increase the high water mark of your memory usage. And the collector tends to kick in at undeterministic times which can lead to very high CPU usage and stutters in the user experience. And that’s why GC has not been acceptable to us on our mobile platforms. In comparison, manual memory management with retain/release is harder to learn, and quite frankly it's a bit of a pain in the ass. But it produces better and more predictable performance, and that’s why we have chosen it as the basis of our memory management strategy. Because out there in the real world, high performance and stutter-free user experiences are what matters to our users.<space/></arg><arg name="date">2011-06-24<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2015-03-27</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The moment when the garbage is actually collected can be unpredictable, resulting in stalls (pauses to shift/free memory) scattered throughout a session.

As a result, the need for explicit manual resource management (release/close) for non-GCed resources becomes transitive to composition. That is: in a non-deterministic GC system, if a resource or a resource-like object requires manual resource management (release/close), and this object is used as &quot;part of&quot; another object, then the composed object will also become a resource-like object that itself requires manual resource management (release/close).</paragraph><heading level='2'>Tracing garbage collectors</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Tracing garbage collection</arg></template><link><target>Tracing garbage collection</target></link><space/>is the most common type of garbage collection, so much so that &quot;garbage collection&quot; often refers to tracing garbage collection, rather than other methods such as<space/><link><target>reference counting</target></link>. The overall strategy consists of determining which objects should be garbage collected by tracing which objects are<space/><italics>reachable</italics><space/>by a chain of references from certain root objects, and considering the rest as garbage and collecting them. However, there are a large number of algorithms used in implementation, with widely varying complexity and performance characteristics.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Reference counting</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Reference counting</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Reference counting is a form of garbage collection whereby each object has a count of the number of references to it. Garbage is identified by having a reference count of zero. An object's reference count is incremented when a reference to it is created, and decremented when a reference is destroyed. When the count reaches zero, the object's memory is reclaimed.</paragraph><paragraph>As with manual memory management, and unlike tracing garbage collection, reference counting guarantees that objects are destroyed as soon as their last reference is destroyed, and usually only accesses memory which is either in CPU caches, in objects to be freed, or directly pointed by those, and thus tends to not have significant negative side effects on CPU cache and virtual memory operation.</paragraph><paragraph>There are a number of disadvantages to reference counting; this can generally be solved or mitigated by more sophisticated algorithms:</paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Cycles</defkey></listitem></list><list type='ident'><listitem>If two or more objects refer to each other, they can create a cycle whereby neither will be collected as their mutual references never let their reference counts become zero.

Under reference counting, a weak reference is similar to a weak reference under a tracing garbage collector. It is a special reference object whose existence does not increment the reference count of the referent object. Furthermore, a weak reference is safe in that when the referent object becomes garbage, any weak reference to it<space/><italics>lapses</italics>, rather than being permitted to remain dangling, meaning that it turns into a predictable value, such as a null reference.</listitem></list><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Space overhead (reference count)</defkey></listitem></list><list type='ident'><listitem>Reference counting requires space to be allocated for each object to store its reference count. The count may be stored adjacent to the object's memory or in a side table somewhere else, but in either case, every single reference-counted object requires additional storage for its reference count.
