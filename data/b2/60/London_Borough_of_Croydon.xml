The early 19th century building was known initially as &quot;Courthouse&quot; as, like its predecessor and successor, the local court met there. The building stood on the western side of the High Street near to the junction with Surrey Street, the location of the town's market. The building became inadequate for the growing local administrative responsibilities and stood at a narrow point of a HIgh Street in need of widening.</paragraph><paragraph>The present town hall was designed by local architect Charles Henman<extension extension_name='ref' name="Croydon Town Hall"></extension><space/>and was officially opened by the Prince and<space/><link><target>Queen Alexandra</target><part>Princess of Wales</part></link><space/>on 19 May 1896.

It also housed the court and most central council employees.</paragraph><paragraph>The Borough's incorporation in 1883 and a desire to improve central Croydon with improvements to traffic flows and the removal of social deprivation in Middle Row prompted the move to a new configuration of town hall provision. The second closure of the Central Railway Station provided the Corporation with the opportunity to buy the station land from the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company for 11,500 to provide the site for the new town hall. Indeed, the council hoped to be able to sell on some of the land purchased with enough for municipal needs and still &quot;leave a considerable margin of land which might be disposed of&quot;. The purchase of the failed railway station came despite local leaders having successfully urged the re-opening of the poorly patronised railway station. The railway station re-opening had failed to be a success so freeing up the land for alternative use.</paragraph><paragraph>Parts, including the former court rooms, have been converted into the<space/><link><target>Museum of Croydon</target></link><space/>and exhibition galleries.

The Braithwaite Hall is used for events and performances. The town hall was renovated in the mid-1990s and the imposing central staircase, long closed to the public and kept for councillors only, was re-opened in 1994. The civic complex, meanwhile, was substantially added to, with buildings across Mint Walk and the 19-floor Taberner House to house the rapidly expanding corporation's employees.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:CroydonTabHouse.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>upright</part><part>Croydon Council's offices were in<space/><link><target>Taberner House</target></link><space/>until September 2013</part></link><link><target>Ruskin House</target></link><space/>is the headquarters of Croydon's<space/><link><target>Labour Party (UK)</target><part>Labour</part></link>, Trade Union and<space/><link><target>Co-operative Party</target><part>Co-operative</part></link><space/>movements and is itself a co-operative with shareholders from organisations across the three movements. In the 19th century, Croydon was a bustling commercial centre of London. It was said that, at the turn of the 20th century, approximately 10,000 was spent in Croydon's taverns and inns every week. For the early labour movement, then, it was natural to meet in the town's public houses, in this environment. However, the temperance movement was equally strong, and<space/><link><target>Georgina King Lewis</target></link>, a keen member of the<space/><link><target>Croydon United Temperance Council</target></link>, took it upon herself to establish a dry centre for the labour movement.

Although the council had needed extra space since the 1920s, it was only with the imminent creation of the London Borough of Croydon that action was taken. The building, being demolished in 2014, was in classic 1960s style, praised at the time but subsequently much derided.
