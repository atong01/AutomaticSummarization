The word '''neuroleptic''' originates from the Greek word νεῦρον ''neuron'' ("nerve") and λῆψις ''lepsis'' ("seizure" or "fit").<ref>{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc|title=Moby's Medical Dictionary|publisher=Elsevier}}</ref>

First-generation antipsychotics, known as [[typical antipsychotics]], were discovered in the 1950s. Most second-generation drugs, known as [[atypical antipsychotics]], have been developed more recently, although the first atypical antipsychotic, [[clozapine]], was discovered in the 1950s and introduced clinically in the 1970s. Both generations of medication tend to block receptors in the brain's [[dopamine pathway]]s, but atypicals tend to act on [[serotonin]] receptors as well.

Antipsychotics are more effective than placebo in treating symptoms of psychosis, but some people do not respond fully or even partly to treatment. Their use is associated with significant side effects, most notably movement disorders and weight gain.

==Medical uses==
Antipsychotics are most frequently used for the following conditions:
* [[Schizophrenia]]
* [[Schizoaffective disorder]] most commonly in conjunction with either an antidepressant (in the case of the depressive subtype) or a mood stabiliser (in the case of the bipolar subtype). 
* [[Bipolar disorder]] (acute mania and mixed episodes) may be treated with either typical or atypical antipsychotics, although atypical antipsychotics are usually preferred because they tend to have more favourable adverse effect profiles<ref name = "Lancet 09" /> and, according to a recent meta-analysis, they tend to have a lower liability for causing conversion from mania to depression.<ref name="Haldep">{{cite journal | author = Goikolea JM, Colom F, Torres I, Capapey J, Valentí M, Undurraga J, Grande I, Sanchez-Moreno J, Vieta E | title = Lower rate of depressive switch following antimanic treatment with second-generation antipsychotics versus haloperidol | journal = J Affect Disord | volume = 144 | issue = 3 | pages = 191–8 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23089129 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2012.07.038 }}</ref>
* [[Psychotic depression]]. In this indication it is a common practice for the psychiatrist to prescribe a combination of an atypical antipsychotic and an antidepressant as this practice is best supported by the evidence.<ref name = Maudsley>Taylor D, Paton C, Kapur S, Taylor D, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust.

===Schizophrenia===
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}
Antipsychotic drug treatment is a key component of schizophrenia treatment algorithms recommended by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE),<ref name = "NICE">{{cite web |url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG178 |title=Psychosis and schizophrenia in adults (CG178) |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> the American Psychiatric Association,<ref name = "APA">{{cite web |url=http://psychiatryonline.org/guidelines.aspx |title=PsychiatryOnline &#124; Guidelines |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> and the British Society for Psychopharmacology.<ref name = "BAP">{{cite journal | author = Barnes TR | title = Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology | journal = J.

There is mixed evidence to support a significant impact of antipsychotic use on negative symptoms (such as apathy, lack of emotional affect, and lack of interest in social interactions) or on the cognitive symptoms (disordered thinking, reduced ability to plan and execute tasks) of schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miyamoto S, Miyake N, Jarskog LF, Fleischhacker WW, Lieberman JA |title=Pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: a critical review of the pharmacology and clinical effects of current and future therapeutic agents |journal=Mol.

Applications of antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia include prophylaxis in those showing symptoms that suggest that they are at high risk of developing psychosis, treatment of first episode psychosis, maintenance therapy, and treatment of recurrent episodes of acute psychosis.<ref name = BAP />

====Prevention of psychosis and symptom improvement====
Test batteries such as the PACE (Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation Clinic) and COPS (Criteria of Prodromal Syndromes), which measure low level psychotic symptoms, and others focused on cognitive disturbances (Basic symptoms"), are used to evaluate people with early, low level symptoms of psychosis.  Used in combination with family history information, these tests can identify a "high risk" group having a 20–40% risk of progression to frank psychosis within 2 years.<ref name = BAP/> These patients are often treated with low doses of antipsychotic drugs with the goal of reducing their symptoms and preventing progression to frank psychosis.  While generally useful for reducing symptoms, the clinical trials performed to date provide little evidence that early use of antipsychotics, alone or in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapy, provides improved long term outcomes in those with prodromal symptoms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg178/resources/cg178-psychosis-and-schizophrenia-in-adults-full-guideline3 |title=NICE Treatment Guideance 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-07 }}</ref>

====First episode psychosis====
NICE recommends that all persons presenting with a first episode of frank psychosis be treated with both an antipsychotic drug and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).  NICE further recommends that those expressing a preference for CBT alone be informed that combination treatment is more efficacious.<ref name = NICE />  A diagnosis of schizophrenia is not normally made at this time, as up to 25% of those presenting with first episode psychosis are eventually found to suffer from bipolar disorder instead. The goals of treatment of these patients include reducing symptoms and potentially improving long-term treatment outcomes.  Randomized clinical trials have provided strong evidence for the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs in achieving the former goal, with first-generation and second generation antipsychotics showing about equal efficacy.  Evidence that early treatment has a favorable effect on long term outcomes is equivocal.<ref name = NICE /><ref name = BAP />

====Recurrent psychotic episodes====
Placebo-controlled trials of both first and second generation antipsychotic drugs consistently demonstrate the superiority of active drug to placebo in suppressing psychotic symptoms.<ref name = BAP /> A large meta analysis of 38 trials of antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia acute psychotic episodes showed an effect size of about 0.5.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leucht S, Arbter D, Engel RR, Kissling W, Davis JM |title=How effective are second-generation antipsychotic drugs?

Few patients achieve complete resolution of symptoms. Response rates, calculated using various cutoff values for symptom reduction, are low and their interpretation is complicated by high placebo response rates and selective publication of clinical trial results.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Beitinger R, Lin J, Kissling W, Leucht S | title = Comparative remission rates of schizophrenic patients using various remission criteria | journal = Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry | volume = 32 | issue = 7 | pages = 1643–51 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18616969 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.06.008 | url =  }}</ref>

====Maintenance therapy====
The majority of patients treated with an antipsychotic drug will experience a response within 4 weeks.  The goals of continuing treatment are to maintain suppression of symptoms, prevent relapse, improve quality of life, and support engagement in psychosocial therapy.<ref name = BAP />

Maintenance therapy with antipsychotic drugs is clearly superior to placebo in preventing relapse, but is associated with weight gain, movement disorders, and high dropout rates.<ref name="Leucht S, Tardy M, Komossa K, Heres S, Kissling W, Davis JM 2012 CD008016">{{cite journal |author=Leucht S, Tardy M, Komossa K, Heres S, Kissling W, Davis JM |title=Maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=5 |issue= |pages=CD008016 |year=2012 |pmid=22592725 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008016.pub2 |url=}}</ref> A 3-year trial following persons receiving maintenance therapy after an acute psychotic episode found that 33% obtained long-lasting symptom reduction, 13% achieved remission, and only 27% experienced satisfactory quality of life. The effect of relapse prevention on long term outcomes is uncertain, as historical studies show little difference in long term outcomes before and after the introduction of antipsychotic drugs.<ref name = BAP />

A significant challenge in the use of antipsychotic drugs for the prevention of relapse is the poor rate of compliance. In spite of the relatively high rates of adverse effects associated with these drugs, some evidence, including higher dropout rates in placebo arms compared to treatment arms in randomized clinical trials, suggest that most patients who discontinue treatment do so because of suboptimal efficacy.<ref name="Leucht S, Tardy M, Komossa K, Heres S, Kissling W, Davis JM 2012 CD008016"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kinon BJ, Ascher-Svanum H, Adams DH, Chen L |title=The temporal relationship between symptom change and treatment discontinuation in a pooled analysis of 4 schizophrenia trials |journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=544–9 |date=October 2008  |pmid=18794651 |doi=10.1097/JCP.0b013e318185e74a |url=}}</ref>

===Bipolar disorder===
{{Main|Bipolar disorder}}

===Withdrawal===
Withdrawal symptoms from antipsychotics may emerge during dosage reduction and discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms can include [[nausea]], [[emesis]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[diarrhea]], [[rhinorrhea]], [[diaphoresis]], [[myalgia]], [[paresthesia]], [[anxiety]], agitation, restlessness, and [[insomnia]].

Withdrawal effects may also occur when switching a person from one antipsychotic to another, (it is presumed due to variations of potency and receptor activity). Such withdrawal effects can include [[cholinergic]] rebound, an activation syndrome, and motor syndromes including [[dyskinesia]]s.

* [[Amisulpride]]<sup>‡</sup>– Selective dopamine antagonist. Higher doses (greater than 400&nbsp;mg) act upon post-synaptic dopamine receptors resulting in a reduction in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as psychosis. Lower doses, however, act upon dopamine autoreceptors, resulting in increased dopamine transmission, improving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Lower doses of amisulpride have also been shown to have [[antidepressant]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects in non-schizophrenic patients, leading to its use in [[dysthymia]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobias]].

==Mechanism of action==
All antipsychotic drugs tend to block [[dopamine receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptors]] in the [[dopamine]] pathways of the [[Human brain|brain]]. This means that dopamine released in these pathways has less effect. Excess release of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] has been linked to psychotic experiences. It has also been proven{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} less dopamine released in the prefrontal cortex in the brain, and excess dopamine released from all other pathways, has also been linked to psychotic experiences, caused by abnormal dopaminergic function as a result of patients suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Various neuroleptics such as [[haloperidol]] and [[chlorpromazine]] suppress dopamine chemicals throughout its pathways, in order for dopamine receptors to function normally.

In addition of the antagonistic effects of dopamine, antipsychotics (in particular atypical neuroleptics) also antagonize [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors]]. Different [[alleles]] of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor have been associated with schizophrenia and other psychoses, including depression.<ref name="McDonald 41–63">{{cite journal | author = McDonald C, Murphy KC | title = The new genetics of schizophrenia | journal = The Psychiatric clinics of North America | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–63 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12683259 | doi = 10.1016/S0193-953X(02)00030-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schmidt CJ, Sorensen SM, Kehne JH, Carr AA, Palfreyman MG | title = The role of 5HT2A receptors in antipsychotic activity | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 56 | issue = 25 | pages = 2209–22 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7791509 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(95)00210-W }}</ref> Higher concentrations of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in cortical and subcortical areas, in particular in the right [[caudate nucleus]] have been historically recorded.<ref name="McDonald 41–63"/> This is the same receptor that [[psychedelic drugs]] agonize to various degrees,
which explains the correlation between psychedelic drugs and schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc|last=Chattopadhyay|first=ed. by Amitabha|title=Serotonin receptors in neurobiology|year=2007|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=0-8493-3977-4|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1853/}}</ref>

Typical antipsychotics are not particularly selective and also block dopamine receptors in the [[mesocortical pathway]], [[tuberoinfundibular pathway]], and the [[nigrostriatal pathway]]. Blocking D<sub>2</sub> receptors in these other pathways is thought to produce some unwanted [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] that the typical antipsychotics can produce (see above). They were commonly classified on a spectrum of low potency to high potency, where potency referred to the ability of the drug to bind to dopamine receptors, and not to the effectiveness of the drug. High-potency antipsychotics such as [[haloperidol]], in general, have doses of a few milligrams and cause less sleepiness and calming effects than low-potency antipsychotics such as [[chlorpromazine]] and [[thioridazine]], which have dosages of several hundred milligrams. The latter have a greater degree of anticholinergic and antihistaminergic activity, which can counteract dopamine-related side-effects.

[[Atypical antipsychotic]] drugs have a similar blocking effect on D<sub>2</sub> receptors, however, most also act on serotonin receptors, especially [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] and [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]] receptors. Both clozapine and quetiapine appear to bind just long enough to elicit antipsychotic effects but not long enough to induce extrapyramidal side effects and prolactin hypersecretion.<ref name = Atypicality>{{cite journal|last=Stahl|first=SM|title=Describing an Atypical Antipsychotic: Receptor Binding and Its Role in Pathophysiology|journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry|year=2003|volume=5|issue=Suppl. 3|pages=9–13|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v05s03/v05s0302.pdf}}</ref> 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonism increases dopaminergic activity in the [[nigrostriatal pathway]], leading to a lowered extrapyramidal side effect liability among the atypical antipsychotics.<ref name = Atypicality /><ref>{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc|last1=Gross|first1=Gerhard|last2=Geyer|first2=Mark A.|title=Current Antipsychotics|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-25761-2|pages=88–89|url=http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-25761-2/page/1|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-25761-2}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Thorazine advert.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Thorazine ([[chlorpromazine]]) from the 1950s, reflecting the perceptions of psychosis, including the now-discredited perception of a tendency towards violence, from the time when antipsychotics were discovered<ref>The text reads: "When the patient lashes out against 'them' - THORAZINE (brand of chlorpromazine) quickly puts an end to his violent outburst. 'Thorazine' is especially effective when the psychotic episode is triggered by delusions or hallucinations. At the outset of treatment, Thorazine's combination of antipsychotic and sedative effects provides both emotional and physical calming. Assaultive or destructive behavior is rapidly controlled. As therapy continues, the initial sedative effect gradually disappears. But the antipsychotic effect continues, helping to dispel or modify delusions, hallucinations and confusion, while keeping the patient calm and approachable. SMITH KLINE AND FRENCH LABORATORIES leaders in psychopharmaceutical research."</ref>]]

The original antipsychotic drugs were happened upon largely by chance and then tested for their effectiveness. The first, [[chlorpromazine]], was developed as a surgical [[anesthetic]]. It was first used on psychiatric patients because of its powerful calming effect; at the time it was regarded as a non-permanent "pharmacological [[lobotomy]]".<ref name=pieters>{{cite journal | author = Pieters T, Majerus B | title = The introduction of chlorpromazine in Belgium and the Netherlands (1951-1968); tango between old and new treatment features | journal = Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed Sci | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 443–52 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22035718 | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsc.2011.05.003 }}</ref> Lobotomy at the time was used to treat many behavioral disorders, including psychosis, although its effect was to markedly reduce behavior and mental functioning of all types. However, chlorpromazine proved to reduce the effects of psychosis in a more effective and specific manner than lobotomy, even though it was known to be capable of causing severe sedation. The underlying [[neurochemistry]] involved has since been studied in detail, and subsequent antipsychotic drugs have been discovered by an approach that incorporates this sort of information.

The discovery of chlorpromazine's psychoactive effects in 1952 led to greatly reduced use of restraint, seclusion, and sedation in the management of agitated patients,<ref name=pieters /> and also led to further research that resulted in the development of [[antidepressant]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, and the majority of other drugs now used in the management of psychiatric conditions. In 1952, [[Henri Laborit]] described chlorpromazine only as inducing indifference towards what was happening around them in nonpsychotic, nonmanic patients, and [[Jean Delay]] and [[Pierre Deniker]] described it as controlling manic or psychotic agitation. The former claimed to have discovered a treatment for agitation in anyone, and the latter team claimed to have discovered a treatment for psychotic illness.<ref>Healy, D. 2005. Psychiatric Drugs Explained. 4th Ed. Britain:Elsevier Limited. P. 8, 17.</ref>

Until the 1970s there was considerable debate within psychiatry on the most appropriate term to use to describe the new drugs.<ref name="king">{{cite journal | author = King C, Voruganti LN | title = What's in a name?

Thus, the word means ''taking hold of one's nerves''. This may refer to common side effects such as reduced activity in general, as well as lethargy and impaired motor control. Although these effects are unpleasant and in some cases harmful, they were at one time, along with akathisia, considered a reliable sign that the drug was working.<ref name=pieters /> The term "ataraxy" was coined by the neurologist Howard Fabing and the classicist Alister Cameron to describe the observed effect of psychic indifference and detachment in patients treated with chlorpromazine.<ref>{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-63353-6| last = Owens| first = David Griffith Cunningham| title = A guide to the extrapyramidal side-effects of antipsychotic drugs|date = 1999-04-13|url = http://books.google.ie/books?id=RwRSahg71GkC&pg=PA12| page = 12}}</ref> This term derived from the Greek adjective "[[wikt:ἀτάρακτος|ἀτάρακτος]]" (''[[wikt:ataractic|ataraktos]]''), which means "not disturbed, not excited, without confusion, steady, calm".<ref name="king"/> In the use of the terms "[[tranquilizer]]" and "ataractic", medical practitioners distinguished between the "major tranquilizers" or "major ataractics", which referred to drugs used to treat psychoses, and the "minor tranquilizers" or "minor ataractics", which referred to drugs used to treat [[neurosis|neuroses]].<ref name="king"/> While popular during the 1950s, these terms are infrequently used today.

Antipsychotics are broadly divided into two groups, the [[typical antipsychotic|typical or first-generation antipsychotics]] and the [[atypical antipsychotic|atypical or second-generation antipsychotics]]. The typical antipsychotics are classified according to their chemical structure while the atypical antipsychotics are classified according to their pharmacological properties. These include serotonin-dopamine antagonists (see[[dopamine antagonist]] and [[serotonin antagonist]]), multi-acting receptor-targeted antipsychotics (MARTA, those targeting several systems), and [[dopamine partial agonists]], which are often categorized as atypicals.<ref name=Horacek2006>{{cite journal | author = Horacek J, Bubenikova-Valesova V, Kopecek M, Palenicek T, Dockery C, Mohr P, Höschl C | title = Mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs and the neurobiology of schizophrenia | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 389–409 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16696579 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200620050-00004 }}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Sales===
Antipsychotics were once among the biggest selling and most profitable of all drugs, generating $22&nbsp;billion in global sales in 2008.<ref name="healthcarefinancenews.com">[http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/press-release/pipeline-antipsychotic-drugs-drive-next-market-evolutionPipelineantipsychotic drugs to drive next market evolution (2009)]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}.

===Formulations===

Antipsychotics are sometimes administered as part of compulsory psychiatric treatment via [[involuntary commitment|inpatient (hospital) commitment]] or [[outpatient commitment]]. They may be administered orally or, in some cases, through long-acting (depot) injections administered in the [[dorsogluteal muscle|dorsgluteal]], [[ventrogluteal area|ventrogluteal]] or [[deltoid muscle]].

===Controversy===
Joanna Moncrieff has argued that antipsychotic drug treatment is often undertaken as a means of control rather than to treat specific symptoms experienced by the patient.<ref name="guard 1">{{cite web |title=Myth of the antipsychotic|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/mar/02/mythoftheantipsychotic |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=27 July 2012 |first=Adam |last=James |date=2 March 2008}}</ref> Moncreiff has further argued that the evidence for antipsychotics from discontinuation-relapse studies may be flawed, because they do not take into account that antipsychotics may sensitize the brain and provoke psychosis if discontinued, which may then be wrongly interpreted as a relapse of the original condition.<ref name="Moncrieff-2006">{{cite journal | author = Moncrieff J | title = Why is it so difficult to stop psychiatric drug treatment?

Use of this class of drugs has a history of criticism in residential care. As the drugs used can make patients calmer and more compliant, critics claim that the drugs can be overused. Outside doctors can feel under pressure from care home staff.<ref>''GPs under 'pressure' to issue neuroleptics, claims professor'', Chemist + Druggist, 15 January 2009</ref> In an official review commissioned by UK government ministers it was reported that the needless use of antipsychotic medication in dementia care was widespread and was linked to 1800 deaths per year.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nick Triggle |title=Dementia drug use 'killing many' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8356423.stm |date=12 November 2009 |newspaper=BBC |accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=UK study warns against antipsychotics for dementia |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/12/dementia-drugs-idUSLC44347420091112 |date=Nov 12, 2009 |newspaper=reuters |accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref> In the US, the government has initiated legal action against the pharmaceutical company [[Johnson & Johnson]] for allegedly paying [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] to [[Omnicare]] to promote its antipsychotic [[risperidone]] (Risperdal) in nursing homes.<ref name=Hilzenrath>{{Cite news|author=Hilzenrath, David S. |date=16 January 2010 |title=Justice suit accuses Johnson & Johnson of paying kickbacks |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011503903.html |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate= 17 January 2010}}</ref>

There has also been controversy about the role of [[pharmaceutical]] companies in [[marketing]] and promoting antipsychotics, including allegations of downplaying or covering up adverse effects, expanding the number of conditions or illegally promoting off-label usage; influencing drug trials (or their publication) to try to show that the expensive and profitable newer atypicals were superior to the older cheaper typicals that were out of patent. Following charges of illegal marketing, settlements by two large pharmaceutical companies in the US set records for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations.<ref name=bied2010>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?_r=3&hp=&pagewanted=all|title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits |first=Duff |last=Wilson |date=October 2, 2010 |work=New York Times }}</ref> One case involved [[Eli Lilly and Company]]'s antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]].

Harvard medical professor [[Joseph Biederman]] conducted research on bipolar disorder in children that led to an increase in such diagnoses. A 2008 Senate investigation found that Biederman also received $1.6 million in speaking and consulting fees between 2000 and 2007&nbsp;— some of them undisclosed to Harvard&nbsp;— from companies including makers of antipsychotic drugs prescribed for children with bipolar disorder. [[Johnson & Johnson]] gave more than $700,000 to a research center that was headed by Biederman from 2002 to 2005, where research was conducted, in part, on [[Risperdal]], the company's antipsychotic drug. Biederman has responded saying that the money did not influence him and that he did not promote a specific diagnosis or treatment.<ref name=bied2010/>

Pharmaceutical companies have also been accused of attempting to set the mental health agenda through activities such as funding [[consumer advocacy groups]].<ref name="pmid15278977">{{cite journal |author=Gosden R, Beder S |title=Pharmaceutical industry agenda setting in mental health policies |journal=Ethical Human Sciences and Services : an International Journal of Critical Inquiry |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=147–59 |year=2001 |pmid=15278977 |doi= |url=http://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/pharm-agenda.html}}</ref>
