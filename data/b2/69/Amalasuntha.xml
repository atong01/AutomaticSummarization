She was daughter of<space/><link><target>Theoderic the Great</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>She was married in 515 to<space/><link><target>Eutharic</target></link><space/>(c. 480 522), an Ostrogoth noble of the old<space/><link><target>Amali</target><part>Amal</part></link><space/>line, who had previously been living in<space/><link><target>Visigoths</target><part>Visigothic</part></link><space/><link><target>Hispania</target></link>, son of Widerich (born c. 450), grandson of Berismund (born c. 410), and great-grandson of<space/><link><target>Valamir</target><part>Thorismund</part></link><space/>(died after 400),<space/><link><target>King of the Ostrogoths</target></link><space/>c. 400.</paragraph><paragraph>Her husband died, apparently in the early years of her marriage, leaving her with two children,<space/><link><target>Athalaric</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Matasuntha</target></link><space/>(c. 517 after 550), wife c. 550 of<space/><link><target>Germanus (cousin of Justinian I)</target><part>Germanus</part></link>. On the death of her father in 526, her son succeeded him, but she held the power as<space/><link><target>regent</target></link><space/>for her son. Deeply imbued with the old Roman culture, she gave to that son's education a more refined and literary turn than suited the ideas of her Gothic subjects. Conscious of her unpopularity she banished, and afterwards put to death, three Gothic nobles whom she suspected of intriguing against her rule, and at the same time opened negotiations with the emperor<space/><link><target>Justinian I</target></link><space/>with the view of removing herself and the Gothic treasure to<space/><link><target>Constantinople</target></link>. Her son's death in 534 made little change in the posture of affairs.</paragraph><paragraph>Now queen, Amalasuntha made her cousin<space/><link><target>Theodahad</target></link><space/>partner of her throne (not, as sometimes stated, her husband, for his wife was still living), with the intent of strengthening her position. The choice was unfortunate, for Theodahad fostered the disaffection of the Goths, and either by his orders or with his permission, Amalasuntha was imprisoned in the island of Martana in the Tuscan lake of Bolsena, where on 30 April in the spring of 534/535 she was murdered in her bath.</paragraph><paragraph>The letters of<space/><link><target>Cassiodorus</target></link>, chief minister and literary adviser of Amalasuntha, and the histories of<space/><link><target>Procopius</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Jordanes</target></link>, give us our chief information as to the character of Amalasuntha.</paragraph><paragraph>The life of Amalasunta was made the subject of a<space/><link><target>tragedy</target></link>, the first play written by the young<space/><link><target>Carlo Goldoni</target></link><space/>and presented at<space/><link><target>Milan</target></link><space/>in (1733).</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Asteroid</target></link><space/><link><target>650 Amalasuntha</target></link><space/>is named in her honour.</paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>EB1911</target><arg name="wstitle">Amalasuntha</arg></template></listitem><listitem><italics><link><target>:fr:Continuit des lites Byzance durant les sicles obscurs.
