The '''central nervous system''' ('''CNS''') is the part of the [[nervous system]] consisting of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from, and coordinates and influences the activity of, all parts of the bodies of [[bilaterian|bilaterally symmetric animals]] — that is, all multicellular animals except [[sponge]]s and [[radiata|radially symmetric animals]] such as [[jellyfish]] — and it contains the majority of the nervous system.

==Structure==
{{main|Neuroanatomy}}
The central nervous system consists of the two major structures: the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].
The brain is encased in the skull, and protected by the cranium.<ref name="Moore's" /> The spinal cord is continuous with the brain and lies [[anatomical terminology|caudaly]] to the brain,<ref name="Kandel" /> and is protected by the [[vertebra]].<ref name="Moore's" /> The spinal cord reaches from the base of the skull, continues through<ref name="Moore's" /> or starting below<ref name="Huijzen" /> the [[foramen magnum]],<ref name="Moore's" /> and terminates roughly level with the first or second [[lumbar vertebra]],<ref name=Kandel>{{cite book|vauthors= Kandel ER, Schwartz JH |title=Principles of neural science|year=2012|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=Appleton & Lange|isbn=978-0-07-139011-8|pages=338–343|edition=5.}}</ref><ref name="Huijzen">{{cite book|last=Huijzen|first=R.

Voogd, C. van|title=The human central nervous system|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-34686-9|pages=3|edition=4th}}</ref> occupying the upper sections of the [[vertebral canal]].<ref name="Fitzgerald">{{cite book|last=Estomih Mtui|first=M.J. Turlough FitzGerald, Gregory Gruener|title=Clinical neuroanatomy and neuroscience|publisher=Saunders|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7020-3738-2|pages=38|edition=6th}}</ref>

===White and gray matter===
{{main|Gray matter|White matter}}
[[Image:1202 White and Gray Matter.jpg|thumb|left|Dissection of a brain with labels showing the clear division between white and gray matter.]]
Microscopically, there are differences between the neurons and tissue of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The central nervous system is divided in [[white matter|white]] and [[gray matter]].<ref name="Kandel" /> This can also be seen macroscopically on brain tissue. The white matter consists of [[axon]]s and [[oligodendrocyte]]s, while the gray matter chiefly consists of [[neuron]]s. Both tissues include a number of [[glia]]l cells (although the white matter contains more), which are often referred to as supporting cells of the central nervous system. Different forms of glial cells have different functions, some acting almost as scaffolding for neuroblasts to climb during [[neurogenesis]] such as [[bergmann glia]], while others such as [[microglia]] are a specialized form of [[macrophage]], involved in the [[immune system]] of the brain as well as the clearance of various [[metabolites]] from the [[brain tissue]].<ref name="Fitzgerald" /> [[Astrocytes]] may be involved with both clearance of metabolites as well as transport of fuel and various beneficial substances to neurons from the [[capillary|capillaries]] of the brain. Upon CNS injury astrocytes will proliferate, causing [[gliosis]], a form of neuronal scar tissue, lacking in functional neurons.<ref name="Fitzgerald" />

The brain ([[cerebrum]] as well as [[midbrain]] and [[hindbrain]]) consists of a [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], composed of neuron-bodies constituting gray matter, while internally there is more white matter that form tracts and [[commissure]]s. Apart from cortical gray matter there is also [[subcortical gray matter|subcortical gray]] making up a large number of different [[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]].<ref name="Kandel" />

===Spinal cord===
{{main|Spinal cord}}
From and to the spinal cord are projections of the peripheral nervous system in the form of [[spinal nerve|spinal]] [[nerve]]s (sometimes segmental nerves<ref name="Moore's" />). The nerves connect the spinal cord with skin, joints, muscles etc. and allow for the transmission of [[efferent]] motor as well as [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent sensory signals]] and stimuli.<ref name="Kandel" /> This allows for voluntary and involuntary motions of muscles, as well as the perception of senses.
All in all 31 spinal nerves project from the brain stem,<ref name="Kandel" /> some forming plexa as they branch out, such as the [[brachial plexus|brachial plexa]], [[sacral plexus|sacral plexa]] etc.<ref name="Moore's" /> Each spinal nerve will carry both sensory and motor signals, but the nerves synapse at different regions of the spinal cord, either from the periphery to sensory relay neurons that relay the information to the CNS or from the CNS to motor neurons, which relay the information out.<ref name="Kandel" />
[[File:Sobo 1909 615.png|thumb|right|Diagram of the columns and of the course of the fibers in the spinal cord. Sensory synapses occur in the dorsal spinal cord (above in this image), and motor nerves leave through the ventral (as well as lateral) horns of the spinal cord as seen below in the image.]]
[[Image:1508 Autonomic Control of Pupil Size.jpg|thumb|right|Different ways in which the central nervous system can be activated without engaging the cortex, and making us aware of the actions. The above example shows the process in which the pupil dilates during dim light, activating neurons in the spinal cord. The second example shows the constriction of the pupil as a result of the activation of the Eddinger-Westphal nucleus (a cerebral ganglion).]]
The spinal cord relays information up to the brain through spinal tracts through the "final common pathway"<ref name="Kandel" /> to the [[thalamus]] and ultimately to the cortex. Not all information is relayed to the cortex, and does not reach our immediate consciousness, but is instead transmitted only to the thalamus which sorts and adapts accordingly. This in turn may explain why we are not constantly aware of all aspects of our surroundings.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

File:1507 Short and Long Reflexes.jpg|Reflexes may also occur without engaging more than one neuron of the central nervous system as in the below example of a short reflex.
</gallery>

====Cranial nerves====
Apart from the spinal cord, there are also peripheral nerves of the PNS that synapse through intermediaries or [[ganglia]] directly on the CNS. These 12 nerves exist in the head and neck region and are called [[cranial nerves]]. Cranial nerves bring information to the CNS to and from the face, as well as to certain muscles (such as the [[trapezius muscle]], which is innervated by [[accessory nerve]]s<ref name="Moore's" /> as well as certain [[cervical spinal nerve]]s).<ref name="Moore's" />

Two pairs of cranial nerves; the [[olfactory nerve]]s and the [[optic nerve]]s<ref name="Purves 2000"/> are often considered structures of the central nervous system. This is because they do not synapse first on peripheral ganglia, but directly on central nervous neurons. The olfactory epithelium is significant in that it consists of central nervous tissue expressed in direct contact to the environment, allowing for administration of certain pharmaceuticals and drugs.

===Brain===
{{main|Brain}}
Rostrally to the spinal cord lies the brain.<ref name="Kandel" />
The brain makes up the largest portion of the central nervous system, and is often the main structure referred to when speaking of the nervous system. The brain is the major functional unit of the central nervous system. While the spinal cord has certain processing ability such as that of [[spinal locomotion]] and can process [[reflex]]es, the brain is the major processing unit of the nervous system.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Brainstem====
{{main|Brainstem}}
The brainstem consists of the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]], the [[pons]] and the [[midbrain]]. The medulla can be referred to as an extension of the spinal cord, and its organization and functional properties are similar to those of the spinal cord.<ref name="Kandel" /> The tracts passing from the spinal cord to the brain pass through here.<ref name="Kandel" />

Regulatory functions of the medulla nuclei include control of the [[blood pressure]] and [[breathing]]. Other nuclei are involved in [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[taste]], [[hearing]] and control of muscles of the [[face]] and [[neck]].<ref name="Kandel" />

The next structure rostral to the medulla is the pons, which lies on the ventral anterior side of the brainstem. Nuclei in the pons include [[pontine nuclei]] which work with the [[cerebellum]] and transmit information between the cerebellum and the [[cerebral cortex]].<ref name="Kandel" />
In the dorsal posterior pons lie nuclei that have to do with breathing, sleep and taste.<ref name="Kandel" />

The midbrain (or mesencephalon) is situated above and rostral to the pons, and includes nuclei linking distinct parts of the motor system, among others the cerebellum, the [[basal ganglia]] and both [[cerebral hemisphere]]s. Additionally parts of the visual and auditory systems are located in the mid brain, including control of automatic eye movements.<ref name="Kandel" />

The brainstem at large provides entry and exit to the brain for a number of pathways for motor and autonomic control of the face and neck through cranial nerves,<ref name="Kandel" /> and autonomic control of the organs is mediated by the tenth cranial ([[vagus]]) nerve.<ref name="Fitzgerald" /><!-- page 98-199 --> A large portion of the brainstem is involved in such autonomic control of the body. Such functions may engage the [[heart]], [[blood vessels]], [[pupil]]lae, among others.<ref name="Kandel" />

The brainstem also hold the [[reticular formation]], a group of nuclei involved in both [[arousal]] and [[alertness]].<ref name="Kandel" />

====Cerebellum====
{{main|Cerebellum}}
The cerebellum lies behind the pons. The cerebellum is composed of several dividing fissures and lobes. Its function includes the control of posture, and the coordination of movements of parts of the body, including the eyes and head as well as the limbs. Further it is involved in motion that has been learned and perfected though practice, and will adapt to new learned movements.<ref name="Kandel" />
Despite its previous classification as a motor structure, the cerebellum also displays connections to areas of the cerebral cortex involved in language as well as [[cognition|cognitive functions]]. These connections have been shown by the use of [[medical imaging]] techniques such as [[fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]].<ref name="Kandel" />

The body of the cerebellum holds more neurons than any other structure of the brain including that of the larger [[cerebrum]] (or cerebral hemispheres), but is also more extensively understood than other structures of the brain, and includes fewer types of different neurons.<ref name="Kandel" /> It handles and processes sensory stimuli, motor information as well as balance information from the [[vestibular organ]].<ref name="Kandel" />

====Diencephalon====
{{main|Diencephalon|Thalamus|Hypothalamus}}
The two structures of the diencephalon worth noting are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. The thalamus acts as a linkage between incoming pathways from the peripheral nervous system as well as the optical nerve (though it does not receive input from the olfactory nerve) to the cerebral hemispheres. Previously it was considered only a "relay station", but it is engaged in the sorting of information that will reach cerebral hemispheres ([[neocortex]]).<ref name="Kandel" />

Apart from its function of sorting information from the periphery, the thalamus also connects the cerebellum and basal ganglia with the cerebrum. In common with the aforementioned reticular system the thalamus is involved in wakefullness and consciousness, such as though the [[Suprachiasmatic nucleus|SCN]].<ref name="Kandel" />

The hypothalamus engages in functions of a number of primitive emotions or feelings such as [[hunger]], [[thirst]] and [[maternal bond]]ing. This is regulated partly through control of secretion of [[hormone]]s from the [[pituitary gland]]. Additionally the hypothalamus plays a role in [[motivation]] and many other behaviors of the individual.<ref name="Kandel" />

====Cerebrum====
{{main|Cerebrum|Cerebral cortex|Basal ganglia|Amygdala|Hippocampus}}
The cerebrum of cerebral hemispheres make up the largest portion of the human brain. Various structures combine forming the cerebral hemispheres, among others, the cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala and hippocampus. The hemispheres together control a large portion of the functions of the human brain such as emotion, memory, perception and motor functions. Apart from this the cerebral hemispheres stand for the cognitive capabilities of the brain.<ref name="Kandel" />

Connecting each of the hemispheres is the [[corpus callosum]] as well as several additional [[commissure]]s.<ref name="Kandel" />
One of the most important parts of the cerebral hemispheres is the cortex, made up of gray matter covering the surface of the brain. Functionally, the cerebral cortex is involved in planning and carrying out of everyday tasks.<ref name="Kandel" />

The hippocampus is involved in storage of memories, the amygdala plays a role in perception and communication of emotion, while the basal ganglia play a major role in the coordination of voluntary movement.<ref name="Kandel" />

===Difference from the peripheral nervous system===
[[File:1205 Somatic Autonomic Enteric StructuresN.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A map over the different structures of the nervous systems in the body, showing the CNS, [[Parasympathetic nervous system|PNS]], and [[Enteric nervous system|ENS]].]]
This differentiates the central nervous system from the peripheral nervous system, which consists of neurons, axons and [[Schwann cells]]. Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells have similar functions in the central and peripheral nervous system respectively. Both act to add [[myelin]] sheaths to the axons, which acts as a form of insulation allowing for better and faster proliferation of electrical signals along the nerves. Axons in the central nervous system are often very short (barely a few millimeters) and do not need the same degree of isolation as peripheral nerves do. Some peripheral nerves can be over 1m in length, such as the nerves to the big toe. To ensure signals move at sufficient speed, myelination is needed.

The way in which the Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes myelinate nerves differ. A Schwann cell usually myelinates a single axon, completely surrounding it. Sometimes they may myelinate many axons, especially when in areas of short axons.<ref name="Moore's">{{cite book|last=Arthur F. Dalley|first=Keith L. Moore, Anne M.R. Agur|title=Clinically oriented anatomy|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Wolters Kluwer|location=Philadelphia [etc.]|isbn=978-1-60547-652-0|pages=48–55,464,700,822,824,1075|edition=6th ed., [International ed.].}}</ref> Oligodendrocytes usually myelinate several axons. They do this by sending out thin projections of their [[cell membrane]] which envelop and enclose the axon.

{{Main|Neural development}}
During early development of the vertebrate embryo, a longitudinal [[neural groove|groove]] on the [[neural plate]] gradually deepens and the ridges on either side of the groove (the [[neural folds]]) become elevated, and ultimately meet, transforming the groove into a [[neural tube|closed tube]], the [[ectoderm]]al wall of which forms the rudiment of the nervous system. This tube initially differentiates into three [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] (pockets): the [[prosencephalon]] at the front, the [[mesencephalon]], and, between the mesencephalon and the spinal cord, the [[rhombencephalon]]. (By six weeks in the human embryo) the prosencephalon then divides further into the [[telencephalon]] and [[diencephalon]]; and the rhombencephalon divides into the [[metencephalon]] and [[myelencephalon]].

As a vertebrate grows, these vesicles differentiate further still. The telencephalon differentiates into, among other things, the [[striatum]], the [[hippocampus]] and the [[neocortex]], and its cavity becomes the [[lateral ventricles|first and second ventricles]]. Diencephalon elaborations include the [[subthalamus]], [[hypothalamus]], [[thalamus]] and [[epithalamus]], and its cavity forms the [[third ventricle]]. The [[tectum]], [[pretectum]], [[cerebral peduncle]] and other structures develop out of the mesencephalon, and its cavity grows into the [[mesencephalic duct]] (cerebral aqueduct). The metencephalon becomes, among other things, the [[pons]] and the [[cerebellum]], the myelencephalon forms the [[medulla oblongata]], and their cavities develop into the fourth ventricle.

Their primitive brains, consisting of two fused anterior ganglia, and longitudinal nerve cords form the CNS; the laterally projecting nerves form the PNS. A molecular study found that more than 95% of the 116 genes involved in the nervous system of planarians, which includes genes related to the CNS, also exist in humans.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mineta K, Nakazawa M, Cebria F, Ikeo K, Agata K, Gojobori T | title = Origin and evolutionary process of the CNS elucidated by comparative genomics analysis of planarian ESTs | journal = PNAS | volume = 100 | issue = 13 | pages = 7666–7671 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12802012 | pmc = 164645 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1332513100 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/100/13/7666.full.pdf+html?sid=b2a914e7-5647-4ee2-835c-bc54c4927a98 }}</ref> Like planarians, vertebrates have a distinct CNS and PNS, though more complex than those of planarians.

The CNS of [[chordate]]s differs from that of other animals in being placed dorsally in the body, above the gut and [[notochord]]/[[Vertebral column|spine]].<ref name=Romer>Romer, A.S. (1949): ''The Vertebrate Body.'' W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia. (2nd ed. 1955; 3rd ed. 1962; 4th ed. 1970)</ref> The basic pattern of the CNS is highly conserved throughout the different species of [[vertebrate]]s and during evolution. The major trend that can be observed is towards a progressive telencephalisation: the [[telencephalon]] of reptiles is only an appendix to the large [[olfactory bulb]], while in mammals it makes up most of the volume of the CNS. In the human brain, the telencephalon covers most of the [[diencephalon]] and the [[mesencephalon]]. Indeed, the [[allometry|allometric]] study of brain size among different species shows a striking continuity from rats to whales, and allows us to complete the knowledge about the evolution of the CNS obtained through [[cranial endocast]]s.

===Diseases===
{{main|Central nervous system disease}}
There are many central nervous system diseases and conditions, including [[List of central nervous system infections|infections]] of the central nervous system such as [[encephalitis]] and [[poliomyelitis]], early-onset [[neurological disorders]] including [[ADHD]] and [[autism]], late-onset [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative diseases]] such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[essential tremor]], [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] and inflammatory diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]], genetic disorders such as [[Krabbe's disease]] and [[Huntington's disease]], as well as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] and [[adrenoleukodystrophy]]. Lastly, cancers of the central nervous system can cause severe illness and, when [[Malignant brain tumor|malignant]], can have very high mortality rates.
