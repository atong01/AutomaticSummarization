{{Politics of Estonia}}
'''Politics in Estonia''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[Riigikogu|Estonian parliament]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the [[Government of Estonia|Government]] which is led by the [[Prime Minister of Estonia|Prime Minister]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Estonia is a member of [[United Nations]], [[European Union]] and [[NATO]], among others.

==Political history of Estonia==
{{main|History of Estonia}}
The [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]] was issued in 1918. A parliamentary republic was formed by the [[Estonian Constituent Assembly]] and the first Constitution of Estonia was adopted on June 15, 1920. The parliament [[Riigikogu]] (State Assembly) elected a [[Riigivanem]] who acted both as [[Head of Government]] and [[Head of State]]. During the [[Era of Silence]] political parties were banned and the parliament was not in session between 1934 and 1938 as the country was ruled by [[decree]] by [[Konstantin Päts]], who was elected as the first [[President of Estonia]] in 1938. In 1938 a new constitution was passed and [[Riigikogu]] was convened once again, this time [[bicameral]]ly, consisting of [[Riigivolikogu]] ([[lower house]]) and [[Riiginõukogu]] ([[upper house]]), both meaning State Council in direct translation. In 1940 Estonia was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]]. A year later, the Soviet occupation was taken over by a [[Nazi German]] one. During the course of the two occupations legal institutions, elected according to the constitution approved by the people, were removed from power. In September 1944, after German forces left, legal power was briefly restored as [[Otto Tief]] formed a new government in accordance with the [[1938 constitution]]. The Tief government, though, lasted for  only 5 days, as Estonia was again occupied by the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1991 the Republic of Estonia was restored on the basis of continuity with the constitution prior to 1938, with the public approving a new constitution in 1992. [[Estonia]] declared independence in 1991 causing the transition from a state socialist economy to the capitalist market economy. <ref>{{Cite journal

The contemporary Estonian government follows the principles of [[separation of powers]] and its people elect a 101-member [[Riigikogu]] every four years. Only Estonian citizens may participate in parliamentary elections. Estonia uses a voting system based on [[proportional representation]]. A party must exceed a national threshold of 5% of all votes to gain entry to the parliament.  The Parliament elects a [[President of Estonia|President]], who can be in office for a five-year period for a maximum of two terms in succession. As a rule, the president asks the party leader who has collected the most votes to form the new government, who then must gain the approval of [[Riigikogu]]. The parliament also appoints the president of the [[Bank of Estonia]], the [[Chief of the Headquarters of the Estonian Defense]], the [[Comptroller General of Estonia]], the [[Chancellor of Justice of Estonia]] and the [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of Estonia]], all on the proposal of the [[President of Estonia]].

Estonia does not have a [[state church]]; [[religious freedom]] is guaranteed by the constitution.

== Head of State ==
The [[President of Estonia]] is elected by [[Parliament of Estonia|Parliament]] (''Riigikogu'') for a five-year term; if he or she does not secure two-thirds of the votes after three rounds of balloting, then an electoral assembly (made up of Parliament plus members of local governments) elects the president, choosing between the two candidates with the largest percentage of votes.

==Executive branch==
The [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] (''[[Estonian language|Estonian]]: Eesti Vabariigi Peaminister'') is the [[head of government]] of the [[Republic of Estonia]]. The prime minister is chosen by the [[President of Estonia|President]] and conferred by Parliament. This is usually the leader of the largest party or coalition in the Parliament.
The activity of the government is directed by the Prime Minister. He does not head any specific ministry, but is, in accordance with the [[Constitution of Estonia|constitution]], the supervisor of the work of the government. The Prime Minister’s significance and role in the government and his relations with other ministries often depend on the position of the party led by the prime minister in vis-à-vis the coalition partners, and on how much influence the prime minister possesses within his own party. If the prime minister has a strong position within his party, and the government is made up solely of representatives of that party, he can enjoy considerable authority. In all crucial national questions, however, the final word rests with Riigikogu as the legislative power.

==Legislative branch==
{{main|Riigikogu|Electronic voting in Estonia}}
The [[Riigikogu|State Council]] (''Riigikogu'') has 101 members, elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]]. Only Estonian citizens may participate in parliamentary elections.

[[Internet voting]] was first used in the 2005 local elections<ref>[http://archive.is/20120713045721/http://news.com.com/Estonia+pulls+off+nationwide+Net+voting/2100-1028_3-5898115.html News.COM]</ref> and it has since then been used in electing Riigikogu and the European Parliament as well.

===Political parties and elections===
{{elect|List of political parties in Estonia|Elections in Estonia}}
{{see also |Estonian parliamentary election, 2007}}
In the years shortly following the restoration of independence, there were dozens of parties to represent a population of only 1.3 million; at present 6 main parties are in the parliament. The local authorities have developed in much the same direction. All [[permanent resident]]s of [[voting age]] (18) may participate in local elections.
