'''Khmer''' {{IPAc-en|k|m|ɛər}}<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, "Khmer".</ref> or '''Cambodian''' (natively {{lang|km|ភាសាខ្មែរ}} {{IPA-km|pʰiːəsaː kʰmaːe|}}, or more formally {{lang|km|ខេមរភាសា}} {{IPA-km|kʰeɛmaʔraʔ pʰiːəsaː|}}) is the language of the [[Khmer people]] and the [[official language]] of [[Cambodia]]. With approximately 16 million speakers, it is the second most widely spoken [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language]] (after [[Vietnamese Language|Vietnamese]]). Khmer has been influenced considerably by [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli|Pali]], especially in the royal and religious [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], through the vehicles of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The more colloquial registers have influenced, and have been influenced by, [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Lao language|Lao]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and [[Cham language|Cham]], all of which, due to geographical proximity and long-term cultural contact, form a [[sprachbund]] in peninsular [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name ="enfield">[http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:57458:2/component/escidoc:57459/Enfield_2005_areal.pdf Enfield, N.J.

Smyth, Judith Margaret Jacob|year=1993|publisher=Routledge (UK)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fRyungEACAAJ|isbn=978-0-7286-0218-2}}</ref> due to Old Khmer being the language of the historical empires of [[Chenla Kingdom|Chenla]], [[Angkor]] and, presumably, their earlier predecessor state, [[Funan Kingdom|Funan]].

The vast majority of Khmer speakers speak Central Khmer, the dialect of the central plain where the Khmer are most heavily concentrated. Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, and that of the remote Cardamom mountains, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, two distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the [[Khmer Empire]]. The [[Northern Khmer dialect]] is spoken by the Khmer of the southern regions of [[Isan|Northeast Thailand]] and Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of the [[Khmer Krom|Khmer of Vietnam]]. 

Khmer is primarily an [[analytic language|analytic]], [[isolating language]]. There are no [[inflection]]s, [[conjugation (grammar)|conjugation]]s or [[grammatical case|case]] endings. Instead, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and auxiliary words are used to indicate [[Grammar|grammatical]] relationships. General word order is [[subject–verb–object]], and [[modifier (grammar)|modifier]]s follow the word they modify. [[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifier]]s appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

Khmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai, [[Burmese language|Burmese]], Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a [[tonal language]]. Words are [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]ed on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a [[minor syllable]]. The [[Khmer script]] is an [[abugida]] descended from the [[Brahmi script]] via the southern Indian [[Pallava script]]; its features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write [[consonant cluster|cluster]]s, and a division of consonants into two series with different [[inherent vowel]]s.

==Classification==
{{Main|Austroasiatic languages}}

Khmer is a member of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language family, the most archaic family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India.<ref name=DiffZide>Diffloth, Gerard & Zide, Norman.

==Geographic distribution and dialects==
[[File:Approximate Location of Khmer Dialects.png|thumb|280px|Approximate locations where various dialects of Khmer are spoken]]
Khmer is spoken by some 13 million people in [[Cambodia]], where it is the official language. It is also a second language for most of the minority groups and indigenous hill tribes there. Additionally there are a million speakers of Khmer native to southern [[Vietnam]] (1999 census)<ref>{{e18|khm|Central Khmer}}</ref> and 1.4 million in northeast [[Thailand]] (2006).<ref>{{e18|kxm|Northern Khmer}}</ref>

Khmer [[dialect]]s, although mutually intelligible, are sometimes quite marked. Notable variations are found in speakers from [[Phnom Penh]] (Cambodia's capital city), the rural [[Battambang Province|Battambang]] area, the areas of Northeast Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as [[Surin province]], the [[Cardamom Mountains]], and southern Vietnam.<ref name="SIDWELL">[http://people.anu.edu.au/~u9907217/languages/Khmer-Cambodian.html Khmer/Cambodian] Paul Sidwell.

Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a [[Khmer Krom]] speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native to [[Sisaket Province]] in Thailand.

The following is a classification scheme showing the development of the modern Khmer dialects.<ref name="Sidwell2009">Sidwell, Paul (2009).

*Middle Khmer
**Cardamom (Western) Khmer
**Central Khmer
***Surin (Northern) Khmer
***Standard Khmer and related dialects (including Khmer Krom)

'''Standard Khmer''', or '''Central Khmer''', the language as taught in Cambodian schools and used by the media, is based on the dialect spoken throughout the [[Geography of Cambodia#Central plain|Central Plain]],<ref name="HUFF"/> a region encompassed by the northwest and central provinces.

'''[[Northern Khmer dialect|Northern Khmer]]''' (called ''Khmer Surin'' in Khmer) refers to the dialects spoken by many in several border provinces of present-day northeast Thailand. After the fall of the Khmer Empire in the early 15th century, the Dongrek Mountains served as a natural border leaving the Khmer north of the mountains under the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of [[Lan Xang]]. The conquests of Cambodia by [[Naresuan|Naresuan the Great]] for [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] furthered their political and economic isolation from Cambodia proper, leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from the midpoint of the Middle Khmer period.<ref name=Bernon>[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/bernon1988khmer.pdf de Bernon, Olivier. "Khmer of Surin: Lexical Remarks". 1988.]</ref> This has resulted in a distinct accent influenced by the surrounding tonal languages [[Isan language|Lao]] and [[Thai language|Thai]], lexical differences, and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants. Syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}}, which has become silent in other dialects of Khmer, is still pronounced in Northern Khmer. Some linguists classify Northern Khmer as a separate but closely related language rather than a dialect.<ref name=Thomas>Thomas, David. 1990. "On the 'language' status of Northern Khmer." ''JLC'' 9.1:98-106</ref><ref name=SUW>[http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/24:1-26.pdf Phonetic variation of final trill and final palatals in Khmer dialects of Thailand] Suwilai, Premsrirat; Mahidol University; Mon-Khmer Studies 24:1-26; pg 1</ref>

'''[[Western Khmer]]''', also called Cardamom Khmer or Chanthaburi Khmer, is spoken by a very small, isolated population in the [[Cardamom Mountains|Cardamom mountain]] range extending from western Cambodia into eastern [[Central Thailand]]. Although little studied, is unique in that it maintains a definite system of [[Register (phonology)|vocal register]] that has all but disappeared in other dialects of modern Khmer.<ref name="DiffZide" />

'''Phnom Penh Khmer''' is spoken in the capital and surrounding areas. This dialect is characterized by merging or complete [[elision]] of syllables, considered by speakers from other regions to be a "relaxed" pronunciation. For instance, "Phnom Penh" will sometimes be shortened to "m'Penh". Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an "r" either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a [[consonant cluster]] (as in the English word "bread"). The "r", [[Alveolar trill|trilled]] or [[Alveolar tap|flapped]] in other dialects, is either pronounced as a [[uvular trill]] or not pronounced at all. This alters the quality of any preceding consonant, causing a harder, more emphasized pronunciation. Another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low-rising or "dipping" [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] much like the "hỏi" tone in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. For example, some people pronounce {{IPA|/trəj/}} ('fish') as {{IPA|[təj]}}: the {{IPA|/r/}} is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises, effectively doubling its length. Another example is the word {{IPA|/riən/}} ('study'), which is pronounced {{IPA|[ʀiən]}}, with the uvular "r" and the same intonation described above.<ref>{{cite book|title=Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand |author= William Allen A. Smalley|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago|isbn=0-226-76288-2}}</ref>

'''[[Khmer Krom]]''' or '''Southern Khmer''' is spoken by the indigenous Khmer population of the [[Mekong Delta]], formerly controlled by the Khmer Empire but part of Vietnam since 1698. Khmers are persecuted by the Vietnamese government for using their native language and, since the 1950s, have been forced to take Vietnamese names.<ref name=UNPC>Unrepresented Peoples and Nations Organization [http://www.unpo.org/members/7887 Khmer Krom Profile] Retrieved 19 June 2012</ref> Consequently, very little research has been published regarding this dialect. It has been generally influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent, tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical differences from Standard Khmer.<ref>Thach, Ngoc Minh.

'''[[Khmer Khe language|Khmer Khe]]''' is spoken in [[Siem Pang District]], [[Stung Treng Province]]

==Historical periods==
[[File:AncientKhmerScript.jpg|thumb|320px|A stone carved in Middle Khmer]]
[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] study of the Khmer language divides its history into four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian.<ref name="Sak">Sak-Humphry, Channy. [http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/sak-humphry1993syntax.pdf ''The Syntax of Nouns and Noun Phrases in Dated Pre-Angkorian Inscriptions'']. Mon Khmer Studies 22: 1-26.</ref> Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the language after its divergence from Proto-Mon–Khmer until the 9th century, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the [[Khmer Empire]] from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following the end of the Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonology]] and [[lexicon]]. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.<ref name="Sak" />

The following table shows the conventionally accepted historical stages of Khmer.<ref name="Sidwell2009"/>

Just as modern Khmer was emerging from the transitional period represented by Middle Khmer, Cambodia fell under the [[French protectorate of Cambodia|influence]] of [[France|French]] [[French colonial empire|colonialism]].<ref name=CBHP>{{cite book

This led to French becoming the language of higher education and the intellectual class.  Many native scholars in the early 20th century, led by a monk named [[Chuon Nath]], resisted the French influence on their language and championed Khmerization, using Khmer roots (and Pali and Sanskrit) to coin new words for modern ideas, instead of French.<ref name=CBHP/> Nath cultivated modern Khmer-language identity and culture, overseeing the translation of the entire Pali Buddhist canon into Khmer and creating the modern Khmer language dictionary that is still in use today, thereby ensuring that Khmer would survive, and indeed flourish, during the French colonial period.<ref name=CBHP/>

===Consonants===
{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center

|}

The voiceless plosives {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /c/, /k/}} may occur with or without [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] (as {{IPA|[p]}} vs. {{IPA|[pʰ]}}, etc.); this difference is contrastive before a vowel. However, the aspirated sounds in that position may be analyzed as sequences of two [[phoneme]]s: {{IPA|/ph/, /th/, /ch/, /kh/}}. This analysis is supported by the fact that [[infix]]es can be inserted between the stop and the aspiration; for example {{IPA|[tʰom]}} ('big') becomes {{IPA|[tumhum]}} ('size') with a nominalizing infix. When one of these plosives occurs initially before another consonant, aspiration is no longer contrastive and can be regarded as mere phonetic detail:<ref name="ELL">{{cite book|last=Minegishi|first=M|title=Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics|editor=Keith Brown|publisher=Elsevier|year=2006|edition=2|pages=4981–4984|chapter=Khmer}}</ref><ref name=SOAS>{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=JM|title=Classical Civilizations of South-East Asia: Key Papers from SOAS|editor=VI Braginskiĭ|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|chapter=The Structure of the Word in Old Khmer}}</ref> slight aspiration is expected when the following consonant is not one of {{IPA|/ʔ/, /b/, /d/, /r/, /s/, /h/}} (or /ŋ/ if the initial plosive is /k/).

The voiced plosives are pronounced as [[implosive consonant|implosive]]s {{IPA|[ɓ, ɗ]}} by most speakers, but this feature is weak in educated speech, where they become {{IPA|[b, d]}}.<ref>''International Encyclopedia of Linguistics'', OUP 2003, p. 356.</ref>

In syllable-final position, {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/ʋ/}} approach {{IPA|[ç]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} respectively.  The stops {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /c/, /k/}} are unaspirated and have [[no audible release]] when occurring as syllable finals. (As noted [[#Syllable structure|below]], the phonemes {{IPA|/b/, /d/, /r/, /s/}} do not occur as syllable finals in Standard Khmer.)

In addition, the consonants {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} occur occasionally in recent [[loan word]]s in the speech of Cambodians familiar with French and other languages. Other speakers may approximate them with natively occurring [[phoneme]]s, such as {{IPA|/k/}} for {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/ph/}} for {{IPA|/f/}}, and {{IPA|/s/}} for {{IPA|/ʃ/}} or {{IPA|/z/}}.

===Vowels===
Various authors have proposed slightly different analyses of the Khmer vowel system. This may be in part because of the wide degree of variation in pronunciation between individual speakers, even within a dialectal region.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/21736/1/jaas031010.pdf| title= On Takeo Dialects of Khmer: Phonology and World List| first=Makoto| last=Minegishi| year=1986| accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> The description below follows Huffman (1970).<ref name="HUFF"/> The number of vowel nuclei and their values vary between dialects; differences exist even between the Standard Khmer system and that of the Battambang dialect on which the standard is based.<ref name=Accoustic>Wayland, Ratree.

The vowel {{IPA|/ɔː/}} sometimes has a shorter pronunciation [ɔ] in [[#Stress|weak initial syllables]], but this is not considered distinctive. Most of the diphthongs are described as falling, except for {{IPA|/ŭə/}} and {{IPA|/ŏə/}}, which are sometimes rising. The starting points of the short diphthongs are slightly more [[open vowel|open]] than the corresponding monophthongs.

There are also some sequences with offglides (in some cases written with a single vowel symbol in the [[Khmer script]]) which are analyzed as vowel plus [[semivowel]] (/j/ or /ʋ/, where the latter tends to [w] in this position). These include: (with short monophthongs) {{IPA|/ɨʋ/}}, {{IPA|/əʋ/}}, {{IPA|/aj/}}, {{IPA|/aʋ/}}, {{IPA|/uj/}}; (with long monophthongs) {{IPA|/əːj/}}, {{IPA|/aːj/}}; (with long diphthongs) {{IPA|/iəj/}}, {{IPA|/iəʋ/}}, {{IPA|/ɨəj/}}, {{IPA|/aoj/}}, {{IPA|/uəj/}}.

===Syllable structure===
A Khmer [[syllable]] begins with a single consonant, or else with a [[consonant cluster|cluster]] of two, or rarely three, consonants. The only possible clusters of three consonants at the start of a syllable are {{IPA|/str/, /skr/}},<ref name=ppak>[http://www.panl10n.net/english/Outputs%20Phase%202/CCs/Cambodia/ITC/Papers/2007/0701/phonetic-and-phonological-analysis.pdf Phonetic and Phonological Analysis of Khmer]</ref> and (with aspirated consonants analyzed as two-consonant sequences) {{IPA|/sth/, /lkh/}}. There are 85 possible two-consonant clusters (including [pʰ] etc. analyzed as /ph/ etc.). All the clusters are shown in the following table, phonetically, i.e. with superscript ʰ marking either contrastive or non-contrastive aspiration (see [[#Consonants|above]]).

Slight vowel [[epenthesis]] occurs in the clusters consisting of a plosive followed by /ʔ/, /b/, /d/, in those beginning /ʔ/, /m/, /l/, and in the cluster /kŋ-/.

After the initial consonant or consonant cluster comes the syllabic [[nucleus (syllable)|nucleus]], which is one of the [[#Vowels|vowels]] listed above. This vowel may end the syllable or may be followed by a [[syllable coda|coda]], which is a single consonant. If the syllable is stressed and the vowel is short, there must be a final consonant. All consonants except {{IPA|/b/, /d/, /r/, /s/}} can appear as the coda (although final /r/ is heard in some dialects; see [[Northern Khmer dialect|Northern Khmer]]). For pronunciation differences in final position, see above under [[#Consonants|Consonants]].

A [[minor syllable]] (unstressed syllable preceding the main syllable of a word) has a structure of CV-, CrV-, CVN- or CrVN- (where C is a consonant, V a vowel, and N a nasal consonant). For the pronunciation of such syllables, see the following section.

===Stress===
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] in Khmer falls on the final syllable of a word.<ref name="Schiller">{{cite web| url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/schiller1994khmer.pdf | title= Khmer Nominalizing and Causitivizing Infixes| year=1994 | first=Eric| last= Schiller | publisher=University of Chicago| accessdate =2008-12-04}}</ref> Because of this predictable pattern, stress is non-[[phoneme|phonemic]] in Khmer (it does not distinguish different meanings).

Most Khmer words consist of either one or two syllables. In most native disyllabic words, the first syllable is a [[minor syllable|minor]] (fully unstressed) syllable. Such words have been described as ''sesquisyllabic'' (i.e. as having one-and-a-half syllables). The vowels in such syllables are usually short; in conversation they may be [[vowel reduction|reduced]] to {{IPA|[ə]}}, although in careful or formal speech, including on television and radio, they are clearly articulated. An example of such a word is {{lang|km|មនុស្ស}} ('person'), pronounced {{IPA|[mɔˈnuh]}}, or more casually {{IPA|[məˈnuh]}}.

There are also some disyllables in which the first syllable does not behave as a minor syllable, but takes [[secondary stress]]. Most such words are [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]], but some are single [[morpheme]]s (generally loanwords). An example is {{lang|km|ភាសា}} ('language'), pronounced {{IPA|[ˌpʰiəˈsaː]}}.

Words with three or more syllables, if they are not compounds, are mostly loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French. They are nonetheless adapted to Khmer stress patterns.<ref name=KhDict>Headley, Robert K.; Chhor, Kylin; Lim, Lam Kheng; Kheang, Lim Hak; Chun, Chen. 1977. ''Cambodian-English Dictionary''. Bureau of Special Research in Modern Languages. The Catholic University of America Press. Washington, D.C. ISBN 0-8132-0509-3</ref> Primary stress falls on the final syllable, with [[secondary stress]] on every second syllable from the end. Thus in a three-syllable word, the first syllable has secondary stress; in a four-syllable word, the second syllable has secondary stress; in a five-syllable word, the first and third syllables have secondary stress, and so on. Long polysyllables are not often used in conversation.

Compounds, however, preserve the stress patterns of the constituent words. Thus {{lang|km|សំបុកចាប}}, the name of a kind of cookie (literally 'bird's nest'), is pronounced {{IPA|[sɑmˌbok ˈcaːp]}}, with secondary stress on the second rather than the first syllable, because it is composed of the words {{IPA|[sɑmˈbok]}} ('nest') and {{IPA|[caːp]}} ('bird').

===Phonation and tone===
Khmer once had a [[phonation]] distinction in its vowels, but this now survives only in the most archaic dialect ([[Western Khmer dialect|Western Khmer]]).<ref name=DiffZide/> The distinction arose historically when vowels after Old Khmer voiced consonants became [[breathy voice]]d and diphthongized; for example {{IPA|*kaa, *ɡaa}} became {{IPA|*kaa, *ɡe̤a}}. When consonant voicing was lost, the distinction was maintained by the vowel ({{IPA|*kaa, *ke̤a}}); later the phonation disappeared as well ({{IPA|[kaː], [kiə]}}).<ref name=ELL/> These processes explain the origin of what are now called a-series and o-series consonants in the [[Khmer script]].

Although most Cambodian dialects are not [[tonal language|tonal]], colloquial Phnom Penh dialect has developed a tonal contrast (level versus peaking tone) to compensate for the [[elision]] of {{IPA|/r/}}.<ref name=ELL/>

===Intonation===
[[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] often conveys [[semantic]] context in Khmer, as in distinguishing [[declarative sentence|declarative statements]], questions and exclamations [the available grammatical means of making such distinctions are not always used, or may be ambiguous; for example, the final [[interrogative particle]] {{lang|km|ទេ}} {{IPA|/teː/}} can also serve as an emphasizing (or in some cases negating) particle].

The intonation pattern of a typical Khmer declarative phrase is a steady rise throughout followed by an abrupt drop on the last syllable.<ref name=ppak /> 
:{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំមិនចង់បានទេ}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{IPA|[↗kʰɲom mɨn caŋ baːn <nowiki>|</nowiki> ↘teː]}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ('I don't want it')

Other intonation contours signify a different type of phrase such as the "full doubt" interrogative, similar to [[yes-no question]]s in English. Full doubt interrogatives remain fairly even in tone throughout, but rise sharply towards the end.
:{{lang|km|អ្នកចង់ទៅលេងសៀមរាបទេ}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{IPA|[↗nea? caŋ <nowiki>|</nowiki> ↗tɨw leːŋ siəm riəp <nowiki>|</nowiki> ꜛteː]}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ('do you want to go to Siem Reap?')

Exclamatory phrases follow the typical steadily rising pattern, but rise sharply on the last syllable instead of falling.<ref name=ppak />
:{{lang|km|សៀវភៅនេះថ្លៃណាស់}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{IPA|[↗siəw pʰɨw nih<nowiki>|</nowiki> ↗tʰlaj <nowiki>|</nowiki> ꜛnah]}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ('this book is expensive!')

==Grammar==
{{Main|Khmer grammar}}

Khmer is primarily an [[analytic language]], with no [[inflection]]. There is some [[Morphological derivation|derivation]] by means of [[prefixes]] and [[infixes]], but this is not always productive in the modern language.<ref name = "cc">{{cite book|title=Colloquial Cambodian: A Complete Language Course |author= David Smyth|year=1995|publisher=Routledge (UK)|isbn=0-415-10006-2}}</ref> Basic word order is [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO); [[prepositions]] are used rather than postpositions;<ref>Huffman, Franklin. 1967. ''An outline of Cambodian Grammar''. PhD thesis, Cornell University.</ref> and the language is generally [[head-initial]] (modifiers follow the words they modify).

===Adjectives and adverbs===
[[Adjective]]s, [[demonstrative]]s and [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s follow the noun they modify. Adverbs likewise follow the verb.  Morphologically, adjectives and adverbs are not distinguished, with many words often serving either function. Similar to other languages of the region, intensity can be expressed by [[reduplication]].<ref name=msc>Huffman, F. E., Promchan, C., & Lambert, C.-R. T. (1970). ''Modern spoken Cambodian''. New Haven: Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-01315-9</ref>

:{{lang|km|ស្រីស្អាតនោះ}} {{IPA|/srəj sʔaːt nuh/}} (girl pretty that) = 'that pretty girl'
:{{lang|km|ស្រីស្អាតស្អាត}} {{IPA|/srəj sʔaːt sʔaːt/}} (girl pretty pretty) = 'pretty girls'

As Khmer sentences rarely use a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], adjectives are also employed as verbs. [[Comparative]]s are expressed using the word {{lang|km|ជាង}} {{IPA|/ciəŋ/}}: "A X {{IPA|/ciəŋ/}} [B]" (A is more X [than B]).  The most common way to express [[superlative]]s is with {{lang|km|ជាងគេ}} {{IPA|/ciəŋ keː/}}: "A X {{IPA|/ciəŋ keː/}}" (A is the most X).<ref name=msc/>

===Nouns and pronouns===
Khmer [[noun]]s have no [[grammatical gender]] or [[grammatical number|singular/plural]] inflections. There are no [[Article (grammar)|articles]], but indefiniteness is often expressed by the word for "one" following the noun.  Plurality can be marked by [[postnominal]] particles, numerals, or reduplication of a following adjective, which, although similar to intensification, is usually not ambiguous due to context.<ref name=msc/>

:{{lang|km|ឆ្កែពីរ}} {{IPA|/cʰkae piː/}} (dog two) = 'two dogs'
:{{lang|km|ឆ្កែធំ}} {{IPA|/cʰkae tʰom/}} (dog large) = 'large dog'
:{{lang|km|ឆ្កែធំធំ}} {{IPA|/cʰkae tʰom tʰom/}} (dog large large) = 'large dogs' or 'a very large dog'

[[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifying particles]] are used after numerals, but are not always obligatory as they are in [[Thai grammar|Thai]] or [[Chinese classifier|Chinese]], for example.

[[Pronoun]]s are subject to a complicated system of social register, the choice of pronoun depending on the perceived relationships between speaker, audience and referent (see [[#Social registers|Social registers]] below). Kinship terms, nicknames and proper names are often used as pronouns (including for the first person) among intimates. Subject pronouns are frequently [[null-subject language|dropped]] in colloquial conversation.<ref name=msc/>

===Verbs===
As is typical of most East Asian languages,<ref>[http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-927311-1.pdf East and Southeast Asian Languages: A First Look] at Oxford University Press Online</ref> Khmer verbs do not inflect at all; [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] can be expressed using particles (such as កំពុង {{IPA|/kəmpuŋ/}}, placed before a verb to express [[continuous aspect]]) and adverbs (such as "yesterday", "earlier", "tomorrow"), or may be understood from context. [[Serial verb construction]] is quite common.

[[Negation]] is achieved by putting មិន {{IPA|/mɨn/}} before the verb and ទេ {{IPA|/teː/}} at the end of the sentence or clause. In normal speech, verbs can also be negated without the need for a final particle, by placing ឥត {{IPA|/ʔɑt/~/ʔət/}} before them.<ref name=msc/>
:{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំជឿ}} {{IPA|/kɲom cɨə/}} ('I believe')
:{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំមិនជឿទេ}} {{IPA|/kɲom mɨn cɨə teː/}} ('I don't believe')
:{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំឥតជឿ}} {{IPA|/kɲom ʔɑt cɨə/}} ('I don't believe')

===Numerals===
{{Main|Khmer numerals}}
Counting in Khmer is based on a [[biquinary]] system (the numbers from 6 to 9 have the form "five one", "five two", etc.) However, the words for multiples of ten from 30 to 90 are not related to the basic Khmer numbers, but are probably borrowed from Thai. The [[Khmer script]] has its own versions of the [[Arabic numerals]].
 
The principal number words are listed in the following table, which gives Western and Khmer digits, Khmer spelling and IPA transcription.<ref name = "cc"/>

Intermediate numbers are formed by compounding the above elements. Powers of ten are denoted by {{lang|km|រយ}} {{IPA|/rɔːj/}} (100), {{lang|km|ពាន់}} {{IPA|/pŏən/}} (1,000), {{lang|km|ម៉ឺន}} {{IPA|/məɨn/}} (10,000), {{lang|km|សែន}} {{IPA|/saen/}} (100,000), {{lang|km|លាន}} {{IPA|/liən/}} (1,000,000) and {{lang|km|កោដិ}} {{IPA|/kaot/}} (10,000,000).

[[Ordinal number]]s are formed by placing the particle {{lang|km|ទី}} {{IPA|/tiː/}} before the corresponding cardinal number.

==Social registers==
Khmer employs a system of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] in which the speaker must always be conscious of the social status of the person spoken to. The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for "to eat" used between intimates or in reference to animals is {{IPA|/siː/}}. Used in polite reference to commoners, it's {{IPA|/ɲam/}}. When used of those of higher social status, it's {{IPA|/pisa/}} or {{IPA|/tɔtuəl tiən/}}. For monks the word is {{IPA|/cʰan/}} and for royals, {{IPA|/saoj/}}.<ref name ="cl"/> Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.<ref name=KhDict/>

[[File:Be Cambodian Embassy 03.jpg|thumb|right|180px|An example of modern Khmer script at the Cambodian Embassy in [[Berlin]]]]
Khmer is written with the Khmer script, an [[abugida]] developed from the [[Pallava script]] of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared.<ref name="OMNI">[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/khmer.htm Khmer Alphabet at Omniglot.com]</ref> Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, above or below the consonant they follow, the Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to [[Thai script|Thai]] and [[Lao script|Lao]], both of which were based on the Khmer system. The Khmer script is also distantly related to the [[Mon script]], the ancestor of the modern [[Burmese script]].<ref name="OMNI"/> [[Khmer numerals]], which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]]. Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.<ref name=UNCel>[http://www.un.org.kh/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=469:celebration-of-international-literacy-day-2011-supporting-cambodias-development-efforts&catid=43:latest-press-releases&Itemid=76 United Nations in Cambodia "Celebration of International Literacy Day, 2011"]</ref>

Consonant symbols in Khmer are divided into two groups, or series. The first series carries the inherent vowel {{IPA|/ɑː/}} while the second series carries the inherent vowel {{IPA|/ɔː/}}. The Khmer names of the series, {{IPA|/aʔkʰosaʔ/}} ('voiceless') and {{IPA|/kʰosaʔ/}} ('voiced'), respectively, indicate that the second series consonants were used to represent the voiced phonemes of Old Khmer.  As the voicing of stops was lost, however, the contrast shifted to the phonation of the attached vowels which, in turn, evolved into a simple difference of vowel quality, often by [[Vowel breaking|diphthongization]].<ref name=ELL/>  This process has resulted in the Khmer alphabet having two symbols for most consonant phonemes and each vowel symbol having two possible readings, depending on the series of the initial consonant:<ref name="HUFF"/>
