Erfurt was the junction of important trade routes: the<space/><link><target>Via Regia</target></link><space/>was one of the most used eastwest roads between France and Russia (via<space/><link><target>Frankfurt</target></link>, Erfurt,<space/><link><target>Leipzig</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Wrocaw</target></link>) and another route in northsouth direction was the connection between the<space/><link><target>Baltic Sea</target></link><space/>ports (e. g.<space/><link><target>Lbeck</target></link>) and the potent upper Italian city-states like<space/><link><target>Venice</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Milan</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>During the 10th and 11th centuries both the<space/><link><target>Holy Roman Emperor</target><part>Emperor</part></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Electorate of Mainz</target></link><space/>held some privileges in Erfurt. The German kings had an important monastery on Petersberg hill and the Archbishops of Mainz collected taxes from the people. Around 1100, some people became free citizens by paying the annual &quot;Freizins&quot; (liberation tax), which marks a first step in becoming an independent city. During the 12th century, as a sign of more and more independence, the citizens built a city wall around Erfurt (in the area of today's Juri-Gagarin-Ring). After 1200, independence was fulfilled and a city council was founded in 1217; the town hall was built in 1275. In the following decades, the council bought a city-owned territory around Erfurt which consisted at its height of nearly 100 villages and castles and even another small town (<link><target>Smmerda</target></link>). Erfurt became an important regional power between the<space/><link><target>Landgraviate of Thuringia</target></link><space/>around, the Electorate of Mainz to the west and the<space/><link><target>Electorate of Saxony</target></link><space/>to the east. Between 1306 and 1481, Erfurt was allied with the two other major Thuringian cities (<link><target>Mhlhausen</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Nordhausen</target></link>) in the Thuringian City Alliance and the three cities joined the<space/><link><target>Hanseatic League</target></link><space/>together in 1430. A peak in economic development was reached in the 15th century, when the city had a population of 20,000 making it to one of the largest in Germany. Between 1432 and 1446, a second and higher city wall was established. In 1483, a first city fortress was built on<space/><link><target>Cyriaksburg</target></link><space/>hill in the southwestern part of the town.</paragraph><paragraph>The Jewish community of Erfurt was founded in the 11th century and became, together with<space/><link><target>Mainz</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Worms, Germany</target><part>Worms</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Speyer</target></link>, one of the most influential in Germany.

Before the persecution, a wealthy Jewish merchant buried his property in the basement of his house. In 1998, this treasure was found during construction works.

Some buildings of this old university are extant or restored in the &quot;Latin Quarter&quot; in the northern city centre (like Collegium maius, student dorms &quot;Georgenburse&quot; and others, the hospital and the church of the university).

His<space/><link><target>Protestant Reformation</target></link><space/>found its way to Erfurt in 1521. In 1530, the city became one of the first in Europe to be officially bi-confessional with the<space/><link><target>Hammelburg</target></link><space/>Treaty. It kept that status through all the following centuries. The later 16th and the 17th century brought a slow economic decline of Erfurt. Trade shrunk, the population was falling and the university lost its influence. The city's independence was endangered. In 1664, the city and surrounding area were brought under the dominion of the Electorate of Mainz and the city lost its independence. The Electorate built a huge fortress on Petersberg hill between 1665 and 1726 to control the city and instituted a governor to rule Erfurt.</paragraph><paragraph>During the late 18th century, Erfurt saw another cultural peak. Governor<space/><link><target>Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg</target></link><space/>had close relations with<space/><link><target>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Friedrich Schiller</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Johann Gottfried Herder</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Christoph Martin Wieland</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Wilhelm von Humboldt</target></link>, who often visited him at his court in Erfurt.</paragraph><paragraph>Erfurt became part of the<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Prussia</target></link><space/>in 1802. In the<space/><link><target>Capitulation of Erfurt</target></link><space/>the city, its 12,000 defenders, and the Petersberg fortress were handed over to the French on 16 October 1806. The city became part of the<space/><link><target>First French Empire</target></link><space/>in 1806 as<space/><link><target>Principality of Erfurt</target></link>. In 1808, the<space/><link><target>Congress of Erfurt</target></link><space/>was held with<space/><link><target>Napoleon</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Alexander I of Russia</target></link><space/>visiting the city. Erfurt was returned to Prussia in 1815 after the end of the<space/><link><target>Napoleonic Wars</target></link>.

During the following years, many factories in different sectors were founded. One of the biggest was the &quot;Royal Gun Factory of<space/><link><target>Prussia</target></link>&quot; in 1862. After German Unification in 1871, Erfurt moved from the southern border of Prussia to the centre of Germany, so that the fortifications of the city were not needed anymore. The demolition of the city fortifications in 1873 led to a construction boom in Erfurt, because it was now possible to build in the area formerly occupied by the city walls and beyond. Many public and private buildings emerged and the infrastructure (e. g. tramway, hospitals, schools) improved rapidly. The number of inhabitants grew from 40,000 around 1870 to 130,000 in 1914 and the city expanded in all directions.</paragraph><paragraph>The &quot;<link><target>Erfurt Program</target></link>&quot; was adopted by the<space/><link><target>Social Democratic Party of Germany</target></link><space/>during its congress at Erfurt in 1891.</paragraph><paragraph>Between the wars, the city kept growing. Housing shortages were fought with building programmes and social infrastructure was broadened according to the welfare policy in the<space/><link><target>Weimar Republic</target></link>. The<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link><space/>between 1929 and 1932 led to a disaster for Erfurt, nearly one out of three became unemployed. Conflicts between far-left and far-right oriented milieus increased and many inhabitants supported the new Nazi government and<space/><link><target>Adolf Hitler</target></link>. Others, especially some communist workers, put up resistance against the new administration. In 1938, the new synagogue was destroyed during the<space/><link><target>Kristallnacht</target></link>. Jews lost their property and emigrated or were deported to<space/><link><target>Nazi concentration camps</target></link><space/>(together with many communists). In 1914, the company<space/><italics><link><target>Topf and Sons</target></link></italics><space/>began the manufacture of crematoria later becoming the market leader in this industry.

In 1952, the<space/><link><target>States of Germany</target><part>Lnder</part></link><space/>in the GDR were dissolved in favour of forced centralization under the socialist regime. Erfurt then became the capital of a new &quot;<link><target>Erfurt (Bezirk)</target><part>Bezirk</part></link>&quot;. In 1953, the<space/><link><target>Hochschule</target></link><space/>of education was founded, followed by the Hochschule of medicine in 1954, the first academical institutions in Erfurt since the closing of the university in 1816.</paragraph><paragraph>On 19 March 1970, the East and West German heads of government<space/><link><target>Willi Stoph</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Willy Brandt</target></link><space/>met in Erfurt, the first such meeting since the division of Germany. During the 1970s and 1980s, as the economic situation in GDR worsened, many old buildings in city centre decayed, while the government fought against the housing shortage by building large<space/><link><target>Plattenbau</target></link><space/>settlements in the periphery.

At the same time, many buildings were redeveloped and the infrastructure improved massively. In 1994, the new university was opened, as was the Fachhochschule in 1991.

The population of Erfurt was 21,000 in 1820, and increased to 32,000 in 1847, the year of rail connection as industrialization began. In the following decades Erfurt grew up to 130,000 at the beginning of World War I and 190,000 inhabitants in 1950. A maximum was reached in 1988 with 220,000 persons. The bad economic situation in eastern Germany after the reunification resulted in a decline in population, which fell to 200,000 in 2002 before rising again to 206,000 in 2011. The average growth of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.68% p. a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Erfurt. It occurred after reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders.</paragraph><paragraph>The birth deficit was 200 in 2012, this is -1.0 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4).

In 1873, the city's fortifications were demolished and it became possible to build houses in the area in front of the former city walls. In the following years, Erfurt saw a construction boom. In the northern area (districts Andreasvorstadt, Johannesvorstadt and Ilversgehofen)<space/><link><target>tenement</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>for the factory workers were built whilst the eastern area (Krmpfervorstadt and Daberstedt) featured apartments for white-collar workers and clerks and the southwestern part (Lbervorstadt and Brhlervorstadt) with its beautiful valley landscape saw the construction of villas and mansions of rich factory owners and notables. During the interwar period, some settlements in<space/><link><target>Bauhaus</target></link><space/>style were realized, often as housing cooperatives. After World War II and over the whole GDR period, housing shortages remained a problem even though the government started a big apartment construction programme.

The current international glass and steel architecture is dominant among most larger new buildings like the Federal Labour Court of Germany (1999), the new opera house (2003), the new main station (2007), the university library, the fair hall and the<space/><link><target>Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann</target></link><space/>ice rink.</paragraph><paragraph><table style='border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid grey;'><tablerow><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:Ernst-Toller-Strae Erfurt.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>Grnderzeit tenements in Johannesvorstadt district</tablecell><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:Brunnen Jacobsenviertel Erfurt.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>Cubistic fountain in a Bauhaus housing complex</tablecell><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:Lutherkirche Erfurt2.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>Art Deco Luther's Church</tablecell><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:ThringerLandtag.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>Entrance of the Thuringian parliament</tablecell></tablerow><tablerow><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:Audimax-Foyer der Universitt Erfurt.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>Lobby of the university main building</tablecell><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:Statue Johannesplatz Erfurt.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>GDR architecture in Johannesplatz district</tablecell><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:2011-05-19-bundesarbeitsgericht-by-RalfR-24.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>Inner yard of the Federal Labour Court</tablecell></tablerow></table></paragraph><heading level='2'>Economy and infrastructure</heading><paragraph>During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved: the unemployment rate declined from 21% in 2005 to 9% in 2013.

There is also growing of fruits (like apples, strawberries and sweet cherries), vegetables (e.g. cauliflowers, potatoes, cabbage and sugar beets) and grain on more than 60% of the municipal territory.</paragraph><paragraph>Industrialization in Erfurt started around 1850. Until World War I, many factories were founded in different sectors like engine building, shoes, guns, malt and later electro-technics, so that there was no industrial monoculture in the city. After 1945, the companies were nationalized by the<space/><link><target>East Germany</target><part>GDR</part></link><space/>government, which led to the decline of some of them. After reunification, nearly all factories were closed, either because they failed to successfully adopt to a free market economy or because the German government sold them to west German businessmen who closed them to avoid competition to their own enterprises.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">July 2014</arg></template><space/>However, in the early 1990s the federal government started to subsidize the foundation of new companies. It still took a long time before the economic situation stabilized around 2006. Since this time, unemployment has decreased and overall, new jobs were created. Today, there are many small and medium-sized companies in Erfurt with electro-technics, semiconductors and photovoltaics in focus. Building engines, the production of food (i.e. a big noodle factory), the<space/><link><target>Braugold</target></link><space/>brewery, and<space/><link><target>Born Feinkost</target></link><space/>a producer of Thuringian mustard, are still an important industries.</paragraph><paragraph>Erfurt is an<space/><italics>Oberzentrum</italics><space/>(which means &quot;supra-centre&quot; according to<space/><link><target>Central place theory</target></link>) in German regional planning. Such centres are always hubs of service businesses and public services like hospitals, universities, research, trade fairs, retail etc. Additionally, Erfurt is the capital of the federal state of Thuringia, so that there are many institutions of administration like all the Thuringian state ministries and some nationwide authorities. Typical for Erfurt are the logistic business with many distribution centres of big companies, the<space/><link><target>Erfurt Trade Fair</target></link><space/>and the media sector with<space/><link><target>KiKa</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk</target><part>MDR</part></link><space/>as public broadcast stations. A growing industry is tourism, due to the various historical sights of Erfurt. There are 4,800 hotel beds and (in 2012) 450,000 overnight visitors spent a total of 700,000 nights in hotels. Nevertheless, most tourists are one-day visitors from Germany. The Christmas Market in December attracts some 2,000,000 visitors each year.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Transport</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Erfurt Hbf Front.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>Main railway station</part></link></paragraph><heading level='4'>By rail</heading><paragraph>Erfurt is connected by the<space/><link><target>Thuringian Railway</target></link><space/>to<space/><link><target>Leipzig</target></link><space/>in the east and to<space/><link><target>Frankfurt</target></link>/<link><target>Kassel</target></link><space/>in the west.
