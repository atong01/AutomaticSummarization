Watanabe was one influenced by American<space/><link><target>comics</target></link>, which were beginning to gain popularity in Japan, and as such began to make his characters look stronger and &quot;cool.&quot; The character creation process, however, has for most of the franchise's history been collaborative and reliant on conversation and brainstorming.<extension extension_name='ref' name="famitsu"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.famitsu.com/news/201307/05035910.html</arg><arg name="publisher">[[Famitsu]]</arg><arg name="date">July 5, 2013</arg><arg name="accessdate">February 12, 2014</arg><arg name="script-title">ja:『デジモンワールド リ：デジタイズ デコード』イラストレーターインタビュー！</arg><arg name="language">Japanese</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Eponymous creatures</heading><paragraph>Digimon hatch from types of eggs which are called<space/><template><target>nihongo</target><arg>Digi-Eggs</arg><arg>デジタマ</arg><arg>Dejitama</arg></template>.

(This type of Digi-Egg was also featured as a major object throughout season 2 as a way of Digivolution available only to certain characters at certain points throughout the season.) They age via a process called &quot;Digivolution&quot; which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of<space/><link><target>intelligence</target></link><space/>and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. In some cases, as in the first series, the DigiDestined (known as the 'Chosen Children' in the original Japanese) had to find some special items such as crests and tags so the Digimon could digivolve into further stages of evolution known as<space/><italics>Ultimate</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Mega</italics><space/>in the dub.</paragraph><paragraph>The first Digimon anime introduced the Digimon<space/><link><target>Biological life cycle</target><part>life cycle</part></link>: They age in a similar fashion to real organisms, but do not die under normal circumstances because they are made of reconfigurable data, this data can be seen all throughout the show.

The Digimon pet had several evolution capabilities and abilities too, so many owners had different Digimon.

Its premise is a group of 7 kids who, while at summer camp, travel to the Digital World,<extension extension_name='ref' name="clements2006"></extension><space/>inhabited by creatures known as Digital Monsters, or Digimon, learning they are chosen to be &quot;<link><target>DigiDestined</target></link>&quot; (&quot;Chosen Children&quot; in the Japanese version) to save both the Digital and Real World from evil. Each Kid was given a Digivice which selected them to be transported to the DigiWorld and was destined to be paired up with a<space/><link><target>Chosen Digimon</target><part>Digimon Partner</part></link>, such as Tai being paired up with<space/><link><target>Agumon</target></link><space/>and Matt with<space/><link><target>Gabumon</target></link>. The children are helped by a mysterious man/digimon named Gennai, who helps them via hologram. The Digivices help their Digimon allies to Digivolve into stronger creatures in times of peril. The Digimon usually reached higher forms when their human partners are placed in dangerous situations, such as fighting the evil forces of Devimon, Etemon and Myotismon in their Champion forms. Later, each character discovered a crest that each belonged to a person; Tai the Crest of Courage, Matt the Crest of Friendship, Sora the Crest of Love, Izzy the Crest of Knowledge, Mimi the Crest of Sincerity, Joe the Crest of Reliability, T.K. the Crest of Hope, and later Kari the Crest of Light which allowed their Digimon to digivolve into their Ultimate forms. The group consisted of seven original characters:<space/><link><target>Taichi &quot;Tai&quot; Kamiya</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Yamato &quot;Matt&quot; Ishida</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Sora Takenouchi</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Koushiro &quot;Izzy&quot; Izumi</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Mimi Tachikawa</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Joe Kido</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Takeru &quot;T.K.&quot; Takaishi</target></link>.

Three years later, with most of the original DigiDestined now in high school at age fourteen, the Digital World was supposedly secure and peaceful. However, a new evil has appeared in the form of the Digimon Emperor (Digimon Kaiser) who as opposed to previous enemies is a human just like the DigiDestined. The Digimon Emperor has been enslaving Digimon with Dark Rings and Control Spires and has somehow made regular Digivolution impossible. However, five set Digi-Eggs with engraved emblems had been appointed to three new DigiDestined along with T.K. and Kari, two of the DigiDestined from the previous series. This new evolutionary process, dubbed Armor Digivolution helps the new DigiDestined to defeat evil lurking in the Digital World. Eventually, the DigiDestined defeat the Digimon Emperor, more commonly known as<space/><link><target>List of Digimon Adventure characters#Ken Ichijouji</target><part>Ken Ichijouji</part></link><space/>on Earth, only with the great sacrifice of Ken's own Digimon, Wormmon. Just when things were thought to be settled, new Digimon enemies made from the deactivated Control Spires start to appear and cause trouble in the Digital World. To atone for his past mistakes, Ken joins the DigiDestined, being a DigiDestined himself, with his Partner<space/><link><target>Wormmon</target></link><space/>revived to fight against them. They soon save countries including France and Australia from control spires and defeat MaloMyotismon (BelialVamdemon), the digivolved form of Myotismon (Vamdemon) from the previous series. They stop the evil from destroying the two worlds, and at the end, every person on Earth gains their own Digimon partner.</paragraph><heading level='3'><italics>Digimon Tamers</italics></heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Digimon Tamers</arg></template>The third Digimon series, which began airing on April 1, 2001, is set largely in a &quot;real world&quot; where the<space/><italics>Adventure</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Adventure 02</italics><space/>series are television shows, and where Digimon game merchandise (based on actual items) become key to providing power boosts to real Digimon which appear in that world.

Some of the changes in this series include the way the Digimon digivolve with the introduction of Biomerge-Digivolution and the way their &quot;Digivices&quot; work. In this series, the Tamers can slide game cards through their &quot;Digivices&quot; and give their Digimon partners certain advantages, as in the card game. This act is called &quot;Digi-Modify&quot; (Card Slash in the Japanese version).

After finding the ten spirits of the Legendary Warriors and defeating Mercurymon, Grumblemon, Ranamon, and Arbormon, they finally end up fighting Cherubimon hoping to foil his effort to dominate the Digital World. After the defeat of Cherubimon, the Digidestined find they must face an even greater challenge as they try to stop the Royal KnightsDynasmon and Crusadermonfrom destroying the Digital World and using the collected data to revive the original ruler of the Digital World: the tyrannical Lucemon. Ultimately the Digidestined fail in preventing Lucemon from reawakening but they do manage to prevent him from escaping into the Real World.

The story focuses on the challenges faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (&quot;Digital Accident Tactics Squad&quot;), an organization created to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from the rest of mankind, and secretly solve any Digimon-related incidents occurring on Earth.

The English version was dubbed by<space/><link><target>Studiopolis</target></link><space/>and it premiered on the<space/><link><target>Jetix</target></link><space/>block on<space/><link><target>Toon Disney</target></link><space/>on October 1, 2007. Digivolution in<space/><italics>Data Squad</italics><space/>requires the human partner's DNA (&quot;Digital Natural Ability&quot; in the English version and &quot;Digisoul&quot; in the Japanese version) to activate, a strong empathy with their Digimon and a will to succeed. 'Digimon Savers' also introduces a new form of digivolving called Burst Mode which is essentially the level above Mega (previously the strongest form a digimon could take). Like previously in Tamers, this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed, originally in Japan, at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties from ages 16 to 21. Because of that, along with the designs, the anime being heavily edited and localized for western US audiences like past series, and the English dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower TV-Y7-FV rating just like past dubs, Studiopolis dubbed the anime on Jetix with far more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage. This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization (Marcus Damon as opposed to the Japanese Daimon Masaru), cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining). Despite all that, the setting of the country was still in Japan and the characters were Japanese in the dub. This series was the first to show any Japanese cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with American audiences (such as the manju), which were left unedited and used in the English dub. Also despite the heavy censorship and the English dub aimed at young children, some of the Digimon's attacks named after real weapons such as RizeGreymon's Trident Revolver are not edited and used in the English dub. Well Go USA released it on DVD instead of Disney.

The story follows a boy named Mikey Kud (Taiki Kudo in Japan) who, along with his friends, ends up in the Digital World where they meet Shoutmon and his Digimon friends. Wielding a digivice known as a Fusion Loader (Xros Loader in Japan), Mikey is able to combine multiple Digimon onto one to enhance his power, Shoutmon being the usual core of the combination, using a technique known as 'DigiFuse' (Digi-Xros in Japan). Forming Team Fusion Fighters (Team Xros Heart in Japan), Mikey, Shoutmon and their friends travel through the Digital World to liberate it from the evil Bagra Army, led by Bagramon(Lord Bagra in English), and Midnight, a shady group led by AxeKnightmon with Nene as a figurehead before joining the Fusion Fighters. The Fusion Fighters also finds themselves at odds with Blue Flare, led by Christopher Aonuma (Kiriha Anouma in Japan). The second arc of<space/><italics>Xros Wars</italics><space/>was subtitled<space/><italics>The Evil Death Generals and the Seven Kingdoms</italics>. It saw the main cast reshuffled with a new wardrobe while Angie (Akari in Japan) and Jeremy (Zenjiro in Japan) stay behind in the Human World; thus making Mikey, Christopher and Nene the lead protagonists as they set off to face the Seven Death Generals of the Bagra Army and AxeKnightmon's new pawn: Nene's brother Ewan (Yuu in Japan).

The series finale reintroduces the heroes of the previous five seasons as they all come together and help the current heroes in the final battle due to the fact that the DigiQuartz is essentially a tear in Space and Time, allowing all of the Digimon universes to converge.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-08-17/digimon-xros-wars-anime-to-get-2nd-year-this-october<space/></arg><arg name="title">Digimon Xros Wars Anime to Get 2nd Year This October - News<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Anime News Network<space/></arg><arg name="date">2011-08-17<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2012-08-15</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph><italics>Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time</italics><space/>was a nominee for the 2012<space/><link><target>International Emmy</target></link><space/>Kids Awards for &quot;Best Animation&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.iemmys.tv/news_item.aspx?id</arg><arg name="title">News - News - Item Detail - International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Iemmys.tv<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2013-04-22</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Films</heading><paragraph>There have been nine Digimon movies released in Japan.
