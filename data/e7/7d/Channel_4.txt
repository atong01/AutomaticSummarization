'''Channel 4''' is a British [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public-service]] television broadcaster which began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by [[Channel Four Television Corporation]], a public body established in 1990, coming into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the [[Wenvoe transmitting station|Wenvoe]] transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time.

The channel was established to provide a fourth television service to the United Kingdom in addition to the [[television licence]]-funded [[BBC]]'s two services and the single commercial broadcasting network, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

{{TOClimit|3}}

==History==

===Conception===
{{main|Fourth UK television service}}

Before Channel 4 and S4C, Britain had three terrestrial television services: [[BBC One|BBC1]], [[BBC Two|BBC2]], and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The [[Broadcasting Act 1980]] began the process of adding a fourth, and Channel 4, along with its [[S4C|Welsh counterpart]], was formally created by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1982. After some months of test broadcasts, it began scheduled transmissions on 2 November 1982.

The notion of a second commercial broadcaster in the United Kingdom had been around since the inception of ITV in 1954 and its subsequent launch in 1955; the idea of an "ITV2" was long expected and pushed for. Indeed, television sets sold throughout the 1970s and early 1980s had a spare channel called "ITV/IBA 2". Throughout [[History of ITV|ITV's history]] and until Channel 4 finally became a reality, a perennial dialogue existed between the [[General Post Office|GPO]], [[Government of the United Kingdom|the government]], the ITV companies and other interested parties, concerning the form such an expansion of commercial broadcasting would take. It was most likely politics which had the biggest impact in leading to a delay of almost three decades before the second commercial channel became a reality.<ref name="tbsseefour">{{cite web| url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/seefour/yes | title=Yes it's no | author=Russ J Graham | publisher=seefour by Electromusications from [http://www.transdiffusion.org/ Transdiffusion] | date = 11 September 2005 | accessdate=23 March 2007}}</ref> With what can crudely be summed up as a clash of ideologies between an expansion of ITV's [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] ethos and a [[public broadcasting|public service]] approach more akin to the BBC, it was ultimately something of a compromise that eventually led to the formation of Channel 4 as launched in 1982.

One clear benefit of the "late arrival" of the channel was that its frequency allocations at each transmitter had already been arranged in the early 1960s, when the launch of an ITV2 was highly anticipated.<ref name="tbsseefour"/> This led to very good coverage across most of the country and few problems of interference with other UK-based transmissions; a stark contrast to the problems associated with [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s launch fourteen and a half years later{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

===Wales===
{{Main|S4C}}
At the time the fourth service was being considered, a movement in Wales lobbied for the creation of dedicated service that would air Welsh-language programmes, then only catered for at 'off peak' times on [[BBC Wales]] and [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]]. The campaign was taken so seriously by [[Gwynfor Evans]], former president of [[Plaid Cymru]], that he threatened the government with a hunger strike were it not to honour the plans.<ref name="seefour_wales">{{cite web| url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/seefour/wales | title=A Channel for Wales | author=Dafydd Hancock | publisher=seefour by Electromusications from [http://www.transdiffusion.org/ Transdiffusion] | date=11 September 2005 | accessdate=23 March 2007}}</ref>

The result was that Channel 4 as seen by the rest of the United Kingdom would be replaced in Wales by ''[[Sianel Pedwar Cymru]] (S4C)'' (''Channel Four Wales''). Operated by a specially created [[S4C Authority|authority]], S4C would air programmes in Welsh made by HTV, the BBC, or independent companies. Initially limited frequency space meant that Channel 4 could not be broadcast alongside S4C, though some Channel 4 programmes would be aired at less popular times on the Welsh variant, a practice that carried on up until the closure of S4C's analogue transmissions in 2010.

Since then, carriage on digital [[cable television|cable]], [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[digital terrestrial]] has introduced Channel 4 to Welsh homes where it is now universally available.

===Launch and IBA control===
The first voice heard on Channel 4's opening day of Tuesday 2 November 1982 was that of [[continuity announcer]] [[Paul Coia]], who intoned, "Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be able to say to you: Welcome to Channel Four", before heading into a montage of clips from its programmes set to the station's signature tune, "[[Fourscore]]", written by [[Lord David Dundas]], which would form the basis of the station's jingles for its first decade. The first programme to air on the channel was the teatime game show ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', at 16:45 produced by [[Yorkshire Television]]; it is still running as of 2015. The first person to be seen on Channel 4 was [[Richard Whiteley]] with [[Ted Moult]] being the second. The first woman on the channel, contrary to popular belief, was not [[Carol Vorderman]] and was a lexicographer only ever identified as Mary. Whiteley opened the show with the words "As the countdown to a brand new channel ends, a brand new countdown begins." On its first day, Channel 4 also broadcast controversial soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'', which ran for 21 years.

On its launch, Channel 4 committed itself to providing an alternative to the existing channels, an agenda in part set out by its remit which required the provision of programming to minority groups.

In step with its remit, the channel became well received both by minority groups and the arts and cultural worlds during this period, especially under founding chief executive [[Jeremy Isaacs]], where the channel gained a reputation for programmes on the contemporary arts. Channel 4 co-commissioned [[Robert Ashley]]'s ground-breaking television opera ''Perfect Lives'',<ref>[http://www.robertashley.org/operas/perfectlives.htm Robert Ashley-Perfect Lives<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> which it premiered over several episodes in 1984. The channel often did not receive mass audiences for much of this period, however, as might be expected for a station focusing on minority interest. Channel 4 for many years had a poorer quality signal compared to other channels.{{where|date=February 2012}}{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Channel 4 also began the funding of independent films, such as the [[Merchant-Ivory]] [[docudrama]] ''[[The Courtesans of Bombay]]'', during this time.

In 1992, Channel 4 also faced its first libel case by [[Jani Allan]], a South African journalist, who objected to her representation in the documentary ''[[The Leader, His Driver and the Driver's Wife]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/901342.stm|title= BBC News – UK – Victims of the 'silver fox'|accessdate=20 August 2007 | date=29 August 2000}}</ref>

===Channel Four Television Corporation===
{{Main|Channel Four Television Corporation}}
After control of the station passed from the Channel Four Television Company to the [[Channel Four Television Corporation]] in 1993, a shift in broadcasting style took place. Instead of aiming for the fringes of society, it began to focus on the edges of the mainstream, and the centre of the mass market itself.{{citation needed|date=March 2007}} It began to show many US programmes in peak viewing time, far more than it had previously done. It gave such shows as ''[[Friends]]'' and ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' their UK premières.

In the early 2000s, Channel 4 began broadcasting reality formats such as ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' and obtained the rights to broadcast mass appeal sporting events like [[cricket]] and [[horse racing]]. This new direction increased ratings and revenues.

In addition, the corporation launched a number of new television channels through its new [[Channel Four Television Corporation#4Ventures|4Ventures]] offshoot, including [[Film4]], [[At the Races]], [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] and [[More4]].

Partially in reaction to its new 'populist' direction, the [[Communications Act 2003]] directed the channel to demonstrate innovation, experimentation and creativity, appeal to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society and to include programmes of an educational nature which exhibit a distinctive character.<ref name="overview"/>

On 31 December 2004, Channel 4 launched a new look and new idents in which the logo is disguised as different objects and the 4 can be seen in an angle.

Under the leadership of [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] founder [[Andy Duncan (executive)|Andy Duncan]], 2005 saw a change of direction for Channel 4's digital channels. Channel 4 made E4 [[free-to-air]] on [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|digital terrestrial television]], and launched a new free-to-air digital channel called More4. By October, Channel 4 had joined the Freeview consortium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=1225|title=DTG News: ITV and Channel 4 confirm Freeview stakes|accessdate=3 April 2007}}</ref> By July 2006, Film4 had also become a 'free to air' and restarted broadcasting on digital terrestrial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4sales.com/news/news-article.aspx?year=2006&id=21|title=CHANNEL4SALES : NEWS|accessdate=3 April 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070203111052/http://www.channel4sales.com/news/news-article.aspx?year=2006&id=21 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 3 February 2007}}</ref>

Venturing into radio broadcasting, 2005 saw Channel 4 purchase 51 per cent of shares in the now defunct [[Oneword]] radio station with UBC Media holding on to the remaining shares. New programmes such as the weekly, half-hour ''The Morning Report'' news programme were among some of the new content Channel 4 provided for the station, with the name [[#4radio|4Radio]] being used. As of early 2009, however, Channel 4's future involvement in radio remained uncertain.

On 2 November 2007, the station celebrated its twenty-fifth birthday. It showed the first episode of ''Countdown'', an anniversary ''Countdown'' special, as well as [[The Big Fat Quiz of the Year#The Big Fat Anniversary Quiz|a special edition of ''The Big Fat Quiz'']] and using the original multicoloured 1982–1996 blocks logo on presentation and idents using the [[Fourscore]] jingle throughout the day.

In November 2009, Channel 4 launched a week of [[3D television]], broadcasting selected programmes each night using [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[ColorCode 3D]] technology. The accompanying 3D glasses were distributed through [[Sainsbury's]] supermarkets.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/programmes/3d-week 3D Week – Channel 4<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

At 9pm on 29 September 2015, Channel 4 revamped its presentation for a fifth time. The refreshed look ditches the '4' logo, with it now only seen in print advertising and on the DOG on the HD channel. Instead, the logo is split into multiple variations the various blocks that it is made up of and these adorn the on-screen graphics for programme promotions and break bumpers. Four new idents, filmed by [[Jonathan Glazer]], are used to introduce programmes and feature various elements of the blocks within them. A fifth ident, in which hundreds of the blocks form what appears to be a clock face, is used to introduce the [[Channel 4 News]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3256085/Channel-4-unveils-new-brand-identity-splitting-familiar-33-year-old-logo-elemental-blocks-er-s-4.html|title=Missing something?

=== Future ===
Channel 4 has raised concerns over how it might finance its public service obligations after digital switch-over. However, some certainty lies in the announcement in April 2006 that Channel 4's digital switch-over costs would be paid for by licence fee revenues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/apr/25/citynews.broadcasting1|title=Media registration promo – Media – MediaGuardian.co.uk |accessdate=3 April 2007 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=26 April 2006}}</ref>

On 28 March 2007, Channel 4 announced plans to launch a music channel "4Music" as a joint venture with British media company [[EMAP]] which would include carriage on the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] platform. On 15 August 2008, [[4Music]] was launched across the UK.<ref>[http://www.4music.com/ Music News | New Music Videos | Celebrity News | Music | 4Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Recently{{When|date=February 2012}}, Channel 4 have announced interest in launching a high-definition version of Film4 on Freeview, to coincide with the launch of Channel 4 HD,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117962004/?categoryid=18&cs=1|title= Channel 4 maps music presence|accessdate=7 May 2007 | first=Steve | last=Clarke | date=28 March 2007 | work=Variety}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukfree.tv/fullstory.php?storyid=1107051220|title=Channel 4 to join YouTube and add music channel to – ukfree.tv – independent digital TV and switchover advice|accessdate=7 May 2007}}</ref> however the fourth HD slot was given to Channel 5 instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a159413/five-awarded-freeview-hd-licence.html|title=Five awarded Freeview HD licence|date=11 June 2009|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=27 June 2009}}</ref> Channel 4 has since acquired a 50% stake in EMAP's TV business for a reported £28 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a67199/channel-4-takes-50-percent-stake-in-emap-tv.html|title= Channel 4 takes 50% stake in Emap TV|date=23 July 2007|work=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Neil Wilkes}}</ref>

==Public service remit==
Channel 4 was established with, and continues to hold, a remit of public service obligations which it must fulfil. The remit changes periodically, as dictated by various broadcasting and communications acts, and is regulated by the various authorities Channel 4 has been answerable to; originally the IBA, then the [[Independent Television Commission|ITC]] and now [[Ofcom]].

The preamble of the remit as per the [[Communications Act 2003]] states that:

<blockquote>
"The public service remit for Channel 4 is the provision of a broad range of high quality and diverse programming which, in particular:
*    demonstrates innovation, experiment and creativity in the form and content of programmes;
*    appeals to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society;
*    makes a significant contribution to meeting the need for the licensed public service channels to include programmes of an educational nature and other programmes of educative value; and
*   exhibits a distinctive character."<ref name="overview">{{cite web| url=http://www.channel4.com/info/corporate/ | publisher=Channel 4 | title=Channel 4 Overview}}</ref><ref name="licence">{{cite web| url=http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/tv-broadcast-licences/current-licensees/channel-4/ | publisher=Ofcom | title=Channel 4 Licence}}</ref>
</blockquote>

The remit also involves an obligation to provide programming for schools,<ref name="schools">{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c4/c4v2attach.pdf |format=PDF |title=Channel 4 Broadcasting Licence |pages=[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c4/c4v2attach.pdf#page=13 Appendix 2, part 10 (Page 13)] |publisher=Ofcom |date=4 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130116072205/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c4/c4v2attach.pdf |archivedate=16 January 2013 }}</ref> and a substantial amount of programming produced outside of [[Greater London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c4/c4v2attach.pdf |format=PDF |title=Channel 4 Broadcasting Licence |pages=[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c4/c4v2attach.pdf#page=12 Appendix 2, part 8 (Page 12)] |publisher=Ofcom |date=4 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130116072205/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c4/c4v2attach.pdf |archivedate=16 January 2013 }}</ref>

==Carriage==
Channel 4 was carried from its beginning on analogue terrestrial, which was practically the only means of television broadcast in the United Kingdom at the time. It continued to be broadcast through these means until the changeover to [[digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom]] was complete. Since 1998, it has been universally available on digital terrestrial, and the [[Sky (UK & Ireland)|Sky]] platform (initially encrypted, though encryption was dropped on 14 April 2008 and is now free of charge and available on the [[Freesat]] platform) as well as having been available from various times in various areas, on analogue and digital cable networks.

Due to its special status as a public service broadcaster with a specific remit, it is afforded free carriage on the terrestrial platforms,<ref>[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/psb_review/digitalpsb/digitalpsb.pdf] Digital PSB, Public Service Broadcasting post Digital Switchover, section 1.1 {{wayback|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/psb_review/digitalpsb/digitalpsb.pdf |date=20130116072218 }}</ref> in contrast with other broadcasters such as ITV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itvplc.com/itv/news/releases/pr2005/2005-06-29/|title=Ofcom determination of financial terms for Channel 3 licences ITV plc response|accessdate=3 April 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061015170803/http://www.itvplc.com/itv/news/releases/pr2005/2005-06-29/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 15 October 2006}}</ref>

Channel 4 is also available outside the United Kingdom where it is widely available in Ireland, [[Switzerland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upc-cablecom.ch/en/b2c/tv/sender/sendervergleich.htm |title=Channels – Television &#124; upc cablecom |publisher=Upc-cablecom.ch |date= |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Here viewers receive the channel either on basic cable subscription services or premium services.

Channel 4 Ulster has been available in large parts of Ireland, especially border counties which have been able to receive terrestrial transmissions from Northern Ireland. Channel 4 Ulster has been carried on Irish cable networks since the station went on the air in 1982. 
S4C has been available as a terrestrial transmission from Wales in southern counties such as Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow.

From 4 December 2006 Channel 4 was officially available to Sky viewers in Ireland; some programmes, mainly imports, are not aired on this channel variant, due to Channel 4 not owning the relevant broadcast rights within the country.

Channel 4 allowed Internet users in the United Kingdom to watch Channel 4 live on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} However some programmes (mostly international imports) were not shown and this service no longer exists. Channel 4 is also provided by [[Virgin Mobile]]'s [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] mobile TV service which has the same restrictions as the Internet live stream had. Channel 4 is also carried by the Internet TV service [[TVCatchup]]<ref>{{cite web|title=TVCatchup - Channel 4|url=http://www.tvcatchup.com/watch.html?c=4#4|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref>  and was previously carried by [[Zattoo]] until the operator removed the channel from its platform.<ref>{{cite news|last=Andrews|first=Robert|title=ITV, C4, Five Also Get Yanked From Zattoo|url=http://paidcontent.org/2010/06/15/419-itv-c4-five-also-get-yanked-from-zattoo/|accessdate=8 January 2014|newspaper=paidContent|date=15 June 2010}}</ref>

Channel 4 also makes some of its programming available "on demand" via cable and the Internet through [[All 4]].

==Funding==
During the station's formative years, funding came from the ITV companies in return for their right to sell advertisements in their region on the fourth channel.

Nowadays it pays for itself in much the same way as most privately run commercial stations, i.e. through the sale of on-air advertising, programme sponsorship, and the sale of any programme content and merchandising rights it owns, such as overseas sales and video sales. For example, as of 2012 its total revenues were £925 million with 91% derived from sale of advertising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://annualreport.channel4.com/Downloads/Channel4_AR12_financials.pdf|title=Financial report and statements|year=2013|publisher=Channel 4|pages=112–114|accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref> It also has the ability to subsidise the main network through any profits made on the corporation's other endeavours, which have in the past included subscription fees from stations such as [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] and Film4 (now no longer subscription services) and its 'video-on-demand' sales. In practice, however, these other activities are loss-making, and are subsidised by the main network. According to Channel 4's last published accounts, for 2005, the extent of this cross-subsidy was some £30 million.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/about4/pdf/2005_C4_Complete.pdf 11419_11419_C4<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref>

The change in funding came about under the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] when the new corporation was afforded the ability to fund itself. Originally this arrangement left a 'safety net' guaranteed minimum income should the revenue fall too low, funded by large insurance payments made to the ITV companies. Such a subsidy was never required, however, and these premiums were phased out by government in 1998. After the link with ITV was cut, the cross-promotion which had existed between ITV and Channel 4 also ended.

In 2007 due to severe funding difficulties, the channel sought government help and was granted a payment of £14 million over a six-year period. The money would have come from the television licence fee and would have been the first time that money from the licence fee had been given to any broadcaster other than the BBC.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/jowell-challenges-channel-4-to-justify-16314m-of-public-funding-454035.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Jowell challenges Channel 4 to justify £14m of public funding | first=Ian | last=Burrell | date=21 June 2007 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> The plan was scrapped by The [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], [[Andy Burnham]], ahead of "broader decisions about the future framework of public service broadcasting".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7750501.stm | work=BBC News | title=Channel 4 switchover cash shelved | date=26 November 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>
The broadcasting regulator [[Ofcom]] released their review in January 2009 in which they suggested that Channel 4 would preferably be funded by "partnerships, joint ventures or mergers".<ref>[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/psb2_phase2/statement/ Ofcom | Ofcom's Second Public Service Broadcasting Review: Putting Viewers First<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Programming==
{{Main|Channel 4 programming}}

Channel 4 is a "publisher-broadcaster", meaning that it commissions or "buys" all of its programming from companies independent of itself, and was the first broadcaster in the United Kingdom to do so on any significant scale. This had the consequence of starting an industry of production companies that did not have to rely on owning an ITV licence to see their programmes air, though since Channel 4, external commissioning has become regular practise on the numerous stations that have launched since, as well as on the [[BBC]] and in ITV (where a quota of 25% minimum of total output has been imposed since the 1990 Broadcasting Act came into force). Ironically, having been the first British broadcaster to completely commission its programmes from third parties, Channel 4 was the last terrestrial broadcaster to outsource its transmission and playout operations (to [[Red Bee Media]]), after 25 years in-house.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/nov/14/channel4.television1 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Channel 4 outsources to Red Bee | first=Caitlin | last=Fitzsimmons | date=14 November 2007 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>

The requirement to obtain all content externally is stipulated in its licence.<ref name="licence"/> Additionally, Channel 4 also began a trend of owning the copyright and distribution rights of the programmes it aired, in a manner that is similar to the major Hollywood studios' ownership of television programs that they did not directly produce{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. Thus, although Channel 4 does not produce programmes, many are seen as belonging to it.

Channel 4 also pioneered the concept of ''stranded programming'', where seasons of programmes following a common theme would be aired and promoted together. Some would be very specific, and run for a fixed period of time; the ''[[4 Mation]]'' season, for example, showed innovative animation. Other, less specific strands, were (and still are) run regularly, such as ''[[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]]'', a strand of programming aimed at teenagers, on weekend mornings (and weekdays during school/college holidays); ''Friday Night Comedy'', a slot where the channel would pioneer its style of comedy commissions, ''4Music'' (now a separate channel) and ''[[4Later]]'', an eclectic collection of offbeat programmes transmitted to a cult audience in the early hours of the morning.

In its earlier years, ''[[Red triangle (Channel 4)|Red Triangle]]'' was the name given to the airing of certain risqué art-house films due to the use of a red triangle [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] in the upper right of the screen, dubbed as being pornographic by many of Channel 4's critics, while general broadcasting of films on the station for many years came under the banner of ''Film on Four'' prior to the launch of the ''FilmFour'' brand and station in the late 1990s.

The station's critically acclaimed news service, ''[[Channel 4 News]]'', is supplied by [[ITN]] while its long-standing investigative documentary, ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'', causes perennial media attention.

==Regions==
Channel 4 has, since its inception, broadcast identical programmes and [[continuity (broadcasting)|continuity]] throughout the United Kingdom (excluding Wales where it did not operate on analogue transmitters). At launch this made it unique, as both the BBC and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] had long established traditions of providing [[regional variations]] in their programming and announcements between transmitters in different areas of the country (although in the case of BBC2, variations have by and large tended to be limited to national idents as opposed to regional ones). In ITV's case, this was a consequence of its inherent federal structure (see [[ITV (TV network)#ITV companies: Past and Present|ITV companies]]). Since the launch of subsequent British television channels, Channel 4 has become typical in its lack of variations of this nature.

A few exceptions exist to this rule for programming and continuity: Ireland has a dedicated variant broadcast on Sky Ireland which omits programmes for which broadcast rights are not held in Ireland. For example, the series [[Glee (TV series)|''Glee'']] is not available on Channel 4 on Sky in Ireland.

Some of Channel 4's schools' programming (1980s/early '90s) were regionalised due to differences in curricula between different regions.<ref name="itvschools">{{Wayback |df=yes|date=20070706195104 |url=http://www.schoolstv.com/itvschoolson4_history.shtml?1 |title=SchoolsTV.com }} History of ITV Schools on Channel 4. Retrieved at the [[Internet Archive]], 16 February 2008</ref>

Part of Channel 4's remit covers the commissioning of programmes from outside London. Channel 4 has a dedicated director of nations and regions, [[Stuart Cosgrove]], who is based in a regional office in Glasgow. As his job title suggests, it is his responsibility to foster relations with independent producers based in areas of the United Kingdom (including Wales) outside of London.

Advertising on Channel 4 does contain regular variation: prior to 1993, when ITV was responsible for selling Channel 4's advertising, each regional ITV company would provide the content of advertising breaks, covering the same transmitter area as themselves, and these breaks were often unique to that area. After Channel 4 became responsible for its own advertising, it continued to offer advertisers the ability to target particular audiences and divided its coverage area into six parts coining the term 'LEMNUS' standing for "London, The East [and South] of England, The Midlands, The North of England, [[Ulster]] and Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4sales.com/data/macro_map|title=Channel 4's 'Macro Regions' for advertising, including a map | accessdate=27 September 2013}}</ref>

At present, Wales does not have its own advertising region, instead its viewers receive the southern region on digital platforms intentionally broadcast to the area, or the neighbouring region where terrestrial transmissions spill over into Wales. The Republic of Ireland shares its advertising region with Northern Ireland (referred to by Channel 4 as the 'Ulster Macro') with many advertisers selling products for Ireland here.<ref name="foursales">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4sales.com/advertising/regions/dublin |title=Channel 4's Dublin Sales Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080527224137/http://www.channel4sales.com:80/advertising/regions/dublin |archivedate=27 May 2008 }}</ref> [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] has an advertising variant for Ireland, although Northern Ireland receives the UK version of E4.<ref name="foursales"/> The six regions are also carried on satellite, cable and Digital Terrestrial.

[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and [[ITV Breakfast]] use a similar model to Channel 4 for providing their own advertising regions, despite also having a single national output of programming.

===Future possibility of regional news===
With [[ITV plc]] pushing for much looser requirements on the amount of regional news and other programming it is obliged to broadcast in its ITV regions, the idea of Channel 4 taking on a regional news commitment has been considered, with the corporation in talks with [[Ofcom]] and ITV over the matter.<ref name="c4moveregional">{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jul/03/channel4.ofcom | title=Channel 4 ponders move into regional news as ITV retreats | publisher="guardian.co.uk" | author=Leigh Holmwood | date=7 March 2008 | accessdate=30 September 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Channel 4 believe that a scaling-back of such operations on ITV's part would be detrimental to Channel 4's national news operation, which shares much of its resources with ITV through their shared news contractor [[ITN]]. At the same time, Channel 4 also believe that such an additional public service commitment would bode well in on-going negotiations with Ofcom in securing additional funding for its other public service commitments.<ref name="c4moveregional" />

==Channel 4 HD==
[[Image:Channel 4HD Logo.svg|thumb|170px|right]]
Previously, in the summer of 2006, Channel 4 ran a six-month closed trial of [[High-definition television|HDTV]], as part of the wider [[Digital television in the United Kingdom#Freeview HD|Freeview HD]] experiment via the [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|Crystal Palace transmitter]] to London and parts of the [[home counties]],<ref>[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/ddr/ddr_annexed.pdf Digital Dividend Review Annexes<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> including the use of [[Lost (2004 TV series)|''Lost'']] and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as part of the experiment, as US broadcasters such as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] already have an HDTV back catalogue.

On 10 December 2007, Channel 4 launched a [[high definition television]] [[simulcast]] of Channel 4 on [[Sky+ HD|Sky]]'s digital satellite platform, after Sky agreed to contribute toward the channel's satellite distribution costs. It was the first full-time high definition channel from a terrestrial UK broadcaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/dtg/press_releases/dtg_nmm_20100318.pdf|title=BBC HD strategy comes into focus as Five opts for BSkyB, not Freeview|publisher=New Media Markets|date=18 March 2010}}</ref>

On 31 July 2009, Virgin Media added Channel 4 HD on channel 146 (now on channel 142) as a part of the M pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a168390/c4-hd-coming-to-virgin-media-tomorrow.html|title=C4 HD coming to Virgin Media tomorrow|work=Digital Spy|date=30 July 2009}}</ref> On 25 March 2010 Channel 4 HD appeared on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] channel 52 with a placeholding caption, ahead of a commercial launch on 30 March 2010, coinciding with the commercial launch of Freeview HD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a210797/c4-hd-begins-freeview-test-transmissions.html|title=C4 HD begins Freeview test transmissions|work=Digital Spy|date=26 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reghardware.com/2010/03/30/freeview_hd_launches_gets_channel_4/|title=Freeview HD launches, gets Channel 4|publisher=Register Hardware|date=30 March 2010}}</ref> On 19 April 2011, Channel 4 HD was added to [[Freesat]] on channel 126.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joinfreesat.co.uk/channel-4-hd-finally-arrives-on-freesat/|title=Channel 4 HD Finally Arrives on Freesat|publisher=Join Freesat|date=19 April 2011}}</ref> As a consequence, the channel moved from being [[free-to-view]] to [[free-to-air]] on satellite during March 2011. With the closure of [[S4C|S4C Clirlun]] in Wales on 1 December 2012, on Freeview, Channel 4 HD launched in Wales on 2 December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/spectrum/spectrum-policy-area/projects/dtv/Amendment_to_Determination.pdf|title=Amendment to Determination|date=21 September 2012|work=Ofcom|accessdate=2 October 2012}}</ref>

The channel carries the same schedule as Channel 4, broadcasting programmes in HD when available, acting as a simulcast. Therefore, SD programming is broadcast upscaled to HD.

On 1 July 2014, Channel 4 +1 HD, a timeshift of Channel 4 HD, launched on Freeview channel 110.

==All 4==
{{Main|All 4}}

[[All 4]] is a [[video on demand]] service from Channel 4, launched in November 2006 as 4oD. The service offers a variety of programmes recently shown on Channel 4, [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]], [[More4]] or from their archives, though some programmes and movies are not available due to rights issues.

==Teletext services==
===4-Tel/FourText===
Channel 4 originally licensed an ancillary teletext service to provide schedules, programme information and features. The original service was called 4-Tel, and was produced by Intelfax, a company set up especially for the purpose. It was carried in the 400s on [[ORACLE (teletext)|Oracle]].<ref name="4Tel">{{cite web|url=http://teletext.mb21.co.uk/gallery/ancillary/c4-s4c/index.shtml|title=ANCILLARY TELETEXT SERVICES|accessdate=10 June 2007|last=Brown|first=Mike|publisher=MB21}}</ref> In 1993, with Oracle losing its franchise to [[Teletext Ltd]], 4-Tel found a new home in the 300s, and had its name shown in the header row. Intelfax continued to produce the service <ref name="4Tel" /> and in 2002 it was renamed FourText.

===Teletext on 4===
In 2003, Channel 4 awarded Teletext Ltd a ten-year contract to run the channel's ancillary teletext service, named Teletext on 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmgt.co.uk/news/809/Teletext+and+C4+sign+text+services+deal|title=Teletext and C4 sign text services deal|accessdate=10 June 2007|date=1 July 2003|publisher=Daily Mail and General Trust plc}}</ref> This has now ceased and Teletext is no longer available on Channel 4, ITV and Channel 5.

==Awards and nominations==
In January 2015, Channel 4 was nominated for the Responsible Media of the Year award at the [[British Muslim Awards]].<ref name="asianimage">{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.asianimage.co.uk/news/business/11745550.British_Muslim_Awards_2015_finalists_unveiled/|title=British Muslim Awards 2015 finalists unveiled|work= |location= |publisher=''Asian Image''|date=23 January 2015|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref>
