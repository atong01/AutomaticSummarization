Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the<space/><link><target>Independent Broadcasting Authority</target></link><space/>(IBA), the station is now owned and operated by<space/><link><target>Channel Four Television Corporation</target></link>, a public body established in 1990, coming into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the<space/><link><target>Wenvoe transmitting station</target><part>Wenvoe</part></link><space/>transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time.</paragraph><paragraph>The channel was established to provide a fourth television service to the United Kingdom in addition to the<space/><link><target>television licence</target></link>-funded<space/><link><target>BBC</target></link>'s two services and the single commercial broadcasting network,<space/><link><target>ITV (TV network)</target><part>ITV</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>TOClimit</target><arg>3</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><heading level='3'>Conception</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Fourth UK television service</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Before Channel 4 and S4C, Britain had three terrestrial television services:<space/><link><target>BBC One</target><part>BBC1</part></link>,<space/><link><target>BBC Two</target><part>BBC2</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>ITV (TV network)</target><part>ITV</part></link>. The<space/><link><target>Broadcasting Act 1980</target></link><space/>began the process of adding a fourth, and Channel 4, along with its<space/><link><target>S4C</target><part>Welsh counterpart</part></link>, was formally created by an<space/><link><target>Act of Parliament</target></link><space/>in 1982. After some months of test broadcasts, it began scheduled transmissions on 2 November 1982.</paragraph><paragraph>The notion of a second commercial broadcaster in the United Kingdom had been around since the inception of ITV in 1954 and its subsequent launch in 1955; the idea of an &quot;ITV2&quot; was long expected and pushed for.

Throughout<space/><link><target>History of ITV</target><part>ITV's history</part></link><space/>and until Channel 4 finally became a reality, a perennial dialogue existed between the<space/><link><target>General Post Office</target><part>GPO</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Government of the United Kingdom</target><part>the government</part></link>, the ITV companies and other interested parties, concerning the form such an expansion of commercial broadcasting would take.
