[[File:Cross2.svg|thumb|150px|A ''Greek cross'' (all arms of equal length) above a ''[[saltire]]'', a cross whose limbs are slanted]]
A '''cross''' is a geometrical figure consisting of two lines or bars perpendicular to each other, dividing one or two of the lines in half. The lines usually run vertically and horizontally; if they run obliquely, the design is technically termed a [[saltire]], although the arms of a saltire need not meet at right angles.

The cross is one of the most ancient human symbols, and has been used by many religions, most notably [[Christian cross|Christianity]]. It may be seen as a division of the world into [[classical element|four elements]] (Chevalier, 1997) or [[cardinal directions|cardinal points]], or alternately as the union of the concepts of [[divinity]], the vertical line, and the [[world]], the horizontal line (Koch, 1955).

== Etymology ==
The word ''[[:wikt:cross|cross]]'' comes ultimately from [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:crux|crux]]'', a Roman torture device used for [[crucifixion]], via [[Old Irish]] ''cros''. The word was introduced to English in the 10th century as the term for the instrument of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|torturous execution of Jesus]] as described in the [[New Testament]], gradually replacing the earlier word ''[[rood]]''. Crux is possibly derived from [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cross]</ref> According to the Catholic Encyclopedia cross does not come from ''crux'' but form the Latin ''curio'', "to torment".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_VtdidLC5eEC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=original+latin+word+for+cross&source=bl&ots=kj8AULnnYb&sig=Uqe5nFnzNfx2_44RVHqQ0-9FZ9Y&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=original%20latin%20word%20for%20cross&f=false]</ref>

== History ==

[[File:Raffi kojian-goshavank-IMG 0454.JPG|thumb|upright|A famous [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] [[khachkar]] at [[Goshavank]].]]
Due to the simplicity of the design (two crossing lines), cross-shaped incisions make their appearance from deep prehistory; as [[petroglyph]]s in European cult caves, dating back to the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]], and throughout prehistory to the [[Iron Age]].

Prior to 2000 B.C. the cross symbol, †, was already in use in ancient alphabets (Paleo-Hebrew [✗], Canaanite, Phoenician) as the letter 'Tau' ('Taw'/'Tav') which corresponds to the modern letter 'T' and meant 'Mark' (Its literal usage in the Torah denotes a wound). It is probably derived from two sticks crossed to mark a place similar to the Egyptian hieroglyph.<ref>[http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/3_taw.html]</ref>

Use of the cross as a [[Christian cross|Christian symbol]] may be as early as the 1st century, and is certain for the 3rd century.<ref>William Wood Seymour, [http://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/150/mode/2up "The Cross in Early Christian Art"],  ''The Cross in Tradition, History, and Art'' (1898).</ref> A wide variation of cross symbols is introduced for the purposes of [[heraldry]] beginning in the age of the [[Crusades]].<ref>William Wood Seymour, [http://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/360/mode/2up "The Cross in Heraldry"],  ''The Cross in Tradition, History, and Art'' (1898).</ref>

The earliest depiction of the cross as a Christian symbol may be as early as 200 A.D. when it was used to mock the faith in the [[Alexamenos graffito]].

== As markings ==

Written crosses are used for many different purposes, particularly in mathematics.

* The [[addition]] (or ''plus'') sign (+) and the [[multiplication]] (or ''times'') sign (×) are cross shapes.
* A cross is often used as a [[check mark]] because it can be clearer, easier to create with an ordinary pen or pencil, and less obscuring of any text or image that is already present than a large dot. It also allows marking a position more accurately than a large dot.
* The [[Chinese character]] for ten is [[wikt:十|十]] (see [[Chinese numerals]]).
* The [[dagger (typography)|dagger]] or ''obelus'' (†) is a cross
* The [[Georgian scripts|Georgian letters]] [[wikt:ქ|ქ]] and [[wikt:ჯ|ჯ]] are crosses.
* In the [[Latin alphabet]], the letter [[X]] and the [[Lower case|minuscule]] form of [[t]] are crosses.
* The [[Roman numeral]] for [[10 (number)|ten]] is [[X]].
* A large cross through a text often means that it is wrong or should be considered deleted. A cross is also used stand-alone ([[✗]]) to denote rejection.

The swastika is an [[equilateral]] cross with its arms bent at [[Types of angles|right angles]], in either right-facing ({{script|Hant|卐}}) form or its mirrored left-facing ({{script|Hant|卍}}) form.  The [[fylfot]] is a similar version.

Archaeological evidence of swastika-shaped ornaments dates from the [[Neolithic]] period. It occurs mainly in the modern day [[culture of India]], sometimes as a geometrical motif and sometimes as a religious symbol. It remains widely used in [[Eastern religions|Eastern]] and [[Dharmic religion]]s such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].
Though once commonly used all over much of the world without stigma, because of its right-facing variant's iconic usage in [[National Socialist Germany]], the symbol has become stigmatized in the [[Western world]].

== Other noteworthy crosses ==
[[Crux]], or the Southern Cross, is a cross-shaped [[constellation]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It appears on the national flags of [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[New Zealand]], [[Niue]], [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Samoa]].

The tallest cross, at 152.4 metres high, is part of [[Francisco Franco]]'s monumental "Valley of the Fallen", the ''[[Monumento Nacional de Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caidos]]'' in [[Spain]].

A cross at the junction of Interstates [[Interstate 57|57]] and [[Interstate 70|70]] in [[Effingham, Illinois]], is purportedly the tallest in the United States, at 198 feet (60.3 m) tall.<ref>http://www.crossusa.org/</ref>

The tallest freestanding cross in the United States is located in Saint Augustine, FL and stands 208 feet.<ref>http://www.missionandshrine.org/great_cross.htm</ref>

The tombs at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], [[Iran]], made in the 5th century BC, are carved into the cliffside in the shape of a cross.  They are known as the "Persian crosses".

== As physical gestures ==
Cross shapes are made by a variety of physical [[gesture]]s. [[Crossed fingers|Crossing the fingers of one hand]] is a common invocation of the symbol. The [[sign of the cross]] associated with Christian [[genuflection]] is made with one hand: in Eastern Orthodox tradition the sequence is head-heart-right shoulder-left shoulder, while in Oriental Orthodox, Catholic and Anglican tradition the sequence is head-heart-left-right. Crossing the index fingers of both hands represents the number 10 in Chinese-speaking societies and a charm against evil in European folklore (hence its frequent appearance in [[vampire]] movies). Other gestures involving more than one hand include the "cross my heart" movement associated with making a promise and the [[Tau]] shape of the [[referee]]'s "time out" hand signal.
