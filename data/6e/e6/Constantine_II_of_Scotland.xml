The<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Alba</target></link>, a name which first appears in Constantine's lifetime, was in northern Great Britain. The core of the kingdom was formed by the lands around the<space/><link><target>River Tay</target></link>. Its southern limit was the<space/><link><target>River Forth</target></link>, northwards it extended towards the<space/><link><target>Moray Firth</target></link><space/>and perhaps to<space/><link><target>Caithness</target></link>, while its western limits are uncertain. Constantine's grandfather<space/><link><target>Kenneth I of Scotland</target></link><space/>(Cined mac Ailpn, died 858) was the first of the family recorded as a king, but as<space/><link><target>king of the Picts</target></link>. This change of title, from king of the Picts to king of Alba, is part of a broader transformation of<space/><link><target>Pictland</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>origins of the Kingdom of Alba</target></link><space/>are traced to Constantine's lifetime.</paragraph><paragraph>His reign, like those of his predecessors, was dominated by the actions of<space/><link><target>Viking</target></link><space/>rulers in the<space/><link><target>British Isles</target></link>, particularly the<space/><link><target>U mair</target></link><space/>(&quot;the grandsons of mar&quot;, or<space/><link><target>Ivar the Boneless</target></link>). During Constantine's reign the rulers of the southern kingdoms of<space/><link><target>Wessex</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Mercia</target></link>, later the<space/><link><target>Kingdom of England</target></link>, extended their authority northwards into the disputed kingdoms of<space/><link><target>Northumbria</target></link>.

King<space/><link><target>Athelstan of England</target><part>thelstan</part></link><space/>was successful in securing Constantine's submission in 927 and 934, but the two again fought when Constantine, allied with the<space/><link><target>Strathclyde Britons</target></link><space/>and the Viking king of<space/><link><target>Dublin</target></link>, invaded thelstan's kingdom in 937, only to be defeated at the great<space/><link><target>battle of Brunanburh</target></link>.
