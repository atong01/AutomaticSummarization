The name was said to come from the station of the first line in Nantes, in front of the store of a hat-maker named Omnes, who had a large sign on his building saying &quot;Omnes Omnibus&quot; (&quot;All for all&quot; in Latin). Following success in Nantes, Baudry moved to Paris and founded the Enterprise des Omnibus on rue de Lancre, with workshops on the quai de Jemmapes. In 1827 he commissioned an English coach-maker,<space/><link><target>George Shillibeer</target></link>, to design a vehicle that could be stable and carry a large number of passengers. Shillibeer's design worked, On 28 April 1828, the first Paris omnibus began service, running every fifteen minutes between La Madeleine and la Bastille. Before long, there were one hundred omnibuses in service, with eighteen different itineraries. A journey cost twenty-five centimes. The omnibuses circulated between seven in the morning and seven in the evening; each omnibus could carry between twelve and eighteen passengers. The busiest line was that along the Grand Boulevards; it ran from eight in the morning until midnight.<space/><template><target>sfn</target><arg>Fierro</arg><arg>1996</arg><arg name="pages">1031-1032</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The Paris omnibus service was an immediate popular success, with more than two and a half million passengers in the first six months. However, there was no reliable way to collect money from the passengers, or the fare collectors kept much of the money for themselves; In its first years the company was continually on the verge of bankruptcy, and in despair, Baudry committed suicide in February 1830.

Some buses, while not economical to keep running as service buses, are often converted in some way for use by the operator, or another user, for purposes other than revenue earning transport.

This can be done by individuals, volunteer preservation groups or charitable trusts, museums, or sometimes by the operators themselves as part of a<space/><link><target>heritage fleet</target></link>. These buses often need to undergo a degree of<space/><link><target>vehicle restoration</target></link><space/>to restore them to their original condition, and will have their livery and other details such as internal notices and<space/><link><target>rollsign</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>restored to be authentic to a specific time in the bus's actual history. Some buses that undergo preservation are rescued from a state of great disrepair, but others enter preservation with very little wrong with them. As with other historic vehicles, many preserved buses either in a working or static state form part of the collections of<space/><link><target>List of transport museums</target><part>transport museums</part></link>. Working buses will often be exhibited at rallies and events, and they are also used as charter buses. While many preserved buses are quite old or even vintage, in some cases relatively new examples of a bus type can enter restoration. In-service examples are still in use by other operators. This often happens when a change in design or operating practice, such as the switch to one person operation or low floor technology, renders some buses redundant while still relatively new.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><paragraph><template><target>portal bar</target><arg>Buses</arg><arg>Transport</arg></template><template><target>div col</target><arg>3</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Bicycle carrier</target></link><space/>(bus mounted bike racks)</listitem><listitem><link><target>BRTS</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Bus spotting</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Bus station</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Cutaway bus</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Dollar van</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Intercity bus</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Intercity bus driver</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of fictional buses</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Motor bus</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Public light bus</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Trackless train</target></link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>div col end</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Bibliography</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Combeau</arg><arg name="first">Yvan</arg><arg name="title">Histoire de Paris</arg><arg name="year">2013</arg><arg name="publisher">Presses Universitaires de France</arg><arg name="location">Paris</arg><arg name="ISBN">978-2-13-060852-3</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Fierro</arg><arg name="first">Alfred</arg><arg name="title">Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris</arg><arg name="year">1996</arg><arg name="publisher">Robert Laffont</arg><arg name="ISBN">2-221-07862-4</arg></template></listitem><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Héron de Villefosse</arg><arg name="first">René</arg><arg name="title">HIstoire de Paris</arg><arg name="year">1959</arg><arg name="publisher">Bernard Grasset</arg></template></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>30em</arg><arg name="refs">
