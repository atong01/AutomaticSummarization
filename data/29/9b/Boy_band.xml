The popularity of Barbershop quartets had been prominent into the earlier part of the 20th century.

While The Monkees were originally a manufactured act turned real band that featured members with distinct (albeit fictional) personality types,<space/><link><target>the Jackson 5</target></link><space/>were a family group that established many musical conventions that boy bands follow. For instance, their music featured<space/><link><target>close harmony</target><part>close harmonies</part></link><space/>from<space/><link><target>soul music</target></link><space/>and catchy pop hooks influenced as much as they were by<space/><link><target>Motown</target></link><space/>and acts like<space/><link><target>the Supremes</target></link>. All members of the band sang, which is a common convention of a boy band, as opposed to having a front man and the rest on instruments; thus, no one person dominated the stage. Even so, the members conveniently fitted into the convention of having stereotypical personality types (e.g.<space/><link><target>Michael Jackson</target></link><space/>being the &quot;cute one&quot;).</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>The Beatles</target></link><space/>were directly an influence on boy bands that use rock band instrumentation, and played more rock oriented music. The precedent for this was when TV producers<space/><link><target>Bert Schnider</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Bob Rafelson</target></link><space/>recruited four young actor/singers to perform catchy pop tunes while also acting in a television series in which performances were integrated into the shows' plots and were very influential in shaping early<space/><link><target>music video</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The Monkees are often considered as the original pioneers among boy bands as they were the first example of a manufactured boy band, put together by producers rather than already performing together and then being &quot;discovered&quot; by record label executives. Formed in 1965 under the supervision of<space/><link><target>Don Kirshner</target></link>, the group became dissatisfied with Kirshner's control over them and they became independent two years later, working on their own up to 1970, when the group first dissolved.</paragraph><heading level='3'>1970s and 1980s: Menudo, New Edition, and New Kids on the Block</heading><paragraph>Other antecedents (apart from those already mentioned) exist throughout the history of pop music.

The key factor of a boy band is being trendy. This means that the band conforms to the most recent fashion and musical trends in the popular music scene. Typically, each member of the group will have some distinguishing feature and be portrayed as having a particular personality stereotype, such as &quot;the baby,&quot; &quot;the bad boy,&quot; or &quot;the shy one.&quot; While managing the portrayal of popular musicians is as old as<space/><link><target>popular music</target></link>, the particular pigeonholing of band members is a defining characteristic of boy and girl bands.</paragraph><paragraph>In most cases, their music is written, arranged and produced by a producer who works with the band at all times and controls the group's sound if necessary, to the point of hiring<space/><link><target>session singers</target></link><space/>to record guide vocals for each member of the group to sing individually if the members cannot harmonize well together. However, for clarity of each voice, recording each voice individually is most commonly the norm with most modern vocal groups. In recent years<space/><link><target>auto-tune</target></link><space/>has become a popular tool for boy bands who are unable to sing to a high standard. Some boy bands have come under fire for this issue of using auto-tune. Some have also come under fire for<space/><link><target>lip syncing</target></link><space/>in their performances as well, for example<space/><link><target>New Kids on the Block</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title"><space/>New Kids' Performance Was Dubbed, Critic Says<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-03-04/news/9203040523_1_mcpherson-new-kids-starr<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Orlando Sentinel<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">August 15, 2012</arg><arg name="date">March 4, 1992</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>A typical boy band performance features elaborately choreographed dancing, with the members taking turns singing and/or rapping. Boy bands generally do not compose or produce their own material, unless the members lobby hard enough for creative control. However, some bands were created around the talent of a songwriter within the group like<space/><link><target>Gary Barlow</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Take That</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Tony Mortimer</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>East 17</target></link>. It is not uncommon to find extra songs on an album written by one or more of the band members; however, their producers rarely use these as singles.</paragraph><paragraph>Since the 21st century, however, boy bands have been expected to write or at least contribute in some part lyrically to songs. Apart from the groups mentioned above who all had at least one primary songwriter from their beginning, other groups soon caught up. From the late nineties, members of<space/><link><target>Backstreet Boys</target></link><space/>who had previously used writers like<space/><link><target>Max Martin</target></link><space/>during their early albums began writing their own songs. Newer groups from late 2000s such as<space/><link><target>JLS</target></link><space/>have all made a point from early interviews that they write their own songs and hold their own image as this is an important part of marketing. Some bands like<space/><link><target>The Wanted</target></link><space/>have even spent time learning the craft of songwriting.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a329584/the-wanted-go-to-songwriting-camp-to-write-new-album.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Wanted go to songwriting camp to write new album<space/></arg><arg name="work">Digital Spy<space/></arg><arg name="date">July 13, 2011<space/></arg><arg name="place"><space/>[[United Kingdom|UK]]<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">June 29, 2012</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Individuals can also go on to achieve greater success as a solo artist coming out of a boy band having used the groups popularity to build on.
