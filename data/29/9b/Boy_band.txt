A '''boy band''' (or '''boyband''') is loosely defined as a [[vocal group]] consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hickey|first1=Walt|title=Boy Bands: More Like Man Bands|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/boy-bands-more-like-man-bands/|website=FiveThirtyEight|accessdate=June 7, 2014|date=June 4, 2014}}</ref> singing love songs marketed towards young females.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.contactmusic.com/5-seconds-of-summer/news/5-seconds-of-summer-boy-band-one-direction_4311542 |title=5 Seconds of Summer Are A Boy Band}}</ref> Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play [[musical instrument]]s, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a [[misnomer]]. However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.

Some such bands form on their own. They can evolve out of church choral or [[gospel music]] groups, but are often created by [[talent manager]]s or record producers who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards a female audience of [[preteen]]s, [[teenybopper]]s, or teens, the term may be used with negative connotations in [[music journalism]]. Boy bands are similar in concept to their counterparts, [[girl group]]s. Boy bands' popularity peaked thrice: in the 1960s (e.g., [[the Monkees]] and [[the Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]]), in the 1990s and early 2000s when acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]], [[NSYNC]], and [[Westlife]], among others, dominated the top of the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' and pop charts, and in the early 2010s with the emergence of new boy bands such as [[JLS]], [[Big Time Rush (band)|Big Time Rush]], [[One Direction]] and [[The Wanted]].

==History==

===Early history===
The earliest forerunner of boy band music began in the late 19th century as [[a capella]] [[Barbershop quartets]].  They were usually a group of males and sang in [[Four part harmony|four part harmonies]]. The popularity of Barbershop quartets had been prominent into the earlier part of the 20th century. A revival of the male vocal group took place in the late 1940s and 1950s with the use of [[doo-wop]] music. Doo-wop bands sang about topics such as love and other themes used in [[pop music]]. The earliest traces of boy bands were in the mid-1950s although the term boy band was not used. [[African American]] vocal group [[The Ink Spots]] was one of the first of what would now be called boy bands. The term boy band was not established until the late 1980s as before that they were called male vocal groups or "hep harmony singing groups.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://didyouknow.org/boybands/ |title=Boy bands |publisher=Did you know |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>

===1960s: The Osmonds, the Jackson 5 and the Monkees===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:The-Osmonds.jpg|thumb|The Osmonds]]
Although the term "boy band" is mostly associated with groups from the 1990s onwards, the earliest predecessors of this format were groups such as [[the Osmonds]], [[the Jackson 5]], and [[the Monkees]], which helped form the template for boy bands.  While The Monkees were originally a manufactured act turned real band that featured members with distinct (albeit fictional) personality types, [[the Jackson 5]] were a family group that established many musical conventions that boy bands follow. For instance, their music featured [[close harmony|close harmonies]] from [[soul music]] and catchy pop hooks influenced as much as they were by [[Motown]] and acts like [[the Supremes]]. All members of the band sang, which is a common convention of a boy band, as opposed to having a front man and the rest on instruments; thus, no one person dominated the stage. Even so, the members conveniently fitted into the convention of having stereotypical personality types (e.g. [[Michael Jackson]] being the "cute one").

[[The Beatles]] were directly an influence on boy bands that use rock band instrumentation, and played more rock oriented music. The precedent for this was when TV producers [[Bert Schnider]] and [[Bob Rafelson]] recruited four young actor/singers to perform catchy pop tunes while also acting in a television series in which performances were integrated into the shows' plots and were very influential in shaping early [[music video]]s. The Monkees are often considered as the original pioneers among boy bands as they were the first example of a manufactured boy band, put together by producers rather than already performing together and then being "discovered" by record label executives. Formed in 1965 under the supervision of [[Don Kirshner]], the group became dissatisfied with Kirshner's control over them and they became independent two years later, working on their own up to 1970, when the group first dissolved.

===1970s and 1980s: Menudo, New Edition, and New Kids on the Block===
Other antecedents (apart from those already mentioned) exist throughout the history of pop music. The genre has been copied into languages and cultures other than the Anglo-American. The Puerto Rican boy band [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], appealing to young [[Latina]] audiences, was founded in 1977. Menudo had a convention unique among boy bands: when a member turned 16, became too tall, or their voice changed, they were replaced.  The members of Menudo were generally aged 12–17.

The [[Bay City Rollers]] were a [[Scotland|Scottish]] pop band who were most popular in the mid-1970s. The ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' noted that they were "[[tartan]] teen sensations from [[Edinburgh]]", and were "the first of many acts heralded as the 'Biggest Group since The Beatles' and one of the most screamed-at teeny-bopper acts of the 1970s".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums|edition= 19th|publisher= Guinness World Records |location= London|isbn= 1-904994-10-5|page = 45}}</ref>  For a relatively brief but fervent period (nicknamed "Rollermania"), they were worldwide [[teen idol]]s.  The group were one of the first bands like The Monkees before them to take the formula shown by [[The Beatles]] and apply it to a teen market. The group achieved the same amount of success but for a limited period of time. At the peak of their popularity in the UK, comparisons were being made to [[The Beatles]]. Also by this time, Bay City Roller [[fan (person)|fans]] had a completely distinctive style of dress, the main elements of which were ankle-length [[tartan]] trousers and tartan [[scarf|scarves]], the group using the benefit of merchandise and promotion.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book| first= Martin C | last = Strong| year = 2000| title = The Great Rock Discography | edition = 5th|publisher= Mojo |location= Edinburgh|pages= 2–3|isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>

In the US, the [[Cleveland]]-based [[power pop]] group [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]] was generally interpreted as a "teen act", although all the band members played their own music. Vocalist [[Eric Carmen]] later commented, "It was not hip for people to like us, because their little sister liked us."<ref>{{Citation | last = Knopper | first = Steve | contribution = Raspberries | title = Contemporary Musicians | publisher = Gale | year = 2004 | series = Encyclopedia | accessdate = December 26, 2009 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/}}</ref>

[[Bros]] (abbreviation of the word "brothers") were a British boy band active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, consisting of twin brothers [[Matt Goss|Matt]] and [[Luke Goss]] along with [[Craig Logan]]. Formed in 1986, they scored multiple top 10 hits between 1987 and 1989. In Britain Bros also became the first modern era–style boy band to have a multiple platinum selling album with ''[[Push (Bros album)|Push]]'' in 1988, which is still one of the most successful boyband albums in the UK. Other big boy bands in Britain during the late eighties were [[Big Fun (boyband)|Big Fun]] and [[Brother Beyond]].

Boston group [[New Edition]] was formed in 1978 and reached their height of popularity in the 1980s, making them often credited for starting the boy band trend in the 1980s, even though the term "boy band" did not exist until the 1990s. [[Maurice Starr]] was influenced by New Edition and popularized it with his [[Mentorship|protégé]] [[New Kids on the Block]], the first commercially successful modern boy band who formed in 1984 and found international success in 1988. Starr's idea was to take the traditional template from the R&B genre (in this case his teenage band New Edition) and apply it to a pop genre.

===1990s: Boyz II Men, Take That, Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Westlife===
Some managers in Europe soon created their own acts after being inspired by [[New Kids on the Block]]. First beginning with [[Nigel Martin-Smith]]'s [[Take That]] in the UK who formed in 1990 and followed by [[Tom Watkins (music manager)|Tom Watkins]] who had success with [[Bros]] in the late eighties and formed [[East 17]] in 1991 who were marketed and pitted against Take That as rivals with a harsher attitude, style and sound. Take That became one of the most successful groups in British music chart history. Irish music manager [[Louis Walsh]], who had witnessed the impact of these British boy bands, put out an advert for an 'Irish Take That' thereby creating [[Boyzone]] in 1993. [[Let Loose]] formed in 1993, [[MN8]] and [[911 (band)|911]] formed in 1995, and [[Damage (British band)|Damage]] formed in 1996 were also boy bands who enjoyed success in Britain; however by the late 1990s all these bands had run their course and split up.

All these artists were very successful on both the singles and albums charts domestically and internationally however with the emergence of [[britpop]] and the commercial co-option of [[indie rock]], many boy bands were ridiculed by the British music press as having no artistic credibility. The media attention was then placed on the [[Battle of Britpop]] and the bands [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]] replaced the importance and rivalry of Take That and [[East 17]] as the two new biggest bands in Britain. However, other boybands found success in the late nineties like [[Five (band)|Five]], [[Another Level (band)|Another Level]], [[Point Break (band)|Point Break]] and [[Westlife]]. In 1995 successful German music manager [[Frank Farian]] who had been manager of [[Boney M]] and [[Milli Vanilli]] put together [[Latin American]] band [[No Mercy (pop band)|No Mercy]] who scored a few worldwide hits during the mid nineties.

Although being American and the sons of [[Tito Jackson]], a member of [[The Jackson 5]], [[3T]] had several hits singles across Europe in the mid-1990s, despite limited success in the [[United States of America|US]], and finished the second biggest selling act of 1996 in Europe behind [[Spice Girls]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.sortmusic.com/_0/3t-biography,len.html |title=3T Biography |publisher=Sort music |accessdate=August 5, 2012}}</ref>

With the success of North American boybands like [[New Kids on the Block]] in East Asia, Japanese entertainment company [[Johnny & Associates]] formed [[SMAP]] in 1992. The group enjoyed tremendous success and paved the way for more Asian boy bands such as [[Arashi]].

[[File:Backstreet Boys 2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Backstreet Boys]] are the best-selling boy band in history.]]
In the early nineties in North America, with New Kids on the Block's continued success and [[Color Me Badd]] also having success, boy bands became a continued staple of the Billboard charts. Continuing this success in the mid-1990s, most prominent boy bands were African American and had R&B and gospel elements, such as the group [[All-4-One]] that formed in 1993 and [[Boyz II Men]] that formed in 1988. Boyz II Men are also the most successful boy band act on the [[U.S. Hot 100]] as well as the [[Australian Singles Chart]]. Although they had success on the Billboard charts, they weren't marketed towards youth but more towards adults. It wasn't until 1997 and the change to pop oriented groups like [[Backstreet Boys]], [[98 Degrees]], [[NSYNC]], [[The Moffatts]], and [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] that boy bands exploded commercially and dominated the market in the United States. This late nineties era marked the height of boy band popularity in North America which hasn't been seen since.

Arguably the most successful boy band manager from the U.S. was [[Lou Pearlman]], who founded commercially successful acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] in 1993, [[NSYNC]] and [[LFO (group)|LFO]] in 1995, [[O-Town (band)|O-Town]] in 2000, and [[US5]] in 2005. Backstreet Boys and NSYNC became the two biggest boy bands in the late 1990s until the early 2000s, and Backstreet Boys went on to become the best selling boy band in history with over 130 million records sold.<ref name = "garcia1">{{cite news|url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2010/02/143_61233.html|title= Backstreet Boys Share Secrets to Success|last=Garcia|first=Cathy Rose A |work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=February 22, 2010|accessdate = January 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Backstreet Boys back, for good|url = http://www.straight.com/article-160145/backstreet-boys-back-good |publisher=Straight |accessdate=May 31, 2012|date=September 4, 2008}}</ref>

In the late nineties in the UK, producer [[Simon Cowell]] (noted in the U.S. for the American Idol/X Factor franchise) is also known for having managed British boyband [[Five (band)|Five]] who were formed in 1997 and Irish boyband [[Westlife]] formed in 1998. Westlife was created by Irishman [[Louis Walsh]] as a replacement for [[Boyzone]]<ref>{{cite web| url = http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/x-factor/judges/louis-walsh.html | work = Press Association | title = Louis Walsh Profile | publisher= Yahoo! |accessdate= January 9, 2010}}</ref> and was initially managed by a former member of the band [[Ronan Keating]]. Westlife would eventually overtake Take That in number one's tally in the UK although Take That's overall UK sales are still higher. In 2012, the [[Official Charts Company]] revealed the biggest selling singles artists in British music chart history with Take That placed 15th overall and the highest selling boyband act (9.3 million), followed by Boyzone at 29 (7.1 million) and Westlife at 34 (6.8 million).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-20-biggest-selling-groups-of-all-time-revealed-1682/ | title = The Official Top 20 biggest selling groups of all time revealed!|publisher=Official charts |accessdate=November 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-singles-charts-biggest-selling-artists-of-all-time-revealed-1431/ |title=Official Singles Charts' biggest selling artists of all time revealed | publisher =Official charts |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/take-thats-top-40-biggest-selling-songs-3313/ | title = Take That's Top 40 Biggest Selling Songs|publisher=Official charts |accessdate=November 29, 2014}}</ref> Even though Cowell is known to have managed several successful boy bands, he is also infamous for passing on signing two of the biggest boybands to emerge from the 1990s and 2000s, Take That and [[Busted (band)|Busted]].<ref>{{cite news| first =Alasdair | last = Glennie |url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2118414/Simon-Cowell-admits-turned-Take-That-overweight-Gary-Barlow.html | title =Simon Cowell admits that he turned down Take That because of 'overweight' Gary Barlow |work=Daily Mail |date = March 22, 2012 |accessdate=June 29, 2012 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bebo.com/BlogView.jsp?MemberId=7322368642&BlogId=7651779757 |title=Blog |publisher=Bebo |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>

===2000s: Backstreet Boys, Westlife, Jonas Brothers and F4===
[[File:JonasBrothers.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jonas Brothers]] are described as pop boy band]]
With the continued success of [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[*NSYNC]], American and British groups like [[98 Degrees]], [[Dream Street]], [[O-Town (band)|O-Town]], [[A1 (band)|A1]], [[Blue (English band)|Blue]], and [[Busted (band)|Busted]] gained quick popularity both domestically and internationally. International boy bands would also occasionally spring up, such as the [[Moldova]]n band [[O-Zone]] (better known today as an [[Numa numa|Internet meme]]), and [[Overground (band)|Overground]]. American Christian boy band [[Plus One (band)|Plus One]] also enjoyed brief remarkable success during this time.

At the height of boy band popularity in [[North America]], MTV created their own parody boyband, [[2gether (band)|2gether]]. Like [[The Monkees]] in the 1960s, they were a manufactured act composed of actors. 2gether played off of the idea that every successful boy band must have five distinct personality types: the bad boy, the shy one, the young one, the older brother type, and a heart throb.

Since 2001, the dominance of traditional boy bands on pop charts began to fade in the western hemisphere, although Gil Kaufman of [[MTV.com|MTV]] has described "new boy bands" that are "more likely to resemble [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Sum 41]], and [[Simple Plan]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/boy_bands/050207/ |title=The New Boy Bands|accessdate = November 8, 2007 | publisher=MTV|year=2007| first =Gil | last = Kaufman}}</ref>

In 2001, Taiwanese boy band [[F4 (band)|F4]] (called JVKV since 2007)<ref>{{cite news | first = Vivien | last = Wang | title = Boy band changes name F4 into JVKV | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/lifestyle/2007-04/29/content_863824.htm | work = [[China Daily]] | date = April 29, 2007 | accessdate =May 31, 2007}}</ref> blew up big as a result of the success of their TV drama [[Meteor Garden]]. Their popularity spread throughout Asia.{{cn|date=September 2015}} With their success, many other Taiwanese boy bands emerged around this time, such as [[5566]] and [[Fahrenheit (Taiwanese band)|Fahrenheit]]. In South Korea, [[Shinhwa]] also spread [[hallyu]] wave throughout Asia such as [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[China]]. Also in 2001, a new all-male pop band and dance group boyband hailing from Japan called [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]] debuted under Avex Group's label [[Rhythm Zone]] with 14 members, putting them on par with [[Super Junior]], a South Korean boy band, who had 13 members at its peak. In 2005, [[TVXQ!]] rose to fame in South Korea and they were able to achieve considerable success in Japan and other Asian countries.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

In North America, the [[Jonas Brothers]] rose to fame from promotion on the [[Disney Channel]] in 2008. Other boy bands like [[JLS]] and [[Mindless Behavior]] also emerged and experienced remarkable success around this time. However, apart from them, boy bands haven't seen the commercial boom experienced in the genre from the mid to late nineties in North America.

===2010s: NKOTBSB, One Direction, The Wanted and comebacks of 1990s-early 2000s boy bands===
Moving into the 2010s, boy bands are still popular especially in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe due to the continued commercial presence and longevity of nineties boy bands such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[Westlife]] (before they dissolved in 2012), and the successful comeback of [[Take That]] in 2005, [[Boyzone]] in 2007, and [[New Kids on the Block]] in 2008. Some sections of the press have referred to these acts, particularly those who have reformed after a previous split, such as Take That, Boyzone, and [[98 Degrees]], as 'man bands'.<ref>{{cite news|title=98 Degrees reunites as 'man band' on 'Today' show| work = The Los Angeles Times | url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-98-degrees-reunites-today-show-20120817,0,3400710.story |accessdate=September 14, 2012|date=August 17, 2012|first=Christie|last=D'Zurilla}}</ref> These older generation boy bands chart alongside the new boy bands.

[[File:One Direction Sydney 6.jpg|thumb|left|[[One Direction]] rose to fame in 2011.]]
In the early 2010s, there was somewhat of a resurgence of boy band popularity in countries where the trend had not maintained, with the emergence of new boy bands like [[Big Time Rush (band)|Big Time Rush]], [[The Wanted]], and [[One Direction]] and the formation of [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[NKOTBSB]] which comprised members of New Kids on the Block and Backstreet Boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2012/04/rise-and-return-boy-band|title=The rise and return of the boy band|publisher=Hampton Roads|date=April 29, 2012|accessdate= June 29, 2012}}</ref> NKOTBSB's success inspired boy bands who were fairly popular during the 1990s and 2000s to make a comeback, such as [[Blue (English band)|Blue]], 98 Degrees, [[Five (band)|Five]], [[911 (band)|911]], and O-Town. Like [[2gether (band)|2gether]] and [[The Monkees]], Big Time Rush was a manufactured act created for a television show.

In Southeast Asia, local boy bands also emerged as a result of the continued success of Korean and Japanese boy bands such as [[SMAP]], [[Shinhwa]], [[TVXQ!]], [[Arashi]], [[Exile]] and [[Super Junior]]. One of the boy bands who emerged as a result of [[Hallyu]] (Korean wave) is Indonesia's [[SM*SH]] who enjoyed prominent success domestically.

==Key factors of the concept==
Seen as important to a "boy band" group's commercial success is the group's [[Reputation|image]], carefully controlled by managing all aspects of the group's dress, promotional materials (which are frequently supplied to [[teen magazine]]s), and music videos. The key factor of a boy band is being trendy. This means that the band conforms to the most recent fashion and musical trends in the popular music scene. Typically, each member of the group will have some distinguishing feature and be portrayed as having a particular personality stereotype, such as "the baby," "the bad boy," or "the shy one."  While managing the portrayal of popular musicians is as old as [[popular music]], the particular pigeonholing of band members is a defining characteristic of boy and girl bands.

In most cases, their music is written, arranged and produced by a producer who works with the band at all times and controls the group's sound – if necessary, to the point of hiring [[session singers]] to record guide vocals for each member of the group to sing individually if the members cannot harmonize well together. However, for clarity of each voice, recording each voice individually is most commonly the norm with most modern vocal groups.  In recent years [[auto-tune]] has become a popular tool for boy bands who are unable to sing to a high standard. Some boy bands have come under fire for this issue of using auto-tune. Some have also come under fire for [[lip syncing]] in their performances as well, for example [[New Kids on the Block]].<ref>{{cite web | title = New Kids' Performance Was Dubbed, Critic Says | url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-03-04/news/9203040523_1_mcpherson-new-kids-starr |publisher = Orlando Sentinel | accessdate =August 15, 2012|date=March 4, 1992}}</ref>

A typical boy band performance features elaborately choreographed dancing, with the members taking turns singing and/or rapping. Boy bands generally do not compose or produce their own material, unless the members lobby hard enough for creative control. However, some bands were created around the talent of a songwriter within the group like [[Gary Barlow]] of [[Take That]] or [[Tony Mortimer]] of [[East 17]]. It is not uncommon to find extra songs on an album written by one or more of the band members; however, their producers rarely use these as singles.

Since the 21st century, however, boy bands have been expected to write or at least contribute in some part lyrically to songs. Apart from the groups mentioned above who all had at least one primary songwriter from their beginning, other groups soon caught up.  From the late nineties, members of [[Backstreet Boys]] who had previously used writers like [[Max Martin]] during their early albums began writing their own songs. Newer groups from late 2000s such as [[JLS]] have all made a point from early interviews that they write their own songs and hold their own image as this is an important part of marketing. Some bands like [[The Wanted]] have even spent time learning the craft of songwriting.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a329584/the-wanted-go-to-songwriting-camp-to-write-new-album.html |title=The Wanted go to songwriting camp to write new album |work=Digital Spy |date=July 13, 2011 | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>

Individuals can also go on to achieve greater success as a solo artist coming out of a boy band having used the groups popularity to build on. Usually this signals the end of the group until potential future reunions. Examples of this include [[Michael Jackson]] from [[The Jackson 5]], [[Donny Osmond]] from [[The Osmonds]], [[Ricky Martin]] from [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Justin Timberlake]] from *NSYNC, and [[Ronan Keating]] from [[Boyzone]]. Sometimes the most successful solo star from a band is not the most popular member such as [[Robbie Williams]] as opposed to lead singer [[Gary Barlow]] from [[Take That]]. Some boy band members have gone on to successful careers elsewhere in the media. [[Michael Dolenz]] of [[The Monkees]] went on to become a successful television producer, working for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] franchises such as [[LWT]] and [[Television South]].

==Music genres==
Although most boy bands consist of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] or pop influences, other [[music genre]]s, most notably [[country music]] and [[folk music]], are also represented. [[South 65]] and [[Marshall Dyllon]], for example, were both country music boy bands. [[Il Divo]], created by [[Simon Cowell]] in 2004, are a vocal group that performs [[operatic pop]] in several (mainly Italian) languages. Since then operatic/classical boy bands have become quite popular and common, especially in the UK. Since 2001 there has been some crossover with [[power pop]] and [[pop punk]] from bands that play live instruments. Just recently some boy bands decided to go back to their original doo-wop roots, most notably, [[The Overtones]].

==Controversy==
Since the 2000s, groups such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[LFO (group)|LFO]] have disliked the term "boy band" and have preferred to be known as a "male vocal group".<ref>{{cite web| title = I would be the dessert because I’m satisfying | url = http://www.popjustice.com/interviewsandfeatures/backstreet-boys-interview/49849/|publisher= Pop Justice | accessdate = August 16, 2012|date=October 24, 2007|quote=We were never a boyband.
