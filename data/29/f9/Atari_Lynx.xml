The first generation of cartridges were flat, and were designed to be stackable for ease of storage. However, this design proved to be very difficult to remove from the console and was replaced by a second design. This style, called &quot;tabbed&quot; or &quot;ridged&quot;, used the same basic design as the original cartridges with the addition of two small tabs on the cartridge's underside to aid in removal. The original flat style cartridges could be stacked on top of the newer cartridges, but the newer cartridges could not be easily stacked on each other, nor were they stored easily. Thus a third style, the &quot;curved lip&quot; style was produced, and all official and third-party cartridges during the console's lifespan were released (or re-released) using this style.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.atariage.com/system_labels.html?SystemID=LYNX'>Atari Lynx</link><space/>cartridge style illustrations at AtariAge.com.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>In May 1991, Sega launched its Game Gear portable gaming handheld. Also a color handheld, in comparison to the Lynx it had a higher cost and shorter battery life (34 hours as opposed to 4-5 for the Lynx), but it was slightly smaller and was backed up by significantly more games. In North America the Game Gear took second place, and while in Europe sales of the Lynx were initially quite strong on the back of the popular Atari ST, it still could not compete with the software library of the Game Gear and was eventually pushed into third place. Retailers such as Game and Toys R Us continued to sell the Lynx well into the mid-90s on the back of the<space/><link><target>Atari Jaguar</target></link><space/>launch, helped by magazines such as Ultimate Future Games who continued to cover the Lynx alongside the new generation of 32-bit and 64-bit consoles.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Atari-Lynx-II-Handheld-Angled.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>The Atari Lynx II, smaller and lighter than the original.</part></link>During 1990, the Lynx had moderate sales. In July 1991, Atari Corp. introduced the Lynx II with a new marketing campaign, new packaging, slightly improved hardware, better battery life and a new sleeker look. The new system (referred to within Atari Corp. as the &quot;Lynx II&quot;) featured rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power save option (which turned off the LCD panel's backlighting). It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo. The new packaging made the Lynx available without any accessories, dropping the price to $99. Although sales improved, Nintendo still dominated the handheld market.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1995, Atari Corp. shifted its focus away from the Lynx. As Nintendo's<space/><link><target>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</target><part>Super Nintendo</part></link><space/>and Sega's<space/><link><target>Sega Genesis</target></link><space/>filled retailers' shelves, Atari Corp. refocused its efforts on its Jaguar console and it's CD add-on. A handful of games were released during this time, including<space/><italics>Battlezone 2000</italics>. In 1996, Atari shut down its internal game development.</paragraph><paragraph>Telegames released a number of games in the second half of the 1990s, including a port of<space/><italics><link><target>Raiden (arcade game)</target><part>Raiden</part></link></italics><space/>and a platformer called<space/><italics>Fat Bobby</italics><space/>in 1997, as well as an action sports game called<space/><italics>Hyperdrome</italics><space/>in 1999. At the end of the 1990s, Hasbro, the owners of the Atari properties at the time, released the rights to develop for the system to the public domain.
