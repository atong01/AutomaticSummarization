He argued (against conventional wisdom) that money was not the creation of governments. Markets emerged, in his view, out of the division of labour, by which individuals began to specialize in specific crafts and hence had to depend on others for subsistence goods. These goods were first exchanged by barter. Specialization depended on trade, but was hindered by the &quot;double coincidence of wants&quot; which barter requires, i.e., for the exchange to occur, each participant must want what the other has. To complete this hypothetical history, craftsmen would stockpile one particular good, be it salt or metal, that they thought no one would refuse. This is the origin of money according to Smith.

Silent trade, also called silent barter, dumb barter (&quot;dumb&quot; here used in its old meaning of &quot;mute&quot;), or depot trade, is a method by which<space/><link><target>Merchant</target><part>traders</part></link><space/>who cannot speak each other's<space/><link><target>language</target></link><space/>can trade without talking. However, Benjamin Orlove has shown that while barter occurs through &quot;silent trade&quot; (between strangers), it also occurs in commercial markets as well. &quot;Because barter is a difficult way of conducting trade, it will occur only where there are strong institutional constraints on the use of money or where the barter symbolically denotes a special social relationship and is used in well-defined conditions. To sum up, multipurpose money in markets is like lubrication for machines - necessary for the most efficient function, but not necessary for the existence of the market itself.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Economic Anthropology</arg><arg name="year">1989</arg><arg name="publisher">Stanford University Press</arg><arg name="location">Stanford, CA</arg><arg name="pages">179</arg><arg name="author">Plattner, Stuart</arg><arg name="authorlink">Markets and Marketplaces</arg><arg name="editor">Plattner, Stuart</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In his analysis of barter between coastal and inland villages in the<space/><link><target>Trobriand Islands</target></link>, Keith Hart highlighted the difference between highly ceremonial gift exchange between community leaders, and the barter that occurs between individual households. The haggling that takes place between strangers is possible because of the larger temporary political order established by the gift exchanges of leaders.

Money may be in such short supply that it becomes an item of barter itself rather than the means of exchange. Barter may also occur when people cannot afford to keep money (as when hyperinflation quickly devalues it).<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last">Humphrey</arg><arg name="first">Caroline</arg><arg name="title">Barter and Economic Disintegration</arg><arg name="journal">Man</arg><arg name="year">1985</arg><arg name="volume">20</arg><arg name="issue">1</arg><arg name="page">52</arg><arg name="doi">10.2307/2802221</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Exchanges</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Trade with indians 1820.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>White traders bartering with the Indians c. 1820</part></link>Economic historian Karl Polanyi has argued that where barter is widespread, and cash supplies limited, barter is aided by the use of credit, brokerage, and money as a unit of account (i.e. used to price items).

A barter exchange operates as a broker and bank in which each participating member has an account that is debited when purchases are made, and credited when sales are made.</paragraph><paragraph>Modern barter and trade has evolved considerably to become an effective method of increasing sales, conserving cash, moving inventory, and making use of excess production capacity for businesses around the world. Businesses in a barter earn trade credits (instead of cash) that are deposited into their account. They then have the ability to purchase goods and services from other members utilizing their trade credits they are not obligated to purchase from those whom they sold to, and vice versa. The exchange plays an important role because they provide the record-keeping, brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member. Commercial exchanges make money by charging a commission on each transaction either all on the buy side, all on the sell side, or a combination of both. Transaction fees typically run between 8 and 15%.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Utopian socialism</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Utopian socialism</arg></template><link><target>File:LaborNote.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>350px</part><part>A 19th-century example of barter: A sample labor for labor note for the<space/><link><target>Cincinnati Time Store</target></link>.
