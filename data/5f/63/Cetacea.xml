Several species of mysticetes exhibit<space/><link><target>sexual dimorphism</target></link>, in that the females are larger than males. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Some cetaceans can travel at up to 20 knots. Balaenopterids use throat pleats to expand their mouths in order to take in gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass. Odontocetes have conical teeth designed for catching fish or squid. Mysticetes have a well developed sense of &quot;smell&quot;, whereas odontocetes have well-developed hearing so well adapted for both air and water that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or<space/><link><target>blubber</target></link>, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.</paragraph><paragraph>Cetaceans are widespread, but some, as with the mysticetes, specialize in certain environments. Most mysticetes prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the<space/><link><target>killer whale</target></link>, feed on mammals, such as<space/><link><target>pinnipeds</target></link>.<space/><link><target>Grey whale</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Some whales produce a variety of vocalizations, notably the songs of the humpback whale. Many species, mainly dolphins, are highly sociable, with some pods reaching over a thousand individuals.</paragraph><paragraph>Once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law. Some species are attributed with<space/><link><target>cetacean intelligence</target><part>high levels of intelligence</part></link>. At the 2012 meeting of the<space/><link><target>American Association for the Advancement of Science</target></link>, support was reiterated for a cetacean bill of rights, listing cetaceans as<space/><link><target>non-human person</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The<space/><link><target>North Atlantic right whale</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and is considered<space/><link><target>functionally extinct</target></link><space/>by<space/><link><target>Cetology</target><part>cetologists</part></link>, and the<space/><link><target>Baiji</target></link><space/>is also considered functionally extinct by the<space/><link><target>International Union for Conservation of Nature</target><part>IUCN</part></link><space/>with the last sighting in 2004. Besides<space/><link><target>whaling</target></link>, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of<space/><link><target>Herman Melville</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>Moby Dick</target></link></italics>.

Their nostril(s) make up the blowhole, with one in toothed whales, and two in baleen whales. They lie on the top of the head, so that the rest of the body can remain submerged while surfacing for air. When the stale air, warmed from the lungs, is exhaled, it condenses as it meets colder external air. As with a terrestrial mammal breathing out on a cold day, a small cloud of 'steam' appears. This is called the 'spout' and varies between species in terms of shape, angle, and height. Species can be identified at a distance using this characteristic. In toothed whales, a connective tissue exists in the<space/><link><target>melon (cetacean)</target><part>melon</part></link><space/>as a head buckle. This is filled with air sacs and fat which aids in buoyancy and<space/><link><target>biosonar</target></link>. The sperm whales have a particularly pronounced melon; this is called the<space/><link><target>spermaceti organ</target></link><space/>and contains the eponymous<space/><link><target>spermaceti</target></link>, hence the name &quot;sperm whale&quot;. Even the long tusk of the narwhal is a vice-formed tooth. The<space/><link><target>baleen</target></link>, which consists of long, fibrous strands of keratin, of baleen whales sit in place of the teeth and are used to seethe the water for plankton and krill among others.</paragraph><paragraph>The body is wrapped in a thick layer of fat known as<space/><link><target>blubber</target></link>. This blubber is used for thermal insulation and gives cetaceans their smooth, streamlined body shape. In larger species, it can reach a thickness up to half a meter (1.6&amp;nbsp;ft). The very specific structure of the skin above the fat layer ensures a phenomenon known as<space/><link><target>Gray's Paradox</target></link>: the body, especially for the faster swimmers, has in reality far better flow properties, than at a solids equal to the form in this case. This is attributed to the damping properties of the skin, interfering with mitigated vortices. To this end, the dermis forms a seam with the overlying epidermis and are interlocked. The<space/><link><target>nipple</target><part>papillae</part></link><space/>are seated on slats, which are largely transverse to the longitudinal axis of the body and thus also provide to the flow direction. The papillae are used for excretory ducts of sweat glands. Today, however, we know its real function and also know that cetaceans possess no skin glands except for the mammary glands. In addition to these structures, damping the skin has a microscopically fine relief pattern. Based on the results of physiological experiments, an active response of the skin is assumed. The optimization of the flow properties could be readjusted in experiments with artificial whale skin.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Skeleton</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:BlueWhaleSkeleton.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Free crafted skeleton of a blue whale</part></link><link><target>File:Walschdelknochen.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>Weathered upper jaw of a sperm whale</part></link><link><target>File:Whale skeleton.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>Bowhead whale skeleton</part></link><link><target>File:Sperm whale skeleton.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Sperm whale skeleton</part></link>The cetacean skeleton is largely made up of compact bone, as it stabilizes in the water. For this reason, the usual terrestrial compact bones, which are finely woven through cancellous bone, are replaced with lighter and more elastic bones. In many places, bone elements are replaced by cartilage and even fat, thereby improving their hydrostatic qualities. The ear and the muzzle contain a bone shape that is exclusive to cetaceans with an extremely high density, which on recalls porcelain. This has special acoustic properties and conducts sound better than other bones, which aids with<space/><link><target>biosonar</target></link>. In many toothed whales, the depression in their skull is due to the formation of a large melon and multiple air bags which are formed asymmetrically.</paragraph><paragraph>The skull of all cetaceans is extended, which can be clearly seen in baleen whales. The nostrils are located on top of the head above the eyes. The back of the skull is significantly shortened and deformed. By shifting the nostrils to the top of the head, the nasal passages extend perpendicularly through the skull. The teeth or baleen in the upper jaw sit exclusively on the<space/><link><target>maxilla</target></link>. The braincase is concentrated through the nasal passage to the front and is correspondingly higher, with individual cranial bones that overlap (<link><target>Teleskoping</target></link>). The bony otic capsule, the petrosal, is only cartilaginous when connected to the skull, so that they can swing independently.<extension extension_name='ref' name="benthamopen"><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="author1">Bruno Cozzi</arg><arg name="author2">Sandro Mazzariol</arg><arg name="author3">Michela Podestà</arg><arg name="author4">Alessandro Zott</arg><arg name="title">Diving Adaptations of the Cetacean Skeleton</arg><arg name="journal">The Open Zoology Journal</arg><arg name="year">2009</arg><arg name="accessdate">5 September 2015</arg><arg name="url">http://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOZJ/TOZJ-2-34.pdf</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The number of vertebrae that make up the spine varies between species, anywhere between 40 and 93 individual vertebrae. The<space/><link><target>cervical spine</target></link>, found in all mammals, consists of seven vertebrae which, however, are greatly reduced in most cetaceans or are fused together, which gives stability during swimming at the expense of mobility. The fins are carried by the<space/><link><target>thoracic vertebrae</target></link>, ranging from 9 to 17 individual vertebrae. The sternum is regressed and is only cartilaginous, but nonetheless is strong. The last two to three pairs of ribs are not connected at all and hang freely in the body wall. This is followed by the stable lumbar and tail part of the spine which includes all other vertebrate. Below the<space/><link><target>caudal vertebrae</target></link><space/>is the<space/><link><target>chevron (anatomy)</target><part>chevron bone</part></link>; the vortex developed provides additional attachment points for the tail musculature.<extension extension_name='ref' name="benthamopen"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The front limbs are paddle-shaped with shortened arms and elongated finger bones, to support the movement. They are united by cartilage. It also leads to a proliferation of the finger members, a so-called Hyperphalangie, on the second and third fingers. The only functional joint is the shoulder joint in all cetaceans except for the<space/><link><target>Amazon river dolphin</target></link>. The<space/><link><target>collarbone</target></link><space/>is completely absent. The movement of cetaceans on land is no longer necessary and no longer possible due to the body weight, which is mainly a problem for the larger variety, and the hindlimbs which are greatly atrophied and only a rudimentary internal appendage without connections to the spine.<extension extension_name='ref' name="benthamopen"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Internal anatomy and physiology</heading><paragraph>The structure of the<space/><link><target>respiratory system</target><part>respiratory</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>circulatory system</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are of particular importance for the life of<space/><link><target>marine mammals</target></link>. The oxygen balance of cetaceans is highly effective. Each breath can replace up to 90 percent of the total volume of air in their lungs. For land mammals, in comparison, this value is usually about 15 percent. In the lungs, the inhaled air is about twice as much oxygen withdrawn by the lung tissue as a land mammal. The oxygen, like all mammals, is in the blood and the lungs, but in cetaceans they are also stored in various tissues, mainly in the muscles, in which the muscle pigment,<space/><link><target>myoglobin</target></link>, provides an effective bond. This external oxygen storage is vital for deep diving since, from a depth of about<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>100</arg><arg>m</arg><arg>ft</arg></template>, the lung tissue is almost completely compressed by the water pressure. In the dipping process, they massively reduce their oxygen consumption by lowering the heart activity and blood circulation; individual organs are not supplied with oxygen during this time. Some<space/><link><target>rorqual</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>can dive for up to 40 minutes, sperm whales between 60 and 90 minutes, and<space/><link><target>bottlenose whale</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>for even two hours.

In the oceans, there are both species that prefer the deeper marine areas and species that live frequently or exclusively in coastal and shallow water areas.</paragraph><paragraph>The distribution of habitats arises normally along certain temperature limits in the oceans, which means many species exist along certain latitudes.

For migratory species, their reproductive sites often lie in tropics and their feeding grounds in polar regions, but the two populations, one in the Arctic and the other in the Antarctic, are genetically separated by their long distance apart from each other.

This cycle is usually coupled with seasonal movements, which can be observed in many species. Most toothed whales have a no fixed bonds. In many species, the females have several partners during a season. The baleen whales are, on the other hand, largely monogamous within each reproductive period, but lasting bonds do not go as well.</paragraph><paragraph>The gestation period of cetaceans takes place between nine and 16 months, with the duration not necessarily dependent on the size. Porpoises wear as well as the huge blue whales about 11 months. Cetaceans usually bear only one calf; with the occurrence of twins, one usually dies because the mother cannot afford sufficient milk for both juveniles. The fetus is positioned for a tail-first delivery, so that the risk of drowning while being delivered is a minimal. After parturition, the young animal is transported quickly to the surface for their first breath, which, in many species, follows several acts of &quot;midwives&quot;. The young animals have, at birth, about one-third of their adult height and tend to be independently active, comparable to the precocial birds or messenger boys of terrestrial mammals. When suckling, the mother splashes milk actively using the muscles of the mammary glands into the mouth of the calf, as it has no lips to suck. This milk usually has a very high fat content, ranging from 16 to 46 percent, which causes the calf to rapidly increase in size and weight.<extension extension_name='ref' name="mann"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The suckling is mostly long, in many small cetaceans it lasts about four months and often goes hand in hand with large species over a year, with a narrow bond of mother to her offspring. For the rearing of young animals alone, the dams are responsible for all cetaceans. In some species of cetaceans, there are so-called &quot;aunts&quot; who also occasionally suckle the pups. Most cetaceans mature late, typically at seven to ten years. This reproductive strategy provides few offspring that have a high survival rate. An exception to this is the<space/><link><target>La Plata Dolphin</target></link><space/>who is already sexually mature at two years, but lives to be only about 20 years old.

This activity has gone on since the<space/><link><target>Stone Age</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In the Middle Ages, people had many reasons for whaling, including their huge amounts of<space/><link><target>whale meat</target><part>meat</part></link>, the<space/><link><target>whale oil</target><part>oil</part></link><space/>usable as fuel, and the jawbone, which was used in house construction. At the end of the Middle Ages, whole whaling fleets, mainly aimed at<space/><link><target>baleen whales</target></link>, such as the<space/><link><target>bowhead whales</target></link>, were hunting. For example, in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch fleet had about 300 whaling ships with 18,000 crewmen.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 18th and 19th centuries,<space/><link><target>whales</target></link>,<space/><link><target>baleen whale</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>especially, were hunted for their<space/><link><target>baleen</target></link>, which was used in the place of plastic which had not been invented yet, or as a replacement for wood; they were used such products as corset and crinoline.

In the first half of the 20th century, whales were of great importance as a supplier of raw materials for industries. Whales were intensively hunted during this time; in the 1930s, 30,000 whales were killed. A further increase to over 40,000 animals per year was made up in the 1960s, which especially collapsed the stocks of large baleen whales.</paragraph><paragraph>Most hunted whales are now threatened in their existence, with some great whale species populations that have been exploited to the brink of extinction. Today, some are decimated, but a slow increase is possible. The Atlantic and the Korean gray whale populations were already completely eradicated, and the<space/><link><target>North Atlantic right whales</target></link><space/>are expected today with a population of 300 to 600 animals, and the<space/><link><target>blue whale</target></link><space/>is probably around 14,000 animals.</paragraph><paragraph>The first efforts to protect whales was decided in 1931. In some particularly endangered species, such as the<space/><link><target>humpback whale</target></link>, they numbered about 100 animals, and were placed under international protection, and the first protected areas were established. In 1946, the<space/><link><target>International Whaling Commission</target></link><space/>was established; they monitor and secure the stocks of whales. The killing of whales for commercial purposes was prohibited worldwide by this organization from 1985 to 2005. However, whales are still hunted today. Japanese whaling ships are allowed to hunt whales of different species for supposedly scientific purposes. Native Greenlandics and other indigenous peoples of the world still practice whaling for traditional reasons and is allowed to survive. Iceland and Norway do not recognize the ban, and operate an open commercial whaling. Countries like Norway and Japan are committed to ending the moratorium.</paragraph><paragraph>Dolphins and other smaller cetaceans are also hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. This is an accomplish by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the<space/><link><target>Solomon Islands</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Faroe Islands</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Peru</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Japan</target></link>, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their<space/><link><target>whale meat</target><part>meat</part></link>, though some end up in<space/><link><target>dolphinarium</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes, thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Fishing</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Cetacean bycatch</arg></template><link><target>File:Domino whale-bone hg.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Dominoes made of baleen</part></link>The cost of whaling uninteresting small cetaceans - especially some dolphin species - partly decimated. Dolphin pods often reside near large shoals of tuna. This is also known to fishermen, which is why they often look for dolphins to catch tuna. Dolphins are much easier to make out than tuna, since they have to take a breath at the surface regularly. The fishermen pull their nets hundreds of meters wide in a circle around the dolphin groups, in the expectation that they also include a tuna shoal. When the nets are pulled together, the dolphins become entangled under water and drown. Line fishery in larger rivers are threats especially to<space/><link><target>river dolphins</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>A far greater threat than by-catch arises, however, for small cetaceans: targeted hunting. In Southeast Asia, they are sold in poorer countries as fish-replacement to the native population, since the actual edible fish of the region promise higher revenues from exports.

The co-author of her interim report concludes that the animals killed by the active sonar of some Navy ships were injured.

Mark Hindell and his team from the Tasmanian University in Hobart studied cetacean strandings on the coast of Tasmania from 1920-2002 and found that greater strandings occurred at certain time intervals. Years with a tenfold number of strandings was accompanied by the occurrence of severe storms, which initiated the cold water flows increasingly close to the coast. In nutrient-rich cold water, cetaceans find particularly large prey animals, so they followed the cold water currents and thus, in these exceptional meteorological years, came into shallower waters than usual, where the risk is higher for strandings. Since many whales and dolphins live in pods and follow or accompany the sick or debilitated animals into shallow water, mass stranding occur often at low tide. Once stranded, large whales are crushed by their own body weight, if they cannot get into deeper water. In addition, the regulation of body temperature is no longer guaranteed in a stranded whale and there is a risk of overheating for smaller whales.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Environmental hazards</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Marine mammals and sonar</arg></template><template><target>Quote box</target><arg name="width">30%</arg><arg name="align">left</arg><arg name="quote">Worldwide, use of active sonar has been linked to about 50 marine mammal strandings between 1996 and 2006.

Here, it is called Ketos, a term which initially included all large marine animals. From this was derived the Roman word for whale, Cetus. Other names were phlaina (Aristotle, Latin form of ballaena) for the female and, with an ironic characteristic style, musculus (Mouse) for the male animal. North Sea whales were called Physeter, which was meant for the sperm whale<space/><italics>Physter macrocephalus</italics>. Particular detailed whales described by Aristotle are Pliny and Ambrose. All mention both the Viviparie and the suckling of the pups. Pliny describes the problems associated with the lungs with spray tubes, and Ambrose even claimed that these large whales would take their young into their mouth to protect them.</paragraph><paragraph>In the Bible especially, the Leviathan plays a role as a sea monster. The essence, which features a giant crocodile or a dragon and a whale, was created according to the Bible by God (Psalm 104, 26) and should again be destroyed by him (Psalm 74.14 and Isaiah 27.1). In the Book of Job, the Leviathan is described in more detail (Job 40.25 to 41.26).</paragraph><paragraph>In Jonah 2.1 to 11 is a clearer, more recognizable description of a whale alongside the prophet Jonah, who, on his flight from the divine task, the city of Nineveh is spewed to prophesy the downfall, swallowed by a whale on the beach of Nineveh.</paragraph><paragraph>Dolphins are far more often than great whales mentioned in the ancient world. Aristotle devotes the sacred animals of the Greeks in his<space/><italics>Historia Animalium</italics><space/>and gives details of their role as aquatic animals. The Greeks admired the dolphin as a &quot;king of the aquatic animals&quot; and referred to them erroneously as fish. Its intellectual property is perceived both by its ability to escape from the nets of the fishermen as well as his collaboration with fishermen engaged in fishing operations.</paragraph><paragraph>River dolphins are known from the Ganges and - very erroneously - the Nile. The latter apparently also equating with sharks and catfish. Supposedly they attacked even crocodiles.</paragraph><paragraph>In Greek mythology, dolphins occupy some space. Because of their intelligence, they rescued multiple people from drowning. They were said to have a special love for music - probably not least because of their own song - they saved, in the legends, very famous musicians like Arion of Lesbos from Methymna or Kairanos from Miletus. Because of the mental faculties, dolphins were considered for the god Dionysus.<link><target>File:Cetus constellation map.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Constellation Cetus</part></link>Dolphins belong to the retinue of Poseidon and led him to his wife Amphitrite. But dolphins are also associated with other gods, such as Apollo, Dionysus and Aphrodite. The Greeks paid tribute to both the whale and the dolphin with its own constellation. The constellation of the Whale (Ketos, lat. Cetus) is located south of the constellation of the Dolphin (Delphi, lat. Delphinus) north of the zodiac.</paragraph><paragraph>In ancient art, there are often dolphin representations. Even the Cretan Minoans represented them. Later they often found them on reliefs, gems, lamps, coins, mosaics, grave stones, etc. A particularly popular representation is that of Arion or the Taras riding on a dolphin. In early Christian art, the dolphin is a popular motif, not least because it was partially, next to the fish, used as a symbol of Christ.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Middle Ages to the 19th century</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>History of Whaling</arg><arg>Cryptid whales</arg></template>The Irish monk<space/><link><target>St. Brendan</target></link><space/>described in his travel story<space/><italics>Navigatio Sancti Brendani</italics><space/>an encounter with a whale, which he should have done in the years 565-573.

He met this whale seven years later and rested on his back.</paragraph><paragraph>Most descriptions of large whales from this time to whaling era, starting in the 17th century, came from beached whales, however, which resembled by their corpulence and their appearance no other known animal. This was particularly true for the sperm whale, the most frequently stranded in larger groups. Raymond Gilmore in 1959 to 1723 documented 17 sperm whales in the estuary of the Elbe and in 1784 documented 31 animals on the coast of Great Britain. In 1827, a blue whale with a length of<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>28.5</arg><arg>m</arg><arg>ft</arg></template><space/>beached itself off the coast of what was then still belonging to the Netherlands Ostend, whose bones were sent all through Europe for seven years.

Although they knew that most whales represent harmless giants, they described especially the battles with the harpooned animals than slaughter. With the intensification of whaling, there were increasing descriptions of the sea monsters, which include huge whales, sharks, sea snakes, giant squid, and octopuses.</paragraph><paragraph>Among the first whalers who described their experiences on whaling trips was Captain William Scoresby from Great Britain, who published the book in 1820<space/><italics>Northern Whale Fishery</italics><space/>and it described the hunt for the great baleen whales of the northern seas.

The success of belugas turned attention to maintaining their relative, the<space/><link><target>narwhal</target></link>, in captivity. However, in repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, all narwhals kept in captivity died within months. A breeding pair of<space/><link><target>pygmy right whale</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>were retained in an enclosed area (with nets); they were eventually released in South Africa. In 1971, Sea World captured a California Gray Whale calf in Mexico at Scammon's Lagoon. The calf, later named Gigi, was separated from her mother using a form of lasso attached to her flukes. Gigi was displayed at<space/><link><target>SeaWorld San Diego</target></link><space/>for a year. Gigi was released off shore with a radio beacon affixed to her back, however, contact was lost after three weeks. Gigi was the first baleen whale to be kept in captivity.

JJ was an orphaned calf that beached itself on April 1997, and was transported two miles to SeaWorld. The<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>680</arg><arg>kg</arg><arg>lbs</arg></template><space/>calf was a popular attraction, and behaved normally, despite being separated from his mother.
