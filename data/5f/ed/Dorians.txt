[[File:AncientGreekDialects (Woodard) en.svg|thumb|330px|{{Ancient Greek dialects/legend}} <br> The Dorian regions of classical Greece were in general, but not always, those where the Doric dialect was spoken.]]
The '''Dorians''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɔr|i|ə|n|z|,_|ˈ|d|oʊr|-}}; {{lang-el|Δωριεῖς}}, ''Dōrieis'', singular {{lang|grc|Δωριεύς}}, ''Dōrieus'') were one of the four major ethnic groups among which the [[Greeks|Hellenes]] (or Greeks) of [[Classical Greece]] considered themselves divided (along with the [[Aeolians]], [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]] and [[Ionians]]).<ref>Apollodorus, ''Library'', I, 7.3</ref> They are almost always referred to as just "the Dorians", as they are in the earliest literary mention of them in ''[[Odyssey]]'',<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'', Book XIX line 177.</ref> where they already can be found inhabiting the island of [[Crete]].

They were diverse in way of life and social organization, varying from the populous trade center of the city of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], known for its ornate style in art and architecture, to the isolationist, military state of [[Sparta]]. And yet, all Hellenes knew which localities were Dorian, and which were not. Dorian states at war could more likely, but not always, count on the assistance of other Dorian states. Dorians were distinguished by the [[Doric Greek]] dialect and by characteristic social and historical traditions.

In the 5th century BC, Dorians and [[Ionians]] were the two most politically important Greek ''[[Ethnic group|ethne]]'', whose ultimate clash resulted in the [[Peloponnesian War]]. The degree to which fifth-century Hellenes self-identified as "Ionian" or "Dorian" has itself been disputed. At one extreme Édouard Will concludes that there was no true ethnic component in fifth-century Greek culture, in spite of anti-Dorian elements in Athenian propaganda.<ref>{{cite book|first=Édouard|last=Will|title=Doriens et Ioniens: essai sur la valeur du critère ethnique appliqué à l'étude de l'histoire et de la civilisation grecques|publisher=Belles Lettres|location=Paris|year=1956 | language=French}}</ref> At the other extreme John Alty reinterprets the sources to conclude that ethnicity did motivate fifth-century actions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alty|first=John|title=Dorians and Ionians|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=102|pages=1–14|year=1982|doi=10.2307/631122}}</ref> Moderns viewing these ethnic identifications through the fifth- and fourth-century BC literary tradition have been profoundly influenced by their own social politics. Also, according to E.N. Tigerstedt, nineteenth-century European admirers of virtues they considered "Dorian" identified themselves as "[[Laconophilia|Laconophile]]" and found responsive parallels in the culture of their day as well; their biases contribute to the traditional modern interpretation of "Dorians".<ref>{{cite book|first=E.N.|last=Tigerstedt|title=The Legend of Sparta in Classical Antiquity|publisher=Almqvist & Wiksell|location=Stockholm|date=1965–1978|pages=28–36}}</ref>

==Origin of the Dorians==
Accounts vary as to the Dorians’ place of origin. One theory, widely believed in ancient times, is that they originated in the north, north-western mountainous regions of [[Greece]], [[Macedon|ancient Macedonia]] and [[Epirus]], whence obscure circumstances brought them south into the [[Peloponnese]], to certain [[Aegean Sea|Aegean islands]], [[Magna Graecia]], [[Lapithos]] and [[Ancient Crete|Crete]]. [[Greek mythology|Mythology]] gave them a Greek origin and [[eponym]]ous founder, [[Dorus]] son of [[Hellen]], the mythological [[patriarch]] of the [[Greeks|Hellenes]].

===Peloponnesian dialect replacement===
The origin of the Dorians is a multi-faceted concept. In modern scholarship the term often has meant the location of the population disseminating the Doric Greek dialect within a hypothetical [[Proto-Greek]] speaking population. This dialect is known from records of classical northwest Greece, the [[Peloponnesus]] and [[Crete]] and some of the islands. The geographic and ethnic information found in the west's earliest known literary work, the ''[[Iliad]]'', combined with the administrative records of the former [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] states, prove to universal satisfaction that East Greek speakers were once dominant in the Peloponnesus but suffered a setback there and were replaced at least in official circles by West Greek speakers. A historical event is associated with the overthrow, called anciently the Return of the Heracleidai and by moderns the [[Dorian Invasion]].

This theory of a return or invasion presupposes that West Greek speakers resided in northwest Greece but overran the Peloponnesus replacing the East Greek there with their own dialect. No other records than Mycenaean are known to have existed in the [[Bronze Age]], so a West Greek of that time and place cannot be proved or disproved. West Greek speakers were in western Greece in classical times. Unlike the East Greeks, they are not associated with any evidence of displacement events. This provides circumstantial evidence that the [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]] disseminated among the Hellenes of northwest Greece, a highly mountainous and somewhat isolated region.

===The Dorian invasion===
{{main|Dorian invasion}}
The Dorian invasion is a modern historical concept attempting to account for:
* at least the replacement of dialects and traditions in southern Greece in pre-classical times
* more generally, the distribution of the Dorians in [[Classical Greece]]
* the presence of the Dorians in Greece at all

On the whole, none of the objectives were met, but the investigations served to rule out various speculative hypotheses. Most scholars doubt that the Dorian invasion was the main cause of the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. The source of the West Greek speakers in the Peloponnesus remains unattested by any solid evidence.

===Post-migrational distribution of the Dorians===
[[File:Lato - Prytaneion 01.jpg|thumb|Dorian site of [[Lato]] in Crete]]
Though most of the Doric invaders settled in the Peloponnese, they also settled on [[Rhodes]] and [[Sicily]], in what is now southern Italy. In Asia Minor existed the Dorian Hexapolis (the six great Dorian cities): [[Halikarnassos]] (Halicarnassus) and [[Knidos]] (Cnidus) in [[Asia Minor]], [[Kos]], and [[Lindos]], [[Kameiros]], and [[Ialyssos]] on the island of Rhodes. These six cities would later become rivals with the [[Ionia]]n cities of Asia Minor. The Dorians also invaded [[Crete]]. These origin traditions remained strong into classical times: [[Thucydides]] saw the [[Peloponnesian War]] in part as "Ionians fighting against Dorians" and reported the tradition that the [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusans]] in Sicily were of Dorian descent.<ref>[http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/thucydides/thucydides-passages.php?pleaseget=7.57 7.57]</ref> Other such "Dorian" colonies, originally from Corinth, Megara, and the Dorian islands, dotted the southern coasts of Sicily from Syracuse to Selinus. (''EB'' 1911).

[[File:Pindus Mountains 02 bgiu.jpg|thumb|left|Uplands of Greece - the [[Pindus Mountains]]]]

====The Dorian of Bronze Age Pylos====
A man's name, Dōrieus, occurs in the [[Linear B]] tablets at [[Pylos]], one of the regions later invaded and subjugated by the Dorians.<ref>{{cite book | first=Michael | last=Ventris | first2=John | last2=Chadwick | title=Documents in Mycenaean Greek | edition=2nd | location=Cambridge | publisher=University Press | year=1973 | page=541}}</ref> Pylos tablet Fn867 records it in the [[dative case]] as do-ri-je-we, '''*Dōriēwei''', a third or consonant declension noun with stem ending in w. An unattested nominative plural, *Dōriēwes, would have become Dōrieis by loss of the w and contraction. The tablet records the grain rations issued to the servants of "religious dignitaries" celebrating a religious festival of [[Potnia]], the mother goddess.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Pierre | last=Carlier | title=Qa-si-re-u et Qa-si-re-wi-ja | url=http://www2.ulg.ac.be/archgrec/IMG/aegeum/aegaeum12(pdf)/Carlier.pdf | year=1995 | journal=Aegeum | number=12 | location=Liège | publisher=Université de Liège | page=359 | language=French}}</ref>

The nominative singular, Dōrieus, remained the same in the classical period.<ref>{{harvnb | Liddell | Scott | 1940| loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*d%3Aentry+group%3D134%3Aentry%3D*dwrieu%2Fs Δωρι-εύς]}}</ref> Many Linear B names of servants were formed from their home territory or the places where they came into Mycenaean ownership. According to [[Carl Darling Buck]], the -eus suffix was very productive. One of its uses was to convert a toponym to an anthroponym; for example, Megareus, "Megarian," from [[Megara]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Carl Darling | last=Buck | title=Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1933 | page=316}}</ref> A Dōrieus would be from Dōris, the only classical Greek state to serve as the basis for the name of the Dorians. The state is a small one in the mountains of west central Greece. However, classical [[Doris (Greece)|Doris]] may not have been the same as Mycenaean Doris.

====The Dorians of upland Doris====
A number of credible etymologies by noted scholars have been proposed. [[Julius Pokorny]] derives Δωριεύς, ''Dōrieus'' from δωρίς, ''dōris'', "woodland" (which can also mean upland).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=deru-, dōru-, dr(e)u-, drou-; drewə: drū- | first=Julius | last=Pokorny | encyclopedia=Indogermanisches Etymologisches Woerterbuch | pages=214–217 | publisher=[[Leiden University]]| url=http://www.indoeuropean.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&root=leiden&basename=\data\ie\pokorny | language=German | quote=Δωριεύς 'Dorer' (von Δωρίς 'Waldland')}}</ref> The ''dōri-'' segment is from the o-grade (either ''ō'' or ''o'') of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*deru-'', "tree", which also gives the Homeric Δούρειος Ἵππος (''Doureios Hippos'', "Wooden Horse").<ref>Πάπυρος - Λεξικό τῆς Ἑλληνικῆς Γλώσσας (Papyros - Dictionary of the Greek Language), 2007, v. 3. pp. 37–8</ref> This derivation has the advantage of naming the people after their wooded, mountainous country. 

====The lancers====
A second popular derivation was given by the French linguist, Émile Boisacq, from the same root, but from Greek {{lang|grc|δόρυ}} (''doru'') 'spear-shaft' (which was made of wood); i.e., "the people of the spear" or "spearmen."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | first=Émile | last=Boisacq | title=δὀρυ | encyclopedia=Dictionnaire Étymologique de la Langue Grecque: Étudiée dans ses Rapports avec les autres Langues Indo-Européennes | year=1916 | location=Paris | publisher=Librairie Klincksieck | language=French}}</ref> In this case the country would be named after the people, as in Saxony from the Saxons. However, [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] doubted the validity of this derivation and asserted that no good etymology exists.<ref>[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 363.</ref>

====The chosen Greeks====
It sometimes happens that different derivations of an [[Indo-European]] word exploit similar-sounding Indo-European roots. Greek ''doru'', "lance," is from the o-grade of Indo-European *''deru'', "solid," in the sense of wood. It is similar to an extended form, *''dō-ro-'', of ''*dō-'', (give), as can be seen in the modern Greek imperative δώσε (''dose'', "give [sing.]!") appearing in Greek as δῶρον (''dōron'', "gift").  This is the path taken by [[Jonathan M. Hall|Jonathan Hall]], relying on elements taken from the myth of the Return of the Herakeidai.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jonathan | last=Hall | title=Hellenicity: between ethnicity and culture | year=2002 | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago | pages=85–89}}</ref>

Hall cites the tradition, based on a fragment of the poet, [[Tyrtaeus]], that "Sparta is a divine gift granted by Zeus and Hera" to the Heracleidae. In another version, [[Tyndareus]] gives his kingdom to Heracles in gratitude for restoring him to the throne, but Heracles "asks the Spartan king to safeguard the gift until his descendants might claim it."

Hall therefore proposes that the Dorians are the people of the gift. They assumed the name on taking possession of Lacedaemon. Doris was subsequently named after them. Hall makes comparisons of Spartans to Hebrews as a chosen people maintaining a covenant with God and being assigned a Holy Land. To arrive at this conclusion, Hall relies on Herodotus' version of the myth (see below) that the Hellenes under Dorus did not take his name until reaching the Peloponnesus. In other versions the Heracleidae enlisted the help of their Dorian neighbors. Hall does not address the problem of the Dorians not calling Lacedaemon Doris, but assigning that name to some less holy and remoter land. Similarly, he does not mention the Dorian servant at Pylos, whose sacred gift, if such it was, was still being ruled by the Achaean Atreid family at Lacedaemon.

===Distinctions of language===
{{main|Doric Greek}}
The [[Doric Greek|Doric]] dialect was spoken in northwest Greece, the [[Peloponnese]], [[Crete]], southwest [[Asia Minor]], the southernmost islands of the [[Aegean Sea]], and the various Dorian colonies of [[Magna Graecia]] in [[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]]. After the classical period it was mainly replaced by the [[Attic Greek|Attic]] dialect, upon which the [[Koine Greek|Koine]] or "common" Greek language of the [[Hellenistic period]] was based. The main characteristic of Doric was the preservation of [[proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] {{IPA|[aː]}},  long {{angbr|α}}, which in Attic-Ionic became {{IPA-el|ɛː|}}, {{angbr|η}}. A famous example is the valedictory phrase uttered by Spartan mothers to their sons before sending them off to war: ἢ τὰν ἢ ἐπὶ τᾶς (''ḕ tàn ḕ epì tâs'', literally "either it or on it", i.e. either return alive with your shield, or dead upon it) would have been ἢ τὴν ἢ ἐπὶ τῆς (''ḕ t'''ḕ'''n ḕ epì t'''ê'''s'') in the [[Attic Greek|Attic]]-[[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] dialect of an Athenian mother. [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]], a descendant of Doric Greek, is still spoken in some parts of the southern [[Regions of ancient Greece#Argolis|Argolid]] coast of the [[Peloponnese]], in the modern prefecture of [[Arcadia]].

===Other cultural distinctions===
Culturally, in addition to their Doric dialect of Greek, Doric colonies retained their characteristic [[Hellenic calendar|Doric calendar]] revolving round a cycle of festivals of which the [[Hyacinthia]] and the [[Carneia]] were especially important.<ref>''[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Dorians Encyclopaedia Britannica'' 1911, ''s.v. "Dorians".]</ref>

The [[Dorian mode]] in music also was attributed to Doric societies and was associated by classical writers with martial qualities.

The [[Doric order]] of architecture in the tradition inherited by [[Vitruvius]] included the Doric column, noted for its simplicity and strength.

Dorian women had a distinctive dress, a tunic (plain dress) not needing to be pinned with brooches, which was once common to all the Hellenes. The Ionian women adopted a new dress with a brooch.<ref>5.87, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt%2e+5%2e87 online] at Perseus.</ref>

The Dorians seem to have offered the central mainland cultus for [[Helios]]. The scattering of cults of the sun god in [[Sicyon]], [[Argos]], [[Ermioni]], [[Epidaurus]] and [[Laconia]], and his holy livestock flocks at [[Taenarum]], seem to suggest that the deity was considerably important in Dorian religion, compared to other parts of ancient Greece. Additionally, it may have been the Dorians to import his worship to [[Rhodes]].<ref>Larson, Jennifer. A Land Full of Gods: Nature Deities in Greek Religion. In Ogden, Daniel. ''A Companion to Greek Religion. Malden'', MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, 56–70.</ref>

==Ancient traditions==
In [[Greek historiography]], the Dorians are mentioned by many authors. The chief classical authors to relate their origins are [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. The most copious authors, however, lived in Hellenistic and Roman times, long after the main events. This apparent paradox does not necessarily discredit the later writers, who were relying on earlier works that did not survive. The customs of the [[Sparta]]n state and its illustrious individuals are detailed at great length in such authors as [[Plutarch]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]].

===[[Homer]]===
The ''[[Odyssey]]'' has one reference to the Dorians:<ref>Book 19, Line 177.</ref><blockquote>"There is a land called [[Crete]], in the midst of the wine-dark sea, a fair, rich land, begirt with water, and therein are many men, past counting, and ninety cities. They have not all the same speech, but their tongues are mixed. There dwell [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], there great-hearted [[Eteocretans|native Cretans]], there [[Kydonia|Cydonians]], and Dorians of waving plumes, and goodly [[Pelasgians]]."</blockquote>
The reference is not compatible with a [[Dorian invasion]] that brought Dorians to Crete only after the fall of the Mycenaean states. In the ''Odyssey'', Odysseus and his relatives visit those states. Two solutions are possible, either the ''Odyssey'' is anachronistic or Dorians were on Crete in Mycenaean times. The uncertain nature of the Dorian invasion defers a definitive answer until more is known about it.

===Tyrtaeus===
[[Tyrtaeus]], a lame Athenian warrior-poet, became advisor of the Lacedaemonians in their mid-7th-century war to suppress a rebellion of the [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenians]]. The latter were a remnant of the Achaeans conquered "two generations before," which suggests a rise to supremacy at the end of the Dark Age rather than during and after the fall of Mycenae. The Messenian population was reduced to serfdom.<ref>{{cite book | editor-first=J.M. | editor-last=Edmonds | title=Elegy and Iambus | volume=I | chapter=The Elegiac Poems of Tyrtaeus | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0479%3Avolume%3D1%3Atext%3D2%3Asection%3D2 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University}}</ref>

Only a few fragments of Tyrtaeus' five books of martial verse survive. His is the earliest mention of the three Dorian tribes: [[Pamphylus (mythology)|Pamphyli]], Hylleis, [[Dymas|Dymanes]]. He also says: <blockquote>"For Cronus' Son Himself, Zeus the husband of fair-crowned Hera, hath given this city to the children of Heracles, with whom we came into the wide isle of Pelops from windy Erineus."</blockquote>
Erineus was a village of Doris. He helped to establish the Spartan constitution, giving the kings and elders, among other powers, the power to dismiss the assembly. He established a rigorous military training program for the young including songs and poems he wrote himself, such as the "Embateria or Songs of the Battle-Charge which are also called Enoplia or Songs-under-Arms." These were chants used to establish the timing of standard drills under arms. He stressed patriotism:<blockquote>"For 'tis a fair thing for a good man to fall and die fighting in the van for his native land, ... let us fight with a will for this land, and die for our children and never spare our lives."</blockquote>

===Herodotus===
[[File:Helmed Hoplite Sparta.JPG|thumb|right|Fifth century BC hoplite, or "heavy-armed soldier", possibly the Spartan king Leonidas, a Dorian, who died holding the pass at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]].]]

[[Herodotus]] was from [[Halicarnassus]], a Dorian colony on the southwest coast of [[Asia Minor]]; following the literary tradition of the times he wrote in [[Ionic Greek]], being one of the last authors to do so. He described the [[Persian Wars]], giving a thumbnail account of the histories of the antagonists, Greeks and Persians.

[[File:Peloponnese modis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peloponnesus]]. [[Sparta]] was in the valley of the lowermost bay.]]
Herodotus gives a general account of the events termed "the Dorian Invasion," presenting them as transfers of population. Their original home was in northern central Greece next to [[Thessaly]]:<ref>''Histories'', 1.57.1.</ref><blockquote>"the [[Pelasgians]] ... were once neighbors of the people now called Dorians, and at that time inhabited the country which now is called Thessalian."</blockquote>
He goes on to expand in mythological terms, giving some of the geographic details of the myth:<ref>''Histories'', 1.56.2-3.</ref><blockquote>"56. Of all the answers that had reached him, this pleased him far the best, for it seemed incredible that a mule should ever come to be king of the Medes, and so he concluded that the sovereignty would never depart from himself or his seed after him. Afterwards he turned his thoughts to the alliance which he had been recommended to contract, and sought to ascertain by inquiry which was the most powerful of the Grecian states. His inquiries pointed out to him two states as pre-eminent above the rest. These were the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians, the former of Doric the latter of Ionic blood. And indeed these two nations had held from very early times the most distinguished place in Greece, the one being a Pelasgic the other a Hellenic people, and the one having never quitted its original seats, while the other had been excessively migratory; for during the reign of Deucalion, Phthiotis was the country in which the Hellenes dwelt, but under Dorus, the son of Hellen, they moved to the tract at the base of Ossa and Olympus, which is called Histiaeotis; forced to retire from that region by the Cadmeians,[1] they settled, under the name of Macedni, in the chain of Pindus. Hence they once more removed and came to Dryopis; and from Dryopis having entered the Peloponnese in this way, they became known as Dorians.

57. What the language of the Pelasgi was I cannot say with any certainty. If, however, we may form a conjecture from the tongue spoken by the Pelasgi of the present day, - those, for instance, who live at Creston above the Tyrrhenians, who formerly dwelt in the district named Thessaliotis, and were neighbours of the people now called the Dorians, - or those again who founded Placia and Scylace upon the Hellespont, who had previously dwelt for some time with the Athenians, - or those, in short, of any other of the cities which have dropped the name but are in fact Pelasgian; if, I say, we are to form a conjecture from any of these, we must pronounce that the Pelasgi spoke a barbarous language. If this were really so, and the entire Pelasgic race spoke the same tongue, the Athenians, who were certainly Pelasgi, must have changed their language at the same time that they passed into the Hellenic body; for it is a certain fact that the people of Creston speak a language unlike any of their neighbours, and the same is true of the Placianians, while the language spoken by these two people is the same; which shows that they both retain the idiom which they brought with them into the countries where they are now settled.

58. The Hellenic race has never, since its first origin, changed its speech. This at least seems evident to me. It was a branch of the Pelasgic, which separated from the main body, and at first was scanty in numbers and of little power; but it gradually spread and increased to a multitude of nations, chiefly by the voluntary entrance into its ranks of numerous tribes of barbarians. The Pelasgi, on the other hand, were, as I think, a barbarian race which never greatly multiplied.

"</blockquote>
Thus, according to Herodotus, the Dorians did not name themselves after Dorus until they had reached Peloponnesus. Herodotus does not explain the contradictions of the myth; for example, how Doris, located outside the Peloponnesus, acquired its name. However, his goal, as he relates in the beginning of the first book, is only to report what he had heard from his sources without judgement. In the myth, the Achaeans displaced from the Peloponnesus gathered at Athens under a leader [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] and became identified as "Ionians".<ref>''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.94&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 7.94], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.44&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 8.44].</ref>

Herodotus' list of Dorian states is as follows. From northeastern Greece were [[Phthia]], [[Oreus|Histiaea]] and [[Macedon]]. In central Greece were [[Doris (Greece)|Doris]] (the former Dryopia) and in the south [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]], specifically the states of [[Laconia|Lacedaemon]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Sicyon]], [[Epidaurus]] and [[Troezen]]. Hermione was not Dorian but had joined the Dorians.<ref>''Histories'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.43&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 8.43].</ref> Overseas were the islands of [[Rhodes]], [[Kos|Cos]], [[Nisyros|Nisyrus]] and the [[Anatolia]]n cities of [[Knidos|Cnidus]], [[Halicarnassus]], [[Phaselis]] and Calydna.<ref>''Histories'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.178&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 2.178], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.99&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 7.99].</ref>  Dorians also colonised [[Crete]] including founding of such towns as [[Lato]], [[Dreros]] and [[Olous]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10847/lato.html#fieldnotes | first=C.

===Thucydides===
[[Thucydides]] professes little of Greece before the [[Trojan War]] except to say that it was full of barbarians and that there was no distinction between barbarians and Greeks. The [[Hellenes]] came from [[Phthiotis]].<ref>''Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+1.3&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 1.3].</ref> The whole country indulged in and suffered from piracy and was not settled. After the Trojan War, "Hellas was still engaged in removing and settling."<ref name=ThucI-12>''Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+1.12&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 1.12].</ref>

Some 60 years after the Trojan War the [[Boeotia]]ns were driven out of [[Tell Aran|Arne]] by the [[Thessaly|Thessalians]] into Boeotia and 20 years later "the Dorians and the Heraclids became masters of the Peloponnese."<ref name=ThucI-12/> So the lines were drawn between the Dorians and the [[Aeolians]] (here Boeotians) with the [[Ionians]] (former Peloponnesians).

Other than these few brief observations Thucydides names but few Dorians. He does make it clear that some Dorian states aligned or were forced to align with the Athenians while some Ionians went with the Lacedaemonians  and that the motives for alignment were not always ethnic but were diverse. Among the Dorians was [[Lacedaemon]],<ref>''Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+2.54&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 2.54].</ref> [[Corcyra]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] and [[Epidamnus]],<ref>''Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+1.24&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 1.24].</ref> [[Lefkada|Leucadia]], [[Ambracia]],<ref>''Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+7.58&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 7.58].</ref> [[Potidaea]],<ref>''Peloponnesian War'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+1.124&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 1.124].</ref> [[Rhodes]], [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]], [[Argos]], [[Carystus]],<ref>''Peloponnesian War'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+7.57&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 7.57].</ref> [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Gela]], [[Agrigento|Acragas]] (later Agrigentum), [[Palazzolo Acreide|Acrae]], Casmenae.<ref>''Peloponnesian War'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+6.4&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 6.4].</ref>

He does explain with considerable dismay what happened to incite ethnic war after the unity between the Greek states during the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]. The Congress of Corinth, formed prior to it, "split into two sections." Athens headed one and Lacedaemon the other:<ref>''Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+1.18&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 1.18].</ref><blockquote>"For a short time the league held together, till the Lacedaemonians and Athenians quarreled, and made war upon each other with their allies, a duel into which all the Hellenes sooner or later were drawn."</blockquote>
He adds: "the real cause I consider to be ... the growth of the power of Athens and the alarm which this inspired in Lacedaemon...."

===Pausanias===
The ''[[Description of Greece]]'' by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] relates that the [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]] of the [[Peloponnesus]] were driven from their lands by Dorians coming from [[Mount Oeta|Oeta]], a mountainous region bordering on [[Thessaly]].<ref>''Description of Greece'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus%2e+5%2e1%2e2 5.1.2].</ref> They were led by [[Hyllus]], a son of [[Heracles]],<ref>''Description of Greece'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus%2e+4%2e30%2e1 4.30.1]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus%2e+8%2e5%2e1 8.5.1]</ref> but were defeated by the Achaeans. Under other leadership they managed to be victorious over the Achaeans and remain in the Peloponnesus, a mythic theme called "the return of the [[Heracleidae]]."<ref>''Description of Greece'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus%2e+3%2e1%2e6 3.1.6], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus%2e+5%2e3%2e5 5.3.5ff], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus%2e+7%2e1%2e6 7.1.6], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus%2e+7%2e3%2e9 7.3.9], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus%2e+8%2e5%2e6 8.5.6]</ref> They had built ships at [[Naupactus]] in which to cross the [[Gulf of Corinth]].<ref>''Description of Greece'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.38.10&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 10.38.10].</ref> This invasion is viewed by the tradition of Pausanias as a return of the Dorians to the Peloponnesus, apparently meaning a return of families ruling in [[Aetolia]] and northern Greece to a land in which they had once had a share. The return is described in detail: there were "disturbances" throughout the Peloponnesus except in [[Arcadia]], and new Dorian settlers.<ref>''Description of Greece'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.13.1&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 2.13.1].</ref> Pausanias goes on to describe the conquest and resettlement of [[Laconia]], [[Messenia]], [[Argos]] and elsewhere, and the emigration from there to [[Crete]] and the coast of [[Asia Minor]].

===Diodorus Siculus===
[[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] is a rich source of traditional information concerning the mythology and history of the Dorians, especially the ''Library of History''. He does not make any such distinction but the fantastic nature of the earliest material marks it as mythical or legendary. The myths do attempt to justify some Dorian operations, suggesting that they were in part political.

[[Heracles]] was a [[Perseid dynasty|Perseid]], a member of the ruling family of Greece. His mother [[Alcmene]] had both Perseids and [[Pelops|Pelopids]] in her ancestry. A princess of the realm, she received Zeus thinking he was [[Amphitryon]]. Zeus intended his son to rule Greece but according to the rules of succession [[Eurystheus]], born slightly earlier, preempted the right. Attempts to kill Heracles as a child failed. On adulthood he was forced into the service of Eurystheus, who commanded him to perform [[Labours of Hercules|12 labors]].<ref>''Library'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.9-10.]</ref>

Heracles became a warrior without a home, wandering from place to place assisting the local rulers with various problems. He took a retinue of [[Regions of ancient Greece#Arcadia|Arcadian]]s with him acquiring also over time a family of grown sons, the Heraclidae. He continued this mode of life even after completing the 12 labors. The legend has it that he became involved with Achaean Sparta when the family of king [[Tyndareus]] was unseated and driven into exile by Hippocoön and his family, who in the process happened to kill the son of a friend of Heracles. The latter and his retinue assaulted Sparta, taking it back from Hippocoön. He recalled Tyndareus, set him up as a guardian regent, and instructed him to turn the kingdom over to any descendants of his that should claim it. Heracles went on with the way of life to which he had become accustomed, which was by today's standards that of a mercenary, as he was being paid for his assistance. Subsequently he founded a colony in [[Aetolia]], then in [[Trachis]].

After displacing the [[Dryopes]], he went to the assistance of the Dorians, who lived in a land called Hestiaeotis under king [[Aegimius]] and were campaigning against the numerically superior [[Lapithae]]. The Dorians promised him 1/3 of Doris (which they did not yet possess). He asked Aegimius to keep his share of the land "in trust" until it should be claimed by a descendant. He went on to further adventures but was poisoned by his  jealous wife, [[Deianeira]]. He immolated himself in full armor dressed for combat and "passed from among men into the company of the gods."<ref>''Library'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.33-38.]</ref>

===Strabo===
[[Strabo]],<ref>Strabo. ''[[Geographica]]''. Book 10, Section 6.</ref> who depends of course on the books available to him, goes on to elaborate:
{{quote|Of these peoples, according to [[Staphylus of Naucratis|Staphylus]], the Dorians occupy the part toward the east, the Cydonians the western part, the Eteo-Cretans the southern; and to these last belongs the town [[Praisos]], where is the temple of the Dictaean Zeus; whereas the other peoples, since they were more powerful, dwelt in the plains. Now it is reasonable to suppose that the Eteo-Cretans and the Cydonians were autochthonous, and that the others were foreigners ...<ref>The Jones translation in the [[Loeb Classical Library|Loeb]], which has Greek and English on opposing pages.</ref>}}
Beside this sole reference to Dorians in Crete, the mention of the ''[[Iliad]]'' on the [[Heracleidae|Heraclid]] [[Tlepolemus]], a warrior on the side of [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] and colonist of three important Dorian cities in [[Rhodes]] has been also regarded as a later interpolation<ref>Homer: An Introduction to the Iliad and the Odyssey By Richard Claverhous Jebb [http://books.google.com/books?id=oW7Zd5LdUo4C&pg=PA43&dq=Tlepolemus+Dorians+Homer#v=onepage&q=&f=false Page 43]  ISBN 0-554-75060-0 (2008)</ref>
