==Geography==
The territory includes {{convert|155.4|km2|1|abbr=on}} Ashmore Reef (including West, Middle, and [[East Island (Ashmore and Cartier Islands)|East]] Islands, and two [[lagoon]]s within the reef) and {{convert|44|km2|0|abbr=on}} Cartier Reef (including [[Cartier Islands|Cartier Island]]).{{citation needed | reason=An Australian Government page cited suggests Ashmore Reef is 239 sq km. | date=April 2014}} They have a total of {{convert|74.1|km|0|abbr=on}} of shoreline, measured along the outer edge of the [[reef]].{{clarify|reason=Which reef? Citation? CIA World Fact Book uses that figure, but does not say how measured.|date=April 2014}} There are no ports or harbours, only offshore anchorage.

West, Middle, and East Islands have a combined land area variously reported as 54 ha, 93 ha, and 112 ha (1 [[hectare]] is 0.01&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, or about 2.5 [[acres]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Mike|last2=Clarke|first2=Rohan|last3=Pierce|first3=Frank|last4=Dooley|first4=Sean|last5=Swann|first5=George|last6=Grant|first6=Murray|title=Lesser Coucal 'Centropus bengalensis' on Ashmore Reef: First Record for Australia|issn=1448-0107|work=Australian Field Ornithology|volume=27|issue=3|year=2010|quote=Within the reef are three small islands: West, Middle and east Islands (total land area 54 ha).

Ashmore Reef is called ''Pulau Pasir'' by Indonesians. In the [[Rote Island]] language, it is called ''Nusa Solokaek''. Both names have the meaning "Sand Island".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rspas.anu.edu.au/people/personal/foxxj_rspas/Fishermen_MOU_BOX.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060827142957/http://rspas.anu.edu.au/people/personal/foxxj_rspas/Fishermen_MOU_BOX.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-27 |title=A STUDY OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC ISSUES FACING TRADITIONAL INDONESIAN FISHERS WHO ACCESS THE MOU BOX}}</ref>

Nearby Hibernia Reef, {{convert|42|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of Ashmore Reef, is not part of the territory, but rather belongs to Western Australia.<ref>[http://www.statoids.com/uau.html States of Australia] Retrieved 2011-06-23</ref> It has no permanently dry land area, although large parts of the reef become exposed during low tide.

==Government==
{{refimprove section | date=April 2014}}

The territory is administered from [[Canberra]] by the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport, which is also responsible for the administration of the territories of [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], the [[Coral Sea Islands]], [[Jervis Bay Territory]] and [[Norfolk Island]].<ref name="AussieAG">{{cite web| author =  Assistant Director, Territories and Disaster Reconstruction Division | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.regional.gov.au/territories | publisher= Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport | date= 16 June 2012 | accessdate = 7 February 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080206093322/http://www.regional.gov.au/territories| archivedate= 6 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> As part of the Machinery of Government Changes following the 2010 Federal Election, administrative responsibility for Territories was transferred from the Attorney General's Department to the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport. Defence of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is the responsibility of Australia, with periodic visits by the [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]]. The vessel [[ACV Ashmore Guardian|ACV ''Ashmore Guardian'']] is stationed more-or-less permanently off the reef. The islands are also visited by seasonal caretakers and occasional scientific researchers.

On 21 October 2002 the nature reserve was recognised as a wetland of international importance when it was designated Ramsar Site 1220 under the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar Convention on Wetlands]].<ref name=ARL>Annotated Ramsar List.</ref>

Due to its proximity to Indonesia, and the area being traditional fishing grounds of Indonesian fishermen for centuries, some Indonesian groups claims Ashmore Reef to be part of [[Rote Ndao Regency]] of [[East Nusa Tenggara]] province. However, the Indonesian government does not appear to actively contest Australia's possession of the territory. Australia's sovereignty is backed up by the fact that the territory was not administered by the [[Netherlands]] (Indonesia's former colonial power), but by the [[United Kingdom|British]] before it was transferred to Australia.

A memorandum of understanding between the Australian and Indonesian governments allows Indonesian fishermen access to their traditional fishing grounds within the region [[special purpose visa|without any formal visa arrangements]], subject to limits.

===Ashmore Reef Commonwealth Marine Reserve===
[[File:Cartier Island.png|thumb|right|Cartier Island and surrounding reef ([[NASA]] satellite image)]]
The Ashmore Reef Commonwealth Marine Reserve (formerly Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve), established in August 1983, comprises an area of approximately {{convert|583|km2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://laptop.deh.gov.au/marinereserves/north-west/ashmore/index.html | accessdate=2014-04-14 | date=2013-06-17 | work=Commonwealth Marine Reserves | publisher=Department of the Environment, Australian Government | title=Ashmore Reef Commonwealth Marine Reserve }}</ref> It is of significant [[biodiversity]] value as it is in the flow of the [[Indonesian Throughflow]] ocean current from the Pacific Ocean through [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] to the Indian Ocean.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} It is also in a surface current west from the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Timor Sea]].

The Reserve comprises several marine habitats, including seagrass meadows, intertidal sand flats, coral reef flats, and lagoons, and supports an important and diverse range of species, including 14 species of [[sea snake]]s, a population of [[dugong]] that may be genetically distinct, a diverse [[marine invertebrate]] fauna, and many [[endemism|endemic]] species, especially of sea snakes and [[mollusc]]s. There are feeding and nesting sites for [[Loggerhead Turtle|loggerhead]], [[Hawksbill turtle|hawksbill]] and [[green turtle]]s.  It is classified as an [[Important Bird Area]]  and has 50,000 breeding pairs of various kinds of [[seabird]]s.  A high abundance and diversity of [[sea cucumber]]s, [[over-exploitation|over-exploited]] on other reefs in the region, is present, with 45 species recorded.<ref name=ARL/>

===Cartier Island Commonwealth Marine Reserve===
The Cartier Island Commonwealth Marine Reserve (formerly Cartier Island Marine Reserve), established in June 2000, comprises an area of approximately {{convert|172|km2|0|abbr=on}}, within a 4 nautical mile radius from the center of Cartier Island, and extends to a depth of {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} below the sea floor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://laptop.deh.gov.au/marinereserves/north-west/cartier/index.html | accessdate=2014-04-14 | date=2013-06-17 | work=Commonwealth Marine Reserves | publisher=Department of the Environment, Australian Government | title=Cartier Island Commonwealth Marine Reserve }}</ref> It includes the reef around Cartier island, a small submerged pinaccle called Wave Governor Bank, and two shallow pools to the island's northeast.

==Economy and migration==
There is no economic activity in the Territory. As Ashmore Reef is the closest point of Australian territory to Indonesia, it was a popular target for [[people smugglers]] transporting [[asylum seekers]] to Australia<ref>Anita Roberts [http://web.archive.org/web/20080830045428/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edit66/anita4.htm "Don't let them drown"] ''Inside Indonesia'' Apr–Jun 2001, vol. 64</ref> despite its only [[water well|well]]s being infected with [[cholera]] or contaminated and [[potable water|undrinkable]].<ref>[http://www.defence.gov.au/news/NAVYNEWS/editions/1999/06_28_99/story03.htm Bizarre Happenings at Reef], [[Royal Australian Navy]] News, 28 June 1999, accessed 29 July 2010</ref> Once they had landed on Ashmore, asylum seekers could claim to have entered Australian territory and request to be processed as refugees. The use of Ashmore for this purpose created great notoriety during late 2001, when refugee arrivals became a major political issue in Australia. As Australia was not the country of first asylum for these "[[boat people]]", the Australian Government did not consider that it had a responsibility to accept them.

A number of things were done to discourage the practice such as attempting to have the people smugglers arrested in Indonesia; the so-called [[Pacific Solution]] of processing them in third countries; the boarding and forced turnaround of the boats by Australian military forces, and finally excising Ashmore and many other small islands from the [[Australian migration zone]]. Two boatloads of asylum seekers were each detained for several days in the lagoon at Ashmore after failed attempts by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] to turn them back to Indonesia in October 2001.
