The earliest designs featured a slot in the stock, down into which the string was placed. To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up through a hole in the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out. This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a trigger or &quot;tickler&quot;. A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a &quot;nut&quot; to retain the string. This nut has a perpendicular center slot for the bolt, and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the internal trigger sits. They often also have some form of strengthening internal &quot;sear&quot; or trigger face, usually of metal. These &quot;roller nuts&quot; were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording, or mounted on a metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally. Nuts were made of antler, bone, or metal. Bows could be kept and ready to shoot for some time with little effort, allowing crossbowmen to aim better.<extension extension_name='ref'>Hanafi et al. 2011: 23</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The bow (called the &quot;prod&quot; or &quot;lath&quot; on a crossbow) of early crossbows was made of a single piece of wood, usually<space/><link><target>Ash tree</target><part>ash</part></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Taxus</target><part>yew</part></link>. Composite bows are made from layers of different materialoften wood, horn and sinewglued together and bound with animal tendon. These composite bows, made of several layers, are much stronger and more efficient in releasing energy than simple wooden bows. As steel became more widely available in Europe around the 14th century, steel prods came into use.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">March 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The crossbow prod is very short compared to ordinary bows, resulting in a short draw length. This leads to a higher draw weight in order to store the same amount of energy. Furthermore, the thick prods are a bit less efficient at releasing energy, but more energy can be stored by a crossbow.

One way to classify them is the acceleration system, while another is the size and energy, degree of automation or projectiles.</paragraph><paragraph>A<space/><link><target>recurve bow</target><part>recurve</part></link><space/>crossbow is a bow that has tips curving away from the archer. The recurve bow's bent limbs have a longer draw length than an equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving more acceleration to the projectile and less hand shock. Recurved limbs also put greater strain on the materials used to make the bow, and they may make more noise with the shot.</paragraph><paragraph>Multiple bow systems have a special system of pulling the sinew via several bows (which can be recurve bows). The workings can be compared to a modern compound bow system. The weapon uses several different bows instead of one bow with a tackle system to achieve a higher acceleration of the sinew via the multiplication with each bow's pulling effect.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">April 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>A compound crossbow is a modern crossbow and is similar to a<space/><link><target>compound bow</target></link>. The limbs are usually much stiffer than those of a recurve crossbow. This limb stiffness makes the compound bow more energy efficient than other bows, but the limbs are too stiff to be drawn comfortably with a string attached directly to them. The compound bow has the string attached to the pulleys, one or both of which has one or more cables attached to the opposite limb. When the string is drawn back, the string causes the pulleys to turn. This causes the pulleys to pull the cables, which in turn causes the limbs to bend and thus store energy. Other types of compound bows use either (one or both) cam shaped or eccentrically mounted pulleys in order to provide a &quot;let off&quot;, such that the archer is not holding against the maximum draw weight of the bow while trying to aim. But in a crossbow the string is held back mechanically, so there is no advantage in providing a let off. Therefore, compound crossbows generally use only pulleys that are both round and concentrically mounted, in order to capture the maximum available energy from the relatively short draw length.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:HJRK A 108 - Wallarmbrust c. 1460-70.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>15th-century ''Wallarmbrust'', a heavy crossbow used for siege defense.</part></link>The smallest crossbows are pistol crossbows.

They almost completely superseded hand bows in many European armies in the 12th century for a number of reasons.In modern tests, longbows showed a higher rate of shot than crossbows of the same energy, due to the difficulty of the shooter in handling the mechanical parts for loading in the same time as the bow was pulled. With lots of training, a longbowman can achieve a high degree of accuracy that is comparable to the much steeper learning curve in aimed shooting with the crossbow. Despite strength training, there are physical limits to the longbow, unlike the crossbow, which can store several times the energy, but will be less efficient in translating stored into kinetic energy due to the thicker spring material.There is no record from the Middle Ages comparing longbowmen and crossbowmen shooting in one army from a similar position, although such occasions are known with visiting Englishmen in the Baltic and Scottish in the French army.</paragraph><paragraph>In the armies of Europe,<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Citation</target><arg name="last"><space/>Verbruggen<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>J.F<space/></arg><arg name="coauthors"><space/>Second revised and enlarged, edition, in English translation<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>1997<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>The art of warfare in Western Europe during the Middle Ages<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Boydell&Brewer<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">0-85115-570-7<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>mounted and unmounted crossbowmen, often mixed with slingers, javeliners and archers, occupied a central position in battle formations.

Furthermore, the crossbow could hold the tension for a long time, whereas even the strongest longbowman could only hold a drawn bow for so long. The ease of use of a crossbow allows it to be used effectively with little training, while other types of bows take far more skill to fire accurately. The disadvantage is the greater weight and clumsiness compared to a bow, as well as the slower rate of shooting and the lower efficiency of the acceleration system, but there would be reduced<space/><link><target>Hysteresis#Elastic hysteresis</target><part>elastic hysteresis</part></link>, making the crossbow a more accurate weapon.</paragraph><paragraph>Crossbows have a much smaller draw length than bows.

While some jurisdictions regard crossbows the same as firearms, many others do not require any sort of license to own a crossbow.
