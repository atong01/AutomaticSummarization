==History and significance==
{{Main|History of the Burgess Shale}}
[[Image:ROM-BurgessShale-CompleteAnomalocarisFossil.png|thumb|left|The first complete ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' fossil found.]]
{{Burgess Shale}}

The Burgess Shale was discovered by [[palaeontologist]] [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]] on 30 August 1909,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://burgess-shale.rom.on.ca/en/history/discoveries/02-walcott.php | title=Charles Walcott | publisher=[[Royal Ontario Museum]] | accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref> towards the end of the season's fieldwork.{{fotbs}} He returned in 1910 with his sons, daughter, and wife, establishing a quarry on the flanks of Fossil Ridge. The significance of soft-bodied preservation, and the range of organisms he recognised as new to science, led him to return to the quarry almost every year until 1924. At that point, aged 74, he had amassed over 65,000 specimens. Describing the fossils was a vast task, pursued by Walcott until his death in 1927.<ref name="fotbs">[[Fossils of the Burgess Shale]]</ref> Walcott, led by scientific opinion at the time, attempted to categorise all fossils into living taxa, and as a result, the fossils were regarded as little more than curiosities at the time. It was not until 1962 that a first-hand reinvestigation of the fossils was attempted, by Alberto Simonetta. This led scientists to recognise that Walcott had barely scratched the surface of information available in the Burgess Shale, and also made it clear that the organisms did not fit comfortably into modern groups.

Excavations were resumed at the [[Walcott Quarry]] by the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] under the persuasion of [[trilobite]] expert [[Harry Blackmore Whittington]], and a new quarry, the Raymond, was established about 20 metres higher up Fossil Ridge.<ref name=fotbs/> Whittington, with the help of research students [[Derek Briggs]] and [[Simon Conway Morris]] of the [[University of Cambridge]], began a thorough reassessment of the Burgess Shale, and revealed that the fauna represented were much more diverse and unusual than Walcott had recognized.<ref name=fotbs/> Indeed, many of the animals present had bizarre [[body form|anatomical features]] and only the slightest resemblance to other known animals. Examples include ''[[Opabinia]]'', with five eyes and a snout like a vacuum cleaner hose and ''[[Hallucigenia]]'', which was originally reconstructed upside down, walking on bilaterally symmetrical spines.

With [[Parks Canada]] and [[UNESCO]] recognising the significance of the Burgess Shale, collecting fossils became politically more difficult from the mid-1970s. Collections continued to be made by the [[Royal Ontario Museum]]. The curator of invertebrate palaeontology, [[Desmond Collins]], identified a number of additional outcrops, [[stratigraphically]] both higher and lower than the original Walcott quarry.<ref name=fotbs/> These localities continue to yield new organisms faster than they can be studied.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s book ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', published in 1989, brought the Burgess Shale fossils to the public's attention. Gould suggests that the extraordinary diversity of the fossils indicates that life forms at the time were much more disparate in body form than those that survive today, and that many of the unique lineages were evolutionary experiments that became extinct. Gould's interpretation of the diversity of Cambrian fauna relied heavily on Simon Conway Morris' reinterpretation of Charles Walcott's original publications. However, Conway Morris strongly disagreed with Gould's conclusions, arguing that almost all the Cambrian fauna could be classified into modern day [[Phylum|phyla]].<ref name="crucible">{{cite book|author=Simon Conway Morris|title =The Crucible of Creation: The Burgess Shale and the Rise of Animals|publisher =Oxford University Press|year =1998|page=316|isbn =0-19-286202-2}}</ref>

The Burgess Shale has attracted the interest of paleoclimatologists who want to study and predict long-term future changes in Earth's climate. According to Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee in the 2003 book ''The Life and Death of Planet Earth'', climatologists study the fossil records in the Burgess Shale to understand the climate of the Cambrian Explosion, and use it to predict what Earth's climate in the future when a warming and expanding Sun combined with declining CO2 levels eventually heat the Earth toward temperatures not seen since the first plants and animals, and therefore understand how and when the last living things will die out.

In February 2014, the discovery was announced of another Burgess Shale outcrop in [[Kootenay National Park]] to the south. In just 15 days of field collecting in 2013, 50 animal species were unearthed at the new site.<ref>{{cite news| title ='Epic' new fossil site found in B.C. national park| newspaper =[[Canoe.ca]]| publisher =[[Quebecor Media]]| date =11 February 2014| url =http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Science/2014/02/10/21461856.html| accessdate =11 February 2014 }}</ref>

The fossiliferous deposits of the Burgess Shale correlate to the [[Stephen formation]], a collection of slightly calcareous dark mudstones, about {{Ma|burgess shale|million years}} old.<ref name=fotbs/> The beds were deposited at the base of a cliff about 160&nbsp;m tall,<ref name=fotbs/> below the depth agitated by waves during storms.<ref name=Gabbott2008>{{Cite journal

This protection explains why fossils preserved further from the Cathedral Formation are impossible to work with — tectonic squeezing of the beds has produced a vertical cleavage that fractures the rocks, so they split perpendicular to the fossils.<ref name=fotbs/> The Walcott quarry produced such spectacular fossils because it was so close to the Stephen Formation — indeed the quarry has now been excavated to the very edge of the Cambrian cliff.<ref name=fotbs/>

It was originally thought that the Burgess Shale was deposited in anoxic conditions, but mounting research shows that oxygen was continually present in the sediment.<ref name=Powell2009>{{Cite journal| year = 2009| last1 = Powell| doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.02.016| pages = 127–140| issue = 1–2| title = Comparison of Geochemical and Distinctive Mineralogical Features Associated with the Kinzers and Burgess Shale Formations and their Associated Units| journal = Palaeogeography Palaeoclimatology Palaeoecology| volume = 277| first1 = W.}}</ref> The anoxic setting had been thought to not only protect the newly dead organisms from decay, but it also created chemical conditions allowing the preservation of the soft parts of the organisms. Further, it reduced the abundance of burrowing organisms — burrows and trackways ''are'' found in beds containing soft-bodied organisms, but they are rare and generally of limited vertical extent.<ref name=fotbs/> Brine seeps are an alternative hypothesis; see [[Burgess Shale type preservation]] for a more thorough discussion.

{{Further|Burgess Shale type preservation}}

There are many other comparable Cambrian ''[[lagerstätte]]n''; indeed such assemblages are far more common in the Cambrian than in any other period. This is mainly due to the limited extent of burrowing activity; as such [[bioturbation]] [[Cambrian substrate revolution|became more prevalent]] throughout the Cambrian, environments capable of preserving organisms' soft parts became much rarer.<ref name=fotbs/> (The [[pre-Cambrian]] fossil record of animals is sparse and ambiguous.)

==Biota==
{{Main|Fossils of the Burgess Shale|Burgess Shale type fauna}}

The biota of the Burgess Shale appears to be typical of Middle Cambrian deposits.<ref name=fotbs/> Although the hard-part bearing organisms make up as little as 14% of the community,<ref name=fotbs/> these same organisms are found in similar proportions in other Cambrian localities. This means that there is no reason to assume that the organisms without hard parts are exceptional in any way; indeed, many appear in other lagerstätten of different age and locations.<ref name=fotbs/>

The biota consists of a range of organisms. Free-swimming ([[Nekton|nectonic]]) organisms are relatively rare, with the majority of organisms being bottom dwelling (benthic) — either moving about (vagrant) or permanently attached to the sea floor (sessile).<ref name=fotbs/> About two-thirds of the Burgess Shale organisms lived by feeding on the organic content in the muddy sea floor, while almost a third filtered out fine particles from the water column. Under 10% of organisms were predators or scavengers, although since these organisms were larger, the biomass was split equally among each of the filter feeding, deposit feeding, predatory and scavenging organisms.<ref name=fotbs/>

Many Burgess Shale organisms represent [[stem-group]] members of the modern animal phyla, though crown-group representatives of certain phyla are also present.<ref>e.g. {{cite doi|10.1038/nature14573}}</ref>

==Working with the Burgess Shale==

The fossils of the Burgess Shale are preserved as black carbon films on black shales, and so are difficult to photograph; however, various photographic techniques can improve the quality of the images that can be acquired.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bengtson|first=Stefan|title=Teasing Fossils out of Shales with Cameras and Computers|journal=Palaeontologia Electronica|year=2000|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://palaeo-electronica.org/2000_1/fossils/text.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2010}}</ref> Other techniques include backscatter SEM, elemental mapping and ''[[camera lucida]]'' drawing.

Once images have been acquired, the effects of decay and [[taphonomy]] must be accounted for before a correct anatomical reconstruction can be made. A consideration of the combination of characters allows researchers to establish the taxonomic affinity.
