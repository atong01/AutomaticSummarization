[[Copenhagen Airport]] is the largest airport in [[Scandinavia]], handling approximately 23m passengers per year (2011).  It is located at [[Kastrup]], 8&nbsp;km south-east of central [[Copenhagen]]. It is connected by train to [[Copenhagen Central Station]] and beyond as well as to [[Malmö]] and other towns in [[Sweden]].

For the west of the country, the major airport is [[Billund Airport|Billund]] (2.7m passengers in 2011) although both  [[Aalborg Airport|Aalborg]] (1.4m passengers in 2011) and [[Aarhus Airport|Aarhus]] (591.000 passengers in 2011) have smaller airports with regular connections to Copenhagen.

=== List of airports ===
{{Further|List of the largest airports in the Nordic countries }}

Denmark's main airports are:

* [[Copenhagen Airport]] (CPH), Scandinavia's busiest passenger airport located at Kastrup to the south-east of Copenhagen city and handling over 25 million passengers a year.
* [[Billund Airport]] (BLL), in central Jutland, one of Denmark's busiest cargo centres as well as a popular charter airline destination and an airport for regular flights serving 2.8 million passengers a year, mainly from the western part of the country.
* [[Aalborg Airport]] (AAL), located 5&nbsp;km northwest of [[Aalborg]], is Denmark's third busiest airport serving around 1,4 million passengers a year in connections with 25 European destinations and one of Europes busiest domestic lines to Copenhagen.
* [[Aarhus Airport]] (AAH), located 39&nbsp;km northeast of Århus, serves some 540,000 passengers a year.

Other airports include: 
* [[Karup Airport]] (KRP) near [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] in the west of Jutland, mainly serving Copenhagen with some 200,000 passengers a year.

==Sea==
Being an island state with a long coastline and always close to the sea, maritime transport has always been important in Denmark. From the primitive [[Dugout (boat)|dugouts]] of the [[Nordic Stone Age|Stone Age]] to the complex designs of the [[Viking ship]]s in the [[Viking Age]], often built to exactly facilitate large scale cargo and passenger transportation. Denmark also engaged in the large scale cargo freights and [[Atlantic slave trade|slave transports]] of the [[History of colonialism|European colonization]] endeavours in the Middle Ages and had several smaller [[Danish colonial empire|colonies of its own]] across the globe.

Today Denmark's ports handle some 48 million passengers and 109 million tonnes of cargo per year.<ref>[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTable=SKIB101&PLanguage=1&PXSId=0 Call of vessels, passengers and throughput of goods in traffic ports by seaport and unit.] Statistics Denmark.

===Passenger traffic===
[[File:Rødbyhavn - færgehavnen.JPG|thumb|right|Rødbyhavn ferry terminal on [[Lolland]]]] 
Passenger traffic is made up partly of ferry crossings within Denmark, partly of international ferry crossings and partly of cruise ship passengers.

Among the most important ports for passenger traffic (thousands of passengers per year in 2007) are:
* [[Helsingør]] 10,966
* [[Rødby]]havn 7,058
* [[Frederikshavn]] 2,894
* [[Sjællands Odde]] 2,233
* [[Esbjerg]] 1,827
* [[Gedser]] 1,612

In 2007, 288 cruise ships visited Copenhagen.

===Cargo traffic===
Among the most important ports for cargo traffic (millions of tonnes per year in 2007) are:
* [[Fredericia]] 15,326
* [[Aarhus]] 12,189
* [[Port of Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] 7,379
* [[Helsingør]] 4,480

* [[Frederikshavn]] 3,200
* [[Aalborg|Aalborg Portland]] 2,999
* [[Aalborg]] 2,749
* [[Odense]] 2,616

===Waterways===
Waterways has historically and traditionally been crucial to local transportation in Denmark proper. Especially the [[Gudenå]] river-system in central Jutland, has played an important role. The waterways was navigated by wooden [[barge]]s and later on [[steamboat]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/the-towpath-along-the-gudenaaen-river|title=The towpath along the Gudenåen River|publisher=The Heritage Agency of Denmark (Danish agency for Culture)|website=1001 stories of Denmark|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> A few historical steamboats are still in operation, like the [[SS Hjejlen]] from 1861 at [[Silkeborg]].

There is a 160&nbsp;km natural canal through the shallow [[Limfjorden]] in northern Jutland, linking the [[North Sea]] to the [[Kattegat]].

Many waterways has formerly been redirected and led through manmade canals in the 1900s, but mainly for agricultural purposes and not to facilitate transportation on any major scale. Several cities have manmade canals used for transportation and traffic purposes. Of special mention are the [[:Category:Canals in Copenhagen|canals of Copenhagen]] and the [[Odense Canal]], ferrying large numbers of both tourists and local citizens.<ref>[http://www.worldcanals.com/english/denmark.html World Canals - Denmark.] Retrieved 26 March 2009.</ref>

Bicycling in Denmark is a common and popular [[utility cycling|utilitarian]] and [[recreation]]al activity. [[Bicycle-friendly#Cycling infrastructure|Bicycling infrastructure]] is a dominant feature of both city and countryside infrastructure, with [[bicycle path]]s and [[segregated cycle facilities|bicycle ways]] in many places and an extensive network of [[national and regional bicycle routes throughout Denmark|bicycle routes]], extending more than {{convert|12000|km|mi}} nationwide.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.visitdenmark.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/inspiration/aktivferie/cykel/cykel-ruter-og-regioner.htm | title = Cykelruter og regioner | accessdate =16 August 2011 | publisher = [[VisitDenmark]] | language = Danish}}</ref> In comparison, [[Denmark#Geography|Denmark's coastline]] is {{convert|7314|km|mi}}. As a unique feature, Denmark has a [[Danish bicycle VIN-system|VIN-system for bicycles]] which is mandatory by law.
