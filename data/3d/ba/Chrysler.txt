'''Chrysler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|aɪ|s|l|ər}}), officially '''FCA US LLC''', is an American [[automobile manufacturer]] headquartered in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]] and owned by holding company [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]], headquartered in [[London]], U.K.<ref name="autonews.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20140121/OEM/140129980/fiat-completes-chrysler-acquisition-in-4-35-billion-deal#axzz2r8024er1 |title=Fiat completes Chrysler acquisition in $4.35 billion deal |publisher=Autonews.com |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> Chrysler is one of the "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]" American automobile manufacturers. It sells vehicles worldwide under its flagship [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] brand, as well as the [[Dodge]], [[Jeep]] and [[Ram Trucks|Ram]]. Other major divisions include [[Mopar]], its automotive parts and accessories division, and [[Street & Racing Technology|SRT]], its performance automobile division. In 2014, FCA US LLC is the [[Automotive industry#By manufacturer|seventh biggest]] automaker in the world by production.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://oica.net/wp-content/uploads/ranking.pdf |title=World motor vehicle production OICA correspondents survey without double counts world ranking of manufacturers year 2011}}</ref>

The Chrysler Corporation was founded by [[Walter Chrysler]] in 1925,<ref name="jbchrysler">{{cite web|url= http://www.jbcarpages.com/chrysler/|title=Chrysler Reviews and History|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref> out of what remained of the [[Maxwell automobile|Maxwell Motor Company]]. Chrysler greatly expanded in 1928, when it acquired the [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] truck company and the [[Dodge|Dodge Brothers Company]] and began selling vehicles under those brands; that same year it also established the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] and [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] automobile brands.

In the 1960s the company expanded into Europe, creating the [[Chrysler Europe]] division, formed from the acquisition of French, British and Spanish companies. In the 1970s, a number of factors including the [[1973 oil crisis]] impacted Chrysler's sales, and by the late 1970s, Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy, forcing its retreat from Europe in 1979. [[Lee Iacocca]] was brought in as CEO and is credited with returning the company to profitability in the 1980s. In 1987, Chrysler acquired [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC), which brought the profitable Jeep brand under the Chrysler umbrella.

In 1998, Chrysler merged with German automaker [[Daimler-Benz|Daimler-Benz AG]] to form DaimlerChrysler; the merger proved contentious with investors and Chrysler was sold to [[Cerberus Capital Management]] and renamed Chrysler LLC in 2007. Like the other Big Three automobile manufacturers, Chrysler was hit hard by the [[automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010]].

Through a combination of negotiations with creditors, filing for [[Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization|Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization]] on April 30, 2009, and participating in a bailout from the U.S. government through the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]], Chrysler managed to remain in business. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the [[United Auto Workers]] pension fund, [[Fiat S.p.A.]], and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. The bankruptcy resulted in Chrysler defaulting on over $4 billion in debts. By May 24, 2011, Chrysler finished repaying its obligations to the U.S. government five years early, although the cost to the American taxpayer was $1.3 billion. Over the next few years Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares while removing much of the weight of the loans (which carried a 21% interest rate) in a short period. On January 1, 2014, Fiat S.p.A announced a deal to purchase the rest of Chrysler from the United Auto Workers retiree health trust. The deal was completed on January 21, 2014, making Chrysler Group a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A.<ref name="autonews.com"/> In May 2014, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, NV]] was born by merging Fiat S.p.A. into the company. This was completed in August 2014. Chrysler Group LLC remained a subsidiary until December 15, 2014, when it was renamed FCA US LLC, to reflect the Fiat-Chrysler merger.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chrysler Group LLC is now FCA US LLC.|url=http://www.fcausllc.com/Pages/Home.aspx|website=fcausllc.com|accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Chrysler}}

The Chrysler company was founded by [[Walter Chrysler]] (1875–1940) on June 6, 1925,<ref>{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Mike |last2=Tell |first2=David |title=The Technology Century: 100 years of The Engineering Society 1895–1995 | publisher=Engineering Society of Detroit |year=1995 |page=53 |isbn=978-1-56378-022-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Lockwood |first=Cliff |url=http://www.chryslerclub.org/walterp.html | title=Early Chrysler Corporate History: 1903–1928 |date=October 18, 1968 |publisher=Chrysler Club pages |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref> when the [[Maxwell automobile|Maxwell Motor Company]] (est. 1904) was re-organized into the Chrysler Corporation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chryslerclub.org/walterp.html |title=A Brief Look at Walter P.

Walter Chrysler arrived at the ailing Maxwell-[[Chalmers Automobile|Chalmers]] company in the early 1920s. He was hired to overhaul the company's troubled operations (after a similar rescue job at the [[Willys]]-Overland car company).<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Kimes |editor-first=Beverly R. |editor2-last=Clark, Jr. | editor2-first=Henry A. |title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805–1942 |year=1996 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=978-0-87341-428-9 |page=292}}</ref> In late 1923 production of the Chalmers automobile was ended.<ref>Kimes, p. 257.</ref>

In January 1924, Walter Chrysler launched the well-received Chrysler automobile. The Chrysler was a 6-cylinder automobile, designed to provide customers with an advanced, well-engineered car, but at a more affordable price than they might expect. (Elements of this car are traceable to a [[prototype]] which had been under development at Willys during Chrysler's tenure).<ref>Kimes, pp. 292, 1498.</ref> The original 1924 Chrysler included a carburetor air filter, high compression engine, full pressure lubrication, and an oil filter, features absent from most autos at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zatz |first=David |title=Chrysler Technological Innovations |url=http://www.allpar.com/corporate/technology.html |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Yost|first=Mark|title=A Nation of Drivers|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204573704577187152424740014.html |date=January 31, 2012 |page=D5 |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref> Among the innovations in its early years were the first practical mass-produced four-wheel hydraulic brakes, a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and rubber engine mounts to reduce vibration.
Chrysler also developed a wheel with a ridged rim, designed to keep a deflated tire from flying off the wheel. This wheel was eventually adopted by the auto industry worldwide.

Following the introduction of the Chrysler, the Maxwell brand was dropped after the 1925 model year. The new, lower-priced four-cylinder Chryslers introduced for the 1926 year were [[badge-engineering|badge-engineered]] Maxwells.<ref>Kimes, pp. 292–293, 901</ref> The advanced engineering and testing that went into Chrysler Corporation cars helped to push the company to the second-place position in U.S. sales by 1936, a position it would last hold in 1949.

In 1928, the Chrysler Corporation began dividing its vehicle offerings by price class and function. The [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] brand was introduced at the low-priced end of the market (created essentially by once again reworking and rebadging Chrysler's four-cylinder model).<ref>Kimes, pp. 296, 1156.</ref> At the same time, the [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] brand was introduced in the medium-price field. Also in 1928, Chrysler bought the Dodge Brothers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timelessrides.com/wiki/dodge |title=Dodge Car History, Car Data, Information, Pictures |publisher=Timeless Rides |accessdate=April 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120408194842/http://www.timelessrides.com:80/wiki/dodge |archivedate=8 April 2012 }}</ref> automobile and truck company and continued the successful [[Dodge]] line of automobiles and Fargo range of trucks. By the mid-1930s, the DeSoto and Dodge divisions would trade places in the corporate hierarchy.

[[File:Chrysler Imperial car-1955.JPG|thumb|1955 Imperial car model shown on display at January 1955 Chicago Auto Show]]
The [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] name had been used since 1926, but was never a separate make, just the top-of-the-line Chrysler. In 1955, the company decided to spin it off as its own make and division to better compete with its rivals, Lincoln and Cadillac.

On April 28, 1955, Chrysler and [[Philco]] had announced the development and production of the World’s First All-Transistor car radio.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chrysler Promises Car Radio With Transistors Instead of Tubes in '56 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 28, 1955 |page=1}}</ref> The all-transistor car radio Mopar model 914HR, was developed and produced by Chrysler and Philco, and was an $150.00 "option" on the 1956 Imperial car models.

On September 28, 1957, Chrysler had announced the first production electronic fuel injection (EFI), as an option on some of its new 1958 car models (Chrysler 300D, Dodge D500, DeSoto Adventurer, Plymouth Fury). The first attempt to use this system was by [[American Motors]] on the 1957 [[Rambler Rebel]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walton |first=Harry |title=How Good is Fuel Injection? |journal=Popular Science |date=March 1957 |volume=170|issue=3 |pages=88–93 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=byEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88&dq=1957+Rambler+fuel+injection |accessdate=June 24, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com">{{cite web| url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel2.htm |title=Rambler Measures Up |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |date=September 22, 2007 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}</ref> [[Bendix Corporation]]'s Electrojector used a transistor computer brain modulator box, but teething problems on [[pre-production car]]s meant very few cars were made.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aird |first=Forbes |title=Bosch fuel injection systems |publisher=HP Trade|year=2001 |page=29 |isbn=978-1-55788-365-0 }}</ref> The EFI system in the Rambler ran fine in warm weather, but suffered hard starting in cooler temperatures and AMC decided not to use this EFI system, on its 1957 Rambler Rebel production cars that were sold to the public.<ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"/> Chrysler also used the Bendix "Electrojector" fuel injection system and only around 35 vehicles were built with this option, on its 1958 production built car models.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |date=September 29, 1957 |page=A9 |title=New Chrysler Fuel System Is Introduced }}</ref><ref name=allpar>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/desoto/electrojector.html |publisher=Allpar.com |title=1958 DeSoto Electrojector - World’s First Electronic Fuel Injection? |first=George |last=Mattar |accessdate=29 July 2013 }}</ref> Owners of EFI Chryslers were so dissatisfied that all but one were retrofitted with carburetors (while that one has been completely restored, with original EFI electronic problems resolved).<ref name=allpar/>

Imperial would see new body styles introduced every two to three years, all with V8 engines and automatic transmissions, as well as technologies that would filter down to Chrysler corporation's other models. Imperial was folded back into the Chrysler brand in 1973.

The [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]] was also introduced for 1960 as a distinct brand. In the U.S. market, Valiant was made a model in the Plymouth line for 1961 and the DeSoto make was discontinued during 1961. With those exceptions per applicable year and market, Chrysler's range from lowest to highest price from the 1940s through the 1970s was Valiant, Plymouth, Dodge, DeSoto, Chrysler, and Imperial.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chrysler Brands, Subsidiaries, and Related Companies |publisher=Allpar |url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/auto |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Tombstone (financial industry) ad - Chrysler buys AMC 13 August 1987.jpg|thumb|right|In 1987 Chrysler purchased [[American Motors]] from [[Renault]] ]]
In 1985, Chrysler entered an agreement with [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) to produce [[Chrysler M platform]] rear-drive, as well as [[Dodge Omni]]s front wheel drive cars, in AMC's [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] plant. In 1987, Chrysler acquired the 47% ownership of AMC that was held by [[Renault]]. The remaining outstanding shares of AMC were purchased on the NYSE by August 5, 1987, making the deal valued somewhere between US$1.7 billion and US$2 billion, depending on how costs were counted.<ref>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=dR3wmKlfnrMC&pg=PA117&dq=Chrysler+purchase+of+AMC+billion |page=117 |title=Jeep Color History |first=Steve |last=Statham |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7603-0636-9 |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref>  Chrysler CEO [[Lee Iacocca]] wanted the Jeep brand, particularly the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)]] that was under development, the world-class, brand-new manufacturing plant in [[Bramalea, Ontario]], as well as AMC's engineering and management talent that became critical for Chrysler's future success.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_daimlerchrysler_ifs/index.html |title=DaimlerChrysler: The 'What Ifs?' |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=June 1, 1998 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> Chrysler established the [[Jeep-Eagle|Jeep/Eagle division]] as a "specialty" arm to market products distinctly different from the [[Chrysler K platform|K-car-based]] products with the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] cars targeting import buyers.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/history/eagle.html |last=Minick |first=Dan |title=A Brief History of Eagle |publisher=allpar.com |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> Former AMC [[Car dealership|dealers]] sold [[Jeep]] vehicles and various new Eagle models, as well as Chrysler products, strengthening the automaker's retail distribution system.

In 1998, Chrysler and its subsidiaries entered into a partnership dubbed a "merger of equals" with German-based [[Daimler-Benz]] AG, creating the combined entity [[DaimlerChrysler AG]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jbcarpages.com/chrysler/history/|title=Chrysler History|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref> To the surprise of many stockholders, Daimler subsequently acquired Chrysler in a stock swap,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/09/business/company-news-daimler-benz-and-chrysler-revise-ratio-for-stock-swap.html |title=Company News; Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Revise Ratio for Stock Swap |date=June 9, 1998 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref> before the retirement of Chrysler CEO Bob Eaton. His lack of planning for Chrysler in the 1990s, to become their own global automotive company, is widely accepted as the reason why the merger was needed. Under DaimlerChrysler, the company was named DaimlerChrysler Motors Company LLC, with its U.S. operations generally called "DCX". The Eagle brand was retired shortly after Chrysler's merger with Daimler-Benz in 1998<ref>{{cite news|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-09-30/business/9709300310_1_eagle-sales-chrysler-corp-chrysler-and-jeep-vehicles |title=Chrysler Discontinues Eagle Brand |first=Jacqueline |last=Fitzgerald |publisher=The Chicago Tribune |date=30 September 1997 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> Jeep became a stand-alone division, and efforts were made to merge the Chrysler and Jeep brands as one sales unit.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown |first=Harold |title=Franchise Dilemmas for Automobile Dealers |journal=Oklahoma City University Law Review |year=1995 |volume=20}}</ref> In 2001, the Plymouth brand was also discontinued.

The sale of substantially all of Chrysler's assets to "New Chrysler", organized as Chrysler Group LLC was completed on June 10, 2009. The federal government provided support for the deal with US$8 billion in financing at near 21%. Under Sergio Marchionne, "World Class Manufacturing" or WCM, a system of complete and thorough manufacturing quality, was introduced and several products re-launched with quality and luxury. The 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee very soon became the most awarded SUV - Ever. The Ram, Jeep, Dodge, SRT and Chrysler divisions were separated to focus on their own identity and brand and 11 major model refreshes occurred in 21 months.

== Sales and marketing ==

=== United States sales ===
Chrysler is the smallest of the "Big Three" U.S. automakers (Chrysler Group LLC, [[Ford Motor Company]], and [[General Motors]]). In 2013 Chrysler sold 1,800,368 vehicles, 9% up from 2012, and fourth largest in sales behind GM, Ford and Toyota.<ref>{{cite web|title=Here Are The December 2013 'Big Eight' US Auto Sales Numbers|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/here-are-december-2013-big-eight-us-auto-sales-numbers-gm-ford-chrysler-toyota-honda-nissan-1525492|work=International Business Times|accessdate=7 May 2014|date=3 January 2014}}</ref>

Chrysler's sales have fluctuated dramatically over the last decade. In 2007 sales reached 2,076,650,<ref>{{cite web|title=Chrysler LLC Reports December 2008 U.S. Sales|url=http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?id=7670&mid=|work=Chrysler LLC|accessdate=7 May 2014|date=5 January 2009}}</ref>  falling to 931,402 units in 2009, the company's worst result in decades.

It is reported that Chrysler was heavy on fleet sales in 2010, hitting as high as 56 percent of total sales in February of that year. For the whole year, 38 percent of sales of Chrysler were to fleet customers. The industry average was 19 percent. However, the company hopes to reduce its fleet sales to the industry average in 2011 with a renewed product lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url= |title=Chrysler to Bring Fleet Sales in-line with Industry Average|date=February 15, 2011 |first=Drew |last=Johnson |publisher=Left Lane News}}</ref>

=== Global sales ===
Chrysler is the world's 11th largest vehicle manufacturer as ranked by OICA in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/worldpro2012-modification-ranking.pdf| title=World Motor Vehicle Production – World Ranking of Manufactures 2012|publisher=OICA |accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref> Total Chrysler vehicle production was about 2.37 million that year, up from 1.58 million in 2010.

=== Product recalls ===

==== Brake booster shield recall, March 2014 ====
In April 2014, Chrysler recalled brake boosters from Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee Vehicles manufactured in the years 2011-2014 stating that, "A brake booster's center shell may corrode and allow water to get inside, which could freeze and limit the braking ability of the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash." Chrysler is offering a free repair for any affected SUV worldwide, all that is required is the drive to a local dealer for the repair.<ref>[http://media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?&id=15493&mid=]</ref>

=== Marketing ===

==== Lifetime powertrain warranty ====
In 2007, Chrysler began to offer vehicle lifetime powertrain warranty for the first registered owner or retail lessee.<ref>{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/07/26/breaking-chrysler-announces-lifetime-powertrain-warranty/ |title=Breaking: Chrysler announces lifetime powertrain warranty! |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=July 26, 2007 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}</ref> The deal covered owner or lessee in U.S., Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, for 2009 model year vehicles, and 2006, 2007 and 2008 model year vehicles purchased on or after July 26, 2007. Covered vehicles excluded SRT models, Diesel vehicles, Sprinter models, Ram Chassis Cab, Hybrid System components (including transmission), and certain fleet vehicles.

==== "Let's Refuel America" ====
In 2008, as a response to customer feedback citing the prospect of rising gas prices as a top concern, Chrysler launched the "Let's Refuel America" incentive campaign, which guaranteed new-car buyers a gasoline price of $2.99 for three years.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do;jsessionid=B9842A079EFC9B4FA925B1D294CCDDD6?&id=7858&mid=10 |title=Chrysler LLC Delivers Economic Stimulus; Protects Consumers from Rising Gas Prices for Three Years |publisher=Chrysler.com |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}</ref> With the U.S. purchase of eligible Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge vehicles, customers could enroll in the program and receive a gas card that immediately lowers their gas price to $2.99 a gallon, and keeps it there for the three years.

==== Lancia co-branding ====
Chrysler plans for [[Lancia]] to codevelop products, with some vehicles being shared. Olivier Francois, Lancia's CEO, was appointed to the [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] division in October 2009. Francois plans to reestablish the Chrysler brand as an upscale brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/lancia-chrysler-to-share-products.html |title=Lancia, Chrysler to share products |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |accessdate=November 29, 2009}}</ref>

==== Ram trucks ====
In October 2009, Dodge's car and truck lines were separated, with the name "Dodge" being used for cars, minivans and crossovers and "Ram" for light- and medium-duty trucks and other commercial-use vehicles.<ref name="autoblog.com/2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/05/dodge-announces-exec-appointments-tied-to-new-dodge-car-and-ram/|title=Officially Official: Dodge splits off Ram brand with new exec appointments|accessdate=March 12, 2010|work=autoblog.com/2009}}</ref>

==== "Imported From Detroit" ====
In 2011, Chrysler unveiled their "Imported From Detroit" campaign with ads featuring Detroit rapper [[Eminem]], one of which aired during the Super Bowl. The campaign highlighted the rejuvenation of the entire product lineup, which included the new, redesigned and repackaged 2011 200 sedan and 200 convertible, the Chrysler 300 sedan and the Chrysler Town & Country minivan.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gutierrez |first=Dianna |url=http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do;jsessionid=FF89CD493D55543EC338709865812824?&id=10512&mid=23 |title=Chrysler Brand Launches New Marketing and Advertising Campaign |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= Chris Shunk RSS feed |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/03/08/detroit-city-council-honors-chryslers-super-bowl-commercial-w/ |title=Detroit City Council honors Chrysler's Super Bowl commercial |publisher=Autoblog.com |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref> As part of the campaign, Chrysler sold a line of clothing items featuring the [[Monument to Joe Louis]], with proceeds being funneled to Detroit-area charities, including the Boys and Girls Clubs of Southeast Michigan, Habitat for Humanity Detroit and the Marshall Mathers Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|author= Aaron Richardson RSS feed |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/03/14/report-chrysler-updates-imported-from-detroit-logo/ |title=Report: Chrysler updates 'Imported From Detroit' logo |publisher=Autoblog.com |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref> Following the Eminem ad, there was also an ad for Detroit Lions defensive tackle [[Ndamukong Suh]] driving a Chrysler 300 to Portland, Oregon, to visit his mother, an ad featuring Detroit-born fashion designer [[John Varvatos]] cruising through a shadowy Gotham while Kevin Yon's familiar baritone traces the designer's genesis.<ref>{{cite news|last=Schultz |first=Jonathan |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/chrysler-exports-imported-from-detroit-to-new-york/ |title=Chrysler Exports 'Imported From Detroit' to New York |work=The New York Times |date=May 12, 2011 |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref>

In March 2011, Chrysler Group LLC filed a lawsuit against Moda Group LLC (owner of Pure Detroit clothing retailer) for copying and selling merchandise with the "Imported from Detroit" slogan.<ref>Halcom, Chad (March 16, 2011).

''Crain's Detroit Business''.

On June 18, 2011, U.S. District Judge Arthur Tarnow ruled that Chrysler's request did not show that it would suffer irreparable harm or that it had a strong likelihood of winning its case. Therefore, Pure Detroit's owner, Detroit retailer Moda Group LLC, can continue selling its "Imported from Detroit" products. Tarnow also noted that Chrysler does not have a trademark on "Imported from Detroit" and rejected the automaker's argument that trademark law is not applicable to the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110629/CARNEWS/110629852/0/videonewsarchive |title=Chrysler loses 'Imported from Detroit' lawsuit |publisher=Autoweek.com |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Zach|last=Bowman|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/06/29/chrysler-legal-bid-to-halt-imported-from-detroit-merchandise-s/ |title=Chrysler legal bid to halt 'Imported From Detroit' merchandise sales falls short |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref> In March 2012, Chrysler Group LLC and Pure Detroit agreed to a March 27 mediation to try to settle the lawsuit over the clothing company's use of "Imported from Detroit" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120319/AUTO0101/203190378/1148/auto01/Chrysler-Pure-Detroit-agree-mediation-settle-Imported-from-Detroit-suit |title=Chrysler, Pure Detroit agree to mediation to settle 'Imported from Detroit' suit |work=The Detroit News |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140407072522/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120319/AUTO0101/203190378/1148/auto01/Chrysler-Pure-Detroit-agree-mediation-settle-Imported-from-Detroit-suit |archivedate=7 April 2014 }}</ref> Pure Detroit stated that Chrysler has made false claims about the origins of three vehicles - Chrysler 200, Chrysler 300 and Chrysler Town & Country - none of which are built in Detroit.

The ad drew criticism from several leading U.S. [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], who suggested that its messaging implied that President [[Barack Obama]] deserved a second term and, as such, was political payback for Obama's support for the federal bailout of the company.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-06/politics/politics_eastwood-ad-politics_1_chrysler-ad-halftime-show-america-auto-industry?_s=PM:POLITICS |first=Bryan |last=Monroe |publisher=CNN|title=Were politics buried inside Eastwood's 'Halftime' commercial? |date=February 6, 2012 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> Asked about the criticism in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview with [[Steve Kroft]], Sergio Marchionne responded "just to rectify the record I paid back the loans at 19.7% Interest. I don't think I committed to do to a commercial on top of that" and characterized the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] reaction as "unnecessary and out of place".<ref>{{Cite interview|title=Sergio Marchionne: Resurrecting Chrysler|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57403925/sergio-marchionne-resurrecting-chrysler/ |date=March 25, 2012|first=Sergio|last=Marchionne|publisher=CBS News|page=3|accessdate=July 30, 2012|interviewer=Steve Kroft|work=60 Minutes|subjectlink=Sergio Marchionne}}</ref>

;"America's Import"
In 2014, Chrysler started using a new slogan, "America's Import" in ads introducing their all-new 2015 Chrysler 200, targeting foreign automakers from Germany to Japan with such ads (German performance and Japanese quality), and at the ending of selected ads, the advertisement will say, "We Built This", indicating being built in America, instead of overseas.

In 2010, Fiat Auto was planning to sell seven of its vehicles in the U.S. by 2014, while Fiat-controlled Chrysler Group was to supply nine models to sell under Fiat brands in the European market, according to a five-year plan rolled out on April 21, 2010 in [[Turin]], Italy, by Fiat and Chrysler CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]]. At least five of the Fiat Auto models were expected to be marketed in the U.S. under its [[Alfa Romeo]] brand. Showing the level of integration envisioned, a product introduction timeline envisaged Chrysler-built compact and full-size SUVs going on sale in 2012 and 2014, respectively, in both European and North American markets.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2010-04-21-fiat-splits_N.htm |work=USA Today |first=James R. |last=Healey |title=7 new Fiat models bound for U.S.; 9 Chryslers to go abroad |date=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

== Electric and hybrid vehicles ==
The first [[Battery electric vehicle|electric]] vehicle produced by Chrysler was the 1992 [[Dodge EPIC]] concept minivan. In 1993, Chrysler began to sell a limited-production electric minivan called the [[Chrysler TEVan|TEVan]]; however only 56 were produced. In 1997, a second generation, called the EPIC, was released. It was discontinued after 1999.{{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}

Chrysler owned the [[Global Electric Motorcars]] company, building low-speed [[neighborhood electric vehicles]], but sold GEM to [[Polaris Industries]] in 2011.

Chrysler intended to pursue new drive concepts through [[Envi (Automobile)|ENVI]], an in-house organization formed to focus on [[electric vehicle|electric-drive vehicles]] and related technologies which was established in September 2007. In August 2009, Chrysler took US$70 million in grants from the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] to develop a test fleet of 220 [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] pickup trucks and minivans. ENVI was disbanded by November 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/07/us-chrysler-ev-idUSTRE5A605N20091107?sp=true |title=Chrysler dismantles electric car plans under Fiat |date=November 6, 2009 |first=Kevin |last=Krolicki |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
In 1973 Chrysler along with [[Ford Motor Company]], [[General Motors]], [[Toyota]], and [[Volkswagen]] had to remove ambient temperature switches which affected emissions, though the companies denied intentional cheating and said that strategies like enriching fuel mixture during cold engine warm-up periods could reduce overall pollution.<ref name=Chronicle-Telegram>{{Citation |title= Auto makers and EPA split victories on '73 vehicles |newspaper=[[Chronicle-Telegram]] |date= 22 January 1973 |publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[Newspaperarchive]] }} }}</ref><ref name=News-Herald1973>{{Citation |title=Defeat Devices Must Go |author=[[United Press International]] |newspaper=[[The News Herald (Panama City)]] |date=23 January 1973 |publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[Newspaperarchive]] }} }}</ref><ref name=Autoweek2015>{{Citation |url= http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/vw-emissions-defeat-device-isnt-first |title= VW emissions 'defeat device' isn't the first |date= 24 September 2015 |magazine=[[AutoWeek]] |accessdate= 26 September 2015 }}</ref> The switches were ordered removed from production but cars already on the road did not have to be recalled, and fines were relatively modest.<ref name=News-Herald1973/><ref name=Autoweek2015/>

== Special programs ==
During [[World War II]], essentially all of Chrysler's facilities were devoted to building military vehicles (the [[Jeep]] brand came later, after Chrysler acquired [[American Motors Corporation]]).<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_djEK2wqmAIC&pg=PA192&dq=Multi-auto+Tank+Engine+Designed+and+Developed+by+Central+Engineering |page=192 |title=The Birth of Chrysler Corporation and Its Engineering Legacy |first=Carl |last=Breer |first2=Anthony J. |last2=Yanik |year=1992 |publisher= SAE International |isbn=978-1-56091-524-9 |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref> They were also designing V12 and V16 hemi-engines producing {{convert|2500|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} for airplanes, but they did not make it into production as [[jet engine|jets]] were developed and were seen as the future for air travel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allpar.com/mopar/hemi/chrysler-hemi.html |title=The Original Chrysler Hemi Engine |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref>  During the 1950s [[Cold War]] period, Chrysler made [[Chrysler air raid siren|air raid sirens]] powered by its Hemi V-8 engines.

=== Radar antennas ===
When the [[Radiation Laboratory]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] was established in 1941 to develop [[microwave]] [[radars]], one of the first projects resulted in the [[SCR-584]], the most widely recognized radar system of the war era. This system included a [[parabolic antenna]] six feet in diameter that was mechanically aimed in a helical pattern (round and round as well as up and down).

One of Chrysler’s most significant contributions to the war effort was not in the field of vehicles but in the radar field. For the final production design of this antenna and its highly complex drive mechanism, the Army’s [[Signal Corps Laboratories]] turned to Chrysler's Central Engineering Office. There, the parabola was changed from aluminum to steel, allowing production forming using standard automotive presses. To keep weight down, 6,000 equally spaced holes were drilled in the face (this had no effect on the radiation pattern). The drive mechanism was completely redesigned, using technology derived from Chrysler’s research in automotive gears and differentials. The changes resulted in improved performance, reduced weight, and easier maintenance. A large portion of the Dodge plant was used in building 1,500 of the SCR-584 antennas as well as the vans used in the systems.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stout |first=Wesley W. |title=The Great Detective |publisher=Chrysler Corporation |year=1946}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Colton |first=Roger B. |title=Radar in the United States Army |publisher=Proceedings of the I.R.E. |volume=33 |pages=740–753 |year=1947 |url=http://cecom.army.mil/historian/docdisp.php?fname=RadarintheUSArmy_byRogerColton.pdf&dirname=Radar |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref>

=== Aircraft ===
* [[Chrysler VZ-6]]

=== Missiles ===
In April 1950, the U.S. Army established the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC) at [[Redstone Arsenal]], adjacent to [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. To form OGMC, over 1,000 civilian and military personnel were transferred from [[Fort Bliss, Texas]]. Included was a group of German scientists and engineers led by [[Wernher von Braun]]; this group had been brought to America under [[Project Paperclip]]. OGMC designed the Army's first [[short-range ballistic missile]], the [[PGM-11 Redstone]], based on the WWII German [[V-2]] missile. Chrysler established the Missile Division to serve as the Redstone prime contractor, setting up an engineering operation in Huntsville and for production obtaining use from the U.S. Navy of a large plant in [[Warren, Michigan]]. The Redstone was in active service from 1958 to 1964; it was also the first missile to test-launch a live [[nuclear weapon]], first detonated in a 1958 test in the South Pacific.<ref>Bullard, John W.; “History Of The Redstone Missile System,” Historical Monograph Project Number: AMC 23 M. Historical Division, Army Missile Command</ref>

Working together, the Missile Division and von Braun's team greatly increased the capability of the Redstone, resulting in the [[PGM-19 Jupiter]], a [[medium-range ballistic missile]]. In May 1959, a Jupiter missile launched two small monkeys into space in a [[nose cone]]; this was America's first successful flight and recovery of live space payloads. Responsibility for deploying Jupiter missiles was transferred from the Army to the Air Force; armed with [[nuclear warheads]], they were first deployed in [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]] during the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Chrysler SM-78/PGM-19 Jupiter |publisher=National Museum of the U.S. Air Force |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=534 |date=May 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref>

=== Space boosters ===
In July 1959, [[NASA]] chose the [[Redstone missile]] as the basis for the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle]] to be used for suborbital test flights of the [[Project Mercury]] spacecraft. Three unmanned MRLV launch attempts were made between November 1960 and March 1961, two of which were successful. The MRLV successfully launched the chimpanzee [[Ham the Chimp|Ham]], and astronauts [[Alan Shepard]] and [[Gus Grissom]] on three suborbital flights in January, May and July 1961, respectively.

America's more ambitious manned space travel plans included the design of the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn series]] of heavy-lift launch vehicles by a team headed by [[Wernher von Braun]]. Chrysler's Huntsville operation, then designated the Space Division, became [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]’s prime contractor for the first stage of the [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB]] versions. The design was based on a cluster of Redstone and [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] fuel tanks, and Chrysler built it for the [[Apollo program]] in the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] in East New Orleans, one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world. Between October 1961 and July 1975, NASA used ten Saturn Is and nine Saturn IBs for suborbital and orbital flights, all of which were successful;<ref>Bilstein, Roger E.; [http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/sp4206.htm ''Stages to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn Launch Vehicles'']. NASA SP-4206, 1980, ISBN 0-16-048909-1.{{Page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> Chrysler missiles and boosters never suffered a launch failure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The division was also a subcontractor which modified one of the [[Mobile Launcher Platform]]s for use with the Saturn IB rockets using Saturn V infrastructure.
