</arg></template><bold>Badminton</bold><space/>is a recreational sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), that take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court divided by a net. Players score points by striking a<space/><link><target>shuttlecock</target></link><space/>with their racquet so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of the court. Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor, or if a fault has been called by either the umpire or service judge or, in their absence, the offending player, at any time during the rally.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last">Boga</arg><arg name="first">Steve</arg><arg name="title">Badminton</arg><arg name="publisher">Paw Prints</arg><arg name="year">2008</arg><arg name="isbn">1439504784</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The shuttlecock is a feathered or (mainly in non-competitive matches) plastic projectile whose unique aerodynamic properties cause it to fly differently from the balls used in most racquet sports; in particular, the feathers create much higher<space/><link><target>drag (physics)</target><part>drag</part></link>, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly than a ball. Shuttlecocks have a much higher top speed, when compared to other racquet sports. Because shuttlecock flight is affected by wind, competitive badminton is played indoors.

Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only.<extension extension_name='ref' name="laws"></extension><space/>The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.</paragraph><paragraph>The full width of the court is 6.1&amp;nbsp;metres (20&amp;nbsp;ft), and in singles this width is reduced to 5.18&amp;nbsp;metres (17&amp;nbsp;ft). The full length of the court is 13.4&amp;nbsp;metres (44&amp;nbsp;ft). The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98&amp;nbsp;metres (6&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;inch) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76&amp;nbsp;metres (2&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;inch) from the back boundary.</paragraph><paragraph>The net is 1.55&amp;nbsp;metres (5&amp;nbsp;ft 1&amp;nbsp;inch) high at the edges and 1.524&amp;nbsp;metres (5&amp;nbsp;ft) high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.</paragraph><paragraph>The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton. Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Equipment rules</heading><paragraph>Badminton rules restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks.

The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receiver's service court. This is similar to<space/><link><target>tennis</target></link>, except that a badminton serve must be hit below waist height and with the racquet shaft pointing downwards, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand inside their service courts unlike tennis.</paragraph><paragraph>When the serving side loses a rally, the serve immediately passes to their opponent(s) (this differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles partner for what is known as a &quot;second serve&quot;).</paragraph><paragraph>In singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in her/his left service court when her/his score is odd.</paragraph><paragraph>In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he/she changes service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time. If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even, the player in the right service court serves; if odd, the player in the left service court serves. The players' service courts are determined by their positions at the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the rally. A consequence of this system is that, each time a side regains the service, the server will be the player who did<space/><italics>not</italics><space/>serve last time.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Scoring</heading><paragraph>Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served<extension extension_name='ref' name="laws"></extension><space/>(this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15 points). A match is the best of three games.</paragraph><paragraph>If the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such as 2422), up to a maximum of 30 points (3029 is a winning score).</paragraph><paragraph>At the start of a match, the shuttlecock is cast and the side towards which the shuttlecock is pointing serves first. Alternatively, a coin may be tossed, with the winners choosing whether to serve or receive first, or choosing which end of the court to occupy, and their opponents making the leftover the remaining choice.</paragraph><paragraph>In subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. Matches are best out of three: a player or pair must win two games (of 21 points each) to win the match. For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives. The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading player's or pair's score reaches 11 points.</paragraph><paragraph>The server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Lets</heading><paragraph>If a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may occur because of some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on court (having been hit there by players playing in adjacent court) or in small halls the shuttle may touch an overhead rail which can be classed as a let.</paragraph><paragraph>If the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet, if the receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, he shall be judged to have been ready.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Equipment</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Heads of badminton raquets.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>Badminton<space/><link><target>racquet</target><trail>s</trail></link></part></link></paragraph><heading level='3'>Racquets</heading><paragraph>Badminton<space/><link><target>Racket (sports equipment)</target><part>racket</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are lightweight, with top quality racquets weighing between 70 and 95&amp;nbsp;grams (2.4 to 3.3 ounces) not including grip or strings.<extension extension_name='ref' name="oqgysc"><template><target>Cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.badmintoncentral.com/badminton-central/content/view/91/26/<space/></arg><arg name="title">Badminton Central Guide to choosing Badminton Equipment</arg><arg name="author">Kwun</arg><arg name="date">28 February 2005</arg><arg name="publisher">BadmintonCentral.com</arg><arg name="archiveurl">http://web.archive.org/web/20070311234023/http://www.badmintoncentral.com/badminton-central/content/view/91/26/</arg><arg name="archivedate">11 March 2007</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.karakal.com/index.php/8/product/72/sl-70/</arg><arg name="title">SL-70</arg><arg name="publisher">Karakal</arg><arg name="archiveurl">http://web.archive.org/web/20071016051147/http://www.karakal.com/index.php/8/product/72/sl-70/</arg><arg name="archivedate">16 October 2007</arg></template></extension><space/>They are composed of many different materials ranging from<space/><link><target>carbon fiber composite</target><part>carbon fibre composite</part></link><space/>(<link><target>graphite reinforced plastic</target></link>) to solid steel, which may be augmented by a variety of materials.<space/><link><target>carbon fiber</target><part>Carbon fibre</part></link><space/>has an excellent strength to weight ratio, is stiff, and gives excellent<space/><link><target>kinetic energy</target></link><space/>transfer. Before the adoption of carbon fibre composite, racquets were made of light metals such as aluminum. Earlier still, racquets were made of wood. Cheap racquets are still often made of metals such as steel, but wooden racquets are no longer manufactured for the ordinary market, because of their excessive mass and cost. Nowadays, nanomaterials such as<space/><link><target>fullerene</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>carbon nanotubes</target></link><space/>are added to rackets giving them greater durability.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">May 2012</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>There is a wide variety of racquet designs, although the laws limit the racquet size and shape. Different racquets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players. The traditional oval head shape is still available, but an<space/><link><target>wikt:isometric</target><part>isometric</part></link><space/>head shape is increasingly common in new racquets.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Strings</heading><paragraph>Badminton strings are thin, high performing strings with thicknesses ranging from about 0.62 to 0.73&amp;nbsp;mm. Thicker strings are more durable, but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings. String tension is normally in the range of 80 to 160&amp;nbsp;<link><target>newton (unit)</target><part>N</part></link><space/>(18 to 36<space/><link><target>pound-force</target><part>lbf</part></link>). Recreational players generally string at lower tensions than professionals, typically between 80 and 110 N (18 and 25&amp;nbsp;lbf). Professionals string between about 110 and 160 N (25 and 36&amp;nbsp;lbf). Some string manufacturers measure the thickness of their strings under tension so they are actually thicker than specified when slack. Ashaway Micropower is actually 0.7mm but Yonex BG-66 is about 0.72mm.</paragraph><paragraph>It is often argued that high string tensions improve control, whereas low string tensions increase power.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.prospeed.com.my/String.htm<space/></arg><arg name="title">String tension relating to power and control</arg><arg name="publisher">Prospeed<space/></arg><arg name="archiveurl"><space/>http://web.archive.org/web/20071028080241/http://www.prospeed.com.my/String.htm<space/></arg><arg name="archivedate"><space/>28 October 2007</arg></template></extension><space/>The arguments for this generally rely on crude mechanical reasoning, such as claiming that a lower tension string bed is more bouncy and therefore provides more power. This is in fact incorrect, for a higher string tension can cause the shuttle to slide off the racquet and hence make it harder to hit a shot accurately. An alternative view suggests that the optimum tension for power depends on the player:<extension extension_name='ref' name="oqgysc"></extension><space/>the faster and more accurately a player can swing their racquet, the higher the tension for maximum power. Neither view has been subjected to a rigorous mechanical analysis, nor is there clear evidence in favour of one or the other. The most effective way for a player to find a good string tension is to experiment.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Grip</heading><paragraph>The choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of their racquet handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer.</paragraph><paragraph>Players may choose between a variety of grip materials. The most common choices are<space/><link><target>polyurethane</target><part>PU</part></link><space/>synthetic grips or towelling grips. Grip choice is a matter of personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands, sweatbands may be used, the player may choose another grip material or change his/her grip more frequently.</paragraph><paragraph>There are two main types of grip:<space/><italics>replacement</italics><space/>grips and<space/><italics>overgrips</italics>. Replacement grips are thicker, and are often used to increase the size of the handle. Overgrips are thinner (less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm), and are often used as the final layer. Many players, however, prefer to use replacement grips as the final layer. Towelling grips are always replacement grips. Replacement grips have an adhesive backing, whereas overgrips have only a small patch of adhesive at the start of the tape and must be applied under tension; overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, because they may be removed more rapidly without damaging the underlying material.<link><target>File:Shuttlecocks Yonex Aerosensa 20.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>100px</part><part><link><target>Shuttlecock</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>with feathers</part></link><link><target>File:ShuttlecockPhoto.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>100px</part><part>A shuttlecock with a plastic skirt</part></link></paragraph><heading level='3'>Shuttlecock</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Shuttlecock</arg></template>A shuttlecock (often abbreviated to<space/><italics>shuttle</italics>; also called a<space/><italics>birdie</italics>) is a high-drag<space/><link><target>projectile</target></link>, with an open<space/><link><target>Cone (geometry)</target><part>conical shape</part></link>: the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping<space/><link><target>feathers</target></link><space/>embedded into a rounded cork base.

High levels of lateral support are useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up lateral support will not be able to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe's support fails, and the player's ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is more than just a safety concern: proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Strokes</heading><paragraph><template><target>Unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">September 2009</arg></template><link><target>File:GGOpen Setiadi.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>A player flies high at the Golden Gate Badminton Club (GGBC) in Menlo Park, 2006</part></link></paragraph><heading level='3'>Forehand and backhand</heading><paragraph>Badminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of skill to perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either<space/><italics>forehand</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>backhand</italics>. A player's forehand side is the same side as their playing hand: for a right-handed player, the forehand side is their right side and the backhand side is their left side. Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading (like hitting with the palm), whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading (like hitting with the knuckles). Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand side with a backhand hitting action, and vice versa.</paragraph><paragraph>In the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rear court, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands, often preferring to play a<space/><italics>round-the-head</italics><space/>forehand overhead (a forehand &quot;on the backhand side&quot;) rather than attempt a backhand overhead. Playing a backhand overhead has two main disadvantages. First, the player must turn their back to their opponents, restricting their view of them and the court. Second, backhand overheads cannot be hit with as much power as forehands: the hitting action is limited by the shoulder joint, which permits a much greater range of movement for a forehand overhead than for a backhand. The<space/><italics>backhand clear</italics><space/>is considered by most players and coaches to be the most difficult basic stroke in the game, since precise technique is needed in order to muster enough power for the shuttlecock to travel the full length of the court.

If the shuttlecock has dropped lower, then a smash is impossible and a full-length, high clear is difficult.<link><target>File:BadmintonJumpSmash.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>150px</part><part>A player prepares for a vertical jump smash</part></link></paragraph><heading level='3'>Vertical position of the shuttlecock</heading><paragraph><bold>When the shuttlecock is well below net height</bold>, players have no choice but to hit upwards.<space/><italics>Lifts</italics>, where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to the back of the opponents' court, can be played from all parts of the court. If a player does not lift, his only remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net: in the forecourt this is called a<space/><italics>netshot</italics>; in the midcourt or rearcourt, it is often called a<space/><italics>push</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>block</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>When the shuttlecock is near to net height</bold>, players can hit<space/><italics>drives</italics>, which travel flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents' rear midcourt and rearcourt. Pushes may also be hit flatter, placing the shuttlecock into the front midcourt. Drives and pushes may be played from the midcourt or forecourt, and are most often used in doubles: they are an attempt to regain the attack, rather than choosing to lift the shuttlecock and defend against smashes. After a successful drive or push, the opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Other factors</heading><paragraph><bold>When defending against a smash</bold>, players have three basic options: lift, block, or drive. In singles, a block to the net is the most common reply. In doubles, a lift is the safest option but it usually allows the opponents to continue smashing; blocks and drives are counter-attacking strokes, but may be intercepted by the smasher's partner. Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides, because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body. Hard shots directed towards the body are difficult to defend.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>The service</bold><space/>is restricted by<space/><link><target>#Laws of the game</target><part>the Laws</part></link><space/>and presents its own array of stroke choices. Unlike in tennis, the server's racket must be pointing in a downward direction to deliver the serve so normally the shuttle must be hit upwards to pass over the net. The server can choose a<space/><italics>low serve</italics><space/>into the forecourt (like a push), or a lift to the back of the service court, or a flat<space/><italics>drive serve</italics>. Lifted serves may be either<space/><italics>high serves</italics>, where the shuttlecock is lifted so high that it falls almost vertically at the back of the court, or<space/><italics>flick serves</italics>, where the shuttlecock is lifted to a lesser height but falls sooner.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Deception</heading><paragraph>Once players have mastered these basic strokes, they can hit the shuttlecock from and to any part of the court, powerfully and softly as required. Beyond the basics, however, badminton offers rich potential for advanced stroke skills that provide a competitive advantage. Because badminton players have to cover a short distance as quickly as possible, the purpose of many advanced strokes is to deceive the opponent, so that either he is tricked into believing that a different stroke is being played, or he is forced to delay his movement until he actually sees the shuttle's direction. &quot;Deception&quot; in badminton is often used in both of these senses. When a player is genuinely deceived, he will often lose the point immediately because he cannot change his direction quickly enough to reach the shuttlecock. Experienced players will be aware of the trick and cautious not to move too early, but the attempted deception is still useful because it forces the opponent to delay his movement slightly. Against weaker players whose intended strokes are obvious, an experienced player may move before the shuttlecock has been hit, anticipating the stroke to gain an advantage.</paragraph><paragraph><italics>Slicing</italics><space/>and using a<space/><italics>shortened hitting action</italics><space/>are the two main technical devices that facilitate deception. Slicing involves hitting the shuttlecock with an angled racquet face, causing it to travel in a different direction than suggested by the body or arm movement. Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to travel more slowly than the arm movement suggests. For example, a good crosscourt<space/><italics>sliced dropshot</italics><space/>will use a hitting action that suggests a straight clear or smash, deceiving the opponent about both the power and direction of the shuttlecock. A more sophisticated slicing action involves brushing the strings around the shuttlecock during the hit, in order to make the shuttlecock spin. This can be used to improve the shuttle's trajectory, by making it dip more rapidly as it passes the net; for example, a sliced low serve can travel slightly faster than a normal low serve, yet land on the same spot. Spinning the shuttlecock is also used to create<space/><italics>spinning netshots</italics><space/>(also called<space/><italics>tumbling netshots</italics>), in which the shuttlecock turns over itself several times (tumbles) before stabilizing; sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of tumbling. The main advantage of a spinning netshot is that the opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has stopped tumbling, since hitting the feathers will result in an unpredictable stroke. Spinning netshots are especially important for high level singles players.</paragraph><paragraph>The lightness of modern racquets allows players to use a very short hitting action for many strokes, thereby maintaining the option to hit a powerful or a soft stroke until the last possible moment. For example, a singles player may hold his racquet ready for a netshot, but then flick the shuttlecock to the back instead with a shallow lift when she or he notices the opponent has moved before the actual shot was played. A shallow lift takes less time to reach the ground and as mentioned above a rally is over when the shuttlecock touches the ground. This makes the opponent's task of covering the whole court much more difficult than if the lift was hit higher and with a bigger, obvious swing. A short hitting action is not only useful for deception: it also allows the player to hit powerful strokes when he has no time for a big arm swing. A big arm swing is also usually not advised in badminton because bigger swings make it more difficult to recover for the next shot in fast exchanges. The use of grip tightening is crucial to these techniques, and is often described as<space/><italics>finger power</italics>. Elite players develop finger power to the extent that they can hit some power strokes, such as net kills, with less than a<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>10</arg><arg>cm</arg><arg>0</arg><arg name="abbr">on</arg></template><space/>racquet swing.</paragraph><paragraph>It is also possible to reverse this style of deception, by suggesting a powerful stroke before slowing down the hitting action to play a soft stroke. In general, this latter style of deception is more common in the rearcourt (for example, dropshots disguised as smashes), whereas the former style is more common in the forecourt and midcourt (for example, lifts disguised as netshots).</paragraph><paragraph>Deception is not limited to slicing and short hitting actions. Players may also use<space/><italics>double motion</italics>, where they make an initial racquet movement in one direction before withdrawing the racquet to hit in another direction. Players will often do this to send opponents in the wrong direction. The racquet movement is typically used to suggest a straight angle but then play the stroke cross court, or vice versa.<space/><italics>Triple motion</italics><space/>is also possible, but this is very rare in actual play. An alternative to double motion is to use a<space/><italics>racquet head fake</italics>, where the initial motion is continued but the racquet is turned during the hit. This produces a smaller change in direction, but does not require as much time.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Strategy</heading><paragraph><template><target>Unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">September 2009</arg></template>To win in badminton, players need to employ a wide variety of strokes in the right situations. These range from powerful jumping smashes to delicate tumbling net returns. Often rallies finish with a smash, but setting up the smash requires subtler strokes. For example, a netshot can force the opponent to lift the shuttlecock, which gives an opportunity to smash. If the netshot is tight and tumbling, then the opponent's lift will not reach the back of the court, which makes the subsequent smash much harder to return.</paragraph><paragraph>Deception is also important. Expert players prepare for many different strokes that look identical, and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke. If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, he may move in the wrong direction and may be unable to change his body momentum in time to reach the shuttlecock.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Doubles</heading><preblock><preline></preline></preblock><paragraph>Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when possible. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rearcourt, and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift. If the rearcourt attacker plays a dropshot, his partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes. In doubles, players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes.</paragraph><paragraph>At high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.</paragraph><paragraph>At high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men's doubles is the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges. Because of this, spectator interest is sometimes greater for men's doubles than for singles.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Singles</heading><paragraph>The singles court is narrower than the doubles court, but the same length. Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court. Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with drop shots and net shots. Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up his effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return. Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a player's energy is at a premium. However, players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to create openings, and players commonly smash weak returns to try to end rallies.</paragraph><paragraph>In singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve. Low serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand. Drive serves are rare.</paragraph><paragraph>At high levels of play, singles demands extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of patient positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Mixed doubles</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Scottish Schools U12 mixed doubles badminton tournament.jpg</target><part>right</part><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>A mixed doubles game Scottish Schools under 12s tournament,<space/><link><target>Tranent</target></link>, May 2002</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>In mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. This is because the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can therefore produce smashes that are more powerful. As a result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front. In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.badmintonplanet.com/cgi-bin/playbetter/strategies.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Badminton Strategies and Tactics for the Novice and Recreational Player</arg><arg name="last">Kumekawa</arg><arg name="first">Eugene</arg><arg name="publisher">BadmintonPlanet<space/></arg><arg name="archiveurl"><space/>http://web.archive.org/web/20070126195758/http://www.badmintonplanet.com/cgi-bin/playbetter/strategies.html<space/></arg><arg name="archivedate"><space/>26 January 2007</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>At high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if required.
