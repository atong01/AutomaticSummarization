'''Alexander Mackenzie''', [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]] (January 28, 1822 – April 17, 1892), was a building contractor and newspaper editor, and was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|second]] [[Prime Minister of Canada]], from November 7, 1873 to October 8, 1878.

==Life and career==
Mackenzie was born in [[Logierait]], Perthshire, [[Scotland]], the son of Mary Stewart (Fleming) and Alexander Mackenzie Sr. He was the third of ten children. At the age of 13, Mackenzie's father died, and he was forced to end his formal education in order to help support his family. At the age of 16 he apprenticed as a stonemason and by the age of 20 he had reached journeyman status in this field. Mackenzie immigrated to Canada in 1842 to seek a better life as well as to follow his sweetheart, Helen Neil. Shortly thereafter, he converted from [[Presbyterianism]] to [[Baptist]] beliefs. Mackenzie's faith was to link him to the increasingly influential [[temperance cause]], particularly strong in [[Canada West]] where he lived, a constituency of which he was to represent in the [[Parliament of Canada]].

Mackenzie married Helen Neil (1826–52) in 1845 and with her had three children, with only one girl surviving infancy. In 1853, he married [[Jane Mackenzie|Jane Sym]] (1825–93).

[[Image:Mason overseer.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1875 ''[[Canadian Illustrated News]]'' cartoon shows Mackenzie the Mason and Governor General [[Lord Dufferin]] the Overseer ]]In Canada, Mackenzie continued his career as a stonemason, building many structures that still stand today. He began working as a general contractor, earning a reputation for being a hard working, honest man as well as having a working man's view on fiscal policy.

Mackenzie involved himself in politics almost from the moment he arrived in Canada. He campaigned relentlessly for [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], owner of the [[Reform movement (pre-Confederation Canada)|Reformist]] paper ''[[The Globe (Toronto newspaper)|The Globe]]'' in the 1851 election, helping him to win a seat in the assembly. In 1852 Mackenzie became editor of another reformist paper, the Lambton Shield. As editor, Mackenzie was perhaps a little too vocal, leading the paper to a suit of law for libel against the local conservative candidate. The paper lost the suit and was forced to fold due to financial hardship. Mackenzie was elected to the Legislative Assembly as a supporter of George Brown in 1861.

===Prime Minister (1873–1878)===
When the [[John A. Macdonald|Macdonald]] government fell due to the [[Pacific Scandal]] in 1873, the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], called upon Mackenzie, who had been chosen as the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] a few months earlier, to form a new government.  Mackenzie formed a government and asked the Governor General to call an [[Canadian federal election, 1874|election for January 1874]]. The Liberals won, and Mackenzie remained prime minister until the [[Canadian federal election, 1878|1878 election]] when Macdonald's [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] returned to power with a [[majority government]].

It was unusual for a man of Mackenzie's humble origins to attain such a position in an age which generally offered such opportunity only to the privileged. Lord Dufferin, the current Governor General, expressed early misgivings about a stonemason taking over government. But on meeting Mackenzie, Dufferin revised his opinions: <blockquote>"However narrow and inexperienced Mackenzie may be, I imagine he is a thoroughly upright, well-principled, and well-meaning man."</blockquote>

Mackenzie also served as Minister of Public Works and oversaw the completion of the Parliament Buildings. While drawing up the plans, he included a circular staircase leading directly from his office to the outside of the building which allowed him to escape the patronage-seekers waiting for him in his ante-chamber. Proving Dufferin's reflections on his character to be true, Mackenzie disliked intensely the patronage inherent in politics. Nevertheless, he found it a necessary evil in order to maintain party unity and ensure the loyalty of his fellow Liberals.

[[Image:Alexander Mackenzie Statue.jpg|Statue of Alexander Mackenzie on Parliament Hill, Canada.|thumb|left]] In keeping with his democratic ideals, Mackenzie refused the offer of a knighthood three times, and was thus the only one of Canada's first eight Prime Ministers not to be knighted. His pride in his working class origins never left him. Once, while touring [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] as prime minister, he asked the soldier accompanying him if he knew the thickness of the wall beside them. The embarrassed escort confessed that he didn't and Mackenzie replied, "I do. It is five feet, ten inches. I know, because I built it myself!"<ref>Canada's Prime Ministers, 1867 – 1994: Biographies and Anecdotes. [Ottawa]: National Archives of Canada, [1994]. 40 p.</ref>

As Prime Minister, Alexander Mackenzie strove to reform and simplify the machinery of government. He introduced the [[secret ballot]]; advised the creation of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]; the establishment of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] in 1874; the creation of the Office of the [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]] in 1878; and struggled to continue progress on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|national railway]].

However, his term was marked by [[economic depression]] that had grown out of the [[Panic of 1873]], which Mackenzie's government was unable to alleviate. In 1874, Mackenzie negotiated a new [[free trade]] agreement with the United States, eliminating the high protective tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. However, this action did not bolster the economy, and construction of the CPR slowed drastically due to lack of funding. In 1876 the Conservative opposition announced a [[National Policy]] of protective tariffs, which resonated with voters. When an [[Canadian federal election, 1878|election]] was held at the conclusion of Mackenzie's five-year term, the Conservatives were swept back into office in a landslide victory.

After his government's defeat, Mackenzie remained [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] for another two years, until 1880. He remained an MP until his death in 1892 from a stroke that resulted from hitting his head during a fall. He died in [[Toronto]] and was buried in Lakeview Cemetery in [[Sarnia]], Ontario.<ref name=Parks_Canada>{{cite web | url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/clmhc-hsmbc/Sepulture-gravesiteindx/listesepulture-listgravesite/mackenzie.aspx | title=Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada – Former Prime Ministers and Their Grave Sites – The Honourable Alexander Mackenzie | author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | date=December 20, 2010 | website=Parks Canada | publisher=Government of Canada | accessdate=March 5, 2014}}</ref>

In their 1999 study of the Prime Ministers of Canada, which included the results of a survey of Canadian historians, [[J.L. Granatstein]] and [[Norman Hillmer]] found that Mackenzie was in the No. 11 place just after [[John Sparrow David Thompson]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hillmer, Norman and Granatstein, J.
