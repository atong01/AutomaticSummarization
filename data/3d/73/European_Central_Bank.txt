The '''European Central Bank''' ('''ECB''') is the [[central bank]] for the [[euro]] and administers [[monetary policy]] of the [[Eurozone]], which consists of 19 [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] and is one of the largest currency areas in the world. It is one of the world's [[Big Four (banking)#International Use|most important central banks]] and is one of the seven [[institutions of the European Union]] (EU) listed in the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU). The capital stock of the bank is owned by the central banks of all 28 EU member states.{{update after|2013|7|4}} The [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] established the bank in 1998, and it is headquartered in [[Frankfurt]], Germany. {{As of|2015}} the [[President of the European Central Bank|President]] of the ECB is [[Mario Draghi]], former governor of the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]], former member of the [[World Bank]],<ref name="IndependentGoldmanConquer">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/what-price-the-new-democracy-goldman-sachs-conquers-europe-6264091.html|title=What price the new democracy?

==History==
{{Further|History of the euro}}
[[File:Wim Duisenberg.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Wim Duisenberg]], first President of the ECB]]
The European Central Bank is the ''de facto'' successor of the [[European Monetary Institute]] (EMI).<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/history/emu/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Economic and Monetary Union|publisher=ECB |accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> The EMI was established at the start of the second stage of the EU's [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] (EMU) to handle the transitional issues of states adopting the euro and prepare for the creation of the ECB and [[European System of Central Banks]] (ESCB).<ref name="autogenerated1"/>  The EMI itself took over from the earlier [[European Monetary Co-operation Fund]] (EMCF).<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web |title=European Central Bank |publisher=CVCE |url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_central_bank-en-fc8d2e17-cbde-4ec8-8f79-46f06c471540.html |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref>

The ECB formally replaced the EMI on 1 June 1998 by virtue of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU, Treaty of Maastricht), however it did not exercise its full powers until the [[introduction of the euro]] on 1 January 1999, signalling the third stage of EMU.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The bank was the final institution needed for EMU, as outlined by the EMU reports of [[Pierre Werner]] and [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jacques Delors]]. It was established on 1 June 1998.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/history/emu/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Economic and Monetary Union |publisher=Ecb.int |accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref>

The first [[List of Presidents of the European Central Bank|President of the Bank]] was [[Wim Duisenberg]], the former president of the [[De Nederlandsche Bank|Dutch central bank]] and the [[European Monetary Institute]].<ref name="autogenerated3"/> While Duisenberg had been the head of the EMI (taking over from [[Alexandre Lamfalussy]] of Belgium) just before the ECB came into existence,<ref name="autogenerated3"/> the French government wanted [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], former head of the [[Banque de France|French central bank]], to be the ECB's first president.<ref name="autogenerated3"/>  The French argued that since the ECB was to be located in Germany, its president should be French. This was opposed by the German, Dutch and Belgian governments who saw Duisenberg as a guarantor of a strong euro.<ref name="ENA EMU3">{{cite web |title=The third stage of Economic and Monetary Union |publisher=CVCE |url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_third_stage_of_economic_and_monetary_union-en-e2e91dc0-3a6d-49fc-b3f8-f96fb5f3addb.html |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref> Tensions were abated by a [[gentleman's agreement]] in which Duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate, to be replaced by Trichet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/uggboy/4417740330/ |title=The powerful European Central Bank [E C B] in the heart of Frankfurt/Main&nbsp;– Germany&nbsp;– The Europower in Mainhattan&nbsp;– Enjoy the glances of euro and europe....03/2010....travel round the world....:)|work=UggBoy♥UggGirl [PHOTO // WORLD // TRAVEL] |publisher=Flickr|date=6 March 2010|accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref>

Trichet replaced Duisenberg as President in November 2003.

[[File:Mario Draghi World Economic Forum 2013 crop.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Mario Draghi]], the current President of the ECB]]
There had also been tension over the ECB's [[Executive Board of the European Central Bank|Executive Board]], with the United Kingdom demanding a seat even though it had not joined the Single Currency.<ref name="ENA EMU3"/> Under pressure from France, three seats were assigned to the largest members, France, Germany, and Italy; Spain also demanded and obtained a seat. Despite such a system of appointment the board asserted its independence early on in resisting calls for interest rates and future candidates to it.<ref name="ENA EMU3"/>

When the ECB was created, it covered a [[Eurozone]] of eleven members. Since then, Greece joined in January 2001, Slovenia in January 2007, Cyprus and Malta in January 2008, Slovakia in January 2009, Estonia in January 2011, Latvia in January 2014 and Lithuania in January 2015, enlarging the bank's scope and the membership of its Governing Council.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

On 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, ECB according to the article 13 of TEU, gained official status of an [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institution]].

In September 2011, when German appointee to the Governing Council and Executive board, [[Jürgen Stark]], resigned in protest of the ECB's bond buying programme, Financial Times Deutschland called it "the end of the ECB as we know it" referring to its perceived "hawkish" stance on inflation and its historical Bundesbank influence.<ref>{{cite news | author=Proissl, von Wolfgang | url=http://www.ftd.de/politik/europa/:stark-ruecktritt-das-ende-der-ezb-wie-wir-sie-kannten/60102214.html | title=Das Ende der EZB, wie wir sie kannten | trans-title=The end of the ECB, as we knew it | department=Kommentar | work=[[Financial Times Deutschland]] | date=9 September 2011 | deadurl=yes | archivedate=15 October 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015235754/http://www.ftd.de/politik/europa/:stark-ruecktritt-das-ende-der-ezb-wie-wir-sie-kannten/60102214.html | language=de }}</ref>

On 1 November 2011, [[Mario Draghi]] replaced Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the ECB.

In April 2011, the ECB raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 from 1% to 1.25%,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ecb-raises-interest-rates-2011-04-07 |title=ECB Raises Interest Rates&nbsp;– MarketWatch|work=marketwatch.com |year=2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> with a further increase to 1.50% in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ecb.int/stats/monetary/rates/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Key interest rates|year=2011 |accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> However, in 2012–2013 the ECB sharply lowered interest rates to encourage economic growth, reaching the historically low 0.25% in November 2013.<ref name=bbc-25 /> Soon after the rates were cut to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 the central bank reduced the rates by two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%, the lowest rates on record.<ref name="ECBcuts">{{cite news|title=Draghi slashes interest rates, unveils bond buying plan|url=http://www.europenews.net/index.php/sid/225407609|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014|publisher=''Europe News.Net''}}</ref>

==Powers and objectives==

===Objective===
[[File:Zahlungsmittel.JPG|thumb|[[Euro banknotes]]]]
The primary objective of the European Central Bank, as laid down in Article 127(1) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], is to maintain [[price stability]] within the [[Eurozone]].<ref>[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title VIII: Economic and Monetary Policy#CHAPTER 2: MONETARY POLICY|wikisource consolidation]]</ref> The Governing Council in October 1998<ref name="HANSPETER K 2006, page 81">THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HISTORY, ROLE AND FUNCTIONS BY

SCHELLER SECOND REVISED EDITION 2006, ISBN 92-899-0022-9 (print) ISBN 92-899-0027-X (online) page 81 at the pdf online version</ref> defined price stability as inflation of around 2%, “a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%” and added that price stability ”was to be maintained over the medium term”. ([[Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices]])<ref name="ENA Pow">{{cite web | title=Powers and responsibilities of the European Central Bank | publisher=European Central Bank | url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/tasks/html/index.en.html | accessdate=10 March 2009 | deadurl=yes | archivedate=16 December 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216083913/http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/tasks/html/index.en.html }}</ref> Unlike for example the [[United States Federal Reserve Bank]], the ECB has only one primary objective but this objective has never been defined in statutory law, and the HICP target can be termed ad-hoc.

The Governing Council confirmed this definition in May 2003 following a thorough evaluation of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. On that occasion, the Governing Council clarified that “in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”.<ref name="HANSPETER K 2006, page 81"/> All lending to credit institutions must be collateralised as required by Article 18 of the Statute of the ESCB.<ref>THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HISTORY, ROLE AND FUNCTIONS BY
HANSPETER K. SCHELLER SECOND REVISED EDITION 2006, ISBN 92-899-0022-9 (print) ISBN 92-899-0027-X (online) page 87 at the pdf online version</ref>  The Governing Council clarification has little force in law.

Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the Treaty also states that "the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/tasks/html/index.en.html|title=ECB: Monetary Policy|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>

===Basic tasks===
The basic tasks of the ECB are to define and implement the [[monetary policy]] for the Eurozone, to conduct foreign exchange operations, to take care of the [[foreign reserve]]s of the European System of Central Banks and to promote smooth operation of the financial market infrastructure under the TARGET2 payments system<ref name="BBC ECB">{{cite news |last=Fairlamb |first=David |author2=Rossant, John |title=The powers of the European Central Bank |publisher=BBC News   |date=12 February 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/business_basics/86006.stm |accessdate=16 October 2007}}</ref>  and being currently developed technical platform for settlement of securities in Europe ([[TARGET2 Securities]]).

Further tasks, among others, include the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of [[euro banknotes]]. Member states can issue [[euro coins]], but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand (upon the introduction of the euro, the ECB also had exclusive right to issue coins).<ref name="BBC ECB"/> The ECB shall also collect statistical information to fulfil the tasks of the European System of Central Banks, and contribute to financial stability and supervision.

===Considerations on ECB's monetary policy===
In [[Federal Reserve System|U.S.-style central banking]], the [[Federal Reserve System]] purchases Treasury securities in order to inject liquidity into the economy; the [[Eurosystem]], on the other hand, uses a different method. There are about 1,500 eligible banks which may bid for short-term [[repurchase agreement|repo contracts]] of two weeks to three months duration.<ref>In practice, 400–500 banks participate regularly. <br/>{{citation | url = http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp107.pdf | title = The collateral frameworks of the Eurosystem, the Federal Reserve System and the Bank of England and the financial market turmoil | author = Samuel Cheun | coauthors = Isabel von Köppen-Mertes and Benedict Weller |date=December 2009 | publisher = ECB | accessdate =24 August 2011 }}</ref>

The banks in effect borrow cash and must pay it back; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually. When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again. An increase in the quantity of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy. A decrease has the contrary effect. The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Bank's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability. In layman terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks, carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.{{efn|The process is similar, though on a grand scale, to an individual who every month charges $10,000 on his or her credit card, pays it off every month, but also withdraws (and pays off) an additional $10,000 each succeeding month for transaction purposes. Such a person is operating "net borrowed" on a continual basis, and even though the borrowing from the credit card is short term, the effect is a stable increase in the money supply. If the person borrows less, less money circulates in the economy. If he or she borrows more, the money supply increases. An individual's ability to borrow from his or her credit card company is determined by the credit card company: it reflects the company's overall judgment of its ability to lend to all borrowers, and also its appraisal of the financial condition of that one particular borrower. The ability of member banks to borrow from the central bank is fundamentally similar.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} }}

To qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities. These can be the public debt of member states, but a fairly wide range of private banking securities are also accepted.<ref name="The ECB and the Eurosystem">{{cite journal | url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/neer/neer2002/neer202e.pdf | title=The European Central Bank and the Eurosystem | last=Bertaut | first=Carol C. | journal=New England Economic Review | year=2002 | issue=2nd quarter | pages=25–28}}</ref>  The fairly stringent membership requirements for the European Union, especially with regard to [[sovereign debt]] as a percentage of each member state's gross domestic product, are designed to insure that assets offered to the bank as collateral are, at least in theory, all equally good, and all equally protected from the risk of inflation.<ref name="The ECB and the Eurosystem" />

==Organization==
The ECB has three decision-making bodies, that take all the decisions with the objective of fulfilling the ECB's mandate:
* the Executive Board,
* the Governing Council, and
* the General Council.

===Languages===
The internal working language of the ECB is generally English, and press conferences are usually held in English. External communications are handled flexibly: English is preferred (though not exclusively) for communication within the ESCB (i.e. with other central banks) and with financial markets; communication with other national bodies and with EU citizens is normally in their respective language, but the ECB website is predominantly English; official documents such as the Annual Report are in the official languages of the EU.<ref>{{cite news|title=Translation Adds Complexity to European Central Bank’s Supervisory Role: ECB Wants Communication in English, But EU Rules Allow Use of Any Official Language|first=Todd|last=Buell|date=29 October 2014|accessdate=11 October 2015|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/translation-adds-complexity-to-european-central-banks-supervisory-role-1414580925}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|page=26|title=The Application of multilingualism in the European Union Context|publisher=ECB|date=February 2006|accessdate=11 October 2015||url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp2.pdf|first=Phoebus|last= Athanassiou}}</ref>  

==Independence==

===Political independence===
The independence of the ECB is instrumental in maintaining price stability. Not only must the bank not seek influence, but EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECB's independence. To offer some accountability, the ECB is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Council]].<ref name="ECB Acc">{{cite web |title=Accountability |publisher=European Central Bank |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html |accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> The European Parliament also gets to question and then issue its opinion on candidates to the executive board.<ref name="BF EB">{{cite web |title=Executive Board |publisher=[[Banque de France]] |year=2005 |url=http://www.banque-france.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/banque_de_france/Eurosysteme_et_international/Directoire_GB.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref>

The governors of national central banks represented in the Governing Council of the ECB are appointed by their national executives, and can be reappointed. In spite of the fact that voting inside the ECB is secret, there is some evidence pointing in the direction of Governing Council members voting along national lines.<ref>Friedrich Heinemann and Felix Huefner (2004) 'Is the view from the Eurotower purely European? National divergence and ECB interest rate policy', ''Scottish Journal of Political Economy'' 51(4):544-558.</ref><ref>Jose Ramon Cancelo, Diego Varela and Jose Manuel Sanchez-Santos (2011) 'Interest rate setting at the ECB: Individual preferences and collective decision making', ''Journal of Policy Modeling'' 33(6): 804-820. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpolmod.2011.08.017 DOI].</ref>

===Financial independence===
The ECB's financial independence means that the ECB has its own budget. Its capital is subscribed and paid up by the euro area central banks.<ref name="Independence">{{cite web |title=Independence |publisher=European Central Bank |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/independence/html/index.en.html |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>

===Other provisions===
The Eurosystem is functionally—i.e., operationally—independent.

Governors of national central banks (NCBs) and members of the executive board of the ECB have security of tenure:<ref name="Independence"/>
*NCB governors have a minimum term of office of five years.
*Members of the Executive Board have a non-renewable term of office of eight years.
*Their removal from office can only be in the event of incapacity or grave misconduct.

==Sovereign debt crisis==
{{main|European debt crisis}}
From late 2009 a handful of mainly southern eurozone member states started being unable to repay their national Euro-denominated [[government debt]] or to finance the bail-out of troubled financial sectors under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties. This so-called ''[[European debt crisis]]'' began after Greece's new elected government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit and openly communicated the imminent danger of a Greek sovereign default. Seeing a sovereign default in the eurozone as a shock, the general public, international and European institutions, and the financial community started to intensively reassess the economic situation and creditworthiness of eurozone states. Those eurozone states being assessed as not financially sustainable enough on their current path, faced waves of [[credit rating]] downgrades and rising borrowing costs including increasing interest rate spreads. As a consequence, the ability of these states to borrow new money to further finance their budget deficits or to refinance existing unsustainable debt levels was strongly reduced.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61F0W720100216 |title= Peripheral euro zone government bond spreads widen |agency=Reuters   |author=George Matlock |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16009099 | title=Acropolis now | work=The Economist | date= 29 April 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=wsj>{{Cite news| author=Brian Blackstone, Tom Lauricella, and Neil Shah | title = Global Markets Shudder: Doubts About U.S. Economy and a Debt Crunch in Europe Jolt Hopes for a Recovery |  work=The Wall Street Journal | date = 5 February 2010 | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704041504575045743430262982.html |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/8553-greek-debt-crisis-worsens | title= Greek Debt Crisis Worsens | author=Bruce Walker |date=9 April 2010 |publisher=[[The New American]] |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/world/europe/geir-haarde-former-iceland-leader-goes-on-trial-for-role-in-financial-crisis.html "Former Iceland Leader Tried Over Financial Crisis of 2008"], ''The New York Times'', 5 March 2012.

===States in debt crisis===
The eurozone states that have applied for and received rescue funds to repay their due debt or bailout their financial sector are Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus, and Spain.

There have been discussions that Italy may not be that far away from a debt crisis depending on its future political, economical, and financial development. To a lesser extent, there have been discussion if France can get also into trouble servicing its debt.

===Main causes===
The European debt crisis had various causes with different weightings in the respective crisis states. The main causes were:
* Joining the [[Euro|currency union]] without sufficient [[Euro convergence criteria|financial convergence]] and [[Stability and Growth Pact|stability]]: Some member states adopted the Euro without fulfilling the agreed-on stability and convergence criteria on a long-term basis. These criteria had been fixed in the [[Treaties of the European Union|intergovernmental treaties]] beforehand to prevent financial tensions and imbalances between the eurozone states.
* Further deterioration of financials: After joining the Euro some eurozone states did not put much emphasis on keeping their public debt and budget deficit in certain ranges or reduce deviations from unhealthy levels even though they were obliged so by the intergovernmental contracts.
* Poor [[Financial regulation|financial sector supervision]]: Some eurozone states relaxed their national financial sector supervision to allow banks and other financial institutions to finance projects with excessive growth rates and inflated collateral. Those short-term ballooning credits started to get much higher in value than the real long-term value of the inflated underlying projects. Especially the produced and collapsed property bubbles in [[Spanish property bubble|Spain]] and [[Irish property bubble|Ireland]] sent huge shock waves to those economies. Not only the bubbles collapsed but also the unsustainable tax revenues out of this excessive boom phase that had led to unsustainable high public expenses and later on produced high budget deficits. The relaxed supervision also created expensive bailout needs for tumbling banks and other financial institutions. 
* Cheap money: The Eurozone member states faced generally easy credit conditions in many of the years preceding the debt crisis with lenders not really understanding the national level of competitiveness and financial indebtedness when excessively financing some members' state public deficits and their private economy boom including financial institutions.
* Destruction of competitiveness: Some states had above-average wage and costs increases in their national economies after joining the Euro thereby reducing their competitiveness. Additionally, some states continued to have above-average corruption and inefficiency levels so their competitiveness was further impaired and capital invested in these economies misallocated. Increasing trade deficits were an important sign of the continuous loss of competitiveness in certain eurozone states. But those signs were not really monitored in the times of excessive "boom" growth rates before the debt crisis erupted.
* No insolvency, crisis, or exit mechanisms: As it was not foreseen that eurozone states would deviate from the stability criteria to an extent that a debt crisis would erupt, no tools or mechanisms had been prepared to prevent or handle a debt crisis in eurozone states.

===New mechanisms===
The ECB has pronounced that the EU and its member states are in the main responsibility to solve the debt crisis of some member states. Until 2009 there had not been sufficient instruments in place on the eurozone level to prevent or solve a debt crisis in a member state. Several systems have been put into place since then to fill this gap: 
* In 2010, two temporary rescue programmes have been started, the [[European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism|European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM)]] and the [[European Financial Stability Facility|European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)]]. Together with massive financial support of the [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund (IMF)]], these facilities have provided funds to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal in 2010 and 2011.
* In 2012 the [[European Stability Mechanism|European Stability Mechanism (ESM)]] with a lending capacity of €500 billion, has been established to replace the previous temporary rescue programmes. The ESM is intended as a permanent firewall for the eurozone to safeguard and provide instant access to financial assistance programmes for member states in financial difficulty. Spain and Cyprus have drawn funds from the ESM programme in 2012 and 2013, with a focus on recapitalization (bail-out) of their financial sectors.
* In 2013 the [[European Fiscal Compact]] became valid as a contract that obliges the EU member states to introduce domestic self-correcting mechanisms on member state level to ensure balanced public budgets and sustainable public debt levels.
* In 2014 the [[Single Supervisory Mechanism|Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)]] was introduced. It grants the European Central Bank (ECB) a supervisory role to monitor the financial stability of banks in the eurozone states (full members) and other EU states. This supervision is intended as a first step to prevent bank bailout needs in EU states that could induce or contribute to a debt crisis in the respective state.

The EU contracts forbid the financial bailout of other eurozone countries having problems to service their financial obligations. The emergency set-up of the various eurozone rescue funds to help the crisis states to fulfill their obligations was to a certain degree a violation of the non-bailout clause, but it is documented that there were no alternatives that the eurozone states could agree on in this unforeseen debt crisis situation. There is a widespread agreement that these rescue funds only buy time to implement reforms and strengthen the competitiveness of the states being in a debt crisis.

There is also a widespread view that giving much more financial support to continuously cover the debt crisis or allow even higher budget deficits or debt levels would discourage the crisis states to implement necessary reforms to regain their competitiveness. So there has been a reluctance of the ECB to further stretch or violate its mandate to solve the crisis, even though the ECB has chosen to play an active role with its own monetary policy instruments to support the troubled states and their financial sectors. There has also been a reluctance of financially stable eurozone states like Germany to further circumvent the no-bailout clause in the EU contracts and to generally take on the burden of financing or guaranteeing the debts of financially unstable or defaulting eurozone countries.

This has led to public discussions if Greece, Portugal, and even Italy would be better off leaving the eurozone to regain economical and financial stability if they would not implement reforms to strengthen their competitiveness as part of the eurozone in time. Greece had the greatest need for reforms but also most problems to implement those, so the Greek exit, also called "Grexit", has been widely discussed. Germany, as a large and financially stable state being in the focus to be asked to guarantee or repay other states debt, has never pushed those exits. Their position is to keep Greece within the eurozone, but not at any cost. If the worst comes to the worst, priority should be given to the euro's stability.<ref name="EwingAlderman2011">{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Ewing |first2=Liz |last2=Alderman |title=Some in Germany Want Greece to Temporarily Exit the Euro Zone |newspaper=New York Times |date=10 August 2011 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/business/global/greece-feels-push-toward-euro-exit.html }}</ref><ref name = "Walker-Bisserbe-2011">{{cite news |first=Marcus|last=Walker|first2=Noemie| last2=Bisserbe|title=Merkel Lessens Fears Over Greece: German Leader Rejects Suggestions Athens Be Allowed to Default or Leave Currency Bloc, Reassuring Nervous Markets|newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=14 September 2011|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904265504576568693911614726.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_987416/Content/DE/Artikel/2011/11/2011-11-03-merkel-sakozy-griechenland.html | title=Stabiler Euro geht vor | trans-title=Stable euro comes first | date=3 November 2011 | deadurl=yes | archivedate=21 January 2010 | publisher=[[Bundesregierung]] | language=de | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121182852/http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_987416/Content/DE/Artikel/2011/11/2011-11-03-merkel-sakozy-griechenland.html }}</ref>

===ECB answer===
There are a variety of possible responses to the problem of bad debts in a banking system. One is to induce debtors to make a greater effort to make good on their debt.<ref name="Euro debt crisis" /> With public debt this usually means getting governments to maintain debt payments while cutting back on other forms of expenditure.<ref name="Euro debt crisis" /> Such policies often involve cutting back on popular social programmes.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sabrina |last=Cohen |title=Italian Unions Criticize Austerity Plan |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=14 August 2011 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903392904576508253558418390.html }}</ref>

Stringent policies with regard to social expenditures and employment in the state sector have led to riots and political protests in Greece.<ref>{{cite news |author=CNN Wire Staff |title=Greek austerity protests turn ugly as strike begins |date=28 June 2011 |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-06-28/world/greece.strike_1_police-and-protesters-stone-throwing-demonstrators-force-protesters?_s=PM:WORLD }}</ref> Another response is to shift losses from the central bank to private investors who are asked to "share the pain" of partial defaults that take the form of rescheduling debt payments.<ref name="Euro debt crisis" />

However, if the debt rescheduling causes losses on loans held by European banks, it weakens the private banking system, which then puts pressure on the central bank to come to the aid of those banks. Private-sector bond holders are an integral part of the public and private banking system. Another possible response is for wealthy member countries to guarantee or purchase the debt of countries that have defaulted or are likely to default.<ref name="Euro debt crisis" /> This alternative requires that the tax revenues and credit of the wealthy member countries be used to refinance the previous borrowing of the weaker member countries, and is politically controversial.<ref>{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Castle |title=Euro Zone Seeks Deal on Greece |date=15 July 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/16/business/global/eu-leaders-to-meet-thursday-to-try-to-break-deadlock-on-greece.html }}</ref>

====Bond purchase====
[[File:ECB SMP Bond Purchases.png|thumb|200px|ECB Securities Markets Programme (SMP) covering bond purchases since May 2010]]
In contrast to the Fed, the ECB normally does not buy bonds outright.<ref>Bagus, ''The Tragedy of the Euro'', 2010, p.75.</ref> The normal procedure used by the ECB for manipulating the money supply has been via the so-called refinancing facilities. In these facilities, bonds are not purchased but used in reverse transactions: [[repurchase agreement]]s, or [[Collateral (finance)|collateralised loans]]. These two transactions are similar, i.e. bonds are used as collaterals for loans, the difference being of legal nature. In the repos the ownership of the collateral changes to the ECB until the loan is repaid.

This changed with the recent [[European sovereign-debt crisis|sovereign-debt crisis]]. The ECB always could, and through the late summer of 2011 did, purchase bonds issued by the weaker states even though it assumes, in doing so, the risk of a deteriorating balance sheet. ECB buying focused primarily on Spanish and Italian debt.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=McManus |first2=Dan |last2=O'Brien |title=Market rout as Berlin rejects call for more EU action |journal=Irish Times |date=5 August 2011 }}</ref> Certain techniques can minimise the impact. Purchases of Italian bonds by the central bank, for example, were intended to dampen international speculation and strengthen portfolios in the private sector and also the central bank.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Walker |first2=Damian |last2=Paletta |first3=Brian |last3=Blacksone |title=Global Crisis of Confidence World Policy Makers' Inability to Agree on Fixes Led Markets on Wild Ride |journal=Wall Street Journal |date=13 August 2011 |url= }}</ref>

The assumption is that speculative activity will decrease over time and the value of the assets increase. Such a move is similar to what the US federal reserve did in buying subprime mortgages in the crisis of 2008, except in the European crisis, the purchases are of member state debt. The risk of such a move is that it could diminish the value of the currency.<ref name="Euro debt working paper" />

On the other hand, certain financial techniques can reduce the impact of such purchases on the currency.<ref name="Euro debt working paper" /> One is [[Sterilization (economics)|sterilisation]], in which highly valued assets are sold at the same time that the weaker assets are purchased, which keeps the money supply neutral.<ref name="Euro debt working paper" /> Another technique is simply to accept the bad assets as long-term collateral (as opposed to short-term repo swaps) to be held until their market value stabilises. This would imply, as a quid pro quo, adjustments in taxation and expenditure in the economies of the weaker states to improve the perceived value of the assets.<ref name="Euro debt working paper" />

When the ECB buys bonds from other creditors such as European banks, the ECB does not disclose the transaction prices. Creditors profit of bargains with bonds sold at prices that exceed market's quotes.

As of 18 June 2012, the ECB in total had spent €212.1bn (equal to 2.2% of the Eurozone GDP) for bond purchases covering outright debt, as part of its '''Securities Markets Programme''' (SMP) running since May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commbank.com.au/corporate/research/publications/economics/economic-issues/international/2012/180612-ECB.pdf|title=The ECB’s Securities Market Programme (SMP) – about to restart bond purchases?|format=PDF|work=Global Markets Research – International Economics|publisher=Commonwealth Bank|date=18 June 2012|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> On 6 September 2012, the ECB announced a new plan for buying bonds from eurozone countries.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/business/global/european-central-bank-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged-at-0-75-percent.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=Jack | last1=Ewing | first2=Steven | last2=Erlanger | title=Europe's Central Bank Moves Aggressively to Ease Euro Crisis | date=6 September 2012}}</ref> The duration of the previous SMP was temporary,<ref>European Central Bank [http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/l_12420100520en00080009.pdf Decision of the ECB of 14 May 2010].</ref> while the '''[[Outright Monetary Transactions]]''' (OMT) programme has no [[ex-ante]] time or size limit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120906.en.html|title=ECB press conference, 6 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> On 4 September 2014, the bank went further by announcing it would buy bonds and other debt instruments primarily from banks in a bid to boost the availability of credit for businesses.<ref name="ECBcuts"/> 

The '''Emergency Lending Assistance''' (ELA) programme was designed for financial institutions in a liquidity crisis, such as the Greek banks in the course of the 2015 Greek financial snafu, when the banks experienced massive deposit flight.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/15/us-ecb-policy-idUSKBN0N60N820150415 reuters.com: "ECB promises 'firm' roll-out of money printing"], 15 Apr 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/15/us-ecb-policy-greece-idUSKBN0N61K520150415 reuters.com: "ECB's Draghi says extending ELA for Greek banks is in Athens' hands"], 15 Apr 2015</ref>

On 9 March 2015 the ECB started its [[quantitative easing]] programme, which was designed to ease sovereign stress in its member states. Purchases are €60bn per month. The program is expected to last until at least September 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Getting the machines revving|url = http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/03/quantitative-easing-and-euro|newspaper = The Economist|date = Mar 9, 2015 <!-- 15:26 --> |access-date = 2015-05-12|issn = 0013-0613}}</ref>

====Long-term refinancing operation====
Though the ECB's main refinancing operations (MRO) are from repo auctions with a (bi)weekly maturity and monthly maturation, the ECB now conducts ''long-term refinancing operations'' (LTROs), maturing after three months, six months, 12 months and 36 months. In 2003, refinancing via LTROs amounted to 45 bln euro which is about 20% of overall liquidity provided by the ECB.<ref>{{cite news|title=THE LONGER TERM REFINANCING OPERATIONS OF THE ECB|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp359.pdf|date=May 2004|format=PDF}}</ref>

The ECB's first supplementary longer-term refinancing operation (LTRO) with a six-month maturity was announced March 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=ECB offers longer-term finance via six-month LTROs|url=http://www.euromoney.com/Article/1925778/ECB-offers-longer-term-finance-via-six-month-LTROs.html|date=May 2008}}</ref> Previously the longest tender offered was three months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euromoney.com/Article/2985829/LTROs.html|author=Erica Jeffery|title=International banking, finance, capital markets news & analysis &#124; Euromoney magazine|publisher=[[Euromoney]]|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref> It announced two 3-month and one 6-month full allotment of Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs). The first tender was settled 3 April, and was more than four times oversubscribed. The €25 billion auction drew bids amounting to €103.1 billion, from 177 banks. Another six-month tender was allotted on 9 July, again to the amount of €25 billion. The first 12-month LTRO in June 2009 had close to 1100 bidders.<ref name="ftalphaville1">{{cite news|title=Markets live transcript 29 February 2012|url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/02/29/903631/markets-live/|date=February 2012}}{{registration required}}</ref>

On 21 December 2011 the bank instituted a programme of making low-interest loans with a term of three years (36 months) and 1% interest to European banks accepting loans from the portfolio of the banks as collateral. Loans totalling €489.2 bn (US$640 bn) were announced. The loans were not offered to European states, but government securities issued by European states would be acceptable collateral as would [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] and other [[commercial paper]] that can be demonstrated to be secure. The programme was announced on 8 December 2011 but observers were surprised by the volume of the loans made when it was implemented.<ref name=ECB82011>{{cite web|title=Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&A)|url=http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2011/html/is111208.en.html|publisher=European Central Bank |date=8 December 2011 |author=Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB|location=Frankfurt am Main|format=Press conference |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref><ref name=NYTloans>{{cite news|title=European Bank in Strong Move to Loosen Credit|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/business/global/demand-for-ecb-loans-surpasses-expectations.html|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 December 2011|author=Nelson D.

===Powers and objectives during the European banking crisis===
The European debt crisis has revealed some relative weaknesses in the sovereign debt of such member countries as Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain.<ref>{{cite news |first=Raphel |last=Minder |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/25/business/global/25spainecon.html |title=Fears Mount Over Spain and Risks to the Euro |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=24 November 2010 |accessdate=24 November 2010 }}</ref>

Rescue operations involving sovereign debt have included temporarily moving bad or weak assets off the balance sheets of the weak member banks into the balance sheets of the European Central Bank.<ref name="Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU">{{cite web | url=http://www.nber.org/~wbuiter/Greece.pdf | title=Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU | publisher=NBER | date=7 September 2010 | accessdate=30 October 2011 | author=Buite, Willem}}</ref> Such action is viewed as [[monetisation]] and can be seen as an inflationary threat, whereby the strong member countries of the ECB shoulder the burden of monetary expansion (and potential inflation) to save the weak member countries.<ref name="Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU" />  Most central banks prefer to move weak assets off their balance sheets with some kind of agreement as to how the debt will continue to be serviced.<ref name="Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU" />  This preference has typically led the ECB to argue that the weaker member countries must:
* Allocate considerable national income to servicing debts.<ref name="Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU" />
* Scale back a wide range of national expenditures (such as education, infrastructure, and welfare transfer payments) to make their payments.<ref name="Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU" />

The European Central Bank had stepped up the buying of member nations debt.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/1202/1224284573209.html |title=Euro zone bonds rally after ECB debt buying |newspaper=Irish Times |date=2 December 2010 }}{{subscription required}}</ref> In response to the crisis of 2010, some proposals have surfaced for a collective European bond issue that would allow the central bank to purchase a European version of [[Treasury bill|US Treasury bills]].<ref name="Walker-20101217">{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Walker |title=Closer Fiscal Union: A Collective Guarantee |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=17 December 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703395204576023784088914652.html }}</ref><ref name="Simon-20101207">{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Nixon |title=A Way Around European Bonds |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=7 December 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704156304576003760628199904.html }}</ref> To make European sovereign debt assets more similar to a US Treasury, a collective guarantee of the member states' solvency would be necessary.{{efn|The European dilemma may be imagined as follows. In the US, if tax collections from California are weak, the total federal debt is financed through tax collections in other states, through federal taxes. California may default on its state debt, but the federal government bypasses California in directly taxing California citizens to finance the federal debt. There is only one legal authority taxing, paying for, and backing the federal debt. Federal expenditures are determined by the federal government. Therefore California cannot leverage more money out of the federal system other than by means of the normal constitutional procedures in the House and Senate. If the federal government transfers additional money to California it is because of federal policy, not because California's state debt is threatening the backing of the US dollar. Consider this hypothetical: If the US federal reserve carried state debts on its balance sheets the system would be more similar to the ECB. If California stated to default on its debt a hole would appear on the Fed's balance sheets where it carried California bonds. To make good this loss, the Fed would have to raise capital from the more solvent states, giving rise to the political issue that California's "lack of responsibility" was forcing other states to jump in and save California's public debt. This, one might worry, could turn into a license to California to ignore fiscal restraints and in effect transfer money from the "more responsible states" to the "least responsible states."  Even though California's state finances are faltering in 2010, this is not an issue for the Federal Reserve, because of the federal system of taxation and unified backing of the federal debt. In Europe, the ECB could push for greater political and fiscal integration, which would make the member states more explicitly responsible for backing each other's debts and potentially lead to greater political integration. Speculative attacks on the sovereign debt that backs the euro have in effect revealed the weaknesses in the EU's political and fiscal structure.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} }}  But the German government has resisted this proposal, and other analyses indicate that "the sickness of the euro" is due to the linkage between sovereign debt and failing national banking systems. If the European central bank were to deal directly with failing banking systems sovereign debt would not look as leveraged relative to national income in the financially weaker member states.<ref name="Simon-20101207" />

In 2011, the European member states may need to raise as much as US$2&nbsp;trillion in debt.<ref name="Walker-Forelle-20101217" />  Some of this will be new debt and some will be previous debt that is "rolled over" as older loans reach maturity.

In late May 2012, looking ahead to further challenges with Greece, Bundesbank chief and ECB council member [[Jens Weidmann]] pointed out that the council could veto "emergency liquidity assistance" (ELA) to, for instance, Greece through a two–third majority of the council. If Greece chose to default on its debts yet wanted to stay in the Euro, the ELA would be one of the ways to accommodate the country's and its banks' liquidity needs or, alternatively, to precipitate departure.<ref name=MW01/>

====European financial stability facility====
{{main|European Financial Stability Facility}}
On 9 May 2010, the 27 [[Member States of the European Union|member states of the European Union]] agreed to incorporate the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).<ref name="Europa EFSF">{{cite web|url=http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/index.htm |title=About EFSF|work=EFSF|date=9 May 2010|accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> The EFSF's mandate is to safeguard financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to Eurozone Member States.<ref name="Europa EFSF" />

The EFSF is authorised to use the following instruments linked to appropriate conditionality:
* To provide loans to countries in financial difficulties (e.g. Greek bailout).<ref name="Europa EFSF" />
* To intervene in the primary and secondary debt markets. Intervention in the secondary debt market will be only on the basis of an ECB analysis recognising the existence of exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability.<ref name="Europa EFSF" />
* Act on the basis of a precautionary programme.<ref name="Europa EFSF" />
* Finance recapitalisations of financial institutions through loans to governments<ref name="Europa EFSF" />

The EFSF is backed by guarantee commitments from the Eurozone member states for a total of €780bn and has a lending capacity of €440bn.<ref name="Europa EFSF" /> In 2011, it was assigned the best possible credit rating (AAA by [[Standard & Poor's]] and [[Fitch Ratings]], Aaa by [[Moody's]])<ref name="Europa EFSF" />

===Monetary policy tools===
The principal monetary policy tool of the European central bank is collateralised borrowing or repo agreements.<ref name="Euro debt crisis">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-all-about-european-debt-crisis-in-simple-terms/20110819.htm |title=All about the European debt crisis: In SIMPLE terms|date=19 August 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011|work=rediff business|publisher=rediff.com}}</ref> These tools are also used by the United States [[Federal Reserve Bank]], but the Fed does more direct purchasing of financial assets than its European counterpart.<ref name="US Open Market operations">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html | title=Open Market Operation&nbsp;– Fedpoints&nbsp;– Federal Reserve Bank of New York | publisher=newyorkfed.org | work=Federal Reserve Bank of New York | date=August 2011 | accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref> The collateral used by the ECB is typically high quality public and private sector debt.<ref name="Euro debt crisis" />

The criteria for determining "high quality" for public debt have been preconditions for membership in the European Union: total debt must not be too large in relation to gross domestic product, for example, and deficits in any given year must not become too large.<ref name="Euro debt working paper">{{cite web|url=http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/304/1/wp_2011_1_darvas.pdf |title=WOrking paper 2011 / 1 A Comprehensive approach to the EUro-area debt crisis|date=February 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011|work=Zsolt Darvas|publisher=Corvinus University of Budapest |format=PDF}}</ref> Though these criteria are fairly simple, a number of accounting techniques may hide the underlying reality of fiscal solvency—or the lack of same.<ref name="Euro debt working paper" />

====Regulatory reliance on credit ratings====
Think-tanks such as the World Pensions Council have also argued that European legislators have pushed somewhat dogmatically for the adoption of the [[Basel II]] recommendations, adopted in 2005, transposed in European Union law through the [[Capital Requirements Directive]] (CRD), effective since 2008. In essence, they forced European banks, and, more importantly, the European Central Bank itself e.g. when gauging the [[solvency]] of financial institutions, to rely more than ever on standardised assessments of [[credit risk]] marketed by two non-European private agencies: Moody's and S&P.
