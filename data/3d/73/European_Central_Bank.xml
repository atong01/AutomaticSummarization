When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again. An increase in the quantity of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy. A decrease has the contrary effect. The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Bank's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability. In layman terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks, carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.<template><target>efn</target><arg name="The process is similar, though on a grand scale, to an individual who every month charges $10,000 on his or her credit card, pays it off every month, but also withdraws (and pays off) an additional $10,000 each succeeding month for transaction purposes. Such a person is operating "net borrowed" on a continual basis, and even though the borrowing from the credit card is short term, the effect is a stable increase in the money supply. If the person borrows less, less money circulates in the economy. If he or she borrows more, the money supply increases. An individual's ability to borrow from his or her credit card company is determined by the credit card company: it reflects the company's overall judgment of its ability to lend to all borrowers, and also its appraisal of the financial condition of that one particular borrower. The ability of member banks to borrow from the central bank is fundamentally similar.{{citation needed|date">September 2015}}<space/></arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>To qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities.

Those short-term ballooning credits started to get much higher in value than the real long-term value of the inflated underlying projects. Especially the produced and collapsed property bubbles in<space/><link><target>Spanish property bubble</target><part>Spain</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Irish property bubble</target><part>Ireland</part></link><space/>sent huge shock waves to those economies. Not only the bubbles collapsed but also the unsustainable tax revenues out of this excessive boom phase that had led to unsustainable high public expenses and later on produced high budget deficits. The relaxed supervision also created expensive bailout needs for tumbling banks and other financial institutions.<space/></listitem><listitem>Cheap money: The Eurozone member states faced generally easy credit conditions in many of the years preceding the debt crisis with lenders not really understanding the national level of competitiveness and financial indebtedness when excessively financing some members' state public deficits and their private economy boom including financial institutions.</listitem><listitem>Destruction of competitiveness: Some states had above-average wage and costs increases in their national economies after joining the Euro thereby reducing their competitiveness. Additionally, some states continued to have above-average corruption and inefficiency levels so their competitiveness was further impaired and capital invested in these economies misallocated. Increasing trade deficits were an important sign of the continuous loss of competitiveness in certain eurozone states. But those signs were not really monitored in the times of excessive &quot;boom&quot; growth rates before the debt crisis erupted.</listitem><listitem>No insolvency, crisis, or exit mechanisms: As it was not foreseen that eurozone states would deviate from the stability criteria to an extent that a debt crisis would erupt, no tools or mechanisms had been prepared to prevent or handle a debt crisis in eurozone states.</listitem></list><heading level='3'>New mechanisms</heading><paragraph>The ECB has pronounced that the EU and its member states are in the main responsibility to solve the debt crisis of some member states. Until 2009 there had not been sufficient instruments in place on the eurozone level to prevent or solve a debt crisis in a member state. Several systems have been put into place since then to fill this gap:<space/></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>In 2010, two temporary rescue programmes have been started, the<space/><link><target>European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism</target><part>European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM)</part></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>European Financial Stability Facility</target><part>European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)</part></link>.

The ESM is intended as a permanent firewall for the eurozone to safeguard and provide instant access to financial assistance programmes for member states in financial difficulty. Spain and Cyprus have drawn funds from the ESM programme in 2012 and 2013, with a focus on recapitalization (bail-out) of their financial sectors.</listitem><listitem>In 2013 the<space/><link><target>European Fiscal Compact</target></link><space/>became valid as a contract that obliges the EU member states to introduce domestic self-correcting mechanisms on member state level to ensure balanced public budgets and sustainable public debt levels.</listitem><listitem>In 2014 the<space/><link><target>Single Supervisory Mechanism</target><part>Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)</part></link><space/>was introduced. It grants the European Central Bank (ECB) a supervisory role to monitor the financial stability of banks in the eurozone states (full members) and other EU states. This supervision is intended as a first step to prevent bank bailout needs in EU states that could induce or contribute to a debt crisis in the respective state.</listitem></list><paragraph>The EU contracts forbid the financial bailout of other eurozone countries having problems to service their financial obligations. The emergency set-up of the various eurozone rescue funds to help the crisis states to fulfill their obligations was to a certain degree a violation of the non-bailout clause, but it is documented that there were no alternatives that the eurozone states could agree on in this unforeseen debt crisis situation. There is a widespread agreement that these rescue funds only buy time to implement reforms and strengthen the competitiveness of the states being in a debt crisis.</paragraph><paragraph>There is also a widespread view that giving much more financial support to continuously cover the debt crisis or allow even higher budget deficits or debt levels would discourage the crisis states to implement necessary reforms to regain their competitiveness. So there has been a reluctance of the ECB to further stretch or violate its mandate to solve the crisis, even though the ECB has chosen to play an active role with its own monetary policy instruments to support the troubled states and their financial sectors. There has also been a reluctance of financially stable eurozone states like Germany to further circumvent the no-bailout clause in the EU contracts and to generally take on the burden of financing or guaranteeing the debts of financially unstable or defaulting eurozone countries.</paragraph><paragraph>This has led to public discussions if Greece, Portugal, and even Italy would be better off leaving the eurozone to regain economical and financial stability if they would not implement reforms to strengthen their competitiveness as part of the eurozone in time. Greece had the greatest need for reforms but also most problems to implement those, so the Greek exit, also called &quot;Grexit&quot;, has been widely discussed. Germany, as a large and financially stable state being in the focus to be asked to guarantee or repay other states debt, has never pushed those exits. Their position is to keep Greece within the eurozone, but not at any cost. If the worst comes to the worst, priority should be given to the euro's stability.<extension extension_name='ref' name="EwingAlderman2011"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="first">Jack<space/></arg><arg name="last">Ewing<space/></arg><arg name="first2">Liz<space/></arg><arg name="last2">Alderman<space/></arg><arg name="title">Some in Germany Want Greece to Temporarily Exit the Euro Zone<space/></arg><arg name="newspaper">New York Times<space/></arg><arg name="date">10 August 2011<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/business/global/greece-feels-push-toward-euro-exit.html<space/></arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Walker-Bisserbe-2011"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="first">Marcus</arg><arg name="last">Walker</arg><arg name="first2">Noemie</arg><arg name="last2">Bisserbe</arg><arg name="title">Merkel Lessens Fears Over Greece: German Leader Rejects Suggestions Athens Be Allowed to Default or Leave Currency Bloc, Reassuring Nervous Markets</arg><arg name="newspaper">Wall Street Journal<space/></arg><arg name="date">14 September 2011</arg><arg name="url">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904265504576568693911614726.html?mod</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_987416/Content/DE/Artikel/2011/11/2011-11-03-merkel-sakozy-griechenland.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Stabiler Euro geht vor<space/></arg><arg name="trans-title">Stable euro comes first<space/></arg><arg name="date">3 November 2011<space/></arg><arg name="deadurl">yes<space/></arg><arg name="archivedate">21 January 2010<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">[[Bundesregierung]]<space/></arg><arg name="language">de<space/></arg><arg name="archiveurl">https://web.archive.org/web/20120121182852/http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_987416/Content/DE/Artikel/2011/11/2011-11-03-merkel-sakozy-griechenland.html<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>ECB answer</heading><paragraph>There are a variety of possible responses to the problem of bad debts in a banking system.

Treasury, a collective guarantee of the member states' solvency would be necessary.<template><target>efn</target><arg name="The European dilemma may be imagined as follows. In the US, if tax collections from California are weak, the total federal debt is financed through tax collections in other states, through federal taxes. California may default on its state debt, but the federal government bypasses California in directly taxing California citizens to finance the federal debt. There is only one legal authority taxing, paying for, and backing the federal debt. Federal expenditures are determined by the federal government. Therefore California cannot leverage more money out of the federal system other than by means of the normal constitutional procedures in the House and Senate. If the federal government transfers additional money to California it is because of federal policy, not because California's state debt is threatening the backing of the US dollar. Consider this hypothetical: If the US federal reserve carried state debts on its balance sheets the system would be more similar to the ECB. If California stated to default on its debt a hole would appear on the Fed's balance sheets where it carried California bonds. To make good this loss, the Fed would have to raise capital from the more solvent states, giving rise to the political issue that California's "lack of responsibility" was forcing other states to jump in and save California's public debt. This, one might worry, could turn into a license to California to ignore fiscal restraints and in effect transfer money from the "more responsible states" to the "least responsible states." Even though California's state finances are faltering in 2010, this is not an issue for the Federal Reserve, because of the federal system of taxation and unified backing of the federal debt. In Europe, the ECB could push for greater political and fiscal integration, which would make the member states more explicitly responsible for backing each other's debts and potentially lead to greater political integration. Speculative attacks on the sovereign debt that backs the euro have in effect revealed the weaknesses in the EU's political and fiscal structure.{{citation needed|date">September 2015}}<space/></arg></template><space/>But the German government has resisted this proposal, and other analyses indicate that &quot;the sickness of the euro&quot; is due to the linkage between sovereign debt and failing national banking systems. If the European central bank were to deal directly with failing banking systems sovereign debt would not look as leveraged relative to national income in the financially weaker member states.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Simon-20101207"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>On 17 December 2010, the ECB announced that it was going to double its capitalisation.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Walker-Forelle-20101217"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="first">Marcus<space/></arg><arg name="last">Walker<space/></arg><arg name="lastauthoramp">yes<space/></arg><arg name="first2">Charles<space/></arg><arg name="last2">Forelle<space/></arg><arg name="title">Bailout Deal Fails to Quell EU rifts<space/></arg><arg name="newspaper">Wall Street Journal<space/></arg><arg name="date">17 December 2010<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703395204576023732485094802.html<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>(The ECB's most recent balance sheet before the announcement listed capital and reserves at 2.03&amp;nbsp;trillion.)<extension extension_name='ref' name="Balance sheet"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.ecb.int/stats/money/aggregates/bsheets/html/outstanding_amounts_L60.X.Z5.0000.en.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Aggregated balance sheet of euro area monetary financial institutions, excluding the Eurosystem<space/></arg><arg name="work">ECB.int<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>The 16 central banks of the member states would transfer assets to the ledger of the ECB.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2011, the European member states may need to raise as much as US$2&amp;nbsp;trillion in debt.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Walker-Forelle-20101217"></extension><space/>Some of this will be new debt and some will be previous debt that is &quot;rolled over&quot; as older loans reach maturity.
