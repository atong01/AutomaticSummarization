The Spaniards never bothered to definitely establish a border between Chile and Bolivia. Chile claimed its limit with Peru ran through the Loa River and that Bolivia was therefore landlocked, while Bolivia claimed it did have a coast and that the limit with Chile ran along the Salado River. The border remained vague throughout the 19th century. Finally, Bolivia and Chile agreed, in 1866, to allow Bolivia access to the Pacific and that the limit of the two countries would run along the 24th parallel. The area between the 25th and 23rd parallel would remain demilitarized and both nations would be allowed to mine there. It was also agreed that taxes on the exportation of<space/><link><target>Potassium nitrate</target><part>saltpeter</part></link><space/>would not increase.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>However, in 1879, Bolivian dictator General<space/><link><target>Hilarin Daza</target></link><space/>increased the taxes on the exportation of saltpeter, violating the 1866 treaty.

Daza then put an end to all commerce with Chile and exiled all Chilean residents in Bolivia (the Bolivian port of<space/><link><target>Antofagasta</target></link><space/>had more Chileans than Bolivians). In response, Chile declared war on Bolivia and occupied Bolivia's coast. Peru had, in 1873, signed a secret pact with Bolivia in which the two countries agreed to fight together against any nation that threatened either of them. When Peru refused to be neutral in the conflict between Chile and Bolivia, Chile declared war on Peru. Chile defeated both countries and annexed the coast claimed by Bolivia. This was ratified in a 1904 treaty.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Diplomatic relations with Bolivia continued to be strained because of Bolivia's continuing aspiration to the sea.

Chile and Peru participated in a common conflict against Spain, the<space/><link><target>Chincha Islands War</target></link><space/>(18641866), despite their causes for war with Spain where different. Despite the Chilean port of<space/><link><target>Valparaso</target></link><space/>was bombed and mostly destroyed by Spain during the conflict, the combined Peru-Chile fleet managed to defend Chilean territory near Abtao, and the Peruvian defenders of Callao managed to drive back the Spanish attack. In 1873, Peru signed a secret defensive pact with Bolivia in which it agreed to help that nation in case of foreign attack. The moment came in 1879, when Chile declared war on Bolivia. Peru refused to null its defensive pact with Bolivia, and Chile declared war on Peru. The<space/><link><target>War of the Pacific</target></link>, as the conflict was called, resulted in a decisive victory for Chile, which managed to reach Lima and occupied Peru for a few years.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In 1883, Chile and Peru signed the Treaty of Ancn in which Peru handed over the Province of<space/><link><target>Tarapac Province (Peru)</target><part>Tarapac</part></link>.

In 1975, both countries were at the brink of war, only a few years before the centennial of the War of the Pacific. The conflict was fueled by ideological disputes: Peruvian General<space/><link><target>Juan Velasco</target></link><space/>was a left-winger while Chilean General<space/><link><target>Augusto Pinochet</target></link><space/>was a right-winger. Velasco, backed by<space/><link><target>Cuba</target></link>, set the date for invasion on August 6, the 150th independence anniversary of Bolivia, and the proposed date when Chile intended to grant this country with a sovereign corridor north of Arica, in former Peruvian territory, transfer not approved by Peru. However, he was successfully dissuaded from starting the invasion on that date by his advisor, General<space/><link><target>Francisco Morales Bermdez</target></link>, whose original family was from the former Peruvian (currently Chilean) region of Tarapac. Velasco later fell ill and was deposed by a group of generals who proclaimed Morales Bermdez president on August 28.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Morales Bermdez assured the Chilean government that Peru had no plans for an invasion despite its tremendous military superiority.

In 2005, the Peruvian Congress unilaterally approved a new law which stated the sea limit with Chile. Peru's position was that the border has never been fully demarcated, but Chile disagreed reminding on treaties in 1952 and 1954 between the countries, which supposedly defined seaborder. The border problem has still not been solved. However, former Chilean president<space/><link><target>Michelle Bachelet</target></link><space/>and Peru's<space/><link><target>Alan Garca</target></link><space/>established a positive diplomatic relationship, and it is very unlikely any hostilities will break out because of the dispute.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Nevertheless, in early April 2007, Peruvian nationalistic sectors, mainly represented by left wing ex-presidential candidate<space/><link><target>Ollanta Humala</target></link><space/>decided to congregate at 'hito uno' right at the border with Chile, in a symbolic attempt to claim sovereignty over a maritime area known in Peru as<space/><link><target>Mar de Grau</target></link><space/>(Grau's Sea) just west of the Chilean city of<space/><link><target>Arica</target></link>. Peruvian police stopped a group of nearly 2,000 people just ten kilometers from the border, preventing them from reaching their intended destination.
