'''Da capo''' {{IPA-it|da kˈkaːpo|}} is a [[musical term]] in [[Italian language|Italian]], meaning ''from the beginning'' (literally ''from the head'').  It is often abbreviated '''D.C.''' It is a [[composer]] or publisher's directive to [[repetition (music)|repeat]] the previous part of music, often used to save space. In small pieces this might be the same thing as a [[Repeat sign|repeat]], but in larger works D.C. might occur after one or more repeats of small [[section (music)|sections]], indicating a return to the very beginning. The resulting [[musical form|structure]] of the piece is generally in [[ternary form]]. Sometimes the composer describes the part to be repeated, for example: ''Menuet da capo''. In [[opera]], where an [[aria]] of this structure is called a [[da capo aria]], the repeated section is often adorned with [[grace note]]s.

Variations of the direction are:
* '''Da Capo al Fine''' (D.C. al Fine): repeat from beginning to the end ''(or up to the word '''fine''', should that appear at the end of the passage, movement &c. - the word '''"fine"''' itself signifying ''''"end" / "ending"''')''.
* '''Da Capo al Coda''' (D.C. al Coda): repeat from beginning to an indicated place and then play the tail part (the [[coda (music)|coda]]).

'''D.C. al Coda''' is a musical direction used in sheet music. It literally means, "da Capo al Coda," or "from the head to the tail". It directs the musician to go back and repeat the music from the beginning ("Capo"), and to continue playing until one reaches the first [[coda (music)|coda]] symbol. Upon reaching the first coda, one is to skip to the second coda symbol (which signifies the ending of the piece), and continue playing until the end. The portion of the piece from the second coda to the end is often referred to as the "coda" of the piece, or quite literally as the "end".
