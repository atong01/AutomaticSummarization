Its mission was extended twice to include an encounter with<space/><link><target>19P/Borrelly</target><part>Comet Borrelly</part></link><space/>and further engineering testing. Problems during its initial stages and with its star tracker led to repeated changes in mission configuration. While the flyby of the asteroid was a partial success, the encounter with the comet retrieved valuable information.

The asteroids in the inner Solar System move in relation to other bodies at a noticeable, predictable speed. Thus a spacecraft can determine its relative position by tracking such asteroids across the star background, which appears fixed over such timescales. Two or more asteroids let the spacecraft triangulate its position; two or more positions in time let the spacecraft determine its trajectory. Existing spacecraft are tracked by their interactions with the transmitters of the<space/><link><target>Deep Space Network</target></link><space/>(DSN), in effect an inverse<space/><link><target>Global Positioning System</target><part>GPS</part></link>. However, DSN tracking requires many skilled operators, and the DSN is overburdened by its use as a communications network. The use of Autonav reduces mission cost and DSN demands.</paragraph><paragraph>The Autonav system can also be used in reverse, tracking the position of bodies relative to the spacecraft.

This lack of a performance history in space meant that despite the potential savings in propellant mass, the technology was considered too experimental to be used for high-cost missions. Furthermore, unforeseen side effects of ion propulsion might in some way interfere with typical scientific experiments, such as fields and particle measurements. Therefore it was a primary mission of the Deep Space 1 demonstration to show long-duration use of an ion thruster on a scientific mission.<extension extension_name='ref' name="MD"><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="title">Mission design for deep space 1: A low-thrust technology validation mission

During the long cruise periods of the mission, spacecraft operations are essentially suspended. Instead of data, the craft emits a<space/><link><target>Carrier wave</target><part>carrier</part></link><space/>signal on a predetermined frequency. Without data decoding, the carrier can be detected by much simpler ground antennas and receivers. If the spacecraft detects an anomaly, it changes the carrier between four tones, based on urgency. Ground receivers then signal operators to divert DSN resources. This prevents skilled operators and expensive hardware from babysitting an unburdened mission operating nominally.

Because this band is higher in frequency than bands currently in use by deep-space missions, the same amount of data can be sent by smaller equipment in space and on the ground. Conversely, existing DSN antennas can split time among more missions.

However, it was later restored to action and performed excellently. Early in the mission, material ejected during launch vehicle separation caused the closely spaced ion extraction grids to short-circuit. The contamination was eventually cleared, as the material was eroded by electrical arcing, sublimed by outgassing, or simply allowed to drift out. This was achieved by repeatedly restarting the engine in an engine repair mode, arcing across trapped material.<extension extension_name='ref' name="results2000"><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="title">Results from the Deep Space 1 technology validation mission<space/></arg><arg name="author">Rayman, M.D. and Varghese, P. and Lehman, D.H. and Livesay, L.L.<space/></arg><arg name="journal">Acta Astronautica<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/17743/1/99-1185.pdf
