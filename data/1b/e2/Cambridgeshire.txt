'''Cambridgeshire''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|m|b|r|ɪ|dʒ|ʃ|ər}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|m|b|r|ɪ|dʒ|ʃ|ɪər}}; abbreviated '''Cambs.''') is an [[East Anglia|East Anglian]] [[Counties of England|county]] in [[England]], bordering [[Lincolnshire]] to the north, [[Norfolk]] to the north-east, [[Suffolk]] to the east, [[Essex]] and [[Hertfordshire]] to the south, and [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Northamptonshire]] to the west. The city of [[Cambridge]] is the [[county town]]. Modern Cambridgeshire was formed in 1974 as an amalgamation of the counties of [[Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely]] and [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]], which had been created in 1965 from the historic counties of Cambridgeshire, [[Huntingdonshire]], the [[Isle of Ely]] and the [[Soke of Peterborough]]. It contains most of the region known as [[Silicon Fen]]. 

==History==
{{Main|History of Cambridgeshire}}
Cambridgeshire is noted as the site of [[Flag Fen]] in [[Fengate]], one of the earliest-known [[Neolithic]] permanent settlements in the [[United Kingdom]], compared in importance to [[Balbridie]] in Aberdeen, Scotland. A great quantity of [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds from the [[Stone Age]], the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]] were made in [[East Cambridgeshire]]. Most items were found in [[Isleham]].

Cambridgeshire was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] as "Grantbridgeshire" (or rather ''Grentebrigescire'') (related to the river Granta).

Covering a large part of [[East Anglia]], Cambridgeshire today is the result of several local government unifications.  In 1888 when [[county council]]s were introduced, separate councils were set up, following the traditional division of Cambridgeshire, for
*the area in the south around Cambridge, and
*the liberty of the [[Isle of Ely]].
In 1965, these two administrative counties were merged to form [[Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely]].<ref>The Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely Order 1964 (SI 1964/366), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1967)]], ''Report and Proposals for the East Midlands General Review Area'' (Report No.3), 31 July 1961 and ''Report and Proposals for the Lincolnshire and East Anglia General Review Area'' (Report No.9), 7 May 1965</ref>
Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] this merged with the county to the west, [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]]. (The latter had been organised in 1965 by the merger of [[Huntingdonshire]] with the [[Soke of Peterborough]] – previously a part of [[Northamptonshire]] which had its own county council).  The resulting county was called simply Cambridgeshire.<ref>[[wikisource:The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972|The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972]] (SI 1972/2039) Part 5: County of Cambridgeshire</ref>

Since 1998, the [[City of Peterborough]] has been a separately administered area, as a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]]. It is associated with Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes such as [[Lord-Lieutenant|Lieutenancy]], and functions such as policing and the fire service.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1878/made The Cambridgeshire (City of Peterborough) (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996] (SI 1996/1878), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)]], ''Final Recommendations for the Future Local Government of Cambridgeshire'', October 1994 and ''Final Recommendations on the Future Local Government of Basildon & Thurrock, Blackburn & Blackpool, Broxtowe, Gedling & Rushcliffe, Dartford & Gravesham, Gillingham & Rochester upon Medway, Exeter, Gloucester, Halton & Warrington, Huntingdonshire & Peterborough, Northampton, Norwich, Spelthorne and the Wrekin'', December 1995</ref>

In 2002, the conservation charity [[Plantlife]] unofficially designated Cambridgeshire's [[county flower]] as the [[Pulsatilla vulgaris|Pasqueflower]].

The [[Cambridgeshire Regiment]] (or [[Cambridgeshire Regiment|Fen Tigers]]), the county-based army unit, fought in the [[Boer War]] of South Africa, the First World War and Second World War.

Due to the county's flat terrain and proximity to the continent, during the Second World War the military built many airfields here for [[RAF Bomber Command]], [[RAF Fighter Command]], and the allied [[USAAF]].  In recognition of this collaboration, the [[Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial]] is located in [[Madingley]]. It is the only WWII burial ground in England for American servicemen who died during that event.  

Most English counties have nicknames for their people, such as a "[[Tyke (dialect)|Tyke]]" from [[Yorkshire]] and a "[[Yellowbelly (Lincolnshire)|Yellowbelly]]" from [[Lincolnshire]]. The traditional [[nickname]]s for people from Cambridgeshire are "Cambridgeshire Camel" or "Cambridgeshire Crane", referring to the wildfowl that were once abundant in the [[fens]]. The term "Fenners" was often applied to those who come from the flat country to the north of Cambridge. Since the late 20th century, this term is considered to be derogatory and has been discouraged in use. 

Original historical documents relating to Cambridgeshire are held by [[Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies]].

==Geography==
: ''See also [[Geology of Cambridgeshire]]''
Large areas of the county are extremely low-lying and [[Holme, Cambridgeshire|Holme Fen]] is notable for being the UK's lowest physical point at 2.75&nbsp;m (9&nbsp;ft) below sea level. The highest point is in the village of [[Great Chishill]] at 146&nbsp;m (480&nbsp;ft) above sea level. Other [[topographic prominence|prominent]] hills are [[Little Trees Hill]] and [[Wandlebury Hill]] in the [[Gog Magog Downs]], [[Rivey Hill]] above [[Linton, Cambridgeshire|Linton]], [[Rowley's Hill]] and the [[Madingley Hills]].

==Climate==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
Cambridgeshire has a maritime temperate climate which is broadly similar to the rest of the United Kingdom, though it is drier than the UK average due to its low altitude and easterly location, the prevailing southwesterly winds having already deposited moisture on higher ground further west. Average winter temperatures are cooler than the English average, due to Cambridgeshire's inland location and relative nearness to continental Europe, which results in the moderating maritime influence being less strong. Snowfall is slightly more common than in western areas, due to the relative winter coolness and easterly winds bringing occasional snow from the North Sea. In summer temperatures are average or slightly above, due to less cloud cover. It reaches 25°C on around 10 days each year, and is comparable to parts of Kent and East Anglia.

==Culture==

===Sports===
Association Football was invented in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire on what is now known as Parker's Piece in the middle of town.{{fact|date=August 2014}}  This is the earliest version of Association Football that has ever existed and the rules still exist today.  Folklore dictates that there are 11 men on each team because when the game was invented, there were eleven trees on either side of Parker's Piece.{{fact|date=August 2014}} In commemoration of the creation of Football; a statue is to be raised in the middle of the park where the game was invented.  Despite this however, the "home" of football is said to be Wembley, London for two reasons.  1) It is in the capital city of England and 2) It is where England's national team play.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

Cambridgeshire is the birthplace of [[bandy]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} now an IOC accepted sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbandy.com/template1.asp?pageID=18 |title=Federation of International Bandy-Olympic |publisher=Internationalbandy.com |date=12 August 2004 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> According to documents from 1813 [[Bury Fen Bandy Club]] was undefeated for 100 years.
