Additionally all Quarter Horses born 2007 or later that are confirmed to be descendants of Impressive must carry a note about the risks of HYPP on their registration papers. Due to HYPP, the halter classes are undergoing significant changes.<space/><link><target>Halter (horse show)</target><part>Halter</part></link><space/>classes are dominated by the<space/><link><target>Impressive (horse)</target><part>Impressive</part></link><space/>bloodline. Impressive, a very prolific halter horse, brought to the stock breeds the muscle mass that is popular in halter competition today. This muscle mass is linked to HYPP, and as the condition is reduced within the breed, the style of horse in halter classes is also likely to change. Already there have been rule changes, including the creation of a &quot;Performance Halter class&quot; in which a horse must possess a Register of Merit in performance or racing before it can compete.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://services2.aqha.com/iphonedev/www/sections/sectionIV/rules/448.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">AQHA Handbook, Section 448 Halter Classes, (j) Performance Halter<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">30 September 2012<space/></arg></template></extension></listitem><listitem><link><target>Malignant hyperthermia</target></link>.

This is caused by an<space/><link><target>autosome</target><part>autosomal</part></link><space/><link><target>recessive gene</target></link>, and thus, unlike HYPP, HERDA can only be transmitted if both parents carry the gene. When a horse has this disease, there is a collagen defect that results in the layers of skin not being held firmly together. Thus, when the horse is ridden under saddle or suffers trauma to the skin, the outer layer often splits or separates from the deeper layer, or it can tear off completely. It rarely heals without disfiguring scars. Sunburn can also be a concern. In dramatic cases, the skin can split along the back and even roll down the sides, with the horse literally being skinned alive. Most horses with HERDA are euthanized for humane reasons between the age of two and four years. The very hotly debated and controversial theory, put forth by researchers at<space/><link><target>Cornell University</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Mississippi State University</target></link><space/>is that the sire line of the great foundation stallion<space/><link><target>Poco Bueno</target></link><space/>is implicated as the origin of the disease. As of May 9, 2007, Researchers working independently at Cornell University and at the<space/><link><target>University of California, Davis</target></link><space/>announced that a DNA test for HERDA has been developed.
