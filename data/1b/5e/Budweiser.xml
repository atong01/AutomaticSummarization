He settled in St. Louis, Missouri, where he eventually established his own brewing supply house. In St. Louis, Busch also met and married Lilly Anheuser. Lillys father, Eberhard Anheuser, owned a small brewery that had been making lager beer for some time. In 1864, Busch partnered with his father in-law to form what would eventually become the Anheuser-Busch Company.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/86051/Adolphus-Busch</arg><arg name="title">Adolphus Busch</arg><arg name="publisher">[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]</arg><arg name="accessdate">August 27, 2011</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Busch traveled extensively in Europe to observe and study the latest brewing techniques.

In the mid-1800s, most Americans preferred robust, dark ales. Busch had encountered lighter lager beers during his travels and began brewing a light Bohemian lager.

As alcohol became illegal to sell and produce, all alcohol companies, including Budweiser, struggled to remain profitable. Budweiser began producing non-alcoholic beverages during Prohibition to counter its ill effects. Prohibition began in 1920, and lasted into the middle of the<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link><space/>in 1933. These are two major setbacks that this company experienced. Just as laws regarding prohibition were repealed, Budweiser was faced with more serious economic struggles, which made their success (like all other companies) very unlikely. In attempt to re-stimulate interest in their beer, Budweiser executed a hugely successful marketing strategy of introducing beer cans for the first time in 1936. This new packaging led to an increase in sales which lasted until the start of<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link><space/>in 1939.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120106110755/http://www.anheuser-busch.com/s/index.php/our-heritage/history/</arg><arg name="title">Official website: Our History</arg><arg name="accessdate">February 20, 2012</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Over the years, Budweiser has undergone various design changes to its can which are discussed in the table below.

They were red, white, and blue in color, and had images of eagles near the label. These cans also had a very classic appearance due to the cursive font and the Anheuser-Busch logo surrounded by wheat and barley. Red, white, and blue, being the colors of the<space/><link><target>Flag of the United States</target><part>American flag</part></link>, identified the cans strongly with the American market for this product. Moreover, the eagles remind viewers of the<space/><link><target>bald eagle</target></link>, America's national bird. These facts strongly suggest that Budweiser was targeting a primarily American market. In contrast to this previous design, the newest can takes on a much more modern appearance and eliminates blue as a main color in the design. Red, white, and gold are the predominant colors on this new can, which makes the can look much less traditionally American, and much more modern. On this new can, there are aspects that continue to resonate with an American market, such as the red and white colors, as these are two of the nation's primary colors. The presence of the yellowish-gold color is not typically American, though, and is surprising to see in the can design of the self-proclaimed &quot;Great American Lager.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>This change in can design was very shocking for a brand that had remained relatively static since its beginning. The new design was largely in response to the huge sales decline in recent years that is threatening to lose Budweiser its title as the best-selling beer in America.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://adage.com/article/news/budweiser-cans-a/229076/</arg><arg name="title">Budweiser Cans Get a New Look—the Bow Tie</arg><arg name="accessdate">March 2, 2012</arg></template></extension><space/>One cause of this sales decline is the unemployment struggles that many Americans have been facing recently. A large group of individuals affected by unemployment are young men, who are the main demographic of Budweiser's<space/><link><target>target market</target></link>. In order to regain the domestic market share that Budweiser has lost, the company is trying to update its appearance by giving the can a more contemporary look that is more appealing to this demographic.

Currently, of the 15 Anheuser-Busch breweries outside of the United States, 14 of them are positioned in China, which shows how interested the company is in this growing market. Budweiser is already the fourth leading brand in the Chinese beer market, and the company hopes that this new design change will push them further up the list as one of China's most dominant brands.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://blog.btrax.com/en/2010/07/24/an-average-us-brand-in-the-china-market-the-budweiser-story/</arg><arg name="title">An Average US Brand in the China Market – The Budweiser Story</arg><arg name="accessdate">February 20, 2012</arg></template></extension><space/>Budweiser's attempt to target China is not sudden, though. There have actually been several advertising campaigns geared toward Chinese consumers. One such campaign was in 2009 when Budweiser sponsored a competition for the creation of a Budweiser commercial involving the Budweiser ants.

The maturation tanks that Anheuser-Busch uses are horizontal and, as such,<space/><link><target>flocculation</target></link><space/>of the yeast occurs much more quickly. Anheuser-Busch refers to this process as a secondary fermentation, with the idea being that the chips give the yeast more surface area to rest on. This is also combined with a<space/><link><target>Brewing#Conditioning</target><part>krausening</part></link><space/>procedure that re-introduces wort into the chip tank, therefore reactivating the fermentation process. By placing the beechwood chips at the bottom of the tank, the yeast remains in suspension longer, giving it more time to reabsorb and process green beer flavors, such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl, that Anheuser-Busch believes are off-flavors which detract from overall drinkability.<template><target>clarify</target><arg name="date">December 2012</arg></template><link><target>Image:Budweiser beverage delivery truck Romulus Michigan.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>Budweiser beverage delivery truck,<space/><link><target>Romulus, Michigan</target></link></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Some drinkers prefer the lightness of beers like Budweiser and consume it as a refreshment or for its inebriating effects.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090109193130/http://beer.themanroom.com/beer-memberrating.php?&id</arg><arg name="publisher">themanroom.com<space/></arg><arg name="title">Member's forum Rating</arg></template></extension><space/>Several beer writers consider it to be bland.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000776.html'>Hops to lighten your step</link><space/>beerhunter.com</extension><extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.realbeer.com/news/articles/news-001477.php'>A Bud by any other name</link><space/>realbeer.com</extension><space/>The beer is light-bodied with faint sweet notes and negligible bitterness, leading to reviews characterizing it as a &quot;...beer of underwhelming blandness.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="page">84<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Beer Bible<space/></arg><arg name="last">Simpson<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Willie<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">John Fairfax Publications<space/></arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>978-1-921190-86-5<space/></arg><arg name="year">2007<space/></arg><arg name="location">Sydney</arg></template></extension><space/>Even Adolphus Busch disliked the very beer he marketed in the United States.<extension extension_name='ref'>Edward McClelland,<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.salon.com/life/food/eat_drink/2008/07/17/budweiser'>&quot;The rise and fall of an American beer&quot;</link><space/><link><target>Salon (magazine)</target></link><space/>July 17, 2008</extension><space/>But based upon sales alone, it became the second most popular American brewed<space/><link><target>pale lager</target></link><space/>among North American beer consumers.</paragraph><paragraph>Budweiser and<space/><italics>Bud Light</italics><space/>are sometimes advertised as<space/><link><target>vegan</target></link><space/>beers, in that their ingredients and conditioning do not use animal by-products.
