==Description==
[[File:Coyote life study - Seton Thompson (1886).png|thumb|Life study by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] (1886).]]

Coyote males average {{convert|8|-|20|kg|abbr=on}} in weight, while females average {{convert|7|-|18|kg|abbr=on}}, though size varies geographically. Northern subspecies, which average {{convert|18|kg|abbr=on}}, tend to grow larger than the southern subspecies of Mexico, which average {{convert|11.5|kg|abbr=on}}. Body length ranges on average from {{convert|1|to|1.35|m|2}}, and tail length {{convert|40|cm}}, with females being shorter in both body length and height.<ref name="bekoff1977"/> The largest coyote on record was a male killed near [[Afton, Wyoming]] on November 19, 1937 which measured {{convert|1.6|m}} from nose to tail, and weighed {{convert|33.9|kg}}.<ref name="young48">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|p=48}}</ref>  Scent glands are located at the upper side of the base of the tail and are a bluish black color.<ref name="young63"/>

The color and texture of the coyote's fur varies somewhat geographically.<ref name="bekoff1977"/> The hair's predominant color is light gray and red or [[fulvous]], interspersed around the body with black and white. Coyotes living on high elevations tend to have more black and gray shades than their desert-dwelling counterparts, which are more fulvous or whitish-gray.<ref name="young50">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|pp=50–53}}</ref> The coyote's fur consists of short, soft underfur and long, coarse guard hairs. The fur of northern subspecies is longer and denser than in southern forms, with the fur of some Mexican and Central American forms being almost hispid (bristly).<ref name="young247">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|p=247}}</ref> [[Albinism]] is extremely rare in coyotes; out of a total of 750,000 coyotes harvested by Federal and cooperative hunters between March 22, 1938 to June 30, 1945, only two were albinos.<ref name="young50"/>

The coyote is typically smaller than the [[gray wolf]], but has longer ears and a larger [[braincase]],<ref name="bekoff1977">{{cite journal|author=Bekoff M. |year=1977|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-079-01-0001.pdf |title=''Canis latrans''|journal=Mammalian Species|volume= 79|issue=79|pages=1–9|doi=10.2307/3503817|jstor=3503817}}</ref> as well as a thinner frame, face and muzzle.

==History==
By the time of the [[European colonization of the Americas]], coyotes were largely confined to open plains and arid regions of the western half of the continent.<ref name="nowak14">{{Harvnb|Nowak|1979|p=14}}</ref> It is often difficult in early post-Columbian historical records to distinguish between coyotes and wolves. One record from 1750 in [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] written by a local priest noted that the "wolves" encountered there were smaller and less daring than European wolves. Another account from the early 1800s in [[Edwards County, Illinois|Edwards County]] mentioned wolves howling at night, though these were likely coyotes.<ref name="hoffmeister">Hoffmeister, Donald F. (2002) ''Mammals of Illinois'', University of Illinois Press, pp. 33–34, ISBN 0252070836</ref> The species was encountered several times during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804–1806), though it was already well known to European traders on the upper [[Missouri River|Missouri]]. [[Meriwether Lewis|Lewis]], writing on May 5, 1805, in northeastern [[Montana]], described the coyote as follows:<ref name="mussulman2004"/>
[[File:Toltec coyote.jpg|thumb|right|[[Toltec]] pictograph of coyote.]]

<blockquote>the small woolf (''sic'') or burrowing dog of the prairies are the inhabitants almost invariably of the open plains; they usually ascociate (''sic'') in bands of ten or twelve sometimes more and burrow near some pass or place much frequented by game; not being able alone to take deer or goat they are rarely ever found alone but hunt in bands; they frequently watch and seize their prey near their burrows; in these burrows they raise their young and to them they also resort when pursued; when a person approaches them they frequently bark, their note being precisely that of the small dog. they are of an intermediate size between that of the fox and dog, very active fleet and delicately formed; the ears large erect and pointed the head long and pointed more like that of the fox; tale (''sic'') long; . . . the hair and fur also resembles the fox tho' is much coarser and inferior. they are of a pale redish (''sic'') brown colour. the eye of a deep sea green colour small and piercing. their tallons [claws] are reather (''sic'') longer than those of the ordinary wolf or that common to the atlantic states, none of which are to be found in this quarter, nor I believe above the river Plat.</blockquote>

The coyote was first scientifically described by [[Thomas Say]] in September 1819 on the site of Lewis and Clark's Council Bluffs, fifteen miles up the Missouri River from the mouth of the Platte during a [[Stephen Harriman Long#1819-20 expeditions up the Missouri and Platte Rivers|government-sponsored expedition]] with Major [[Stephen Harriman Long|Stephen Long]]. He had the first edition of the Lewis and Clark journals in hand, which contained Biddle's edited version of Lewis's observations dated May 5, 1805.<ref name="say1823">Say, T., 1823. in ''[http://archive.org/stream/accountofexpedit01jame#page/168/mode/2up/search/canis+latrans Account of an expedition from Pittsburgh to the Rocky Mountains: performed in the years 1819 and ’20, by order of the Hon.

==Naming and etymology==
The earliest written reference to the species comes from [[Francisco Hernández de Toledo|Francisco Hernández's]] ''Plantas y Animales de la Nueva España'' (1651), where it is described as a "Spanish fox" or "jackal". The first published usage of the word "coyote" (the [[root word]] of which is the [[Nahuatl]] ''coyotl'' meaning "barking dog") comes from [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]]'s ''Historia de México'' in 1780.<ref name="clavijero1817">Clavijero, Francisco Javier (1817) ''[https://archive.org/stream/historyofmexicoc11817clav#page/56/mode/2up The history of Mexico]'', Volume 1, Thomas Dobson, p. 57</ref> The first time it was used in [[English language|English]] occurred in [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]]'s ''Six months' residence and travels in Mexico'' (1824), where it is variously transcribed as ''cayjotte'' and ''cocyotie''. The word's spelling was standardized as "coyote" by the 1880s.<ref name="mussulman2004">{{cite web |url=http://lewis-clark.org/content/content-article.asp?ArticleID=2177 |title=Coyote |last1=Mussulman |first1=Joseph |date=November 2004 |publisher=Discovering Lewis & Clark |accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>Bullock, W.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
[[File:Canis latrans orcutti.png|thumb|Skeleton of [[Pleistocene coyote]] (''C. l. orcutti'').]]
The earliest [[fossil]] [[carnivore]]s that can be linked with some certainty to [[canid]]s are the [[Eocene]] [[Miacids]], which lived some 38 to 56 million years ago. The Miacids later diverged into [[Caniformia|caniform]]s and [[Feliformia|feliform]]s, with the former line leading to such genera as the coyote-sized ''[[Mesocyon]]'' of the [[Oligocene]] (38 to 24 million years ago), the [[fox]]-like ''[[Leptocyon]]'' and the wolf-like ''[[Tomarctus]]'' which inhabited [[North America]] some 10 million years ago.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brewer | first = Douglas J. | last2 = Terence | first2 = Sir Clark | last3 = Phillips | first3 = Adrian | title = DOGS IN ANTIQUITY Anubis to Cerberus: The Origins of the Domestic Dog | url =http://web.archive.org/web/20060517155234/http://www.arisandphillips.com/ap/Anubis.html | date = March 2002 | publisher = Aris & Phillips | isbn = 978-0-85668-704-4}}</ref> The coyote represents a more primitive form of ''Canis'' than the [[gray wolf]], as shown by its relatively small size and its comparatively narrow skull and jaws, which lack the grasping power necessary to hold the large prey wolves specialize in. This is further corroborated by the coyote's [[sagittal crest]], which is low or totally flattened, thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf's. The coyote is not a specialized carnivore as the wolf is, as shown by the larger chewing surfaces on the [[molar (tooth)|molars]], reflecting the species' relative dependence on vegetable matter. In these respects, the coyote resembles the fox-like progenitors of the genus more so than the wolf.<ref name="nowak1978"/> Modern [[phylogenetics]] places the coyote between the gray wolf and [[golden jackal]].<ref name="lindblad-toh2005"/>

The evolution of the coyote is remarkably well documented, and can be traced back in an unbroken line to the [[Hemphillian]] ''[[Eucyon|Eucyon davisi]]''.<ref name="kurten1980">[[Björn Kurtén|Kurtén, Björn]] (1980). ''Pleistocene Mammals of North America''. pp. 167–9. Columbia University Press.

Modern coyotes arose during the [[Middle Pleistocene]], and showed much more variation than they do today.<ref name="nowak1978"/> Compared to their modern Holocene counterparts, [[Pleistocene coyote]]s (''C. l. orcutti'') were larger and more robust, likely in response to larger competitors and prey.<ref name="meachen2012">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1113788109|pmid=22371581| title = Evolution in coyotes (''Canis latrans'') in response to the megafaunal extinctions| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 109| issue = 11| pages = 4191| year = 2012| last1 = Meachen | first1 = J.

===Subspecies===
[[File:Coyote subspecies distribution map.svg|thumb|Range of coyote subspecies (as of 1978)]]
{{As of|2005|uc=on}},<ref name="msw3"/> 19 subspecies are recognized. Geographic variation in coyotes is not great, though taken as a whole, the eastern subspecies (''thamnos'' and ''frustor'') are large, dark colored animals, with a gradual paling in color and reduction in size westward and northward (''texensis'', ''latrans'', ''lestes'' and ''incolatus''), a brightening of ochraceous tones towards the Pacific coast (''ochropus'', ''umpquensis''), a reduction in size in the southwestern United States (''microdon'', ''mearnsi'') and a general trend towards dark reddish colors and short muzzles in Mexican and Central American populations.<ref name="young249">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|p=249}}</ref>

===Hybridization===
Coyotes have occasionally mated with [[dog]]s, sometimes producing [[Coydog|crosses]] capable of work.<ref name="young121">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|pp=121–24}}</ref> Such matings are rare in the wild, as the mating cycles of dogs and coyotes do not coincide, and coyotes are usually antagonistic towards dogs, with even captive specimens having shown reluctance to mate with them. Hybridization usually only occurs when coyotes are expanding into areas where conspecifics are few, and dogs are the only alternatives. Even then, pup survival rates are lower than normal, as dogs do not form pair bonds with coyotes, thus making the rearing of pups more difficult.<ref name="cartaino61">{{Harvnb|Cartaino|2011|pp=61–3}}</ref> In captivity, [[F1 hybrid|F<sub>1</sub> hybrid]]s tend to be more mischievous and less manageable as pups than dogs, and are less trustworthy on maturity than [[Wolfdog|wolf-dog hybrid]]s.<ref name="young121"/> Hybrids vary in appearance, but generally retain the coyote's adult sable coat color, dark neonatal coat color, bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland, and white facial mask.

[[File:Westerncoywolf.png|thumb|[[Coywolf]] hybrid conceived in captivity between a male gray wolf and a female coyote.]]

Coyotes have hybridized with wolves to varying degrees, particularly in the [[Eastern United States]] and [[Eastern Canada|Canada]]. The so-called "[[Canis latrans "var."|eastern coyote]]" of northeastern North America has been confirmed to be of mixed wolf-coyote parentage, and probably originated in the aftermath of the extermination of wolves in the northeast, thus allowing coyotes to colonize former wolf ranges and mix with remnant wolf populations. This hybrid is smaller than the wolf, and holds smaller territories, but is in turn larger and holds more extensive home ranges than the typical western coyote. As of 2010, the eastern coyote's genetic makeup is fairly uniform, with minimal influence from eastern wolves or western coyotes.<ref name="way2010">{{cite journal|doi=10.1656/045.017.0202|jstor=40664873|author1=Way, J.G.|author2= Rutledge, L. |author3=Wheeldon, T. |author4=B.N.

By the age of 35 days, eastern coyote pups average 1590 grams, 200 grams more than western coyotes of similar age. By this time, physical differences become more apparent, with eastern coyote pups having longer legs than their western counterparts. Differences in dental development also occur, with [[tooth eruption]] being later, and in a different order in the eastern coyote.<ref name="bekoff1978"/> Aside from its size, the eastern coyote is physically not unlike the western coyote; both have erect ears, a straight and bushy tail, a conspicuous [[supracaudal gland]] and a narrow chest. There are four color phases, ranging from dark brown to blond or reddish blond, though the most common phase is gray-brown, with reddish legs, ears and flanks.<ref name="hilton1978">Hilton, Henry.

The wolf-coyote admixture resulting in the development of the eastern wolf may have occurred on the order of 600–900 years ago between gray wolves and a now extinct [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] coyote population. The eastern wolf has since [[Backcrossing|backcrossed]] extensively with parent gray wolf populations. The red wolf may have originated later, approximately 287–430 years ago, when much of the southeastern U.S. was being converted to agriculture and predators were targeted for extermination. During this period, declining local wolf populations would have been forced to mate with coyotes, with the resulting hybrids backcrossing to coyotes as the wolves disappeared, to the extent that ~75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.<ref name="genome">{{Cite journal

===Social and reproductive behaviors===
[[File:Gpa bill coyote pups 3.jpg|thumb|Mearns' coyote (''C. l. mearnsi'') pups playing.]]
[[File:Pack of coyotes on snow.jpg|thumb|A pack of coyotes]]
Like the [[golden jackal]], the coyote is gregarious, but not as dependent on [[Biological specificity|conspecifics]] as more social canid species like wolves are. This is likely linked to the fact that the coyote is not a specialized hunter of large prey as the latter species is.<ref name="fox1974">Fox, M. W., ed. (1974) "Evolution of Social Behavior in Canids", pp. 429–60 in M. W. Fox (ed.) ''The Wild Canids: Their Systematics, Behavioral Ecology, and Evolution''. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. ISBN 0442224303</ref> The basic social unit of a coyote pack is a [[nuclear family]] centered on a reproductive female. However, unrelated coyotes may join forces for companionship, or to bring down prey too large to attack singly. Such "non-family" packs are only temporary, and may consist of bachelor males, non-reproductive females and sub-adult young. Families are formed in midwinter, when females enter [[estrus]].<ref name="gier1974"/> Pair bonding can occur 2–3 months before actual [[copulation]] takes place.<ref>Bekoff, Marc, and Judy Diamond. "Precopulatory and copulatory behavior in coyotes." Journal of Mammalogy (1976): 372-375.</ref> A female entering estrus attracts males by scent marking and howling with increasing frequency.<ref name="bekoff2003">Bekoff, M. and Gese, E. M. (2003).

Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland.</ref> A single female in heat can attract up to seven reproductive males, which can follow her for as much as a month.

The newly mated pair then establish a territory and either construct their own den or clean out abandoned badger, marmot or skunk earths. During the pregnancy, the male frequently hunts alone and brings back food for the female. The female may line the den with dried grass or with fur pulled from her belly.<ref name="gier1974"/> The [[gestation period]] lasts 63 days, with an average litter size of six, though the number fluctuates depending on coyote population density and the abundance of food.<ref name="bekoff2003"/>

Coyote pups are born in dens, hollow trees, or under ledges, and weigh 200-50 grams at birth. They are [[altricial]], and are completely dependent on [[milk]] for their first 10 days. The [[incisor]]s erupt at about 12 days, the [[canine teeth|canine]]s at 16, and the second [[premolar]]s at 21. Their eyes open after 10 days, by which point the pups become increasingly more mobile, walking by 20 days, and running at the age of six weeks. The parents begin supplementing the pup's diet with regurgitated solid food after 12–15 days. By the age of 4–6 weeks, when their [[milk teeth]] are fully functional, the pups are given small food items like mice, rabbits or pieces of ungulate carcasses, with [[lactation]] steadily decreasing after two months.<ref name="gier1974"/> Unlike wolf pups, coyote pups begin seriously fighting prior to engaging in play behavior. By 3 weeks of age, coyote pups bite each other with less inhibition than wolf pups. By the age of 4–5 weeks, pups have established dominance hierarchies, and are by then more likely to play rather than fight.<ref name="fox33">{{Harvnb|Fox|1978|p=33}}</ref> The male plays an active role in feeding, grooming and guarding the pups, but will abandon them if the female goes missing before the pups are completely [[Weaning|weaned]]. The den is abandoned by June–July, and the pups follow their parents in patrolling their territory and hunting. Pups may leave their families in August, though can remain for much longer. The pups attain adult dimensions at eight months, and gain adult weight a month later.<ref name="gier1974"/>{{clear}}

===Territorial and sheltering behaviors===
Individual feeding territories vary in size from {{convert|0.38|to|62|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, with the general concentration of coyotes in a given area depending on food abundance, adequate denning sites, and competition with conspecifics and other predators. The coyote generally does not defend its territory outside of the denning season,<ref name="gier1974"/> and is much less aggressive towards intruders than the wolf is, typically chasing and sparring with them, but rarely killing them.<ref>Mlot, Chris. [http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc98/1_31_98/bob1.htm The Coyotes of Lamar Valley: In Yellowstone, the master adapter learns to deal with wolves]. [[Science News|Science News Online]]. (January 31, 1998).</ref> Conflicts between coyotes can arise during times of food shortage.<ref name="gier1974"/>

Like wolves, coyotes use a den (usually the deserted holes of other species) when gestating and rearing young, though they may occasionally give birth under sagebrushes in the open. Coyote dens can be located in [[canyon]]s, [[washout]]s, [[coulee]]s, [[Bank (geography)|bank]]s, rock bluffs, or level ground. Some dens have been found under abandoned homestead shacks, grain bins, drainage pipes, railroad tracks, hollow logs, thickets and thistles. The den is continuously dug and cleaned out by the female until the pups are born. Should the den be disturbed or infested with fleas, the pups are moved into another den. A coyote den can have several entrances and passages branching out from the main chamber. <ref name="young82">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|pp=82–90}}</ref> A single den can be used year after year.<ref name="bekoff2003"/>

===Hunting and feeding behaviors===
While the popular consensus is that olfaction is very important for hunting,<ref>Asa C. S., Mech D. (1995). “A review of the sensory organs in wolves and their importance to life history,” in Ecology and Conservation of Wolves in a Changing World eds. Carbyn L. D., Fritts S. H., Seip D. R., editors. (Edmonton: Canadian Circumpolar Institute; ) 287–291</ref> two studies that experimentally investigated the role of olfactory, auditory, and visual cues found that visual cues are the most important ones for hunting in red foxes<ref>osterholm H. (1964). The significance of distance reception in the feeding behaviour of fox (Vulpes vulpes L.). Acta Zool. Fenn. 106 1–31</ref> and coyotes.<ref>Wells M. C. (1978). Coyote senses in predation – environmental influences on their relative use. Behav. Processes 3 149–158 10.1016/0376-6357(78)90041-4</ref><ref>Wells M. C., Lehner P. N. (1978). Relative importance of distance senses in Coyote predatory behavior. Anim. Behav. 26 251–258 10.1016/0003-3472(78)90025-8</ref>

When hunting large prey, the coyote often works in pairs or in small groups.<ref name="bekoff1977"/> Success in killing large ungulates depends on factors such as snow depth and crust density. Younger animals usually avoid participating in such hunts, with the breeding pair typically doing most of the work.<ref name="bekoff2003"/> Unlike the wolf, which attacks large prey from the rear, the coyote approaches from the front, lacerating its prey's head and throat. Like other canids, the coyote [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|cache]]s excess food.<ref name="young91">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|pp=91–92}}</ref> Coyotes catch [[mouse]]-like rodents by pouncing, whereas [[ground squirrel]]s are chased. Although coyotes can live in large groups, small prey is typically caught singly.<ref name="bekoff2003"/> Coyotes have been observed to kill [[North American porcupine|porcupine]]s in pairs, using their paws to flip the rodents on their backs, then attacking the soft underbelly. Only old and experienced coyotes can successfully prey on porcupines, with many predation attempts by young coyotes resulting in them being injured by their prey's quills.<ref name="young97">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|p=97}}</ref> Coyotes sometimes [[urination|urinate]] on their food, possibly to claim ownership over it.<ref name="young98">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|p=98}}</ref>

Coyotes may occasionally form [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationships with [[American badger]]s, assisting each other in digging up rodent prey. The relationship between the two species may occasionally border on apparent friendship, as some coyotes have been observed laying their heads on their badger companions or licking their faces without protest. The amicable interactions between coyotes and badgers were known to pre-Columbian civilizations, as shown on a Mexican jar dated to 1250–1300 AD depicting the relationship between the two.<ref name="young93"/>

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
Prior to the near extermination of wolves and cougars, the coyote was most numerous in [[grassland]]s inhabited by [[American bison|bison]], [[Pronghorn|antelope]], [[elk]] and other [[deer]], doing particularly well in short grass areas with [[prairie dog]]s, though it was just as much at home in semiarid areas with [[sagebrush]] and [[jackrabbit]]s or in [[desert]]s inhabited by [[cactus]], [[kangaroo rat]]s and [[rattlesnake]]s. As long as it was not in direct competition with the wolf, the coyote ranged from the [[Sonoran Desert]] to the alpine regions of adjoining mountains or the plains and mountainous areas of [[Alberta]]. With the extermination of the wolf, the coyote's range expanded to encompass broken forests from the tropics of [[Guatemala]] and the northern slope of [[Alaska]].<ref name="gier1974"/>

===Diet===
The coyote is highly versatile in its choice of food, but is primarily carnivorous, with 90% of its diet consisting of animal matter. Prey species include [[American bison|bison]], [[deer]], [[sheep]], [[rabbit]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s (except [[toad]]s), [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s, and [[insect]]s. Coyotes may be picky over the prey they target, as animals such as [[shrew]]s, [[mole (animal)|moles]] and [[brown rat]]s do not occur in their diet in proportion to their numbers.<ref name="gier1974"/> More unusual prey include [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]]s,<ref>Brundige, G.C.

Although coyotes prefer fresh meat, they will scavenge when the opportunity presents itself. It has been estimated that, excluding the insects, fruit and grass eaten, the coyote requires 600 g of food daily, or 250&nbsp;kg annually.<ref name="gier1974"/> The coyote readily [[cannibalism|cannibalizes]] the carcasses of [[conspecifics]], with coyote fat having been successfully used by coyote hunters as a lure or poisoned bait.<ref name="young63">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|pp=63–4}}</ref> The coyote's winter diet consists mainly of large ungulate carcasses, with very little vegetable matter. Rodent prey increases in importance during the spring, summer, and fall.<ref name="bekoff1977"/>

The coyote feeds on a variety of different [[fruit]]s, including [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], [[peach]]es, [[pear]]s, [[apple]]s, [[Opuntia|prickly pears]], [[chapote]]s, [[persimmon]]s, and [[peanut]]s. Other vegetable foods include [[watermelon]], [[cantaloupe]] and [[carrot]]s. During the winter and early spring, the coyote eats large quantities of grass, such as green [[wheat]] blades. It sometimes eats unusual items like cotton cake, [[soybean]] meal, domestic animal droppings, and cultivated [[grain]] such as [[corn]], wheat, [[sorghum]], and [[bean]]s.<ref name="gier1974"/>

In areas where the ranges of coyotes and [[gray wolf|gray wolves]] overlap, interference competition and predation by wolves has been hypothesized to limit local coyote densities. Coyote ranges expanded during the 19th and 20th centuries following the extirpation of wolves, while coyotes were driven to extinction on Isle Royale after wolves colonized the island in the 1940s. One study conducted in Yellowstone National Park, where both species coexist, concluded that the coyote population in the Lamar River Valley declined by 39% following the reintroduction of wolves in the 1990s, while coyote populations in wolf inhabited areas of the [[Grand Teton National Park]] are 33% lower than in areas where they are absent.<ref name="berger2007">{{cite journal|author1=Berger, K.

Coyotes may compete with [[cougar]]s in some areas. In eastern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], coyotes compete with cougars over [[mule deer]]. Cougars usually outcompete coyotes, and may kill them occasionally, thus reducing coyote predation pressure on smaller carnivores like foxes and bobcats.<ref name=hornocker2009>Hornocker, M. et al.

==Communication==

===Body language===
Being both a gregarious and solitary animal, the variability of the coyote's visual and vocal repertoire is intermediate between that of the solitary foxes and the highly social wolf.<ref name="fox1974"/> The aggressive behavior of the coyote bears more similarities to that of foxes than it does that of wolves and dogs. An aggressive coyote arches its back and lowers its tail.<ref name="silver1969">{{cite journal|author1=Silver, H.|author2= Silver, W. T. |jstor=3830473|title=Growth and Behavior of the Coyote-like Canid of Northern New England and Observations on Canid Hybrids|year= 1969|journal=The Wildlife Society, Wildlife Monographs|volume= 17|pages= 24–25}}</ref> Unlike dogs, which solicit playful behavior by performing a "play-bow" followed by a "play-leap", play in coyotes consists of a bow, followed by side-to-side head flexions and a series of "spins" and "dives". Although coyotes will sometimes bite their playmates' scruff as dogs do, they typically approach low, and make upward directed bites.<ref name="fox134">{{Harvnb|Fox|1978|pp=134–135}}</ref> Pups will fight each other regardless of sex, while among adults aggression is typically reserved for members of the same sex. Combatants approach each other waving their tails and snarling with their jaws open, though fights are typically silent. Males tend to fight in a vertical stance, while females fight on all four paws. Fights among females tend to be more serious than ones among males, as females seize their opponents' forelegs, throat and shoulders.<ref name="silver1969"/>

===Vocalizations===
The coyote has been described as "the most vocal of North American wild mammals...", whose vocal proclivity lead to its being given the binomial name ''Canis latrans'', meaning "barking dog". At least 11 different vocalizations are known in adult coyotes. These sounds are divided into three categories: 1) Agonistic and alarm, 2) Greeting, and 3) Contact. Vocalizations of the first category include woofs, growls, huffs, barks, bark howls, yelps and high frequency whines. Woofs are used as low intensity threats or alarms, and are usually heard near den sites, prompting the pups to immediately retreat into their burrows. Growls are used as threats in short distances, but have also been heard among pups playing and copulating males. Huffs are high intensity threat vocalizations produced via rapid expiration of air. Barks can be classed as both long distance threat vocalizations and as alarm calls. Bark howls may serve similar functions. Yelps are emitted as a sign of submission, while high frequency whines are produced by dominant animals acknowledging the submission of subordinates. Greeting vocalizations include low frequency whines, ''wow-oo-wows'' and group yip howls. Low frequency whines are emitted by submissive animals, and are usually accompanied by tail wagging and muzzle nibbling. The sound known as ''wow-oo-wow'' has been described as a "greeting song". The group yip howl is emitted when two or more pack members reunite, and may be the final act of a complex greeting ceremony. Contact calls include lone howls and group howls, as well as the previously mention group yip howls. The lone howl is the most iconic sound of the coyote, and may serve the purpose of announcing the presence of a lone individual separated from its pack. Group howls are used as both substitute group yip howls and as responses to either lone howls, group howls or group yip howls.<ref name="lehner1978"/>

==Range==
The coyote's pre-Columbian range was limited to the south-west and plains regions of the U.S. and Canada, and northern and central Mexico. By the 19th century, the species expanded north and west, expanding further after 1900, coinciding with land conversion and the extirpation of wolves. By this time, its range encompassed all of the U.S. and Mexico, southward into Central America, and northward into most of Canada and Alaska. This expansion is ongoing, and the species now occupies the majority of areas between 8°N (Panama) and 70°N (northern Alaska).<ref name="iucn"/>

===In Mexico and Central America===
Although it was once widely believed that coyotes are recent immigrants to southern Mexico and Central America, aided in their expansion by deforestation, [[Pleistocene]]-Early [[Holocene]] records, as well as records from the Pre-Columbian period and early European colonization show that the animal was present in the area long before modern times. Nevertheless, range expansion did occur south of [[Costa Rica]] during the late 1970s and northern [[Panama]] in the early 1980s, following the expansion of cattle grazing lands into tropical rainforests. It has been predicted that the coyote should appear in northern [[Belize]] in the near future, as the habitat there is favorable to the species.<ref name="mihart2004">{{cite journal|author=Hidalgo-Mihart, M.

==Diseases and parasites==
[[File:Mangy coyote Año Nuevo State Park.jpg|thumb|California Valley coyote (''C. l. ochropus'') suffering from [[sarcoptic mange]].]]
Among large North American carnivores, the coyote probably carries the largest number of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet.<ref name="young107">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|pp=107–114}}</ref> [[Viral diseases]] known to infect coyotes include [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], four strains of [[equine encephalitis (disambiguation)|equine encephalitis]], and [[Oral florid papillomatosis|oral papillomatosis]]. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. [[Tularemia]], a [[bacterial disease]], infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.<ref name="gier1978">Gier, H. T.; Kruckenberg, S. M.; Marler, R. J. (1978) "Parasites and diseases of coyotes", pp. 37–71 in M. Bekoff, (ed.) ''Coyotes: biology, behavior, and management''. Academic Press, New York. ISBN 1930665423.</ref>

Coyotes can be infected by both [[Demodicosis|demodectic]] and [[sarcoptic mange]], the latter being the most common. [[Mite]] infestations are rare and incidental in coyotes, while [[tick]] infestations are more common, with seasonal peaks depending on locality (May–August in the Northwest, March–November in Arkansas). Coyotes are only rarely infested with [[lice]], while [[flea]]s infest coyotes from puphood, though they may be more a source of irritation than serious illness.  ''[[Pulex|Pulex simulans]]'' is the most common species to infest coyotes, while ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]'' tends to occur only in areas where coyotes and dogs (its primary host) inhabit the same area. Although coyotes are rarely host to [[Trematoda|fluke]]s, they can nevertheless have serious effects on coyotes, particularly ''[[Nanophyetus salmincola]]'', which can infect them with [[salmon poisoning disease]], a fatal disease with a 90% mortality rate. [[Tapeworm]]s have been recorded to infest 60–95% of all coyotes examined. The most common species to infest coyotes is ''[[Taenia pisiformis]]'' and ''Taenia crassiceps'', which uses cottontail rabbits as intermediate hosts. The largest species known in coyotes is ''T. hydatigena'', which enters coyotes through infected ungulates, and can grow to lengths of 800–4000&nbsp;mm. Though once largely limited to wolves, ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'' has expanded to coyotes since the latter began colonizing former wolf ranges. The most frequent [[Ascarididae|ascaroid]] roundworm in coyotes is ''[[Toxascaris leonina]]'', which dwells in the coyote's short intestine and has no ill effects, save for causing the host to eat more frequently. [[Hookworm]]s of the genus ''[[Ancylostoma]]'' infest coyotes throughout their range, being particularly prevalent in humid areas. In areas of high moisture, such as coastal Texas, coyotes can carry up to 250 hookworms each. The blood-drinking ''[[Ancylostoma caninum|A. caninum]]'' is particularly dangerous, as it damages the coyote through blood-loss and lung congestion. A 10-day-old pup can die from being host to as few as 25 ''A. caninum''.<ref name="gier1978"/>

The coyote features prominently as a trickster figure in the folktales of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|America's indigenous people]]s, alternately assuming the form of an actual coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote acts as a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]] hero which rebels against social convention through deception and humor.<ref name="watts2006"/> The coyote was likely given its trickster role in light of the actual animal's intelligence and adaptability; pre-Columbian American people observed its behavior, and their folkloric representations reflected its attributes.<ref>Harris, M. (1979). ''Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture''. New York: Random House. pp. 200–1. ISBN 0759101353.</ref> It is variously credited for having [[Theft of fire|brought fire]] to humanity, releasing the bison into the world, and of having slain monsters by [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrifying]] them. The [[Maidu]] [[creation myth]] has the coyote introducing work, suffering and death to the world. [[Zuni people|Zuni]] folklore has the coyote bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the [[kachina]]s. Some [[Tribe (Native American)|tribe]]s, such as the [[Chinookan peoples|Chinook]], Maidu, [[Paiute]], [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], [[Tohono O'odham people|Tohono O'odham]], and [[Ute people|Ute]] portray the coyote as the companion of the [[Creator deity|creator]]. In the Paiute creation myth, the coyote was created by the wolf as a companion, and the two created land by piling dirt on the water-covered world. A Tohono O'odham [[flood myth]] has the coyote helping [[Montezuma (mythology)|Montezuma]] survive a global deluge that destroys humanity. After the [[Great Mystery]] creates humanity, the coyote and Montezuma teach people how to live. The [[Crow Nation|Crow]] creation myth portrays Old Man Coyote as the creator. In [[Diné Bahaneʼ|Navajo mythology]], the coyote was present in the First World with First Man and First Woman, though a different version has it being created in the Fourth World. The Navajo coyote brings death into the world, explaining that without death, there would be too many people, and thus no room to plant corn.<ref>Lynch, P. A. & Roberts, J. (2010).

Prior to the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the coyote played a significant role in [[Mesoamerica]]n [[cosmology]]. The coyote symbolized military might in pre-[[Aztec]] [[Teotihuacan]], with warriors dressing up in coyote costumes to call upon its predatory power. The species continued to be linked to Central Mexican warrior cults in the centuries leading up to Aztec rule.<ref name="schwartz1998">Schwartz, M. (1998).

===Attacks on humans===
{{Main|Coyote attacks on humans}}
[[File:No Feeding.jpg|thumb|A sign discouraging people from feeding coyotes, which can lead to them habituating themselves to human presence, thus increasing the likelihood of attack]]
Coyote attacks on humans are uncommon and rarely cause serious injuries, due to the relatively small size of the coyote, but have been increasingly frequent, especially in the state of [[California]].  In the 30 years leading up to March 2006, at least 160 attacks occurred in the United States, mostly in the [[Los Angeles County]] area.<ref name="smithsonian200603">{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/City-Slinkers.html?c=y&story=fullstory | title=City Slinkers |publisher=Smithsonian | date=March 2006 | accessdate=June 14, 2012 | author=Dell'Amore, Christine}}</ref> Data from USDA Wildlife Services, the California Department of Fish and Game, and other sources show that while 41 attacks occurred during the period of 1988–1997, 48 attacks were verified from 1998 through 2003. The majority of these incidents occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland interface.<ref name="AOH">{{cite web| title = Coyote Attacks: An Increasing Suburban Problem|url = http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/awm/docs/coyoteattacks.pdf|accessdate =August 19, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070926044522/http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/awm/docs/coyoteattacks.pdf |archivedate = September 26, 2007}}</ref>

In the absence of the harassment of coyotes practiced by rural people{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, urban coyotes are losing their fear of humans, which is further worsened by people intentionally or unintentionally feeding coyotes. In such situations, some coyotes have begun to act aggressively toward humans, chasing joggers and bicyclists, confronting people walking their dogs, and stalking small children.<ref name="AOH" /> Non [[Rabies|rabid]] coyotes in these areas will sometimes target small children, mostly under the age of 10, though some adults have been bitten.

Although media reports of such attacks generally identify the animals in question as simply "coyotes," research into the genetics of the [[eastern coyote]] indicates those involved in attacks in northeast North America, including Pennsylvania, New York, New England, and eastern Canada, may have actually been [[coywolves]], hybrids of ''Canis latrans'' and ''Canis lupus,'' not fully coyotes.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2009.0575|pmid=19776058|pmc=2817252| title = Rapid adaptive evolution of northeastern coyotes via hybridization with wolves| journal = Biology Letters| volume = 6|issue=1| pages = 89–93| year = 2009| last1 = Kays | first1 = R.| last2 = Curtis | first2 = A.| last3 = Kirchman | first3 = J.

===Livestock and pet predation===
[[File:Coyote vs Dog.jpg|thumb|Coyote confronting a dog]]
Coyotes are presently the most abundant livestock predators in western North America, causing the majority of sheep, goat and cattle losses.<ref name="CP">{{cite web| title = Coyote Predation – Description|work=A.

However, an Idaho census taken in 2005 showed that individual coyotes were one-twentieth as likely to attack livestock than individual wolves.<ref name="relative">Collinge, Mark (2008).

[[Livestock guardian dog]]s are commonly used to aggressively repel predators and have worked well in both fenced pasture and range operations. A 1986 survey of sheep producers in the USA found that 82% reported the use of dogs represented an economic asset.<ref name=AIB588>{{cite web|title=Livestock Guarding Dogs|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/companimals/guarddogs/guarddogs.htm|work=Agricultural Information Bulletin 588|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=April 3, 2012}}</ref><ref name=LGDfact>{{cite web|title=Livestock guarding dogs fact sheet|url=http://www.lgd.org/usdafacts.html|publisher=Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=April 3, 2012}}</ref>

Coyotes will typically bite the throat just behind the jaw and below the ear when attacking adult sheep or goats, with death commonly resulting from suffocation. Blood loss is usually a secondary cause of death. Calves and heavily fleeced sheep are killed by attacking the flanks or hindquarters, causing shock and blood loss. When attacking smaller prey, such as young lambs, the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions, causing massive tissue and bone damage. Small or young prey may be completely carried off, leaving only blood as evidence of a kill. Coyotes will usually leave the hide and most of the skeleton of larger animals relatively intact, unless food is scarce, in which case they may leave only the largest bones. Scattered bits of wool, skin and other parts are characteristic where coyotes feed extensively on larger carcasses.<ref name="CP" />
[[File:coyote with typical hold on lamb.jpg|thumb|left|Coyote with a typical throat hold on domestic sheep]]
Coyote predation can usually be distinguished from dog or coydog predation by the fact that coyotes partially consume their victims. Tracks are also an important factor in distinguishing coyote from dog predation. Coyote tracks tend to be more oval-shaped and compact than those of domestic dogs, and their claw marks are less prominent and the tracks tend to follow a straight line more closely than those of dogs. With the exception of [[sighthound]]s, most dogs of similar weight to coyotes have a slightly shorter stride.<ref name="CP" /> Coyote kills can be distinguished from wolf kills by the fact that there is less damage to the underlying tissues. Also, coyote scats tend to be smaller than wolf scats.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20130409223159/http://animalrangeextension.montana.edu/articles/wildlife/wolf_depredation.htm Ranchers' Guide to Wolf Depredation], Montana State University</ref>

The [[U.S. government]] routinely shoots, poisons, traps and kills about 90,000 coyotes each year to protect livestock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31880990/ns/us_news-environment/ |title=Controlling wily coyotes? Still no easy answers |publisher=MSNBC |date=December 7, 2009 |accessdate=September 14, 2013}}</ref>

Coyotes are often attracted to [[dog food]] and animals that are small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels will attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of south Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks.<ref name="AOP">{{cite web| title = For coyotes, pets are prey|work=Greg Hardesty|publisher=Orange County Register|url = http://web.archive.org/web/20070715134302/http://www.ocregister.com/ocr/sections/news/focus_in_depth/article_508026.php|date =May 5, 2005|author=Hardesty, Greg}}</ref> Scat analysis collected near [[Claremont, California]] revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring.<ref name="AOH"/> At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of [[feral cat]]s as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.<ref name="AOH" />
Coyotes usually attack smaller-sized dogs, but they have been known to attack even large, powerful breeds such as the [[Rottweiler]] in exceptional cases.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20130526200405/http://www4.whdh.com/news/articles/local/BO52127/ "A coyote attacks in Weymouth and kills a dog"]. WHDH-TV – New England News. May 14, 2007</ref> Dogs larger than coyotes are generally able to drive them off, and have been known to kill coyotes. Smaller breeds are more likely to suffer injury or death.

===Uses===
Prior to the mid-1800s, coyote fur was considered worthless. This changed with the diminution of [[North American beaver|beaver]]s, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became a great source of income (75 [[Penny (United States coin)|cent]]s to [[United States dollar|$]]1.50 per skin) for [[wolfers]] in the [[Great Plains]]. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality.<ref name="young115">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|pp=115–116}}</ref> The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs,<ref name="ern816">{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|p=816}}</ref> but can be used for coats and jackets, scarves or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making [[Trim (sewing)|trimming]]s, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation [[Silver fox (animal)|silver fox]].<ref name="young115"/>

Coyotes were occasionally eaten by trappers and mountain men during the [[Manifest destiny|western expansion]]. Coyotes sometimes featured in the feasts of the [[Plains Indians]], and coyote pups were eaten by the indigenous people of [[San Gabriel, California]]. The taste of coyote meat has been likened to that of the wolf, and is more tender than [[pork]] when boiled. Coyote fat, when taken in the fall, has been used on occasion to grease leather or eaten as a [[Spread (food)|spread]].<ref name="young119">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|pp=119–21}}</ref>

===Tameability===
Coyotes were probably semi-domesticated by various [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] cultures. Some 19th-century writers wrote of coyotes being kept in native villages in the Great Plains. The coyote is easily tamed as a pup, but can become destructive as an adult.<ref name="young64">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|pp=64–9}}</ref> Both full-blooded and hybrid coyotes can be playful and confiding with their owners, but are suspicious and shy of strangers,<ref name="young121"/> though there are records of coyotes being tractable enough to be used for practical purposes like [[Retriever|retrieving]]<ref>Schultz, J. W. (1962). ''Blackfeet and Buffalo: Memories of Life Among the Indians''. University of Oklahoma Press. pp. 141–43. ISBN 0806117001</ref> and [[Pointing breed|pointing]].<ref>Etter, J.
