Although the Zwickau prophets were not Anabaptists (that is, they did not practice &quot;re-baptism&quot;), the prevalent social inequities and the preaching of men like this have been seen as laying the foundation for the Anabaptist movement.

Zwingli had gathered a group of reform-minded men around him, with whom he studied classical literature and the scriptures. However, some of these young men began to feel that Zwingli was not moving fast enough in his reform.

Feeling frustrated, some of them began to meet on their own for Bible study.

While a connection between a violent social revolution and non-resistant Anabaptism may be hard to imagine, the common link was the desire for a radical change in the prevailing social injustices. Disappointed with the failure of armed revolt, Anabaptist ideals of an alternative peaceful, just society probably resonated on the ears of the disappointed peasants.<template><target>Sfn</target><arg><space/>Packull<space/></arg><arg><space/>1995<space/></arg><arg name="pp"><space/>169–75</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Before Anabaptism proper was introduced to South Tyrol, Protestant ideas had been propagated in the region by men such as Hans Vischer, a former Dominican.

As well, the population in general seemed to have a favorable attitude towards reform, be it Protestant or Anabaptist. George Blaurock appears to have preached itinerantly in the Puster Valley region in 1527, which most likely was the first introduction of Anabaptist ideas in the area.

Some seem to have taken it as a sign by which they would escape the apocalyptical revenge of the Turks that Hut predicted. Hut even went so far as to predict a 1528 coming of the kingdom of God. When the prediction failed, some of his converts became discouraged and left the Anabaptist movement. The large congregation of Anabaptists at Augsburg fell apart (partly because of persecution) and those who stayed with Anabaptist ideas were absorbed into Swiss and Moravia Anabaptist congregations.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Packull-mysticism"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Packull<space/></arg><arg name="first">Werner O<space/></arg><arg name="title">Mysticism and the Early South German-Austrian Anabaptist Movement 1525–1531<space/></arg><arg name="location">Scottdale, PA<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Herald Press<space/></arg><arg name="year">1977<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">0-8361-1130-3</arg></template></extension><template><target>rp</target><arg>35–117</arg></template><template><target>Sfn</target><arg><space/>Stayer<space/></arg><arg><space/>1991</arg></template><space/><link><target>Pilgram Marpeck</target></link><space/>was another notable leader in early South German Anabaptism.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Persecutions and migrations</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Witch-scene4.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>The burning of a 16th-century Dutch Anabaptist, Anneken Hendriks, who was charged by the Spanish Inquisition with heresy.</part></link>Roman Catholics and Protestants alike persecuted the Anabaptists, resorting to torture and execution in attempts to curb the growth of the movement.
