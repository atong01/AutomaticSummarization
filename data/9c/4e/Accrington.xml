There was regular conflict with employers over wages and working conditions. On 24 April 1826 over 1,000 men and women, many armed, gathered at Whinney Hill in Clayton-le-Moors to listen to a speaker from where they marched on Sykess Mill at Higher Grange Lane, near the site of the modern police station and Magistrates Courts, and smashed over 60 looms. These riots spread from Accrington through Oswaldtwistle, Blackburn, Darwen, Rossendale, Bury and Chorley. In the end after three days of riots 1,139 looms were destroyed, 4 rioters and 2 bystanders shot dead by the authorities in Rossendale and 41 rioters sentenced to death (all of whose sentences were commuted).<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/1826-03.htm</arg><arg name="title">Cotton Times</arg><arg name="publisher">Doug Peacock</arg><arg name="accessdate">17 June 2011</arg><arg name="archiveurl"><space/>http://web.archive.org/web/20110604221023/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/1826-03.htm</arg><arg name="archivedate"><space/>4 June 2011<space/></arg><arg name="deadurl"><space/>no</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="last">Turner</arg><arg name="first">William</arg><arg name="title">Riot!

Wool, lead and coal were other local industries.Geographical coordinates: 53 46' 0&quot; North, 2 21' 0&quot; West.
