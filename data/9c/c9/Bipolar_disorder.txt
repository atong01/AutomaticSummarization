== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Mania]] is the defining feature of bipolar disorder,<ref name="Barnett2009"/> and can occur with different levels of severity. With milder levels of mania, known as [[hypomania]], individuals appear energetic, excitable, and may be highly productive.<ref name="Beentjes2012"/> As mania worsens, individuals begin to exhibit erratic and impulsive behavior, often making poor decisions due to unrealistic ideas about the future, and sleep very little.<ref name="Beentjes2012"/> At the most severe level, manic individuals can experience very distorted beliefs about the world known as [[psychosis]].<ref name="Beentjes2012"/> A depressive episode commonly follows an episode of mania.<ref name="Beentjes2012"/> The biological mechanisms responsible for switching from a manic or hypomanic episode to a depressive episode or vice versa remain poorly understood.<ref name="Salvadore2010">{{cite journal | author = Salvadore G, Quiroz JA, Machado-Vieira R, Henter ID, Manji HK, Zarate CA | title = The neurobiology of the switch process in bipolar disorder: a review | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 71 | issue = 11 | pages = 1488–1501 | date = November 2010 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.09r05259gre | pmc = 3000635 | pmid = 20492846}}</ref>

=== Manic episodes ===
Mania is a distinct period of at least one week of elevated or irritable [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], which can take the form of euphoria, and exhibit three or more of the following behaviors (four if irritable): [[Pressured speech|speak in a rapid, uninterruptible manner]], are easily distracted, have [[racing thoughts]], display an increase in goal-oriented activities or feel agitated, or exhibit behaviors characterized as impulsive or high-risk such as [[hypersexuality]] or excessive money spending.<ref name="Barnett2009"/> To meet the definition for a manic episode, these behaviors must impair the individual's ability to socialize or work.<ref name="Barnett2009"/><ref name="Beentjes2012"/> If untreated, a manic episode usually lasts three to six months.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Titmarsh S | title = Characteristics and duration of mania: implications for continuation treatment | journal = Progress in Neurology and Psychiatry | date = May–June 2013 | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 26–7 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pnp.283/pdf | doi = 10.1002/pnp.283 }}</ref>

=== Hypomanic episodes ===
[[Hypomania]] is a milder form of mania defined as at least four days of the same criteria as mania,<ref name="Beentjes2012"/> but does not cause a significant decrease in the individual's ability to socialize or work, lacks psychotic features (i.e., [[delusions]] or hallucinations), and does not require psychiatric hospitalization.<ref name="Barnett2009"/> Overall functioning may actually increase during episodes of hypomania and is thought to serve as a defense mechanism against depression.<ref name="Bowins2013"/> Hypomanic episodes rarely progress to true manic episodes.<ref name="Bowins2013"/> Some hypomanic people show increased creativity<ref name="Beentjes2012"/> while others are irritable or demonstrate poor judgment. Hypomanic people generally have increased energy and increased activity levels.

Hypomania may feel good to the person who experiences it.<ref name="Beentjes2012"/> Thus, even when family and friends recognize mood swings, the individual will often deny that anything is wrong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/health/bipolar/bipolar.htm |title=Bipolar Disorder: NIH Publication No. 95-3679|publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health|date=September 1995 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080429204140/http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/health/bipolar/bipolar.htm |archivedate = 2008-04-29}}</ref> What might be called a "hypomanic event", if not accompanied by depressive episodes, is often not deemed as problematic, unless the mood changes are uncontrollable, volatile or mercurial.<ref name="Bowins2013">{{cite journal | author = Bowins B | title = Cognitive regulatory control therapies | journal = Am J Psychother | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 215–36 | year = 2007 | pmid = 24236353 }}</ref> Most commonly, symptoms continue for a few weeks to a few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/bipolar-2-disorder|title=Bipolar II Disorder Symptoms and Signs|publisher=Web M.D.|accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref>

=== Depressive episodes ===
Signs and symptoms of the [[Major depressive episode|depressive phase]] of bipolar disorder include persistent feelings of [[sadness]], anxiety, [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anger]], [[Solitude|isolation]], or [[hopelessness]];<ref name="Muneer2013"/> disturbances in sleep and appetite; fatigue and loss of interest in usually enjoyable activities; problems concentrating; loneliness, self-loathing, apathy or indifference; [[depersonalization]]; loss of interest in sexual activity; shyness or [[social anxiety]]; irritability, chronic pain (with or without a known cause); lack of motivation; and morbid suicidal thoughts.<ref name="Muneer2013"/> In severe cases, the individual may become [[psychotic]], a condition also known as severe bipolar depression with psychotic features. These symptoms include [[delusion]]s or, less commonly, [[hallucination]]s, which are usually frightening and/or intimidating. A major depressive episode persists for at least two weeks, and may continue for over six months if left untreated.<ref>{{cite journal|title=APA Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Comprehensive Guidelines and Guideline Watches |volume=1 |year=2006 |doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890423363.50051|chapter=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Bipolar Disorder Second Edition|isbn=978-0-89042-336-3}}</ref>

=== Mixed affective episodes ===
In the context of bipolar disorder, a [[Mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed state]] is a condition during which symptoms of both mania and depression occur at the same time.<ref name="Swann2013">{{cite journal | author = Swann AC, Lafer B, Perugi G, Frye MA, Bauer M, Bahk WM, Scott J, Ha K, Suppes T | title = Bipolar mixed states: an international society for bipolar disorders task force report of symptom structure, course of illness, and diagnosis | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 170 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–42 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23223893 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12030301 }}</ref> Individuals experiencing a mixed state may have manic symptoms such as grandiose thoughts while at the same time experiencing depressive symptoms such as excessive guilt or feeling suicidal.<ref name="Swann2013"/> Mixed states are considered to be high-risk for suicidal behavior since depressive emotions such as hopelessness are often paired with [[Emotional lability|mood swings]] or [[Impulsivity|difficulties with impulse control]].<ref name="Swann2013"/> [[Anxiety disorder]] occurs more frequently as a comorbidity in mixed bipolar episodes than in non mixed bipolar depression or mania.<ref name="Swann2013"/> Substance abuse (including alcohol) also follows this trend.<ref name="Swann2013"/>

=== Associated features ===
{{main|Associated features of bipolar disorder}}
Associated features are clinical phenomena that often accompany the disorder but are not part of the diagnostic criteria. In adults with the condition, bipolar disorder is often accompanied by changes in [[Cognition|cognitive]] processes and abilities. These include reduced [[attention]]al and [[Executive functions|executive]] capabilities and impaired [[memory]]. How the individual processes the world also depends on the phase of the disorder, with differential characteristics between the manic, hypomanic and depressive states.<ref name="Mansell2008">{{cite journal | author = Mansell W, Pedley R | title = The ascent into mania: a review of psychological processes associated with the development of manic symptoms. | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 494–520 | date = Mar 2008 | pmid = 17825463 | doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.07.010}}</ref> Some studies have found a significant association between bipolar disorder and [[creativity]].<ref name="pmid20936438">{{cite journal | author = Srivastava S, Ketter TA | title = The link between bipolar disorders and creativity: evidence from personality and temperament studies. | journal = Current psychiatry reports | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 522–30 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20936438 | doi=10.1007/s11920-010-0159-x}}</ref> Those with bipolar disorder may have difficulty in maintaining relationships.{{sfn|Goodwin|Jamison|2007|p=338}} There are several common childhood precursors seen in children who later receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder; these disorders include mood abnormalities, full major depressive episodes, and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).<ref name="Reinhardt2013">{{cite journal | author = Reinhardt MC, Reinhardt CA | title = Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, comorbidities, and risk situations | journal = J Pediatr (Rio J) | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 124–30 | date = March–April 2013 | pmid = 23642421 | doi = 10.1016/j.jped.2013.03.015 }}</ref>

=== Comorbid conditions ===
The diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be complicated by coexisting (comorbid) psychiatric conditions including the following: [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[substance abuse]], [[eating disorder]]s, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]], [[premenstrual syndrome]] (including [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]]), or [[panic disorder]].<ref name="Post2013">{{cite journal | author = Post RM, Kalivas P | title = Bipolar disorder and substance misuse: pathological and therapeutic implications of their comorbidity and cross-sensitisation | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 202 | issue = 3 | pages = 172–6 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23457180 | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/202/3/172.long | doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.112.116855}}</ref><ref name="Kerner2014"/><ref name="Muneer2013"/><ref name="Cirillo2012">{{cite journal | author = Cirillo PC, Passos RB, Bevilaqua MC, López JR, Nardi AE | title = Bipolar disorder and Premenstrual Syndrome or Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder comorbidity: a systematic review | journal = Rev Bras Psiquiatr | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 467–79 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23429819 | url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462012000400015&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en | doi=10.1016/j.rbp.2012.04.010}}</ref>  A careful longitudinal analysis of symptoms and episodes, enriched if possible by discussions with friends and family members, is crucial to establishing a treatment plan where these comorbidities exist.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sagman D and Tohen M|title=Comorbidity in Bipolar Disorder: The Complexity of Diagnosis and Treatment|journal=Psychiatric Times |year=2009|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1391541}}</ref>

According to the "kindling" hypothesis, when people who are genetically predisposed toward bipolar disorder experience stressful events, the stress threshold at which mood changes occur becomes progressively lower, until the episodes eventually start (and recur) spontaneously.

=== Evolutionary ===
Because bipolar disorder affects an individual’s ability to function in society and has a high morbidity rate, [[evolutionary theory]] would suggest that the genes responsible would have been naturally selected against, effectively culling the disorder. Yet there continue to be high rates of bipolar disorder in many populations, suggesting the genes responsible may have an evolutionary benefit.

Proponents of [[evolutionary medicine]] hypothesize that the genes that cause severe bipolar disorder when inherited in large doses may increase fitness when inherited in small doses.<ref>{{cite book | author = Phelps JR | title = The Biologic Basis of Bipolar Disorder | year = 2008 | publisher = PsychEducation.org | chapter = Chapter 5: The Big Picture — There Must Be Some Evolutionary Advantage? | chapterurl = http://www.psycheducation.org/BipolarMechanism/5BigPicture.htm }}</ref> High rates of bipolar disorder throughout history suggest that the ability to switch between depressive and manic moods conveyed some evolutionary advantage on ancestral humans. Theories put forward to explain the [[Evolutionary approaches to depression|evolutionary advantages of major depressive disorder]] may also explain the adaptiveness of the depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. For example, in individuals under increased stress, depressive mood may serve as a defensive strategy that causes the individual to retreat from the external stressor, increase sleep, and preserve resources and energy for better times.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gilbert P | title = Evolution and depression: Issues and implications | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 287–297 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16236231 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1017/S0033291705006112 }}</ref> Additionally, manic moods may convey advantage in some situations. Creativity, confidence, and high energy have all been linked to mania and hypomania.<ref>{{cite book | author = Jamison KR | title = Touched With Fire: Manic-depressive illness and the artistic temperament | year = 1993 | publisher = The Free Press | location = New York | asin = B002C47A0K }}</ref><ref name="url_Hypomanias_up_side">{{cite web | url = http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050406/news_1c06hypo.html | title = Hypomania's up side distinct but linked to bipolar disorder | author = Carey B  | work = Psychology | publisher = New York Times News Service/The San Diego Union-Tribune | date = April 2005 }}</ref> The ability to utilize mild manic symptoms to be more productive and think more creatively during stress-free times may have increased the fitness of ancestral humans.  Being able to employ both hypomania and mild depression convey advantages that benefit individuals in a variable environment. However, if the genes enabling the manipulation of both of these moods are over activated, the manic and/or severe depressive moods of full bipolar disorder may be triggered instead.

Evolutionary biologists have hypothesized that bipolar disorder could have come from an adaptation to extreme climates in the northern [[temperate zone]] during the [[Pleistocene]]. The Evolutionary Origin of Bipolar Disorder (EOBD) hypothesis states that during the short summers of extreme climates, hypomania would be adaptive, allowing the completion of many tasks necessary for survival within a short period of time. During long winters the lethargy, [[hypersomnia]], lack of interest in social activities, and overeating of depression would be adaptive to group cohesion and survival.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sherman JA | title = Evolutionary Origin of Bipolar Disorder (eobd) | journal =  Psycoloquy | year = 2001 | volume = 12 | issue = 028 | pages = | url = http://www.cogsci.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/psyc/newpsy?12.028 }}</ref> Evidence for the EOBD hypothesis include an association between bipolar disorder and a cold-adapted build, correlation between seasonality and mood changes in those with bipolar disorder, and low rates of bipolar disorder in African Americans.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sherman JA | title = Evolutionary origin of bipolar disorder-revised: EOBD-R | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 78 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–122 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22036090  | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.10.005 }}</ref> The EOBD hypothesis suggests that in the absence of the extreme climatic conditions that fostered the success of bipolar disorder genes, many bipolar disorder behaviors are maladaptive and can often severely impair normal functioning.

== Prevention ==
[[Mental disorder#Prevention|Prevention]] of bipolar has focused on stress (such as childhood adversity or highly conflictual families) which, although not a diagnostically specific causal agent for bipolar, does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more pernicious course of illness.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Miklowitz DJ, Chang KD | title = Prevention of bipolar disorder in at-risk children: theoretical assumptions and empirical foundations. | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 881–97 | date = Summer 2008 | pmid = 18606036 | doi=10.1017/s0954579408000424 | pmc=2504732}}</ref> There has been debate regarding the causal relationship between usage of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and bipolar disorder.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Khan MA, Akella S | title = Cannabis-Induced Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features: A Case Report | journal = Psychiatry (Edgmont) | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = 44–8 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20104292 | pmc = 2811144 }}</ref>

An initial assessment may include a physical exam by a physician.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
There are several other mental disorders with symptoms similar to those seen in bipolar disorder.

It has been noted that the bipolar disorder diagnosis is officially characterized in historical terms such that, technically, anyone with a history of (hypo)mania and depression has bipolar disorder whatever their current or future functioning and vulnerability. This has been described as "an ethical and methodological issue", as it means no one can be considered as being recovered (only "in [[remission (medicine)|remission]]") from bipolar disorder according to the official criteria. This is considered especially problematic given that brief hypomanic episodes are widespread among people generally and not necessarily associated with dysfunction.<ref name="Mansell2008" />

== Management ==
{{main|Treatment of bipolar disorder}}
There are a number of [[pharmacological]] and [[psychotherapeutic]] techniques used to treat bipolar disorder. Individuals may use [[self-help groups for mental health|self-help]] and pursue [[recovery model|recovery]].

Hospitalization may be required especially with the manic episodes present in bipolar I. This can be voluntary or (if mental health legislation allows and varying state-to-state regulations in the USA) involuntary (called civil or [[involuntary commitment]]). Long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to [[deinstitutionalization]], although these can still occur.<ref name="BeckerKilian2006">{{cite journal | author = Becker T, Kilian R | title = Psychiatric services for people with severe mental illness across western Europe: What can be generalized from current knowledge about differences in provision, costs and outcomes of mental health care? | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 113 | issue = 429 | pages = 9–16 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16445476 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00711.x }}</ref> Following (or in lieu of) a hospital admission, support services available can include drop-in centers, visits from members of a community mental health team or an [[Assertive Community Treatment]] team, supported employment and patient-led support groups, intensive outpatient programs.

=== Psychosocial ===
[[Psychotherapy]] is aimed at alleviating core symptoms, recognizing episode triggers, reducing negative expressed emotion in relationships, recognizing [[prodromal]] symptoms before full-blown recurrence, and, practicing the factors that lead to maintenance of [[remission (medicine)|remission]].<ref>Lam et al., 1999; Miklowitz & Goldstein, 1997; Frank, 2005.{{full|date=February 2012|reason=no citations for these references}}</ref>{{sfn|Leahy|Johnson|2003}}{{sfn|Basco|Rush|2005}} [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[family therapy|family-focused therapy]], and [[psychoeducation]] have the most evidence for efficacy in regard to relapse prevention, while [[interpersonal and social rhythm therapy]] and cognitive-behavioral therapy appear the most effective in regard to residual depressive symptoms.

Four [[anticonvulsant]]s are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder.

== Prognosis ==
For many individuals with bipolar disorder a good [[prognosis]] results from good treatment, which, in turn, results from an accurate [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. Of the various forms of bipolar disorder, rapid cycling bipolar disorder is associated with the worst prognosis.<ref name="Muneer2013"/> Because bipolar disorder can have a high rate of both under-diagnosis and [[misdiagnosis]],<ref name="Bowden"/> it is often difficult for individuals with the condition to receive timely and competent treatment.

Bipolar disorder can be a severely disabling medical condition. However, many individuals with bipolar disorder can live full and satisfying lives. Quite often, medication is needed to enable this. Persons with bipolar disorder may have periods of normal or near normal functioning between episodes.{{sfn|Bergen|1999}}

=== Functioning ===
Functioning in bipolar I and II varies over time along a spectrum from good to fair to poor. During periods of [[major depression]] or mania (in BPI), functioning was on average poor, with depression being more persistently associated with disability than mania. Functioning between episodes was on average good&nbsp;– more or less normal. Subthreshold symptoms were generally still substantially impairing, however, except for hypomania (below or above threshold) which was associated with improved functioning.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Judd LL, Akiskal HS, Schettler PJ, Endicott J, Leon AC, Solomon DA, Coryell W, Maser JD, Keller MB | title = Psychosocial disability in the course of bipolar I and II disorders: a prospective, comparative, longitudinal study. | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = 12 | pages = 1322–30 | date = Dec 2005 | pmid = 16330720 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.62.12.1322}}</ref>

=== Recovery and recurrence ===
A naturalistic study from first admission for mania or mixed episode (representing the hospitalized and therefore most severe cases) found that 50% achieved syndromal recovery (no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis) within six weeks and 98% within two years. Within two years, 72% achieved symptomatic recovery (no symptoms at all) and 43% achieved functional recovery (regaining of prior occupational and residential status). However, 40% went on to experience a new episode of mania or depression within 2 years of syndromal recovery, and 19% switched phases without recovery.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tohen M, Zarate CA, Hennen J, Khalsa HM, Strakowski SM, Gebre-Medhin P, Salvatore P, Baldessarini RJ | title = The McLean-Harvard First-Episode Mania Study: Prediction of recovery and first recurrence | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 160 | issue = 12 | pages = 2099–2107 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14638578 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.12.2099 }}</ref>

There are conceptual and methodological limitations and variations in the findings. Prevalence studies of bipolar disorder are typically carried out by lay interviewers who follow fully structured/fixed interview schemes; responses to single items from such interviews may suffer limited validity. In addition, diagnoses (and therefore estimates of prevalence) vary depending on whether a categorical or [[spectrum approach]] is used. This consideration has led to concerns about the potential for both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phelps J |title=Bipolar Disorder: Particle or Wave?

Variations in moods and energy levels have been observed as part of the human experience since throughout history. The words "[[melancholia]]" (an old word for [[depression (mood)|depression]]) and "mania" originated in [[Ancient Greek]]. The word melancholia is derived from ''melas''/μελας, meaning "black", and ''chole''/χολη, meaning "bile" or "gall",{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1980}} indicative of the term's origins in pre-[[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] [[humoral]] theories. Within the humoral theories, mania was viewed as arising from an excess of [[yellow bile]], or a mixture of black and yellow bile. The [[linguistics|linguistic]] origins of mania, however, are not so clear-cut. Several etymologies are proposed by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] physician [[Caelius Aurelianus]], including the Greek word ''ania'', meaning "to produce great mental anguish", and ''manos'', meaning "relaxed" or "loose", which would contextually approximate to an excessive relaxing of the mind or soul.<ref name="Angst-2001">{{cite journal | author = Angst J, Marneros A | title = Bipolarity from ancient to modern times: conception, birth and rebirth | journal = J Affect Disord | volume = 67 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 3–19 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11869749 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0327(01)00429-3 }}</ref> There are at least five other candidates, and part of the confusion surrounding the exact etymology of the word mania is its varied usage in the pre-Hippocratic [[poetry]] and [[mythology|mythologies]].<ref name="Angst-2001"/>

In the early 1800s, French psychiatrist [[Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol]]'s lypemania, one of his affective [[monomania]]s, was the first elaboration on what was to become modern depression.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Borch-Jacobsen M | title = Which came first, the condition or the drug? | journal = London Review of Books | volume = 32 | issue = 19 | pages = 31–33 | date = October 2010 | url = http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n19/mikkel-borch-jacobsen/which-came-first-the-condition-or-the-drug | quote = at the beginning of the 19th century with Esquirol’s ‘affective monomanias’ (notably ‘lypemania’, the first elaboration of what was to become our modern depression) }}</ref> The basis of the current conceptualisation of manic–depressive illness can be traced back to the 1850s; on January 31, 1854, [[Jules Baillarger]] described to the French Imperial [[Académie Nationale de Médecine|Academy of Medicine]] a [[Stereotypy|biphasic]] [[mental illness]] causing recurrent oscillations between mania and depression, which he termed ''folie à double forme'' ("dual-form insanity").<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pichot P | title = Circular insanity, 150 years on | journal = Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine | volume = 188 | issue = 2 | pages = 275–284 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15506718 |language=fr}}.</ref> Two weeks later, on February 14, 1854, [[Jean-Pierre Falret]] presented a description to the Academy on what was essentially the same disorder, and designated ''folie circulaire'' ("circular [[insanity]]") by him.<ref name="Sedler">{{cite journal | author = Sedler MJ | title = Falret's discovery: The origin of the concept of bipolar affective illness.

These concepts were developed by the German [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856–1926), who, using [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum|Kahlbaum]]'s concept of [[cyclothymia]],{{sfn|Millon|1996|p=290}} categorized and studied the natural course of untreated bipolar patients. He coined the term ''manic depressive [[psychosis]]'', after noting that periods of acute illness, manic or depressive, were generally punctuated by relatively symptom-free intervals where the patient was able to function normally.<ref>[[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin, Emil]] (1921) ''Manic–depressive Insanity and Paranoia'' ISBN 0-405-07441-7</ref>

The term "manic–depressive ''reaction''" appeared in the first [[American Psychiatric Association]] Diagnostic Manual in 1952, influenced by the legacy of [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]].{{sfn|Goodwin|Jamison|2007| loc=Chapter 1}} Subclassifying this into 'unipolar' and 'bipolar' disorder was first proposed by German psychiatrists [[Karl Kleist]] and [[Karl Leonhard]] in the 1950s and, since the DSM-III, Major Depressive Disorder has been regarded as a separate condition to Bipolar Disorder. Subtypes of 'Bipolar II' and 'rapid cycling' have been included since the DSM-IV, based on work from the 1970s by [[David L. Dunner]], [[Elliot S. Gershon]], [[Frederick K. Goodwin]], [[Ronald R. Fieve]] and [[Joseph L.

[[Kay Redfield Jamison]], a clinical psychologist and Professor of Psychiatry at the [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], profiled her own bipolar disorder in her memoir ''[[An Unquiet Mind]]'' (1995).{{sfn|Jamison|1995}} In his autobiography ''[[Manicdotes: There's Madness in His Method]]'' (2008) [[Chris Joseph (autobiographer)|Chris Joseph]] describes his struggle between the creative dynamism which allowed the creation of his multimillion-pound advertising agency [[Hook Advertising]], and the money-squandering dark despair of his bipolar illness.{{sfn|Joseph|2008}}

Several dramatic works have portrayed characters with traits suggestive of the diagnosis that has been the subject of discussion by psychiatrists and film experts alike. A notable example is ''[[Mr. Jones (1993 film)|Mr. Jones]]'' (1993), in which Mr. Jones ([[Richard Gere]]) swings from a manic episode into a depressive phase and back again, spending time in a psychiatric hospital and displaying many of the features of the syndrome.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=78–81}} In ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), Allie Fox ([[Harrison Ford]]) displays some features including recklessness, grandiosity, increased goal-directed activity and mood lability, as well as some paranoia.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=84–85}} Psychiatrists have suggested that [[Willy Loman]], the main character in [[Arthur Miller]]'s classic play ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', suffers from bipolar disorder,<ref>{{cite news|last=McKinley|first=Jesse|title=Get That Man Some Prozac; If the Dramatic Tension Is All in His Head|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/weekinreview/ideas-trends-get-that-man-some-prozac-if-the-dramatic-tension-is-all-in-his-head.html|accessdate=3 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 28, 1999}}</ref> though that specific term for the condition did not exist when the play was written.

=== Elderly ===
There is a relative lack of knowledge about bipolar disorder in late life. There is evidence that it becomes less prevalent with age but nevertheless accounts for a similar percentage of psychiatric admissions; that older bipolar patients had first experienced symptoms at a later age; that later onset of mania is associated with more neurologic impairment; that substance abuse is considerably less common in older groups; and that there is probably a greater degree of variation in presentation and course, for instance individuals may develop new-onset mania associated with vascular changes, or become manic only after recurrent depressive episodes, or may have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at an early age and still meet criteria. There is also some weak and not conclusive evidence that mania is less intense and there is a higher prevalence of mixed episodes, although there may be a reduced response to treatment. Overall, there are likely more similarities than differences from younger adults.<ref name=Vasudev2010>{{cite journal | author = Vasudev A, Thomas A | title = 'Bipolar disorder' in the elderly: what's in a name? | journal = Maturitas | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–5 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20307944 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2010.02.013 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15383127">{{cite journal | author = Depp CA, Jeste DV | title = Bipolar disorder in older adults: A critical review | journal = Bipolar Disorders | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 343–367 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15383127 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2004.00139.x }}</ref> In the elderly, recognition and treatment of bipolar disorder may be complicated by the presence of [[dementia]] or the side effects of medications being taken for other conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Trinh NH, Forester B|title=Bipolar Disorder in the Elderly: Differential Diagnosis and Treatment |journal=Psychiatric Times|volume=24 |issue=14 |year=2007 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/bipolar-disorder/article/10168/54481}}</ref>
