It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of<space/><link><target>pressure</target></link><space/>that cause the formation of cavities where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense<space/><link><target>shock wave</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Cavitation is a significant cause of wear in some<space/><link><target>engineering</target></link><space/>contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause<space/><link><target>cyclic stress</target></link><space/>through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called &quot;cavitation&quot;. The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.</paragraph><paragraph>Inertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a<space/><link><target>shock wave</target></link>. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of<space/><link><target>mantis shrimp</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>pistol shrimp</target><trail>s</trail></link>, as well as in the<space/><link><target>vascular tissue</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>of plants.

Such cavitation is often employed in<space/><link><target>ultrasonic cleaning</target></link><space/>baths and can also be observed in pumps, propellers, etc.</paragraph><paragraph>Since the shock waves formed by collapse of the voids are strong enough to cause significant damage to moving parts, cavitation is usually an undesirable phenomenon. It is very often specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of<space/><link><target>fluid dynamics</target></link>.

This phenomenon is coined<space/><italics>cavitation inception</italics><space/>and may occur behind the blade of a rapidly rotating propeller or on any surface vibrating in the liquid with sufficient amplitude and acceleration. A fast-flowing river can cause cavitation on rock surfaces, particularly when there is a drop-off, such as on a waterfall.</paragraph><paragraph>Other ways of generating cavitation voids involve the local deposition of energy, such as an intense focused laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark.<space/><link><target>Vapor</target></link><space/>gases evaporate into the cavity from the surrounding medium; thus, the cavity is not a perfect vacuum, but has a relatively low gas pressure. Such a low-pressure bubble in a liquid begins to collapse due to the higher pressure of the surrounding medium. As the bubble collapses, the pressure and temperature of the vapor within increases. The bubble eventually collapses to a minute fraction of its original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid<space/><link><target>wiktionary:via#Preposition</target><part>via</part></link><space/>a rather violent mechanism which releases a significant amount of energy in the form of an acoustic shock wave and as<space/><link><target>sonoluminesence</target><part>visible light</part></link>.

Cavitation will only occur if the local pressure declines to some point below the saturated<space/><link><target>vapor pressure</target></link><space/>of the liquid and subsequent recovery above the vapor pressure. If the recovery pressure is not above the vapor pressure then flashing is said to have occurred. In pipe systems, cavitation typically occurs either as the result of an increase in the kinetic energy (through an area constriction) or an increase in the pipe elevation.</paragraph><paragraph>Hydrodynamic cavitation can be produced by passing a liquid through a constricted channel at a specific<space/><link><target>flow velocity</target></link><space/>or by mechanical rotation of an object through a liquid. In the case of the constricted channel and based on the specific (or unique) geometry of the system, the combination of pressure and kinetic energy can create the hydrodynamic cavitation cavern downstream of the local constriction generating high energy cavitation bubbles.</paragraph><paragraph>The process of bubble generation, and the subsequent growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles, results in very high energy densities and in very high local temperatures and local pressures at the surface of the bubbles for a very short time. The overall liquid medium environment, therefore, remains at ambient conditions. When uncontrolled, cavitation is damaging; by controlling the flow of the cavitation, however, the power can be harnessed and non-destructive. Controlled cavitation can be used to enhance chemical reactions or propagate certain unexpected reactions because free radicals are generated in the process due to disassociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles.<space/><template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2011</arg></template>.</paragraph><paragraph>Orifices and venturi are reported to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi has an inherent advantage over an orifice because of its smooth converging and diverging sections, such that that it can generate a higher flow velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate more number of holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="first">Vijayanand S.<space/></arg><arg name="last">Moholkar<space/></arg><arg name="first2">Aniruddha B.<space/></arg><arg name="last2">Pandit<space/></arg><arg name="doi">10.1002/aic.690430628<space/></arg><arg name="year">1997<space/></arg><arg name="title">Bubble Behavior in Hydrodynamic Cavitation: Effect of Turbulence<space/></arg><arg name="journal">AIChe Journal<space/></arg><arg name="volume">43<space/></arg><arg name="issue">6<space/></arg><arg name="pages">1641â€“1648<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The cavitation phenomenon can be controlled to enhance the performance of high-speed marine vessels and projectiles, as well as in material processing technologies, in medicine, etc. Controlling the cavitating flows in liquids can be achieved only by advancing the mathematical foundation of the cavitation processes. These processes are manifested in different ways, the most common ones and promising for control being bubble cavitation and supercavitation. The first exact classical solution should perhaps be credited to the well- known solution by H. Helmholtz in 1868.

Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle.

This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.</paragraph><paragraph>In automotive applications, a clogged filter in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that rises and falls in synch with engine RPM. It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Discharge cavitation</heading><paragraph>Discharge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a<space/><link><target>Venturi effect</target><part>venturi</part></link>), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.</paragraph><paragraph>Discharge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone<space/><link><target>Cracking joints</target><part>joint cracking</part></link>, for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Cavitation solutions</heading><paragraph>Since all pumps require well-developed inlet flow to meet their potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.</paragraph><paragraph>To have a well-developed flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about 10 diameters of straight pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel must contend with space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, it is common to use an elbow close-coupled to the pump suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="last">Golomb</arg><arg name="first">Richard</arg><arg name="title">A new tailpipe design for GE frame-type gas turbines to substantially lower pressure losses<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele</arg><arg name="publisher">American Society of Mechanical Engineers</arg><arg name="accessdate">2 August 2012</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>With a double-suction pump tied to a close-coupled elbow, flow distribution to the impeller is poor and causes reliability and performance shortfalls. The elbow divides the flow unevenly with more channeled to the outside of the elbow. Consequently, one side of the double-suction impeller receives more flow at a higher flow velocity and pressure while the starved side receives a highly turbulent and potentially damaging flow. This degrades overall pump performance (delivered head, flow and power consumption) and causes axial imbalance which shortens seal, bearing and impeller life.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>Pulp &amp; Paper</target></link><space/>(1992), Daishowa Reduces Pump Maintenance by Installing Fluid Rotating Vanes</extension>To overcome cavitation:Increase suction pressure if possible.Decrease liquid temperature if possible.Throttle back on the discharge valve to decrease flow-rate.Vent gases off the pump casing.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Control valves</heading><paragraph>Cavitation can occur in<space/><link><target>control valves</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>Emerson Process Management</target></link><space/>(2005), Control valve handbook, 4th Edition, page 136</extension><space/>If the actual pressure drop across the valve as defined by the upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the valve port. To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the vena contracta or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely to the level of the upstream pressure. If the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream. If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Spillways</heading><paragraph>When water flows over a dam<space/><link><target>spillway</target></link>, the irregularities on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation in a high speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the flow velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the water and vapor bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into a high pressure region the bubbles collapse giving rise to high pressures and possible cavitation damage.</paragraph><paragraph>Experimental investigations show that the damage on<space/><link><target>concrete</target></link><space/>chute and tunnel spillways can start at clear water flow velocities of between 12 to 15&amp;nbsp;m/s, and, up to flow velocities of 20&amp;nbsp;m/s, it may be possible to protect the surface by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Volkart_Rutschmann_1984"><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="author">Vokart, P., and Rutschamnn, P.<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Rapid Flow in Spillway Chutes with and without Deflectors â€“ A Model-Prototype Comparison, Proc.

This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant filler cap spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.</paragraph><paragraph>From about the 1980s, new designs of smaller petrol (<link><target>gasoline</target></link>) engines also displayed cavitation phenomena. One answer to the need for smaller and lighter engines was a smaller coolant volume and a correspondingly higher coolant flow velocity. This gave rise to rapid changes in flow velocity and therefore rapid changes of static pressure in areas of high heat transfer. Where resulting vapor bubbles collapsed against a surface, they had the effect of first disrupting protective oxide layers (of cast aluminium materials) and then repeatedly damaging the newly formed surface, preventing the action of some types of corrosion inhibitor (such as silicate based inhibitors). A final problem was the effect that increased material temperature had on the relative electrochemical reactivity of the base metal and its alloying constituents. The result was deep pits that could form and penetrate the engine head in a matter of hours when the engine was running at high load and high speed. These effects could largely be avoided by the use of organic corrosion inhibitors or (preferably) by designing the engine head in such a way as to avoid certain cavitation inducing conditions.</paragraph><heading level='2'>In nature</heading><heading level='3'>Geology</heading><paragraph>Some hypotheses relating to<space/><link><target>diamond</target></link><space/>formation posit a possible role for cavitationnamely cavitiation in the<space/><link><target>kimberlite</target></link><space/>pipes providing the extreme pressure needed to change pure<space/><link><target>carbon</target></link><space/>into the rare<space/><link><target>allotrope</target></link><space/>that is diamond.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>diamond</target></link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The loudest three sounds ever recorded, during the<space/><link><target>1883 eruption of Krakatoa</target></link>, are now understood as the bursts of three huge cavitation bubbles, each larger than the last, formed in the volcano's throat.
