'''Bitola''' ({{lang-mk|Битола}} {{IPA-mk|ˈbitɔɫa||Mk-Bitola.ogg}} known also by several [[#Etymology|alternative names]]) is a city in the southwestern part of the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. The city is an administrative, cultural, industrial, commercial, and educational centre. It is located in the southern part of the [[Pelagonia]] valley, surrounded by the [[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|Baba]], [[Nidže]] and [[Kajmakčalan]] mountain ranges, {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the [[Medžitlija-Níki]] border crossing with [[Greece]]. It is an important junction connecting the south of the [[Adriatic Sea]] with the [[Aegean Sea]] and [[Central Europe]]. It has been known since the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period as "the city of the consuls", since many European countries have consulates in Bitola. According to the 2002 census, Bitola is the [[List of cities in the Republic of Macedonia by population|second largest city]] in the country.<ref name="Statistical Office">[http://www.stat.gov.mk/Publikacii/knigaX.pdf Macedonian census, language and religion]</ref> Bitola is also the seat of the [[Bitola Municipality]]. Bitola is one of the oldest cities on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. It was founded as [[Heraclea Lyncestis]] in the middle of the 4th century BC by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]] the city was the last capital of [[Ottoman Rumelia]].

==Etymology==
According to Adrian Room, the name ''Bitola'' is derived from the [[Old Church Slavonic]] word {{Script|Cyrs|ѡ҆би́тѣл҄ь}} (''obitěĺь'', meaning "monastery, cloister") as the city was formerly noted for its monastery. When the meaning of the name was no longer understood, it lost its prefix "o-".<ref>{{Citation | last = Room | first = Adrian | title = Placenames of the world: origins and meanings of the names for 6,600 countries, cities, territories, natural features, and historic sites | place = Jefferson, N.C. | publisher = McFarland & Company, Inc. | year = 2006 | edition = 2nd | page = 60 | isbn = 0-7864-2248-3 }}</ref> The name ''Bitola'' is mentioned in the [[Bitola inscription]], related to the old city fortress built in 1015. Modern Slavic variants include the [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] ''Bitola'' (Битола), the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''Bitolj'' (Битољ) and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''Bitolya'' (Битоля). In [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, the name was Hellenized to ''Voutélion'' (Βουτέλιον) or ''Vitólia'' (Βιτώλια), hence the names ''Butella'' used by [[William of Tyre]] and ''Butili'' by the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|al-Idrisi]]. The [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] name is ''Bituli''.

The [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the city (''Monastíri'', Μοναστήρι), also meaning "monastery", is a [[calque]] of the Slavic name. The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name ''Manastır'' ({{lang-ota|مناستر}}) is derived from the Greek name, like the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name (''Manastir'').

==Geography==
Bitola is located in the southwestern part of Macedonia. The [[Dragor River]] flows through the city. Bitola lies at an elevation of 615 meters above sea level, at the foot of [[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|Baba Mountain]]. Its magnificent [[Pelister]] mountain (2601 m) is a national park with exquisite flora and fauna, among which is the rarest species of pine, known as [[Macedonian pine]] or [[pinus peuce]], as well as a well-known ski resort.

Covering an area of {{convert|1798|km²|0|abbr=on}}. and with a population of 122,173 (1991), Bitola is an important industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational, and cultural center. It represents an important junction that connects the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the south with the [[Aegean Sea]] and [[Central Europe]].

==History==
[[File:Catolic church bitola.jpg|thumb|left|The Catholic Church "Holy Heart of Jesus", on the main street of Bitola.]]

===Prehistory===
Bitola is very rich in monuments from the prehistoric period. Two important ones are [[Veluška Tumba]], and [[Bara Tumba]] near the village of Porodin. From the [[Copper Age]] there are the settlements of Tumba near the village of Crnobuki, Šuplevec near the village of Suvodol, and Visok Rid near the village of Bukri. The [[Bronze Age]] is represented by the settlements of Tumba near the village of Kanino and the settlement with the same name near the village of Karamani.

===Ancient and early Byzantine periods===
The area of the town is located in ancient [[Lynkestis]], a region of [[Upper Macedonia]], which was ruled by semi-independent chieftains till the later [[Argead dynasty|Argead]] rulers of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]]. The tribes of Lynkestis were known as ''Lynkestai''. They were a [[Greeks|Greek]] tribe and belonged to the [[Molossians|Molossian]] group of the [[Epirotes]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=edited by John Boardman [and] N.G.L.|title=The expansion of the Greek world, eighth to sixth centuries B.C.|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-521-23447-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qAoqP4g1fEC&pg=PA266 |edition=2nd}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière|title=Collected Studies: Further studies on various topics|year=1993|publisher=A.M.

[[Heraclea Lyncestis]] ({{lang-el|Ηράκλεια Λυγκηστίς}}<ref>[[NGL Hammond|Hammond, N. G. L.]], (1972), ''A History of Macedonia'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, pg. 59</ref> - ''City of Hercules upon the Land of the Lynx'') was an important settlement from the [[Hellenistic period]] till the early [[Middle Ages]]. It was founded by [[Philip II of Macedon]] by the middle of the 4th century BC, and named after the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] hero [[Heracles]]. With its strategic location, it became a prosperous city. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered this part of Macedon in 148 BC and destroyed the political power of the city. However, its prosperity continued mainly due to the Roman [[Via Egnatia]] road which passed near the city. Several monuments from the Roman times remain in Heraclea, including a [[portico]], [[thermae]] (baths), an [[amphitheater]] and a number of [[basilica]]s. The theatre was once capable of housing an audience of around 3,000 people.

In the early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period (4th to 6th centuries AD) Heraclea was an important episcopal centre. Some of its bishops were mentioned in the acts of the Church Councils, including Bishop Evagrius of Heraclea in the Acts of the [[Archbishopric of Sardica#Council of Sardica|Sardica Council]] of 343 AD. A small and a great (Large) basilica, the bishop's residence, and a funeral basilica near the necropolis are some of the remains of this period. Three [[nave]]s in the Great Basilica are covered with [[mosaic]]s of very rich floral and figurative [[iconography]]; these well preserved mosaics are often regarded as fine examples of the early [[Christian art]] period. During the 4th and 6th centuries, the names of other bishops from Heraclea were recorded. The city was sacked by [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] forces, commanded by [[Theodoric the Great]] in 472 and, despite a large gift to him from the city's bishop, it was sacked again in 479. It was restored in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. In the late 6th century the city suffered successive attacks by [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes and was gradually abandoned.

===Middle Ages===
In the 6th and 7th centuries, the region around Bitola experienced a demographic shift as more and more Slavic tribes settled in the area. In place of the deserted theater, several houses were built during that time. The Slavs also built a fortress around their settlement. Bitola became a part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] from late in the 8th to early 11th centuries. The spread of Christianity was assisted by St. [[Clement of Ohrid]] and [[Naum of Preslav]] in the 9th and early 10th centuries. Many monasteries and churches were built in the city.

In the 10th century, Bitola was under the rule of the Bulgarian Tsar Samuil. He built a castle in the town, later used by his successor [[Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria]]. The town is mentioned in several medieval sources. [[John Skylitzes]]'s 11th-century chronicle mentions that Emperor [[Basil II]] burned Gavril's castles in Bitola, when passing through and ravaging Pelagonia. The second [[chrysobull]] (1019) of Basil II mentioned that the Bishop of Bitola depended on the [[Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. During the reign of Samuil, the city was an important centre in the Bulgarian state and the seat of the Bitola Bishopric. In many medieval sources, especially Western, the name ''Pelagonia'' was synonymous with the Bitola Bishopric, and in some of them Bitola was known under the name of Heraclea due to the church tradition that turned the Heraclea Bishopric into the Pelagonian Metropolitan's Diocese. In 1015, Tsar Gavril Radomir was killed by his cousin [[Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria|Ivan Vladislav]], who declared himself tsar and rebuilt the city fortress. To celebrate the occasion, a [[Bitola inscription|stone inscription]] written in the [[Cyrillic]] alphabet was set in the fortress; in it the Slavic name of the city is mentioned: Bitol.

Following battles with the Tsar Ivan Vladislav, Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] recaptured Monastiri in 1015. The town is mentioned as an episcopal centre in 1019 in a record by Basil II. Two important uprisings against Byzantine rule took place in the Bitola area in 1040 and 1072. After the Bulgarian state was restored in the late 12th century, Bitola was incorporated under the rule of Tsar [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]]. It was conquered again by Byzantium at the end of the 13th century, but it became part of [[Serbia]] in the first half of the 14th century, after the conquests of [[Stefan Dušan]].

As a military, political and cultural center, Bitola played a very important role in the life of the medieval society in the region, prior to the Ottoman conquest in the mid-14th century. On the eve of the Ottoman conquest, Bitola (Monastir in Ottoman Turkish) experienced great growth with its well-established trading links all over the Balkan Peninsula, especially with big economic centers like [[Constantinople]], [[Thessalonica]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] and [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]. Caravans of various goods moved to and from Bitola.

From 1382 to 1912, Manastır (now Bitola) was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Fierce battles took place near the city during the arrival of Ottoman forces. Ottoman rule was completely established after the death of [[Prince Marko]] in 1395 when Ottoman Empire established the [[Sanjak of Ohrid]] as a part of the [[Rumelia Eyalet]] and one of earliest established sanjaks in Europe.<ref>{{Citation |last= Stojanovski |first=Aleksandar  |authorlink=Aleksandar Stojanovski |title=Makedonija vo turskoto srednovekovie : od krajot na XIV--početokot na XVIII vek |url=http://books.google.rs/books?id=ND4yAAAAIAAJ&q=%22%D0%9E%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%9F%D0%B0%D0%BA%22&dq=%22%D0%9E%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%9F%D0%B0%D0%BA%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tST2TtaHM8fe4QSpp8yNCA&redir_esc=y  |accessdate= 24 December 2011 |year= 1989 |publisher= Kultura |location= Skopje |language= Macedonian |oclc=21875410 |page= 49 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= Овој санџак исто така е еден од најстарите санџаци во Румелискиот беглербеглак}}</ref> Before it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1395 its initial territory belonged to the realm of [[Prince Marko]].<ref>{{Citation |last= Stojanovski |first=Aleksandar  |authorlink=Aleksandar Stojanovski |title=Makedonija vo turskoto srednovekovie : od krajot na XIV--početokot na XVIII vek |url=http://books.google.rs/books?id=ND4yAAAAIAAJ&q=%22%D0%9E%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%9F%D0%B0%D0%BA%22&dq=%22%D0%9E%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%9F%D0%B0%D0%BA%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tST2TtaHM8fe4QSpp8yNCA&redir_esc=y  |accessdate= 24 December 2011 |year= 1989 |publisher= Kultura |location= Skopje |language= Macedonian |oclc=21875410 |page= 49 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=  ОХРИДСКИ САНЏАК (Liva i Ohri): Овој санџак исто така е еден од најстарите санџаци во Румелискиот беглербеглак.

For several centuries, Turks were a majority in this city, while the villages were populated mostly with Slavs. [[Evliya Çelebi]] says in his ''[[Seyahatname|Book of Travels]]'' that the city had 70 mosques, several coffee-tea rooms, a [[bazaar]] (market) with iron gates and 900 shops. Manastır became a [[sanjak]] centre in the [[Rumelia Eyalet]] (Ottoman province).

After the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Austro-Ottoman wars]], the trade development and the overall thriving of the city was stifled. But in the late 19th century, it again it became the second-biggest city in the wider southern Balkan region after [[Salonica]]. The city is also known as "city of consuls", because 12 diplomatic consuls resided here from 1878 to 1913.

In 1874, Manastır became the center of [[Monastir Vilayet]] which included the sanjaks of [[Sanjak of Dibra|Debra]], [[Servia, Greece|Serfidze]], [[Sanjak of Elbasan|Elbasan]], Manastır (Bitola), [[Korçë|Görice]] and towns of [[Kicevo|Kırcaova]], [[Prilep|Pirlepe]], [[Florina]], [[Kastoria|Kesriye]] and [[Grevena]].

Traditionally a strong trading center, Bitola is also known as "the city of the consuls". At one time during the Ottoman rule, Bitola had consulates from twelve countries. During the same period, there were a number of prestigious schools in the city, including a military academy that, among others, was attended by the famous Turkish reformer [[Kemal Atatürk]]. Bitola was also the headquarters of many cultural organizations that were established at that time.
[[File:Bitola 05.JPG|thumb|left|Typical neoclassical architecture from the 19th century]]

There are opposing ethnographic data from that period, but it appears that no specific ethnic or religious group could claim an absolute majority of the population. According to the [http://www.univ.trieste.it/~storia/corsi/Dogo/tabelle/popolaz-ottomana1911.jpg 1911 Ottoman census], [[Greeks]] were the largest Christian population in the vilayet, with 740,000 Greeks, 517,000 Bulgarians and 1,061,000 Muslims in the vilayets of Selanik (Thessaloniki) and Manastır. However, it should be noted that the basis of the Ottoman censuses was the millet system. People were assigned an ethnicity according to their religion. So all Sunni Muslims were categorised as Turks, although many of them were [[Albanians]], and all members of the Greek Orthodox church as Greeks, although their numbers included a vast majority of [[Aromanians]], South Albanians,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/9/6/6/19669/19669.txt |last=Durham M. |first=Edith |title= Twenty Years Of Balkan Tangle |publisher=Gutenberg.org}}</ref><ref>"There was a large "Greek" population, both in town and country, but of these a very large proportion were Vlachs, many were South CHAPTER EIGHT 68Albanians, others were Slavs. Few probably were genuine Greeks.

Bitola’s population itself was very various. It numbered some 50,000 at the end of the 19th century. There were around 7,000 Aromanians most of whom fully embraced the Hellenist ideas, although many of them joined the Romanian idea. Bitola also had significant Muslim population - 11,000 (Turks, Roma, and Albanians) as well Jewish commununity - 5,200. The Slavic-speakers were divided between the Bulgarian Exarchate - 8,000, and the Greek Patriarchate - 6,300.<ref>Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, ISBN 0810862956, pp. 26-27.</ref>

In 1894, Manastır was connected with [[Salonika|Selanik]] by train. The first motion picture made in the Balkans was recorded by the [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] [[Manakis brothers]] in Manastır in 1903. In their honour, the annual Manaki Brothers International Film Camera Festival is held in modern Bitola.

In November 1905, the [[Secret Committee for the Liberation of Albania]], a secret organization to fight for the liberation of [[Albania]] from the Ottoman Empire, was founded by [[Bajo Topulli]] and other Albanian nationalists and intellectuals.<ref name="Elsie2010">{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&pg=PA449|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=30 March 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6|page=449}}</ref> Three years later, the [[Congress of Manastir]] of 1908 which defined the modern [[Albanian alphabet]] was held in the city.<ref name="Campbell2000">{{cite book|first=George L. |last=Campbell|title=Compendium of the World's Languages: Abaza to Kurdish|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYvPvqO2J6wC&pg=PA50|accessdate=29 May 2012|year=2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-20296-1|page=50}}</ref>

===Ilinden Uprising===
[[File:Bitola.1914.jpg|thumb|Street in Bitola in 1914]]

The Bitola region was a stronghold of the [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising|Ilinden Uprising]]. The uprising was started as decided in 1903 in Thessaloniki by the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO).  The uprising in the Bitola region was planned in [[Smilevo]] village in May 1903. The battles were fought in the villages of Bistrica, Rakovo, Buf, Skocivir, Paralovo, Brod, Novaci, Smilevo, Gjavato, Capari and others. Smilevo was defended by 600 rebels led by [[Dame Gruev]] and [[Georgi Sugarev]], but when they were defeated, villages were burned.

===Balkan wars===
In 1912, [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Greece]] fought the Ottomans in the [[First Balkan War]]. After victory at [[Battle of Sarantaporo]], [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]] of Greek troops advanced towards Manastir (Monastir), but was defeated by [[VI Corps (Ottoman Empire|6th Corps]] of Ottoman ones at [[Battle of Sorovich]], led to Serbian occupiation of it after [[Battle of Monastir]]. According to the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1913]], the region of Macedonia was divided in 3 parts among Greeks, Serbs and Bulgarians. Monastir was to be in Bulgaria, according to a pre-war alliance agreement between Bulgaria and Serbia. But the Serbian army entered the city in 19 November 1912 and refused to hand it to Bulgaria. From that moment, the city started to lose its importance and the population started rapidly decreasing, emigrating outside Macedonia and to the [[New World]]. Also Serbians renamed it as "Bitola".

[[File:Vivat-bander - 1915-12-04 - Monastir by O. R. Bossert.jpg|thumb|80px|left|German [[Vivat ribbons|Vivat ribbon]] commemorating the taking of Monastir by Bulgarian forces in 1915]]

===World War I===
During [[World War I]] Bitola was on the Thessaloniki front line. In 1915 Bulgarian forces took the city in 21 November 1915 and the Serb forces were forced to either surrender or try a dangerous escape through the Albanian mountains. In 19 November 1916, Bitola was occupied by the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], which entered the city from the South, fighting the Bulgarian army. Bitola was divided into French, Russian, Italian and Serbian regions, under the command of French general [[Maurice Sarrail]]. Until Bulgaria's surrender in late autumn 1918, Bitola remained a front line city and was almost every day bombarded by airplanes and battery and suffered almost total destruction.

===World War II===
During the [[World War II]] (1941–1945), the Germans (in 9 April 1941) and later Bulgarians (in 18 April 1941) took control of the city. But in September 1944, Bulgaria switched sides in the war and withdrew from Yugoslavia, and Bitola was freed by Macedonian pro-[[Titoism|Tito]]ist Partisans. On 4 November, the 7th Macedonian Liberation Brigade entered Bitola victoriously. After the end of the war, a Macedonian state was established for the first time in modern history, within Yugoslavia. This had cost about 25,000 human lives. In 1945, the first Gymnasium (named "[[Josip Broz Tito]]") to use the Macedonian language, was opened in Bitola.

===Jewish community===
{{See also|History of the Jews in the Republic of Macedonia|History of the Jews in Monastir}}

After the [[Alhambra decree|Expulsion of 1492]], [[Sephardi Jews|Spanish-speaking Jews]], harassed and persecuted by the [[Inquisition]], were invited by [[Sultan Bayezid II]] to the Ottoman territories and arrived in waves from the Iberian peninsula ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]). A majority settled in [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]], but a large community grew in Monastir and made up over ten percent of the city's population in 1900. The local Jewish population referred to themselves as ''[[Monastirli]]'', and a Monastirli synagogue exists to this day in modern [[Thessaloniki]].<ref>[http://www.cassorla.net/Families.html Families of Monastir]</ref>

There was little evidence of anti-Semitism among other local communities. The Jews and the [[Aromanians]] were the only communities who did not make a national claim on Macedonian territory and were generally seen as neutral in these disputes.

Most Jews of Monastir were murdered during [[the Holocaust]], and at present none remain in the city.<ref>[http://www.sephardicstudies.org/monastir1839-1943.html "Last Century of a Sephardic Community, The Jews of Monastir, 1839-1943", by Mark Cohen]</ref>

Many descendants of the Jewish community of Monastir made their way during the 20th century to the [[United States]] in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, and [[Rochester, New York]], and to [[Santiago de Chile]], [[Chile]].<ref>http://jadashot.org/nuestra-historia.html</ref>

==Main sights==
The city has many historical building dating from many historical periods. The most notable ones are from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman age]], but there are some from the more recent past.

===Širok Sokak===
{{Main|Širok Sokak}}
Širok Sokak ({{lang-mk|Широк Сокак}}, meaning "Wide Alley") is a long [[pedestrian street]] that runs from [[Magnolia Square]] to the City Park.

===Clock Tower===

[[File:Амамот во Битола, сега стоковна куќа.jpg|thumb|[[Turkish bath]]]]
[[File:St. Demetrius Church in Bitola 8.JPG|thumb|left|St. Demetrius Church in Bitola]]

It is unknown when Bitola's [[clock tower]] was built. Written sources from the 16th century mention a clock tower, but it is not clear if it is the same one. Some believe it was built at the same time as St. Dimitrija Church, in 1830. Legend says that the Ottoman authorities collected around 60,000 eggs from nearby villages and mixed them in the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to make the walls stronger.

The tower has a rectangular base and is about 30 meters high. Near the top is a rectangular terrace with an iron fence. On each side of the fence is an iron console construction which holds the lamps for lighting the clock. The clock is on the highest of three levels. The original clock was replaced during World War II with a working one, given by the Nazis because the city had maintained German graves from World War I.
The massive tower is composed of walls, massive spiral stairs, wooden mezzanine constructions, [[pendentive]]s and the dome. During the construction of the tower, the façade was simultaneously decorated with simple stone plastic.

===Church of Saint Demetrius===
The Church of [[Saint Demetrius]] was built in 1830 with voluntary contributions of local merchants and craftsmen. It is plain on the outside, as all churches in the [[Ottoman Empire]] had to be, but of rare beauty inside, lavishly decorated with [[chandelier]]s, a carved bishop throne and an engraved [[iconostasis]]. According to some theories, the iconostasis is a work of the [[Mijaks|Mijak]] engravers. Its most impressive feature is the arc above the imperial quarters with modeled figures of [[Jesus]] and the apostles.

Other engraved wood items include the bishop's throne made in the spirit of Mijak engravers, several [[icon frames]] and five more-recent pillars shaped like thrones. The frescoes originate from two periods: the end of the 19th century, and the end of [[World War I]] to the present. The icons and frescoes were created thanks to voluntary contributions of local businessmen and citizens. The authors of many of the icons had a vast knowledge of iconography schemes of the [[New Testament]]. The icons show a great sense of color, dominated by red, green and ochra shades. The abundance of golden ornaments is noticeable and points to the presence of [[late-Byzantine]] artwork and [[baroque style]]. The icon of Saint Demetrius is signed with the initials "D. A. Z.", showing that it was made by iconographer Dimitar Andonov the [[zograph]] in 1889. There are many other items, including the [[chalice]]s made by local masters, a darohranilka of Russian origin, and several paintings of scenes from the New Testament, brought from Jerusalem by pilgrims.

The opening scenes of the film ''[[The Peacemaker (1997 film)|The Peacemaker]]'' were shot in the "St. Dimitrija" church in Bitola, as well as some ''[[Welcome to Sarajevo]]'' scenes.

===Heraclea Lyncestis===
[[Heraclea Lyncestis]] ({{lang-mk|Хераклеа Линкестис}}) was an important ancient settlement from the [[Hellenistic period]] till the early Middle Ages. It was founded by [[Philip II of Macedon]] by the middle of the 4th century BC. Today, its ruins fall in the southern part of Bitola, {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city center.

===The covered bazaar===
[[File:Bitola.1914 01.jpg|Left|thumb||250px|The Monastir bazaar in 1914]]

Situated near the city centre, the covered [[bazaar]] ({{lang-mk|Bezisten, Безистен}}) is one of the most impressive and oldest buildings in Bitola from the Turkish period. With its numerous cupolas that look like a fortress, with its tree-branch-like inner streets and four big metal doors it is one of the biggest covered markets in the region.

It was built in the 15th century by the Rumelian Beglerbey, the Grand Vizier and the famous donor Kara Daut Pasha Uzuncarsili. Although this object looks very secure, many times during its existence it was robbed and set on fire, but it managed to endure. The Bezisten, from the 15th to the 19th centuries, was rebuilt and many stores, often changing over time, were located there. Most of them were selling textile and other luxurious fabrics. In the same time the Bezisten was a treasury, where in specially made small rooms the money from the whole Rumelian Vilaet was kept, before it was transferred in the royal treasury. In the Bezisten in the 19th century there were a total of 84 stores. Today most of them are contemporary and they sell different types of products, but no matter what the internal transformations, the outer appearance stayed unchanged.

===Ajdar-kadi mosque===
The Ajdar-kadi (Turkish judge) Mosque is one of the most attractive monuments of Islamic architecture in Bitola. It was built in the early 1560s, as the project of the famous architect [[Mimar Sinan]], ordered by the Bitola kadija Ajdar-kadi. Over time, it was abandoned and heavily damaged, but recent restoration and conservation has restored to some extent its original appearance.

===Jeni Mosque===
[[File:2011 Bitola, Meczet Jeni 01.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jeni Mosque]]]]
The [[Jeni Mosque]] is located in the center of the city. It has a square base, topped with a dome. Near the mosque is a minaret, 40 m high. Today, the mosque's rooms house permanent and temporary art exhibitions. Recent archaeological excavations have revealed that it has been built upon an old church.

===Ishak Çelebi Mosque===
The [[Ishak Çelebi Mosque]] is the inheritance of the kadi [[Ishak Çelebi]]. In its spacious yard are several tombs, attractive because of the soft, molded shapes of the sarcophagi.

===Kodža Kadi Mosque===

===The old bazaar===
The old [[bazaar]] ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: ''Стара Чаршија'') is mentioned in a description of the city from the 16th and the 17th centuries. The present [[bezisten]] does not differ much in appearance from the original one. The bezisten had eighty-six shops and four large iron gates. The shops used to sell textiles, and today sell food products.

===Deboj Bath===
The Deboj Bath is a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] bath ([[Turkish bath|hamam]]). It is not known when exactly it was constructed. At one point, it was heavily damaged, but after repairs it regained its original appearance: a beautiful façade, two large domes and several minor ones.
