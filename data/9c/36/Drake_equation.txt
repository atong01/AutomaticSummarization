The '''Drake equation''' is a [[Bayesian]]-derived <ref>http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1112/1112.1506.pdf</ref> [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]] used to arrive at an estimate of the number of active, communicative [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilizations]] in the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]]. The equation sets this number of civilizations, ''N'', in our galaxy for which radio-communication might be possible equal to the mathematical product of (i) the average rate of star formation, ''R<sub>*</sub>'', in our galaxy, (ii) the fraction of formed stars, ''f<sub>p</sub>'', that have planets, (iii) the average number of planets per star that has planets, ''n<sub>e</sub>'', that can potentially support life, (iv) the fraction of those planets, ''f<sub>l</sub>'', that actually develop life, (v) the fraction of planets bearing life on which intelligent, civilized life, ''f<sub>i</sub>'', has developed, (vi) the fraction of these civilizations that have developed communications, ''f<sub>c</sub>'',  i.e., technologies that release detectable signs into space, and (vii) the length of time, ''L'', over which such civilizations release detectable signals, for a combined expression of:
:<math>N = R_{\ast} \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_{\ell} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L</math>
The equation was written in 1961 by [[Frank Drake]] not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations,<ref name='December 2002'>{{cite web | url = http://www.setileague.org/askdr/drake.htm | title = Chapter 3 — Philosophy: "Solving the Drake Equation | accessdate = 2013-04-10 | date = December 2002 | publisher = SETI League}}</ref> but as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).  The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life.<ref name='December 2002'/>  Criticism of the Drake equation follows from the fact that several of its terms are conjectural, the net result being that the error associated with any derived value is very large such that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions. A consistent reply to these critiques is that the formalism was intended to stimulate dialogue, indeed, that this was Drake's original intent.

==History==
In September 1959, physicists [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] and [[Philip Morrison]] published an article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' with the provocative title "Searching for Interstellar Communications."<ref name='Cocconi 1959'>

}}</ref> Cocconi and Morrison argued that [[radio telescope]]s had become sensitive enough to pick up transmissions that might be broadcast into space by civilizations orbiting other stars. Such messages, they suggested, might be transmitted at a [[wavelength]] of 21 centimeters (1,420.4 [[Hertz|megahertz]]). This is the wavelength of radio emission by neutral [[hydrogen]], the most common element in the universe, and they reasoned that other intelligences might see this as a logical landmark in the [[radio spectrum]].

Two months later, Harvard University astronomy professor [[Harlow Shapley]] speculated on the number of inhabited planets in the universe, saying "The universe has 10 million, million, million suns (10 followed by 18 zeros) similar to our own. One in a million has planets around it. Only one in a million million has the right combination of chemicals, temperature, water, days and nights to support planetary life as we know it. This calculation arrives at the estimated figure of 100 million worlds where life has been forged by evolution."<ref name="SydneyMorningHerald">

Seven months after Cocconi and Morrison published their article, Drake made the first systematic search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligent beings. Using the 25 meter dish of the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]], Drake monitored two nearby Sun-like stars: [[Epsilon Eridani]] and [[Tau Ceti]]. In this project, which he called [[Project Ozma]], he slowly scanned frequencies close to the 21&nbsp;cm wavelength for six hours a day from April to July 1960.<ref name='history'/> The project was well designed, inexpensive, and simple by today's standards. It was also unsuccessful.

Soon thereafter, Drake hosted a "[[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]" meeting on detecting their radio signals. The meeting was held at the Green Bank facility in 1961. The equation that bears Drake's name arose out of his preparations for the meeting.<ref>

<blockquote> As I planned the meeting, I realized a few day[s] ahead of time we needed an agenda. And so I wrote down all the things you needed to know to predict how hard it's going to be to detect extraterrestrial life. And looking at them it became pretty evident that if you multiplied all these together, you got a number, N, which is the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy. This was aimed at the radio search, and not to search for primordial or primitive life forms.  —Frank Drake.

Within the limits of our existing technology, any practical search for distant intelligent life must necessarily be a search for some manifestation of a distant technology. After about 50 years, the Drake equation is still of seminal importance because it is a 'road map' of what we need to learn in order to solve this fundamental existential question.<ref name='Burchell'/> It also formed the backbone of [[astrobiology]] as a science; although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with [[hypotheses]] that fit firmly into existing [[Theory#Science|scientific theories]]. Some 50 years of SETI have failed to find anything, even though radio telescopes, receiver techniques, and computational abilities have improved enormously since the early 1960s, but it has been discovered, at least, that our galaxy is not teeming with very powerful alien transmitters continuously broadcasting near the 21&nbsp;cm hydrogen frequency. No one could say this in 1961.<ref>[http://www.astronomynow.com/news/n1004/SETI/ SETI: A celebration of the first 50 years]. Keith Cooper. ''Astronomy Now''. 2000</ref>

==Modifications==
As many observers have pointed out, the Drake equation is a very simple model that does not include potentially relevant parameters,<ref>

Others note that the Drake equation ignores many concepts that might be relevant to the odds of contacting other civilizations.  For example, [[David Brin]] states: "The Drake equation merely speaks of the number of sites at which ETIs spontaneously arise. The equation says nothing directly about the contact cross-section between an ETIS and contemporary human society".<ref name="GS">

 |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]
 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=283–309
 |bibcode=1983QJRAS..24..283B
}}</ref>  Because it is the contact cross-section that is of interest to the SETI community, many additional factors and modifications of the Drake equation have been proposed.

;Colonization
It has been proposed to generalize the Drake equation to include additional effects of alien civilizations colonizing other [[star system]]s. Each original site expands with an expansion velocity ''v'', and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime ''L''.  The result is a more complex set of 3 equations.<ref name="GS"/>

;Reappearance factor
The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by ''how many times'' an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next [[Sociocultural evolution|civilization to evolve]]. Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if ''n''<sub>''r''</sub> is the average number of times a new civilization ''re''appears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be (1+''n''<sub>''r''</sub>), which is the actual ''reappearance factor'' added to the equation.

The factor depends on what generally is the cause of [[civilization extinction]]. If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a [[nuclear winter]], then ''n''<sub>''r''</sub> may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as [[stellar evolution]], then ''n''<sub>''r''</sub> may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for ''f''<sub>ℓ</sub>, that is, ''how many times'' life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.

;METI factor
[[Aleksandr Leonidovich Zaitsev|Alexander Zaitsev]] said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) to the classical Drake equation.<ref>
{{cite web
 |last=Zaitsev |first=A.
 |date=May 2005
 |title=The Drake Equation: Adding a METI Factor
 |url=http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&sr/irm/Drake_equation.html
 |publisher=[[SETI League]]
 |accessdate=2013-04-20
}}</ref> He defined the factor as "the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness", or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.

The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.

;Biogenic gases
Astronomer [[Sara Seager]] proposed a revised equation that focuses on the search for planets with biosignature gases. These gases are produced by living organisms that can accumulate in a planet atmosphere to levels that can be detected with remote space telescopes.<ref name=equation>[http://www.space.com/22648-drake-equation-alien-life-seager.html?cid=51463011558824 The Drake Equation Revisited: Interview with Planet Hunter Sara Seager] Devin Powell, ''Astrobiology Magazine''  4 September 2013.</ref>

The Seager equation looks like this:<ref name=equation />{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The rendering of the equation here is slightly modified for clarity of presentation from the rendering in the cited source.<ref name=equation />}}
<math display=block>N = N_**F_Q*F_\text{HZ}*F_O*F_L*F_S</math>
Where:

:N = the number of planets with detectable signs of life
:N{{sub|*}} = the number of stars observed
:F{{sub|Q}} = the fraction of stars that are quiet
:F{{sub|HZ}} = the fraction of stars with rocky planets in the habitable zone
:F{{sub|O}} = the fraction of those planets that can be observed
:F{{sub|L}} = the fraction that have life
:F{{sub|S}} = the fraction on which life produces a detectable signature gas

Seager stresses, “We’re not throwing out the Drake Equation, which is really a different topic,” explaining, “Since Drake came up with the equation, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets. We as a community have had our views revolutionized as to what could possibly be out there. And now we have a real question on our hands, one that’s not related to intelligent life: Can we detect any signs of life in any way in the very near future?”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/what-a-brand-new-equation-reveals-about-our-odds-of-fin-531575395|title=A New Equation Reveals Our Exact Odds of Finding Alien Life|publisher=[http://io9.com/ io9.com]}}</ref>

==Estimates==
===Original estimates===
There is considerable disagreement on the values of these parameters, but the 'educated guesses' used by Drake and his colleagues in 1961 were:<ref>

}} Note: This reference has a table of 1961 values, claimed to be taken from Drake & Sobel, but these differ from the book.</ref> 
* ''R''<sub>*</sub> = 1/year (1 star formed per year, on the average over the life of the galaxy; this was regarded as conservative)
* ''f''<sub>p</sub> = 0.2-0.5 (one fifth to one half of all stars formed will have planets)
* ''n''<sub>e</sub> = 1-5 (stars with planets will have between 1 and 5 planets capable of developing life)
* ''f''<sub>l</sub> = 1 (100% of these planets will develop life)
* ''f''<sub>i</sub> = 1 (100% of which will develop intelligent life)
* ''f''<sub>c</sub> = 0.1-0.2 (10-20% of which will be able to communicate)
* ''L'' = 1000-100,000,000 years (which will last somewhere between 1000 and 100,000,000 years)

Inserting the above minimum numbers into the equation gives a minimum N of 20. Inserting the maximum numbers gives a maximum of 50,000,000. Drake states that given the uncertainties, the original meeting concluded that ''N ≈ L'', and there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

:The authors of the [[rare Earth hypothesis]] propose a number of additional constraints on habitability for planets, including being in galactic zones with suitably low radiation, high star metallicity, and low enough density to avoid excessive asteroid bombardment.  They also propose that it is necessary to have a planetary system with large gas giants which provide bombardment protection without a [[hot Jupiter]]; and a planet with [[plate tectonic]]s, a large moon that creates tidal pools, and moderate [[axial tilt]] to generate seasonal variation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ward |first1=Peter D. |last2=Brownlee |first2=Donald |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus Books (Springer Verlag) |date=2000 |isbn=0-387-98701-0 |ref=harv}}</ref>

====Fraction of the above that actually go on to develop life, ''f<sub>l</sub>''====
:Geological evidence from the Earth suggests that ''f''<sub>l</sub> may be high; life on Earth appears to have begun around the same time as favorable conditions arose, suggesting that [[abiogenesis]] may be relatively common once conditions are right. However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains [[anthropic bias]], as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical [[hypothesis testing]] standpoint, there are zero [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]], permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life were to be found on [[life on Mars|Mars]] that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for ''f''<sub>l</sub> close to one. While this would improve the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.

:Countering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth — that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin. If abiogenesis were more common it would be speculated to have occurred more than once on the Earth.  Scientists have searched for this by looking for [[bacteria]] that are unrelated to other life on Earth, but none have been found yet.<ref>

:In addition, while it appears that life developed soon after the formation of Earth, the [[Cambrian explosion]], in which a large variety of multicellular life forms came into being, occurred a considerable amount of time after the formation of Earth, which suggests the possibility that special conditions were necessary. Some scenarios such as the [[Snowball Earth]] or research into the [[extinction events]] have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile. Research on any past [[life on Mars]] is relevant since a discovery that life did form on Mars but ceased to exist might raise our estimate of f<sub>l</sub> but would indicate that in half the known cases, intelligent life did not develop.

:This model also has a large [[anthropic bias]] and there are still zero [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]]. Note that the capacity and willingness to participate in extraterrestrial communication has come relatively recently, with the Earth having only an estimated 100,000 year history of intelligent human life, and less than a century of technological ability.

:Estimates of ''f''<sub>i</sub> have been affected by discoveries that the Solar System's orbit is circular in the galaxy, at such a distance that it remains out of the spiral arms for tens of millions of years (evading radiation from [[nova]]e). Also, Earth's large moon may aid the evolution of life by stabilizing the planet's axis of rotation.{{or|date=October 2015}}

It could also be argued from Michael Shermer's results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including ''reappearance number'', this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the end result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the ''reappearance number'' rather than increase in ''L'', stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures. Furthermore, since none could communicate over interstellar space, the method of comparing with historical civilizations could be regarded as invalid.

:[[David Grinspoon]] has argued that once a civilization has developed enough, it might overcome all threats to its survival. It will then last for an indefinite period of time, making the value for ''L'' potentially billions of years. If this is the case, then he proposes that the Milky Way galaxy may have been steadily accumulating advanced civilizations since it formed.<ref name="David Grinspoon 2004">

This has the advantage that ''T'' would be a relatively easy to discover number, as it would simply be some fraction of the age of the universe.

:The astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] speculated that all of the terms, except for the lifetime of a civilization, are relatively high and the determining factor in whether there are large or small numbers of civilizations in the universe is the civilization lifetime, or in other words, the ability of technological civilizations to avoid self-destruction.

==Criticism==
Criticism of the Drake equation follows mostly from the observation that several terms in the equation are largely or entirely based on conjecture.  Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around our understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics.  No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known.  The net result is that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind, and the resulting margin of error is huge, far beyond what some consider acceptable or meaningful.<ref>

===Fermi paradox===
{{main|Fermi paradox}}
The pessimists' most telling argument in the SETI debate stems not from theory or conjecture but from an actual observation: the presumed lack of extraterrestrial contact.<ref name='history'/> A civilization lasting for tens of millions of years would have plenty of time to travel anywhere in the galaxy, even at the slow speeds [[100 Year Starship|foreseeable with our own kind of technology]].  Furthermore, no confirmed signs of intelligence elsewhere have been spotted, either in our galaxy or the more than 80 billion other galaxies of the [[observable universe]]. According to this line of thinking, the tendency to fill up all available territory seems to be a universal trait of living things, so the Earth should have already been colonized, or at least visited, but no evidence of this exists.  Hence Fermi's question "Where is everybody?".<ref name="OSTI-19850301">

}}</ref> In terms of the Drake Equation, the explanations can be divided into three classes:

*Few intelligent civilizations ever arise.  This is an argument that at least one of the first few terms, <math>R^{\ast} \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_{\ell} \cdot f_i </math>, has a low value.  The most common suspect is <math>f_i</math>, but explanations such as the rare Earth Hypothesis argue that <math>n_e</math> is the small term.
*Intelligent civilizations exist, but we see no evidence, meaning <math>f_c</math> is small.  Typical arguments include [[Fermi paradox#Intelligent civilizations are too far apart in space or time|that civilizations are too far apart]], [[Fermi paradox#It is too expensive to spread physically throughout the galaxy|it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy]], [[Fermi paradox#Civilizations broadcast detectable radio signals only for a brief period of time|civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time]], [[Fermi paradox#It is dangerous to communicate|it is dangerous to communicate]], and many others.
*The lifetime of intelligent civilizations is short, meaning the value of <math>L</math> is small.  Drake suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, and he further speculated that the lack of evidence of such civilizations may be because technological civilizations tend to disappear rather quickly.  Typical explanations include [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself]], [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others]], [[Fermi paradox#They tend to experience a technological singularity|they tend to experience a technological singularity]], and others.

These lines of reasoning lead to the [[Great Filter]] hypothesis,<ref>

According to this view, either it is very hard for intelligent life to arise, or the lifetime of such civilizations, or the period of time they reveal their existence, must be relatively short.

==In fiction and popular culture==
* [[Frederik Pohl]]'s [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story|Hugo award]]-winning "[[Fermi and Frost]]", cites a paradox as evidence for the short lifetime of technical civilizations—that is, the possibility that once a civilization develops the power to destroy itself (perhaps by [[nuclear warfare]]), it does. 
*Optimistic results of the equation along with unobserved extraterrestrials also serves as backdrop for humorous suggestions such as [[Terry Bisson]]'s classic short story "[[They're Made Out of Meat]]," that there are many extraterrestrial civilizations but that they are deliberately ignoring humanity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baetzler.de/humor/meat_beings.html |title=They're made out of Meat, by Hugo and Nebula Winner Terry Bisson |publisher=Baetzler.de |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref>
* The equation was cited by [[Gene Roddenberry]] as supporting the multiplicity of inhabited planets shown in ''[[Star Trek]],'' the television show he created.  However, Roddenberry did not have the equation with him, and he was forced to "invent" it for his original proposal.<ref>''The Making of Star Trek'' by Stephen E. Whitfield and Gene Roddenberry, Ballantine Books, N. Y., 1968</ref> The invented equation created by Roddenberry is:
::<math>Ff^2 (MgE)-C^1 Ri^1 ~ \cdot ~ M=L/So\ </math>
:Drake has gently pointed out, however, that a number raised to the first power is merely the number itself.  A poster with both versions of the equation was seen in the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[Future's End]]."
* The equation is also cited in [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Sphere (novel)|Sphere]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crichton|first=Michael|title=Sphere|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t4b69z5hs58C|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-81648-1|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=t4b69z5hs58C&pg=PA28 &q=drake+equation 28]}}</ref>

* [[Alastair Reynolds]]' ''[[Revelation Space]]'' trilogy and short stories focus very much on the Drake equation and the [[Fermi paradox]], using genocidal self-replicating machines as a [[Great Filter|great filter]].
* [[Stephen Baxter]]'s ''[[Manifold Trilogy]]'' explores the Drake equation and the Fermi paradox in three distinct perspectives.
* [[Ian R. MacLeod]]'s 2001 novel "New Light On The Drake Equation" concerns a man who is obsessed by the Drake equation.
* The [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[comic book]] mini-series ''[[Ultimate Secret]]'' has [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Reed Richards]] examining the Drake equation and considering the Fermi paradox. He believes that advanced civilizations destroy themselves. In the story, it turns out that they are also destroyed by [[Gah Lak Tus#Ultimate Gah Lak Tus|Gah Lak Tus]].
* Eleanor Ann Arroway paraphrases the Drake equation several times in the film ''[[Contact (1997 US film)|Contact]]'', using the magnitude of ''N''&nbsp;<sup>*</sup> and its implications on the output value to justify the SETI program.
