Cameroon' s first multiparty legislative and presidential elections were held in 1992 followed by<space/><link><target>municipal</target></link><space/>elections in 1996 and another round of legislative and presidential elections in 1997. Because the government refused to consider opposition demands for an independent election commission, the three major opposition parties boycotted the October 1997 presidential election, which Biya easily won. The leader of one of the opposition parties,<space/><link><target>Bello Bouba Maigari</target></link><space/>of the<space/><link><target>NUDP</target></link>, subsequently joined the government.</paragraph><paragraph>Cameroon has a number of independent newspapers.<space/><link><target>Censorship</target></link><space/>was abolished in 1996, but the government sometimes seizes or suspends newspapers and occasionally arrests<space/><link><target>journalist</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Although a 1990 law authorizes private radio and television stations, the government has not granted any licenses as of March 1998.</paragraph><paragraph>The Cameroonian Government's<space/><link><target>human rights</target></link><space/>record has been improving over the years but remains flawed. There continue to be reported abuses, including beatings of detainees, arbitrary arrests, and illegal searches. The judiciary is frequently corrupt, inefficient, and subject to political influence.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://report.globalintegrity.org/Cameroon/2008'>''Global Integrity Report: Cameroon 2008''</link><space/>Retrieved 2012-02-14.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Worthy of note is the fact that Cameroon is the only country in which two Constitutions are applicable side-by-side. For example, the 1972 Constitution designates the Prime Minister as constitutional successor of the Head of State in case of incapacity, death, resignation or unaccountable absence of the incumbent. Contrarily, the 1996 Constitutional Reform designates the President of the Senate as constitutional successor; but the Senate (provided for by 1996 Reform) does not exist. Apart from increasing the presidential mandate from 5 years to 7 years, very few amendments of the 1996 Constitutional Reform have been applied.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Executive branch</heading><paragraph><template><target>office-table</target></template>|<link><target>President of Cameroon</target><part>President</part></link>|<link><target>Paul Biya</target></link>|<link><target>Cameroon People's Democratic Movement</target></link>|6 November 1982|-|<link><target>Prime Minister of Cameroon</target><part>Prime Minister</part></link>|<link><target>Philmon Yang</target></link>|<link><target>Cameroon People's Democratic Movement</target></link>|30 June 2009|}<link><target>Image:Paul biya and colin powell.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Cameroon President<space/><link><target>Paul Biya</target></link><space/>(right) with<space/><link><target>Colin Powell</target></link></part><part>alt=Colin Powell and Cameroon president Paul Biya, smiling and talking</part></link>The 1972<space/><link><target>constitution</target></link><space/>of the<space/><bold>Republic of Cameroon</bold><space/>as modified by 1996 reforms provides for a strong central government dominated by the executive.
