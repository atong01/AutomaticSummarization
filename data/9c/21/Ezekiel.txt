'''Ezekiel''' ({{IPAc-en|ɨ|ˈ|z|iː|k|i|.|ə|l}}; {{lang-he-n|יְחֶזְקֵאל}}, ''Y'ḥez'qel'', {{IPA-he|jəħezˈqel}}), meaning "May God strengthen him", "God will strengthen" (from {{lang|he|חזק}}, ''ḥazaq'', {{IPA|[ħaˈzaq]}}, literally "to fasten upon", figuratively "strong", and {{lang|he|אל}}, ''el'', {{IPA|[ʔel]}}, literally "God", and so figuratively "The Almighty") is the central protagonist of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

In [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]], Ezekiel is acknowledged as a Hebrew prophet. In [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], he is also viewed as the author of the Book of Ezekiel that reveals prophecies regarding the destruction of Jerusalem, the restoration to the land of Israel and the ''Millennial Temple'' visions, or the [[Third Temple]].

== Life ==
The author of the Book of Ezekiel presents himself as Ezekiel, the son of Buzzi,{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|1:3|KJV|Ezekiel 1:3}} born into a priesthood ([[Kohen]]) lineage<ref>Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews Book X, 5.1.79, 80</ref> of the patrilineal line of [[Ithamar]], and resident of [[Anathoth]]. Apart from identifying himself, the author gives a chronology for the first divine encounter which he will present. He states that it happened "in the thirtieth year",{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|1:1–2|KJV|Ezekiel 1:1, 2}} which can be a reference to his age at the time. In such a case, the approximate year of birth is 622 BC. He also dates the event 5 years after the exile of King of Judah [[Jehoiachin]] by the Babylonians, a recurring dating pattern throughout the book. [[Josephus]] claims that under at the request of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], [[Babylonia]]n armies exiled three thousand [[Jew]]s<ref>Flavius /Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' Book X, 6.3.98</ref>  from Judah, after deposing King Jehoiachin in 598 BC.

== Living in Babylon ==
According to the Bible, Ezekiel and his wife lived on the bank of the [[Chebar River]], in [[Tel Abib]]<ref name="Tel Aviv"/> (''Mound of the Deluge'') where exiles from Judah came to seek his prophetic insights.{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|1:1,3:15|NIV|Ezekiel 1:1,3:15}} There is no mention of him having any offspring. Only that his wife died rather young, in the ninth year of exile, when Ezekiel was 34 years of age.{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|24:1,18|NIV|Ezekiel 24:1, 18}}

=== Prophetic career ===
Ezekiel describes his calling to be a [[prophet]] by going into great detail about his encounter with [[Yahweh|God]] and four living creatures or [[Cherub]]im with four wheels that stayed beside the creatures.{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|1|NIV|Ezekiel 1}} For the next five years he incessantly prophesied and acted out the destruction of [[City of David|Jerusalem]] and its temple, which was met with some opposition. However, Ezekiel and his contemporaries like [[Jeremiah]], another prophet who was living in Jerusalem at that time, witnessed the fulfillment of their prophecies when Jerusalem was finally sacked by the Babylonians.  The date of the sacking, 587 BC,{{Cn|date=August 2013}} is confirmed by Babylonian [[cuneiform]] records discovered by archeologists. Ezekiel was 50 years old when he began to have visions of a new ''Temple''. He served as a prophet for at least 22 years until, according to {{Cn|date=September 2013}}, Ezekiel last experienced an encounter with God in April 570 BC.{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|29:17|NIV|Ezekiel 29:16}} His time of death has not been recorded.

== World views ==

=== Jewish tradition ===
[[Image:Yad Vashem Memorial to survivors by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|240px|Monument to [[Holocaust survivors]] at [[Yad Vashem]] in [[Jerusalem]]. The quote is Ezekiel 37:14.]]
Ezekiel, like [[Jeremiah]], is said by [[Talmud]]<ref>(Meg. 14b)</ref> and [[Midrash]]<ref>([[Sifri]], Num. 78)</ref> to have been a descendant of [[Joshua]] by his marriage with the [[proselyte]] [[Rahab]].  Some statements found in rabbinic literature{{Who|date=May 2009}} (Radak – R. David Kimkhi – in his commentary on Ezekiel 1:3, based on Targum Yerushalmi) posits that Ezekiel was the son of Jeremiah, who was (also) called "Buzi" because he was despised by the Jews.

Ezekiel was said to be already active as a prophet while in the Land of Israel, and he retained this gift when he was exiled with Jehoiachin and the nobles of the country to Babylon.<ref>([[Josephus]], ''Ant.'' x. 6, § 3: "while he was still a boy"; comp. Rashi on Sanh. 92b, above)</ref>

Rava states in the Babylonian Talmud that although Ezekiel describes the appearance of the throne of God ([[Merkabah]]), this is not because he had seen more than the prophet [[Isaiah]], but rather because the latter was more accustomed to such visions; for the relation of the two prophets is that of a courtier to a peasant, the latter of whom would always describe a royal court more floridly than the former, to whom such things would be familiar.<ref>(Ḥag. 13b)</ref> Ezekiel, like all the other prophets, has beheld only a blurred reflection of the divine majesty, just as a poor mirror reflects objects only imperfectly.<ref>Midrash Lev. Rabbah i. 14, toward the end</ref>

According to the [[midrash]] ''[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah|Canticles Rabbah]]'', it was Ezekiel whom the three pious men, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah (also called [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] in the Bible) asked for advice as to whether they should resist Nebuchadnezzar's command and choose death by fire rather than worship his [[idolatry|idol]]. At first God revealed to the prophet that they could not hope for a miraculous rescue; whereupon the prophet was greatly grieved, since these three men constituted the "remnant of Judah". But after they had left the house of the prophet, fully determined to sacrifice their lives to God, Ezekiel received this revelation: "Thou dost believe indeed that I will abandon them. That shall not happen; but do thou let them carry out their intention according to their pious dictates, and tell them nothing".<ref>(Midrash Canticles Rabbah vii. 8)</ref>

=== Christianity ===
[[Image:Ezekiel-icon.jpg|thumb|[[Russian icon]] of the Prophet Ezekiel holding a [[scroll]] with his prophecy and pointing to the "closed gate" (18th century, [[Iconostasis]] of [[Kizhi]] [[monastery]], Russia)]]

Ezekiel is commemorated as a [[saint]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]—and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]]—on July 23 (for those churches which use the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], July 23 falls on August 5 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]).<ref>Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America - [http://www.goarch.org/chapel/main_view?D=7/23/2014 Online Chapel: 23 July]</ref> Ezekiel is commemorated on August 28 on the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], and on April 10 in the [[Roman Martyrology]].

Certain [[Lutheranism|Lutheran churches]] also celebrate his commemoration on July 20.

The [[Church Fathers]] interpret Ezekiel's vision of the human likeness upon the sapphire throne ({{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:26|HE}}) as a prophecy of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the [[Logos]] from the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary), who in many ancient church [[hymn]]s is called the "living Throne of God".{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Ezekiel's statement about the "closed gate" ({{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|44:2–3|HE}}) is understood{{weasel-inline|date=December 2013}} as another prophecy of the Incarnation: the "gate" signifying the [[Virgin Mary]] and the "prince" referring to Jesus. This is one of the [[lection|readings]] at [[Vespers]] on [[Great Feasts]] of the [[Theotokos]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Catholic]] Churches.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} This imagery is also found in the traditional Catholic Christmas hymn "[[Gaudete]]" and in a saying by [[Saint Bonaventure]], quoted by [[Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori]]: "No one can enter Heaven unless by Mary, as though through a door."<ref>Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori, ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'', Liguori, Mo.: Liguori Publications, c2000, p.&nbsp;623. ISBN 0-7648-0664-5.</ref> The imagery provides the basis for the concept that God gave Mary to mankind as the "Gate of Heaven" (thence the dedication of churches and convents to the Porta Coeli), an idea also laid out in the ''Salve Regina'' ([[Hail Holy Queen]]) prayer.

According to [[Matthew Henry]] a Bible commentator who flourished in the 17th century, Ezekiel is also believed to have been known as Nazaratus Assyrius, a teacher to [[Pythagoras]]. However, [[James Ussher]], in his writings of the [[Ussher chronology]], republished as "The Annals of the World" claims that this is a mistake, basing his opinion on the writings of [[Clemens Alexandrinus]]. However, [[Sir William Smith]], in his "[[Bible Dictionary]]," points out that [[John Selden]], among others, consider it a possibility. In the book "[[Pythagoras]]: Greek philosopher" it states; "Nazaratus, the Assyrian, one of Pythagoras' masters, was supposed to be the prophet Ezekiel, and [[Thomas Stanley (author)|Thomas Stanley]]'s ''Life of Pythagoras'' says that Ezekiel and Pythagoras flourished together.

=== Mormonism ===
Since 1830, [[Latter Day Saint|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has identified the [[Book of Mormon]] with the "record of the stick of [[Ephraim]]"<ref>Doctrine and Covenants, Section 26, Verse 5</ref> ({{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|37:16|HE}}) while the stick of Judah is identified with the [[Bible]].

=== Islamic tradition ===
{{Main| Dhul-Kifl}}
Ezekiel is recognized as a [[prophet]] in [[Islamic]] [[tradition]]. Although not mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] by the name, all [[Muslim]] scholars, both classical<ref>Ibn Kutayba, Ukasha, Tabari, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Ishaq, Masudi, Kisa'i, Balami, Thalabi and many more have all recognized Ezekiel as a prophet</ref> and modern<ref>The largest depth to the figure is given by [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], in his commentary; his commentary's note '''2743''': "If we accept "Dhul al Kifl" to be not an epithet, but an Arabicised form of "Ezekiel", it fits the context, Ezekiel was a prophet in Israel who was carried away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar after his second attack on Jerusalem (about BCE 599). His Book is included in the English Bible (Old Testament). He was chained and bound, and put into prison, and for a time he was dumb. He bore all with patience and constancy, and continued to reprove boldly the evils in Israel. In a burning passage he denounces false leaders in words which are eternally true: "Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken ...... etc. (Ezekiel, 34:2–4)."</ref> have included Ezekiel in lists of the prophets of Islam.

The Qur'an mentions a prophet called [[Dhul-Kifl|Zul-Kifl]]. This prophet is sometimes identified with Ezekiel although Zul-Kifl's identity is disputed. [[Carsten Niebuhr]], in his ''Reisebeschreibung nach Arabian'',<ref>''Reisebeschreibung nach Arabian'' Copenhagen, 1778, ii. 264–266</ref> says he visited [[Al Kifl]] in [[Iraq]], midway between [[Najaf]] and [[Hilla]] and said ''Kifl'' was the [[Arabic]] form of ''Ezekiel''. He further explained in his book that [[Ezekiel's Tomb]] was present in [[Al Kifl]] and that the Jews came to it on pilgrimage. The name ''Zul-Kifl'' would mean "One of double", as ''Zul'' in [[Arabic]] means "double". Some Islamic scholars have likened Ezekiel's mission to the description of Dhul-Kifl. When the exile, monarchy, and state were annihilated, a political and national life was no longer possible. In the absence of a worldly foundation it became necessary to build a spiritual one and Ezekiel performed this mission by observing the signs of the time and deducing his doctrines from them. In conformity with the two parts of his book, his personality and his preaching are alike twofold, and the title ''Zul-Kifl'' means "the one of double" Aside from the possible identification of Zul-Kifl with Ezekiel, [[Muslim]]s have viewed Ezekiel as a prophet, regardless of his identification with Zul-Kifl. 
Ezekiel appears in all [[Muslim]] collections of ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]''.<ref>''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of Ezekiel (Hizqil)''</ref> [[Muslim]] [[exegesis]] further lists Ezekiel's father as [[Buzi]] (''Budhi'') and Ezekiel is given the title ''ibn al-adjus'', denoting "son of the old", as his parents are supposed to have been very old when he was born. A tradition, which resembles that of [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] and [[Samuel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], states that Ezekiel's mother prayed to God in old age for the birth of an offspring and was given Ezekiel as a gift from [[God]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam'', G. Vajda, ''Hizkil''</ref>

== Tomb ==
[[Ezekiel's Tomb|The tomb of Ezekiel]] is a structure located in modern day south [[Iraq]] near [[Al Kifl|Kefil]], believed to be the final resting place of Ezekiel.<ref name=JE>{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=562&letter=E |title=Jewishencyclopedia.com |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref> It has been a place of pilgrimage to both Muslims and Jews alike. After the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Jewish exodus]] from Iraq, Jewish activity in the tomb ceased although a disused synagogue remains in place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/30317/iraq-cleric-slams-plan-turn-jewish-tomb-mosque |title=Iraq Cleric Slams Plan to Turn Jewish Tomb into Mosque |publisher=Thejc.com |date=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref>
