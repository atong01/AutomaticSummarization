On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of around 200.<ref name="Timeline: Early Chicago History"/> Within seven years it would grow to a population of over 4,000. On June 15, 1835, the first public land sales commenced with [[Edmund Dick Taylor]] as U.S. receiver of public moneys. The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4, 1837 and went on to become the fastest growing city in the world for several decades.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/962.html</ref>

As the site of the [[Chicago Portage]],{{sfnp|Keating|2005|p=27}} the city emerged as an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]], opened in 1848, which also marked the opening of the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]]. The canal allowed [[steamboat]]s and [[sailing ship]]s on the [[Great Lakes]] to connect to the [[Mississippi River]].{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=86-98}}{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=30–31}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=24-25}}{{sfnp|Keating|2005|pp=26-29, 35-39}}

A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] from abroad. Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing the American economy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Conzen|first=Michael|title=Global Chicago|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/277.html|work=The Economic Rivalry between St. Louis and Chicago|publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago}}</ref> The [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (established 1848) listed the first ever standardized 'exchange traded' forward contracts, which were called [[futures contract]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmegroup.com/company/history/timeline-of-achievements.html |title=Timeline-of-achievements |publisher=[[CME Group]]|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Chicago-fire1.jpg|thumb|left|An artist's rendering of the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Chicago Fire of 1871]]]]
In the 1850s, Chicago gained national political prominence as the home of Senator [[Stephen Douglas]], the champion of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] and "popular sovereignty" approach to the issue of the spread of slavery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stephen Douglas|url=http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/spcl/excat/douglas5.html|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}</ref> These issues also helped propel another Illinoisan, [[Abraham Lincoln]], to the national stage. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago for the nation's presidency at the [[1860 Republican National Convention]] and went on to defeat Douglas in the general election, setting the stage for the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lincoln nominated for presidency|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lincoln-nominated-for-presidency|work=History Channel|publisher=A&E Television Networks|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}</ref>

To accommodate [[Chicago#Demographics|rapid population growth]] and demand for better sanitation, the city implemented various infrastructural improvements. In February 1856, the [[Ellis S. Chesbrough|Chesbrough]] plan for the building of the United States' first comprehensive sewerage system was approved by the Common Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/chn.html#y1856_m02_d14 |title=Chicago Daily Tribune, Thursday Morning, February 14 |publisher=nike-of-samothrace.net |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref> The project [[Raising of Chicago|raised much of central Chicago]] to a new grade. While raising Chicago, and at first improving the health of the city, the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the [[Chicago River]], then into [[Lake Michigan]], polluting the primary source of fresh water for the city.
The city responded by tunneling two miles (3&nbsp;km) out into Lake Michigan to newly built [[water crib]]s. In 1900, the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat. It reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that the water flowed away from Lake Michigan rather than into it. This project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]] that connects to the [[Illinois River]], which flows into the [[Mississippi River]].{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=15-18, 243-245}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=27-29, 38-43}}{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=154-155, 172-173, 204-205}}

In 1871, the [[Great Chicago Fire]] broke out, destroying an area of about 4 miles long and 1 mile wide, a large section of the city at the time.{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=148-149}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=32-37}}{{sfnp|Lowe|2000|pp=87–97}} Much of the city, including railroads and [[Union Stock Yard|stockyards]], survived intact,{{sfnp|Lowe|2000|p=99}} and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose more modern constructions of steel and stone which would set the precedent for worldwide construction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bruegmann|first=Robert|title=Built Environment of the Chicago Region |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/181.html|work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|accessdate=December 5, 2013|authorlink=Robert Bruegmann|year=2005}}</ref>{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=9-11}} During its rebuilding period, Chicago constructed the world's [[Home Insurance Building|first skyscraper]] in 1885, using [[steel frame|steel-skeleton]] construction.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Allen|first=Frederick E.|date=February 2003 |title=Where They Went to See the Future |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2003/1/2003_1_68.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220103637/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2003/1/2003_1_68.shtml |archivedate=February 20, 2007 |journal= [[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |volume=54 |issue=1 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>{{sfnp|Lowe|2000|pp=121, 129}}

Chicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from [[Europe]] and migrants from the [[Eastern United States]]. Of the total population in 1900, no less than 77% were foreign-born, or born in the United States of foreign parentage.

During the 1870s and 1880s, Chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health. City, and later state laws, that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of cholera, smallpox, and yellow fever were not only passed, but also enforced. These in turn became templates for public health reform in many other cities and states.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Clinton |last=Sandvick |year=2009 |title=Enforcing Medical Licensing in Illinois: 1877–1890 |journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=67–74 |pmid=19562006 |pmc=2701151}}</ref>

The city invested in many large, well-landscaped [[Chicago Park District|municipal parks]], which also included public sanitation facilities. The chief advocate and driving force for improving public health in Chicago was [[John Henry Rauch|Dr. John H. Rauch, M.D.]], who established a plan for Chicago's park system in 1866, created Lincoln Park by closing a cemetery filled with festering, shallow graves, and helped establish a new Chicago Board of Health in 1867 in response to an outbreak of cholera. Ten years later he became the secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board of Health, which carried out most of its activities in Chicago.<ref>{{cite journal |first=William K. |last=Beatty |year=1991 |title=John H.

In the 19th century, Chicago became the nation's railroad center, by 1910 over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of 6 different downtown terminals.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=43-49, 58, 318-319}}<ref>{{Holland-Classic|pages = 66–91}}</ref> In 1883, the standardized system of North American [[time zone]]s was adopted by the general time convention of railway managers in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book| author = United States.

In 1893, Chicago hosted the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] on former marshland at the present location of [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. The Exposition drew 27.5&nbsp;million visitors, and is considered the most influential world's fair in history.<ref>{{cite web| title=Chicago's Rich History| url=http://www.choosechicago.com/attendees/about_chicago/Pages/chicago_history.aspx| publisher=Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau| accessdate=June 10, 2011}}</ref>{{sfnp|Lowe|2000|pp=148-154, 158-169}} The [[University of Chicago]] was founded in 1892 on the same South Side location.

The World War I period and the 1920s also saw a major expansion in industry. The availability of jobs attracted African-Americans from the [[Southern United States]].

The ratification of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States.

In 1924, Chicago was the first [[United States of America|American]] city to have a homosexual-rights organization, the [[Society for Human Rights]].

In March 1937, there was a violent strike by approximately 3,500 drivers for Checker and Yellow Cab Companies which included rioting that went on for weeks. The cab companies hired "strike breakers", and the cab drivers union hired "sluggers" who ragged through the downtown Chicago area looking for cabs and drivers not participating in the strike.<ref>"Arnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years", (Louis A.

On December 2, 1942, physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] conducted the world's first controlled [[Chicago Pile-1|nuclear reaction]] at the [[University of Chicago]] as part of the top-secret [[Manhattan Project]].

===Topography===
[[File:Full chicago skyline.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown and the North Side with beaches lining the waterfront.]]
Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of [[Lake Michigan]]. It is the principal city in [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]] situated in the [[Midwestern United States]] and the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]]. Chicago rests on a [[continental divide]] at the site of the [[Chicago Portage]], connecting the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] [[drainage basin|watersheds]]. The city lies beside huge freshwater Lake Michigan, and two rivers—the [[Chicago River]] in downtown and the [[Calumet River]] in the industrial far South Side—flow entirely or partially through Chicago.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=6-9}}
Chicago's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge [[lake freighter]]s use the city's [[Port of Chicago|Lake Calumet Harbor]] on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect, moderating Chicago's climate; making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Angel|first=Jim|title=State Climatologist Office for Illinois|url=http://www.isws.illinois.edu/atmos/statecli/general/chicago-climate-narrative.htm|work=Illinois State Water Survey|publisher=[[Prairie Research Institute]]|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref>

When Chicago was founded in 1833, most of the early building began around the mouth of the Chicago River, as can be seen on a map of the city's original 58 blocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11175.html|title=Thompson's Plat of 1830|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2004|accessdate=July 3, 2011}}</ref> The overall [[Land grading|grade]] of the city's central, built-up areas, is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise. The average land elevation is {{convert|579|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The lowest points are along the lake shore at {{convert|578|ft|abbr=on}}, while the highest point, at {{convert|672|ft|abbr=on}}, is the morainal ridge of [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]] in the city's far south side.<ref name=neiu>{{cite web|title=Chicago Facts|url=http://www.neiu.edu/~jmhemzac/courses/docs/ofs2005-09%20small2.pdf|work=[[Northeastern Illinois University]]|accessdate=August 28, 2013|page=46}}</ref>

The [[Chicago Loop]] is the central business district, but Chicago is also a city of [[Chicago#Neighborhoods|neighborhoods]]. [[Lake Shore Drive]] runs adjacent to a large portion of Chicago's lakefront. Some of the parks along the waterfront include [[Lincoln Park]], [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]] and [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. Twenty-four public [[Chicago beaches|beaches]] are also found across {{Convert|26|mi|km|0}} of the waterfront.<ref name=usabeaches>{{cite news|last=Fulton|first=Jeff|title=Public Beaches in Chicago|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/public-beaches-chicago-53741.html|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref> Landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for [[Navy Pier]], [[Northerly Island]], the [[Museum Campus Chicago|Museum Campus]], and large portions of the [[McCormick Place]] Convention Center. Most of the city's high-rise commercial and residential buildings can be found close to the waterfront.

An informal name for the entire [[Chicago metropolitan area]] is "Chicagoland". There is no precise definition for the term "Chicagoland", but it generally means the city and its suburbs combined together. The [[Chicago Tribune]], which coined the term, includes the city of Chicago, the rest of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], eight nearby Illinois counties: [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake]], [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry]], [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane]], [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]], [[Grundy County, Illinois|Grundy]], [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] and [[Kankakee County, Illinois|Kankakee]], and three counties in [[Indiana]]: [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake]], [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter]] and [[LaPorte County, Indiana|LaPorte]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/communities/ |title=Chicago Tribune Classifieds map of Chicagoland |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref> The Illinois Department of Tourism defines Chicagoland as Cook County without the city of Chicago, and only Lake, DuPage, Kane and Will counties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chicagoland Region|url=http://www.enjoyillinois.com/topSpots/region.aspx?area=chicagoland|work=EnjoyIllinois.com|publisher=Illinois Department of Tourism|accessdate=August 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928043624/http://www.enjoyillinois.com/topSpots/region.aspx?area=chicagoland|archivedate=September 28, 2011}}</ref> The [[Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce]] defines it as all of Cook and DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fast Facts About The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.chicagolandchamber.org/sub/fast_facts.asp|publisher=Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209003914/http://www.chicagolandchamber.org/sub/fast_facts.asp|archivedate=February 9, 2009|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref>

===Streetscape===
{{main| Roads and expressways in Chicago}}
Chicago's streets were laid out in a [[Grid plan|street grid]] that grew from the city's original townsite plat. Streets following the [[Public Land Survey System]] section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections. As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction. The grid's regularity would provide an efficient means to develop new real estate property. A scattering of diagonal streets, many of them originally native American trails, also cross the city (Elston, Milwaukee, Ogden, Lincoln, etc.). Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the [[Burnham Plan|Plan of Chicago]], but only the extension of [[Ogden Avenue (Chicago)|Ogden Avenue]] was ever constructed.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=31, 52-53}}

Most of the city's residential streets tend to have a wide patch of grass and/or trees between the street and the sidewalk itself.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This has the effect of keeping pedestrians walking on the sidewalk further away from the street traffic. Chicago's [[Western Avenue (Chicago)|Western Avenue]] is the longest continuous urban street in the world.<ref name="El-KhouryRobbins2004">{{cite book|author1=Rodolphe El-Khoury|author2=Edward Robbins|title=Shaping the City: Studies in History, Theory and Urban Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dbv-zU6M9WIC&pg=PA60|accessdate=May 9, 2013|date=June 19, 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-26189-0|pages=60–}}</ref> Other famous streets include [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|North Michigan Avenue]], [[State Street (Chicago)|North State Street]], [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark]], and [[Belmont Avenue (Chicago)|Belmont Avenue]].

{{Main|Demographics of Chicago}}
During its first 100 years, Chicago was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. When founded in 1833, fewer than 200 people had settled on what was then the American frontier. By the time of its first census, seven years later, the population had reached over 4,000. Within the span of forty years, the city's population grew from slightly under 30,000 in 1850 to over 1&nbsp;million by 1890. By the close of the 19th century, Chicago was the fifth largest city in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201f.htm |title=Top 10 Cities of the Year 1900 |publisher=Geography.about.com |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref> and the largest of the cities that did not exist at the dawn of the century. Within sixty years of the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Chicago Fire of 1871]], the population went from about 300,000 to over 3 million,<ref>{{cite web

From the last two decades of the 19th century, Chicago was the destination of waves of immigrants from [[Ireland]], Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, including [[Italians]], [[Jews]], [[Poles]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Bosnians]] and [[Czechs]].<ref name="Cohen">Lizabeth Cohen, ''Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919–1939''.

The great majority of American blacks moving to Chicago in these years were clustered in a so‑called "[[Black Belt (region of Chicago)|Black Belt]]" on the city's South Side.<ref name=Cohen /> By 1930, two-thirds of Chicago's African-American population lived in sections of the city which were 90% black in racial composition.<ref name=Cohen /> Chicago's South Side emerged as America's second largest urban black concentration, following New York's [[Harlem]].<ref name=Cohen />

There are several distinctly Chicago sandwiches, among them the [[Italian beef]] sandwich, which is thinly sliced beef slowly simmered in [[au jus]] and served on an Italian roll with sweet peppers or spicy giardiniera. A popular modification is the Combo—an Italian beef sandwich with the addition of an Italian sausage. Another is the [[Maxwell Street Polish]], a grilled or deep-fried [[kielbasa]]&nbsp;— on a hot dog roll, topped with grilled onions, yellow mustard, and hot sport peppers.<ref name="sandwich">{{cite web| last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | title = City of the big sandwiches: Four uncommon Chicago meals on a bun | work=Dining Chicago | publisher=Chicago's Restaurant & Entertainment Guide, Inc. | date = January 22, 2010 | url = http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2010/01/22/city-of-the-big-sandwiches-four-uncommon-chicago-meals-on-a-bun/ | accessdate =June 16, 2010}}</ref>

The annual summer festival, the [[Taste of Chicago]] in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], highlights food in the city with many local restaurants taking part.

A number of well-known chefs have had restaurants in Chicago, including [[Charlie Trotter]], [[Rick Tramonto]], [[Grant Achatz]], and [[Rick Bayless]]. In 2003, ''[[Robb Report]]'' named Chicago the country's "most exceptional dining destination."<ref>{{cite web|title=Robb Report Editors Name Chicago As Country's Finest Dining Destination|url=http://robbreport.com.sg/News-and-Press/Robb-Report-Editors-Name-Chicago-As-Countrys-Finest-Dining-Destination|work=[[Robb Report]]}}</ref>

===Literature===
{{Further|Chicago literature}}

Chicago literature finds its roots in the city's tradition of lucid, direct journalism, lending to a strong tradition of [[social realism]]. In the ''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', [[Northwestern University]] Professor Bill Savage describes Chicago fiction as prose which tries to ''"capture the essence of the city, its spaces and its people."'' The challenge for early writers was that Chicago was a frontier outpost that transformed into a global metropolis in the span of two generations. Narrative fiction of that time, much of it in the style of "high-flown romance" and "genteel realism", needed a new approach to describe the urban social, political, and economic conditions of Chicago.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/448.html Encyclopedia of Chicago, "Fiction."]</ref> Nonetheless, Chicagoans worked hard to create a literary tradition that would stand the test of time,<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/755.html Encyclopedia of Chicago, "Literary Cultures."]</ref> and create a "city of feeling" out of concrete, steel, vast lake, and open prairie.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1390.html Encyclopedia of Chicago, "Literary Images of Chicago"]</ref> Much notable Chicago fiction focuses on the city itself, with social criticism keeping exultation in check.

At least, three short periods in the [[history of Chicago]] have had a lasting influence on [[American Literature]].<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/257.html Encyclopedia of Chicago History, "Chicago Literary Renaissance."]</ref> These include from the time of the [[Great Chicago Fire]] to about 1900, what became known as the Chicago Literary Renaissance in the 1910s and early 1920s, and the period of the [[Great Depression]] through the 1940s.

What would become the influential ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine was founded in 1912 by [[Harriet Monroe]], who was working as an [[art]] [[critic]] for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. The magazine discovered such poets as [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], [[James Merrill]], and [[John Ashbery]].<ref name="ny">Goodyear, Dana, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/02/19/070219fa_fact_goodyear "The Moneyed Muse: What can two hundred million dollars do for poetry?"], article, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', February 19 and 26 double issue, 2007</ref> [[T.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Eliot]]'s first professionally published poem, "[[The Love Song of J.&nbsp;Alfred Prufrock]]", was first published by ''Poetry''. Contributors have included [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Langston Hughes]], and [[Carl Sandburg]], among others. The magazine was instrumental in launching the [[Imagist]] and [[Objectivist poets|Objectivist]] poetic movements.

{{Main|Sports in Chicago}}

Chicago was named the "Best Sports City" in the United States by the ''[[Sporting News]]'' in 1993, 2006, and 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/feed/2010-10/best-sports-city|title=Sweet home Chicago: Best Sports City 2010 |work=[[Sporting News]] |date=October 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}</ref> Along with Boston, Chicago is the only city to continuously host major professional sports since 1871, having only taken 1872 and 1873 off due to the Great Chicago Fire. Additionally, along with Boston, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia, Chicago is one of the six cities in the United States to have won championships in [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|the four major professional sports leagues]] and, along with New York and Los Angeles, is one of three cities to have won soccer championships as well.

The city is home to two [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams: the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the National League (NL), who play in [[Wrigley Field]] on the North Side; and the [[Chicago White Sox]] of the American League (AL), who play in [[U.S. Cellular Field]] on the South Side. Chicago is the only city that has had more than one MLB franchise every year since the AL began in 1901 (New York only hosted one between 1958 and early 1962, and Los Angeles has only done so since 1961). The Cubs are the oldest Major League Baseball team to have never changed their city, one of nine out of the sixteen teams to predate expansion that have not changed cities. They have played in Chicago since 1871, and continuously so since 1874 due to the Great Chicago Fire. They have played more games, have more wins and scored more runs than any other team in Major League baseball since 1876.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ Baseball Reference - MLB Teams and Baseball Encyclopedia]</ref> They have won two World Series titles and are fifth among National League teams with 16 pennants, but have the dubious honor of having the two longest droughts in professional sports: They have not won their sport's title since [[1908 Chicago Cubs season|1908]], and have not participated in a World Series since [[1945 Chicago Cubs season|1945]], both records in their respective rights. The White Sox have played on the South Side continuously since 1901, with all three of their home fields throughout the years being within mere blocks of one another. They have won three World Series titles (1906, 1917, 2005) and six American League pennants, including the first in 1901. The Sox are fifth in the American League in all-time wins, and sixth in pennants.

The [[Chicago Bears]], one of the last two remaining charter members of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), have won nine [[List of NFL champions|NFL Championships]], including [[Super Bowl&nbsp;XX]]. The other remaining charter franchise, the [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]], also started out in the city, but is now known as the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. The Bears have won more games in the history of the NFL than any other team, and only the [[Green Bay Packers]], their longtime rivals, have won more championships. The Bears play their home games at [[Soldier Field]], named after "The men and women of the armed forces". It is located next to the shores of Lake Michigan, on Lake Shore Drive. Soldier Field was an aging stadium and was in dire need of renovation by the end of the 20th century. In 2003, the stadium re-opened after an extensive renovation, which increased the number of luxury boxes and dramatically improved the game day experience for Bears fans. However, because of this renovation, the stadium lost its National Historic Landmark designation on February 17, 2006.

The [[Chicago Bulls]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is one of the most recognized basketball teams in the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} During the 1990s, with [[Michael Jordan]] leading them, the Bulls won six NBA championships in eight seasons.<ref name=bulls_dynasty>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Clare|title=The Bulls Dynasty|url=http://www.nba.com/history/bulls_dynasty.html|work=[[NBA]]|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Markovits|first=Andrei S.|authorlink1=Andrei Markovits|title=Gaming the World: How Sports Are Reshaping Global Politics and Culture|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0-691-13751-X|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2QpA0fGyiIC&lpg=PP1&dq=isbn%3A069113751X&pg=PA89|author2=Rensmann, Lars}}</ref> They also boast the youngest player to win the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]], [[Derrick Rose]], who won it for the [[2010–11 NBA season|2010–11 season]].<ref name="NBA.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2011/news/05/03/mvp-award/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpt1|title=Chicago's Derrick Rose Wins 2010–11 Kia NBA MVP Award|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=May 3, 2011}}</ref>

The [[Chicago Blackhawks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) began play in 1926, and are one of the "[[Original Six]]" teams of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team has won six [[Stanley Cup]]s, including in [[2015 Stanley Cup Finals|2015]]. Both the Bulls and the Blackhawks play at the [[United Center]] on the Near West Side.

The [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club]] is a member of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) and plays at [[Toyota Park]] in suburban [[Bridgeview, Illinois|Bridgeview]], after playing its first eight seasons at [[Soldier Field]]. The Fire have won one league title and four [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S.&nbsp;Open Cups]], since their founding in 1997. In 1994, the United States hosted a successful [[1994 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] with games played at [[Soldier Field]].

The [[Chicago Sky]] is a professional basketball team based in [[Rosemont, Illinois]], playing in the Eastern Conference in the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA). They play home games at the [[Allstate Arena]]. The team was founded before the 2006 WNBA season began. It is owned by Michael J. Alter (principal owner) and Margaret Stender (minority owner).

While six of the eight major franchises have won championships within recent years&nbsp;– the Bears (1985), the Bulls (91, '92, '93, '96, '97, and '98), the White Sox (2005), the Blackhawks (2010, 2013, 2015), the Fire (1998) and the Chicago Wolves (2008)&nbsp;— the Chicago Cubs are known for their drought of over 100 years without a championship (currently 106 years, as of the 2014 MLB season). The last time the Cubs were in a World Series was 1945. Some fans claim the [[Curse of the Billy Goat]] is responsible for the drought.

When Chicago was incorporated in 1837, it chose the motto ''Urbs in Horto'', a [[Latin]] phrase which translates into English as "City in a Garden". Today, the [[Chicago Park District]] consists of more than 570 parks with over {{convert|8000|acre}} of [[municipal park]]land. There are 31 sand [[List of beaches in Chicago, Illinois|beaches]], a plethora of museums, two world-class conservatories, and 50 nature areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/about-us/history/|publisher=[[Chicago Park District]]|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}</ref> [[Lincoln Park]], the largest of the city's parks, covers {{convert|1200|acre}} and has over 20&nbsp;million visitors each year, making it third in the number of visitors after [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], and the [[National Mall and Memorial Parks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{cite web|title=City Park Facts Report|url=http://www.tpl.org/sites/default/files/files_upload/2014_CityParkFacts.pdf|publisher=[[The Trust for Public Land]]|accessdate=September 23, 2014|page=30|date=February 2014}}</ref>

With berths for more than 6,000 boats, the Chicago Park District operates the nation's largest municipal harbor system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harbors|url=http://www.chicagoharbors.info/slip-information/|work=[[Chicago Park District]]|accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> In addition to ongoing beautification and renewal projects for the existing parks, a number of new parks have been added in recent years, such as the [[Ping Tom Memorial Park]] in Chinatown, [[DuSable Park (Chicago)|DuSable Park]] on the Near North Side, and most notably, [[Millennium Park]], which is in the northwestern corner of one of Chicago's oldest parks, [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] in the Chicago Loop.

The wealth of greenspace afforded by Chicago's parks is further augmented by the [[Cook County Forest Preserves]], a network of open spaces containing forest, [[prairie]], [[wetland]], streams, and lakes that are set aside as natural areas which lie along the city's periphery,<ref>{{cite web|title=Forest Preserve District of Cook County|url=http://library.uic.edu/collections/fpdcc|work=[[University of Illinois at Chicago]]|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref> home to both the [[Chicago Botanic Garden]] in [[Glencoe, Illinois|Glencoe]] and the [[Brookfield Zoo]] in [[Brookfield, Illinois|Brookfield]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Affiliates|url=http://fpdcc.com/about/affiliates/|work=[[Forest Preserve District of Cook County]]|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref> In addition, [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]] is one of the city's biggest parks as well; covering nearly {{convert|400|acres|0|abbr=on}}.

The government of the City of Chicago is divided into executive and [[legislature|legislative]] branches. The [[Mayor of Chicago]] is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. In addition to the mayor, Chicago's two other citywide elected officials are the clerk and the treasurer. The [[Chicago City Council|City Council]] is the legislative branch and is made up of 50 aldermen, one elected from each [[wards of the United States|ward]] in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=City Council, Your Ward & Alderman|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/council.html|work=City of Chicago|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref> The council takes official action through the passage of [[local ordinance|ordinances]] and resolutions and approves the city budget.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chicago Government|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/chicagogovt.html|work=City of Chicago|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref>

The [[Chicago Police Department]] provides law enforcement for the City of Chicago and its residents. The [[Chicago Fire Department]] provides fire suppression and emergency medical services for the City of Chicago and its residents. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the [[Cook County Circuit Court]] of the State of Illinois court system, or in the [[Northern District of Illinois]], in the federal system. In the former, the public prosecutor is the Illinois [[State's Attorney]], in the latter, the United States [[District Attorney|Attorney]].

===Politics===
{{Main|Political history of Chicago}}
During much of the last half of the 19th century, Chicago's politics were dominated by a growing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] organization. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, [[anarchism|anarchist]] and labor organizations.<ref>Schneirov 1998, pp 173–174</ref> For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been "[[Red states and blue states|solid blue]]" in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] since 1992. Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayor since 1927, when [[William Hale Thompson|William Thompson]] was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent the rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding. Chicago contains less than 25% of the state's population, but 8 of Illinois' 19 [[United States House of Representatives|U.S.&nbsp;Representatives]] have part of Chicago in their [[Illinois's congressional districts|districts]].

[[Machine politics]] persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large U.S. cities.<ref>Montejano 1998, pp 33–34</ref> During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal "independent" faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of [[Harold Washington]] (in office 1983–1987). From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago was under the leadership of its longest serving mayor, [[Richard M. Daley]], the son of Richard J. Daley. On May 16, 2011, [[Rahm Emanuel]] was sworn in as the 55th mayor of Chicago. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic [[primary election|primary]] vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U.S. House and Illinois State seats. The aldermanic, mayoral, and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed.

====Transit systems====
[[File:Chicago (ILL) Union Station, great Hall, 1925.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chicago Union Station]], opened in 1925, is the third busiest rail terminal in the United States]]
The '''[[Regional Transportation Authority (Illinois)|Regional Transportation Authority]] (RTA)''' coordinates the operation of the three service boards: CTA, Metra, and Pace.

* The '''[[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA)''' handles public transportation in the City of Chicago and a few adjacent suburbs outside of the Chicago city limits. The CTA operates an extensive network of buses and a [[rapid transit]] elevated and subway system known as the [[Chicago "L"|'L']] (for "elevated"), with lines designated by colors. These rapid transit lines also serve both [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway]] and [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]]s. The CTA's rail lines consist of the [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red]], [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue]], [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green]], [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange]], [[Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Brown]], [[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple]], [[Pink Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Pink]], and [[Yellow Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Yellow]] lines. Both the Red and Blue lines offer 24‑hour service which makes Chicago one of a handful of cities around the world (and one of two in the United States, the other being New York City) to offer rail service 24 hours a day, every day of the year, within the city's limits.
* '''[[Metra]]''', the nation's second-most used passenger regional rail network, operates an 11-line [[commuter rail]] service in Chicago and throughout the Chicago suburbs. The [[Metra Electric Line]] shares its trackage with Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District's [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]], which provides commuter service between [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] and Chicago.
* '''[[Pace (transit)|Pace]]''' provides bus and [[paratransit]] service in over 200 surrounding suburbs with some extensions into the city as well. A 2005 study found that one quarter of commuters used public transit.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/13/real_estate/public_transit_commutes/index.htm "New Yorkers are top transit users"], by Les Christie,''CNNmoney.com'', June 29, 2007.

'''[[Greyhound Lines]]''' provides inter-city bus service to and from the city, and Chicago is also the hub for the Midwest network of [[Megabus (North America)]].

'''[[Amtrak]]''' long distance and [[commuter rail]] services originate from [[Union Station (Chicago)|Union Station]]. Chicago is one of the largest hubs of passenger rail service in the nation. The services terminate in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., New York City, [[Indianapolis]], New Orleans, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Seattle]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St.&nbsp;Louis]], [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], Boston, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], Los Angeles, and [[San Antonio]]. An attempt was made in the early 20th century to link Chicago with New York City via the [[Chicago&nbsp;– New York Electric Air Line Railroad]]. Parts of this were built, but it was ultimately never completed.

====Freight rail====
Chicago is the largest hub in the railroad industry.<ref>http://www2.beltrailway.com/about-2/</ref> Six of the seven [[Class I railroad]]s meet in Chicago, with the exception being the [[Kansas City Southern Railway]].<ref>[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ENVIRonment/freightaq/appendixc.htm Appendix C: Regional Freight Transportation Profiles].

U.S. Department of Transportation&nbsp;– Federal Highway Administration (April 2005).</ref> As of 2002, severe freight train congestion caused trains to take as long to get through the Chicago region as it took to get there from the West Coast of the country (about 2 days).<ref>{{cite web|last=Winsor |first=Jeromie |url=http://www.metroplanning.org/articleDetail.asp?objectID=1707 |title=Metropolitan Planning Council |publisher=Metroplanning.org |date=July 14, 2003 |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref> According to U.S. DOT, the volume of imported and exported goods transported via rail to, from, or through Chicago is forecast to increase nearly 150 percent between 2010 and 2040.<ref>{{cite web|title=CREATE Program Benefits Fact Sheets|url=http://www.createprogram.org/benefits.htm|website=CREATE|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> CREATE, the Chicago Region Environmental and Transport Efficiency program, comprises about 70 programs, including crossovers, overpasses and underpasses, that intend to significantly improve the speed of freight movements in the Chicago area.<ref>{{cite web|title=CREATE projects|url=http://www.createprogram.org/projects.htm|website=CREATE|publisher=CREATE.org|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref>

''Airports Council International''.</ref> Both O'Hare and Midway are owned and operated by the City of Chicago. [[Gary/Chicago International Airport]] and [[Chicago Rockford International Airport]], located in [[Gary, Indiana]] and [[Rockford, Illinois]], respectively, can serve as alternate Chicago area airports, however they do not offer as many commercial flights as O'Hare and Midway. In recent years the state of Illinois has been leaning towards [[Proposed Chicago south suburban airport|building an entirely new airport]] in the Illinois suburbs of Chicago.<ref>{{cite news|last=Metsch|first=Steve|title=Top IDOT official says third airport will be built|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/14080173-418/top-idot-official-says-third-airport-will-be-built.html|accessdate=June 11, 2013|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}</ref> The City of Chicago is the world headquarters for [[United Airlines]], the world's third largest airline.

====Port authority====
{{Main|Port of Chicago}}
'''The Port of Chicago''' consists of several major port facilities within the city of Chicago operated by the '''Illinois International Port District''' (formerly known as the '''Chicago Regional Port District'''). The central element of the Port District, '''Calumet Harbor''', is maintained by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Calumet Harbor and River|url=http://www.lrc.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorksProjects/CalumetHarborandRiver.aspx|work=[[US Army Corps of Engineers]]|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}</ref>

* Iroquois Landing Lakefront Terminal: at the mouth of the Calumet River, it includes {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of warehouses and facilities on Lake Michigan with over 780,000 square meters (8,390,000 square feet) of storage.
* Lake Calumet terminal: located at the union of the [[Grand Calumet River]] and [[Little Calumet River]] {{convert|6|mi|km}} inland from Lake Michigan. Includes three transit sheds totaling over 29,000 square meters (315,000 square feet) adjacent to over 900 linear meters (3,000 linear feet) of ship and barge berthing.
* Grain (14&nbsp;million bushels) and bulk liquid (800,000 barrels) storage facilities along [[Lake Calumet]].
* The Illinois International Port district also operates [[Foreign trade zones of the United States|Foreign trade zone]] No.&nbsp;22, which extends {{convert|60|mi|km}} from Chicago's city limits.

===Utilities===
Electricity for most of [[northern Illinois]] is provided by [[Commonwealth Edison]], also known as ComEd. Their service territory borders [[Iroquois County, Illinois|Iroquois County]] to the south, the [[Wisconsin]] border to the north, the [[Iowa]] border to the west and the [[Indiana]] border to the east. In northern Illinois, ComEd (a division of [[Exelon]]) operates the greatest number of nuclear generating plants in any US state. Because of this, ComEd reports indicate that Chicago receives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. Recently, the city started the installation of wind turbines on government buildings with the aim to promote the use of renewable energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |title=IIT.edu |publisher=IIT.edu |date=June 20, 2003 |accessdate=May 4, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605021018/http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |archivedate = June 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentlaw.edu/news/advisory/adv030707.html |title=KentLaw.edu |publisher=KentLaw.edu |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Martin LaMonica Staff Writer, CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/Micro+wind+turbines+are+coming+to+town/2100-11398_3-6037539.html |title='Micro' wind turbines are coming to town &#124; CNET News.com |publisher=news.cnet.com |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref>

Natural Gas is provided by Peoples Gas, a subsidiary of [[Integrys Energy Group]], which is headquartered in Chicago.

Domestic and industrial waste was once incinerated but it is now [[landfill]]ed, mainly in the [[Lake Calumet|Calumet area]]. From 1995 to 2008, the city had a [[blue bag]] program to divert certain refuse from landfills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1322.html |title=Waste Disposal |publisher=Encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}</ref> In the fall of 2007 the city began a pilot program for blue bin recycling similar to that of other cities due to low participation rates in the blue bag program. After completion of the pilot the city will determine whether to roll it out to all wards.
