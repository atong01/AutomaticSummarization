'''Engineering''' is the application of [[mathematics]], [[empirical evidence]] and [[science|scientific]], [[economics|economic]], social, and practical [[knowledge]] in order to [[invention|invent]], [[design]], build, [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintain]], [[Engineering research|research]], and improve [[Structural engineering|structures]], [[machine]]s, [[tool]]s, [[Systems engineering|systems]], [[Part (system)|components]], [[Materials science|materials]], and [[process (engineering)|processes]].

The discipline of engineering is extremely broad, and encompasses a range of more specialized [[List of engineering branches|fields of engineering]], each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied science, [[technology]] and types of application.

The term ''Engineering'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'', meaning "cleverness" and  ''ingeniare'', meaning "to contrive, devise".

==Definition==
The [[American Engineers' Council for Professional Development]] (ECPD, the predecessor of [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology|ABET]])<ref name="ABET History">[http://www.abet.org/History/ ABET History]</ref> has defined "engineering" as:
<blockquote>The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation or safety to life and property.<ref name="ECPD Canons">[http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/26393909&referer=brief_results Engineers' Council for Professional Development.

==History==
{{Main|History of engineering}}
[[File:Grondplan citadel Lille.JPG|thumb|Relief map of the [[Citadel of Lille]], designed in 1668 by [[Vauban]], the foremost military engineer of his age.]]

Engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the wedge, lever,  wheel, and pulley. Each of these inventions is essentially consistent with the modern definition of engineering.

The term ''engineering''  deriving from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to 1300, when an ''engine'er'' (literally, one who operates an ''engine'') originally referred to "a constructor of military engines."<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref> In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, ''i.e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, ''e.g.'', the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].

The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'' (c. 1250), meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."<ref>Origin: 1250–1300; ME engin < AF, OF < L ingenium nature, innate quality, esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.</ref>

Later, as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline, the term [[civil engineering]]<ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/> entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the older discipline of [[military engineering]].

Chinese, Greek and Roman armies employed complex military machines and inventions such as [[artillery]] which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century B.C.,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244231/ancient-Greece/261062/Military-technology Britannica on Greek civilization in the 5th century Military technology] Quote: "The 7th century, by contrast, had witnessed rapid innovations, such as the introduction of the hoplite and the trireme, which still were the basic instruments of war in the 5th." and "But it was the development of artillery that opened an epoch, and this invention did not predate the 4th century.

[[John Smeaton]] was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer, and is often regarded as the "father" of [[civil engineering]]. He was an English [[civil engineer]] responsible for the design of [[bridge]]s, [[canal]]s, [[harbour]]s and [[lighthouse]]s. He was also a capable [[mechanical engineer]] and an eminent [[physicist]]. Smeaton designed the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of '[[hydraulic lime]]' (a form of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. His lighthouse remained in use until 1877 and was dismantled and partially rebuilt at [[Plymouth Hoe]] where it is known as [[Smeaton's Tower]]. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern [[cement]], because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain "hydraulicity" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of [[Portland cement]].

The early stages of [[electrical engineering]] included the experiments of [[Alessandro Volta]] in the 1800s, the experiments of [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]] and others and the invention of the [[electric motor]] in 1872. The theoretical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] (see: [[Maxwell's equations]]) and [[Heinrich Hertz]] in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [[electronics]]. The later inventions of the [[vacuum tube]] and the [[transistor]] further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.<ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/>

Aeronautical engineering deals with [[aircraft design process]] design while [[aerospace engineering]] is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including [[spacecraft]] design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of [[Sir George Cayley]] has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.<ref name="americana">

Only a decade after the successful flights by the [[Wright brothers]], there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in [[World War I]] . Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining [[theoretical physics]] with experiments.

Engineering is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. These disciplines concern themselves with differing areas of engineering work. Although initially an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline, throughout an engineer's career the engineer may become multi-disciplined, having worked in several of the outlined areas. Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hy9WAAAAMAAJ&q=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&dq=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&hl=en&ei=2UkYTff0MZL-ngfesbGMDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA Journal of the British Nuclear Energy Society: Volume 1 British Nuclear Energy Society - 1962 - Snippet view] Quote: In most universities it should be possible to cover the main branches of engineering, i.e. civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering in this way.

* [[Chemical engineering]] – The application of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]], [[microfabrication]], [[fermentation]], and [[Biotechnology|biomolecule production]].
* [[Civil engineering]] – The design and construction of public and private works, such as [[infrastructure]] ([[airports]], [[roads]], [[railways]], water supply and treatment etc.), [[bridge]]s, dams, and buildings.
* [[Electrical engineering]] – The design, study and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems, such as [[electrical circuit]]s, [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[Electric motor|motors]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]]/[[electromechanical]] devices, [[electronic devices]], [[electronic circuits]], [[optical fiber]]s, [[optoelectronic device]]s, [[computer]] systems, [[telecommunications]], instrumentation, controls, and [[electronics]].
* [[Mechanical engineering]] – The design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and [[energy]] systems, [[aerospace]]/[[aircraft]] products, [[weapon systems]], [[transportation]] products, [[Internal combustion engine|engines]], [[gas compressor|compressors]], [[powertrain]]s, [[kinematic chain]]s, vacuum technology, and [[vibration isolation]] equipment.

Beyond these four, a number of other branches are recognized.  Historically, [[naval architecture|naval engineering]] and [[mining engineering]] were major branches.  Modern fields sometimes included as major branches{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} are [[manufacturing engineering]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[corrosion engineering]], [[Instrumentation and control]], [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]], [[Automotive engineering|automotive]], [[computer engineering|computer]], [[electronic engineering|electronic]], [[petroleum engineering|petroleum]], [[systems engineering|systems]], [[audio engineering|audio]], [[software engineering|software]], [[architectural engineering|architectural]], [[agricultural engineering|agricultural]],  [[biosystems engineering|biosystems]], [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]],<ref>Bronzino JD, ed., The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2006, ISBN 0-8493-2121-2</ref> [[Geological engineering|geological]], [[Textile manufacturing|textile]], [[industrial engineering|industrial]], [[materials science|materials]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bensaude-Vincent|first1=Bernadette|title=The construction of a discipline: Materials science in the United States|journal=Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences|date=March 2001|volume=31|issue=2|pages=223–248|doi=10.1525/hsps.2001.31.2.223}}</ref> and [[nuclear engineering|nuclear]]<ref>http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf</ref> engineering.  These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 institutions forming the membership of the UK [[Engineering Council]].

New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches - for example [[Earth Systems Engineering and Management]] involves a wide range of subject areas including [[anthropology]], [[engineering studies]], [[environmental science]], [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]]. A new or emerging area of application will commonly be defined temporarily as a permutation or subset of existing disciplines; there is often gray area as to when a given sub-field warrants classification as a new "branch." One key indicator of such emergence is when major universities start establishing departments and programs in the new field.

For each of these fields there exists considerable overlap, especially in the areas of the application of fundamental sciences to their disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics.

==Practice==
One who practices engineering is called an [[engineer]], and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as [[Professional Engineer]], [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative (DER)|Designated Engineering Representative]], [[Chartered Engineer]], [[Incorporated Engineer]], [[Ingenieur]] or [[European Engineer]].

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Design of a [[turbine]] requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]

Engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find suitable solutions to problems or to make improvements to the status quo. More than ever, engineers are now required to have knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, they may keep on learning new material throughout their career.

If multiple options exist, engineers weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result. It is usually not enough to build a technically successful product; it must also meet further requirements.

Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productibility, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.

A general methodology and epistemology of engineering can be inferred from the historical case studies and comments provided by Walter Vincenti.<ref>Vincenti, Walter G. (1993-02-01). What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History. The Johns Hopkins University Press. ISBN 0-8018-4588-2.</ref> Though Vincenti's case studies are from the domain of aeronautical engineering, his conclusions can be transferred into many other branches of engineering, too.

According to Billy Vaughn Koen, the "''engineering method'' is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources." Koen argues that the definition of what makes one an engineer should not be based on what he produces, but rather how he goes about it.<ref name="Discussion of The Method">{{cite book|last1=Koen|first1=Billy Vaughn|title=Discussion of The Method|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York Oxford|isbn=0-19-515599-8|page=8|edition=1|url=https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/discussion-of-the-method-9780195155990|accessdate=23 July 2015|ref=5}}</ref>

===Problem solving===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]
Engineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem.  Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.

Usually multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements.  [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of "[[level of invention|low-level]]" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.

Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.

Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.

The study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]], and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.

===Computer use===
[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [[Finite element method|modelling]] of the combined effects of [[Navier–Stokes equations|fluid flow]] and the [[heat equation]]s.]]

As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.

One of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software like [[CATIA]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], DSS [[SolidWorks]] or [[Pro Engineer]] which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.

These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [[product data management]] software.<ref>

There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software to generate [[CNC]] machining instructions; [[manufacturing process management]] software for production engineering; [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and circuit [[schematic]]s for electronic engineers; [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|MRO]] applications for maintenance management; and [[Architecture, engineering and construction|AEC]] software for civil engineering.

In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM).<ref>

Engineering as a subject ranges from large collaborations to small individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are beholden to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government. The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.

By its very nature engineering has interconnections with society and human behavior. Every product or construction used by modern society will have been influenced by engineering. Engineering is a very powerful tool to make changes to environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a great responsibility.  Many [[Engineering society|engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and [[engineering ethics|codes of ethics]] to guide members and inform the public at large.

Engineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.

All overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. A number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind:
* [[Engineers Without Borders]]
* [[Engineers Against Poverty]]
* Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief
* [[Engineers for a Sustainable World]]
* [[Engineering for Change]]
* Engineering Ministries International<ref name="EMI">[http://www.emiusa.org/index.html Home page for EMI]</ref>

Engineering companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges ahead with regard to the number of skilled engineers being trained, compared with the number retiring. This problem is very prominent in the UK.<ref>http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/</ref> There are many economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues<ref>http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important</ref> It is widely agreed that engineering faces an "image crisis",<ref>http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html</ref> rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career. Much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the UK and well as the USA and other western economies.

There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena.  Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the book ''[[What Engineers Know and How They Know It]]'',<ref name="vincenti">{{cite book|last=Vincenti|first=Walter G. |title=What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1993|isbn=0-8018-3974-2}}</ref> Walter Vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research. First, it often deals with areas in which the basic [[physics]] or [[chemistry]] are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.

[[File:Expedition 36 flight engineer Chris Cassidy.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Christopher Cassidy]] of [[NASA]] works on the Capillary Flow Experiment aboard the [[International Space Station]].]]

Examples are the use of numerical approximations to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of [[Fatigue (material)|Miner's rule]] to calculate fatigue damage. Second, engineering research employs many semi-[[empirical methods]] that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As stated by Fung ''et al.'' in the revision to the classic engineering text ''Foundations of Solid Mechanics'':

<blockquote>Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what is existing. Since a design has to be concrete, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristic numbers. Almost all engineers working on new designs find that they do not have all the needed information. Most often, they are limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they study mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they have to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences are born.<ref name="Fung">{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P. Tong|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001}}</ref></blockquote>

Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Medicine and biology===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|225px|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], seen here in a self-portrait, has been described as the epitome of the artist/engineer.<ref name="Bjerklie, David"/> He is also known for his studies on [[human anatomy]] and [[physiology]].]]

The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. [[Medicine]] aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the [[human body]], if necessary, through the use of [[technology]].

[[File:GFP Mice 01.jpg|thumb|right|Genetically engineered mice expressing [[green fluorescent protein]], which glows green under blue light. The central mouse is [[wild-type]].]]
Modern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, [[brain implant]]s and [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]].<ref name="Boston U">[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Bioe/BioeMcGe.htm Ethical Assessment of Implantable Brain Chips. Ellen M. McGee and G. Q. Maguire, Jr. from Boston University]</ref><ref name="IEEE foreign parts">[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/2188/27125/01204814.pdf?arnumber=1204814 IEEE technical paper: Foreign parts (electronic body implants).by Evans-Pughe, C. quote from summary: Feeling threatened by cyborgs?]</ref> The fields of [[bionics]] and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.

Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying, and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing [[biology]] with technology. This has led to fields such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neural networks]], [[fuzzy logic]], and [[robot]]ics.  There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.<ref name="IME">[http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html Institute of Medicine and Engineering: Mission statement The mission of the Institute for Medicine and Engineering (IME) is to stimulate fundamental research at the interface between biomedicine and engineering/physical/computational sciences leading to innovative applications in biomedical research and clinical practice.]</ref><ref name="IEEE">[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=51 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology: Both general and technical articles on current technologies and methods used in biomedical and clinical engineering&nbsp;...]</ref>

Both fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and [[empirical]] knowledge is an integral part of both.

Medicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.<ref name="Royal Academy">[http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf Royal Academy of Engineering and Academy of Medical Sciences: Systems Biology: a vision for engineering and medicine in pdf: quote1: Systems Biology is an emerging methodology that has yet to be defined quote2: It applies the concepts of systems engineering to the study of complex biological systems through iteration between computational and/or mathematical modelling and experimentation.]</ref>

The heart for example functions much like a pump,<ref name="Science Museum of Minnesota">[http://www.smm.org/heart/lessons/lesson5a.htm Science Museum of Minnesota: Online Lesson 5a; The heart as a pump]</ref> the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers,<ref name="Minnesota State University emuseum">[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/biology/humananatomy/skeletal/skeletalsystem.html Minnesota State University emuseum: Bones act as levers]</ref> the brain produces [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electrical signals]] etc.<ref name="UC Berkeley News">[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/02/23_brainwaves.shtml UC Berkeley News: UC researchers create model of brain's electrical storm during a seizure]</ref> These similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine, led to the development of the field of [[biomedical engineering]] that uses concepts developed in both disciplines.

Newly emerging branches of science, such as [[systems biology]], are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.<ref name="Royal Academy"/>

Among famous historical figures [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is a well-known [[Renaissance]] artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.<ref name="Bjerklie, David">Bjerklie, David.  "The Art of Renaissance Engineering."  MIT's Technology Review Jan./Feb.1998: 54-9.  Article explores the concept of the "artist-engineer", an individual who used his artistic talent in engineering. Quote from article: Da Vinci reached the pinnacle of "artist-engineer"-dom, Quote2: "It was Leonardo da Vinci who initiated the most ambitious expansion in the role of artist-engineer, progressing from astute observer to inventor to theoretician."

===Other fields===
In [[political science]] the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles. [[Financial engineering]] has similarly borrowed the term.
