The '''Northern Territory Country Liberal Party''' ('''CLP''') is an [[Australia]]n [[Northern Territory]] political party<ref>[http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/ntclp.htm NT Country Liberal Party], ''Current Register of Political Parties'' [[Australian Electoral Commission]], 29 May 2009. Retrieved 17 August 2009.</ref> affiliated with both the [[National Party of Australia|National]] (formerly "Country") and [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] parties of Australia. The CLP contests seats for the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] in the Northern Territory rather than the Liberal or National parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clp.org.au/ |title=Country Liberal Party |publisher=Clp.org.au |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}</ref>

The CLP dominated the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] from its establishment in 1974 until the [[Northern Territory general election, 2001|2001 Legislative Assembly election]], when it lost government winning only 10 of the 25 seats, and was reduced further to four parliamentary members at the [[Northern Territory general election, 2005|2005 election]]. At the [[Northern Territory general election, 2008|2008 election]] it increased its numbers, winning 11 seats. The CLP returned to office following the [[Northern Territory general election, 2012|2012 election]], winning 16 seats, and leader [[Terry Mills (Australian politician)|Terry Mills]] became [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory]]. Mills was replaced as CLP leader in March 2013 by [[Adam Giles]], who also became Chief Minister. Giles was the first [[indigenous Australian]] to lead a state or territory government in Australia.<ref name="abc.net.au">http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-13/terry-mills-dumped-as-nt-leader/4570820</ref> After further defections, numbers fell to reduce the CLP government to [[minority government]] status in July 2015.<ref name=abc1>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-20/kezia-purick-quits-country-liberals-nt-government-loses-majority/6632916 Kezia Purick quits Northern Territory Country Liberals party, Government loses one-seat majority: ABC 20 July 2015]</ref><ref name=abc2>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-20/adam-giles-wants-early-election-after-kezia-purick-leaves-clp/6634496 Adam Giles would 'love to go to an early election' after Kezia Purick resigns Country Liberals party: ABC 20 July 2015]</ref>

The CLP fielded candidates at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 federal election]], winning one seat in the Senate and the non-voting seat in the House of Representatives. Since 1979, the CLP has been formally affiliated with both the federal National Party (previously National Country Party) and the Liberal Party. It has full voting rights within the National Party, and observer status with the Liberal Party. Currently, the CLP has two representatives in federal parliament: [[Nigel Scullion]] is a [[Australian Senate|Senator]] and [[Natasha Griggs]] holds the [[Division of Solomon]] seat in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Scullion is the Senate leader of the National Party, while Griggs sits with the Liberals in the House.

==Party philosophy==
The CLP stands for office in the Northern Territory Assembly and [[Federal Parliament of Australia]] and primarily concerns itself with representing Territory interests. It is a regionally based party, that has parliamentary representation in both the Federal Parliament and at the Territory level.

It generally competes against the [[Australian Labor Party]] (a party founded by [[democratic socialist]]s, now functioning more as a [[social democratic]] party). It is closely affiliated with, but is independent from the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] (a mainly urban, pro-private enterprise party comprising anti-socialist [[conservative]] as well as more [[classical liberalism|classically liberal]] membership) and the [[National Party of Australia]] (an [[agrarianism|agrarian]] conservative rural and regional party).<ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au">http://www.parliament.curriculum.edu.au/parties_countrylib.htm</ref>

The Party promotes local issues like [[states and territories of Australia|statehood]] for the Northern Territory as well as more broadly liberal values like support for individualism and private enterprise, as well as traditional conservative values and progressive political policy.<ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au"/> In indigenous policy, the party has committed to improving education and job creation and to reducing a culture of [[welfare dependency]].<ref name="theaustralian.com.au">http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/indigenous/my-people-must-grow-up-alison-anderson/story-fn9hm1pm-1226508746330</ref>

==Party structure==
Branch delegates and members of the party's Central Council attend the Annual Conference of the Country Liberal Party to decide the party's platform. The Central Council is composed of the party's office bearers, its leaders from the Territory Assembly and the Federal Parliament and representatives of party branches.<ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au"/>

The Annual Conference of the Country Liberal Party, attended by branch delegates and members of the party's Central Council, decides matters relating to the party's platform and philosophy. The Central Council administers the party and makes decisions on [[pre-selection]]s. It is composed of the party's office bearers, its leaders in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, members in the Federal Parliament, and representation from each of the party's branches.<ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au"/>

Both the Nationals and Liberals receive Country Liberal Party delegations, and the party president has full voting rights with the National Party and observer status with the Liberal Party. The party also directs its federal members and senators as to which of the two other parties they should sit with in the parliamentary chamber. The CLP vote is often tabulated together with either of its coalition partners in many election results tables, or included within a single Coalition vote.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==History==

===Origins===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
The [[Whitlam Government]] passed legislation in 1974 to establish a fully elected [[unicameral]] [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] to replace the previous partly elected [[Northern Territory Legislative Council]], which had been in existence since 1947. The term of the Legislative Assembly was four years. Initially, the Legislative Assembly consisted of 19 members, which was increased in 1982 to 25 members, the present number. The Northern Territory was granted self-government in 1978.

===Foundation and electoral record===
Following the creation of the Legislative Assembly in 1974, the Territory's branches of the Country and Liberal parties merged to form the "Country Liberal Party" (CLP) to field candidates at the [[Northern Territory general election, 1974|1974 NT election]] for the Legislative Assembly.<ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au"/> The driving force behind the merger was [[Sam Calder]], the Territory's sole federal member of Parliament from the [[Division of Northern Territory]], who was the  elected member of the federal [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] and represented the Territory in the House of Representatives, with non-voting rights.

The CLP has contested every Territory election since 1974, and has also contested many [[List of Northern Territory by-elections|by-elections]].

The CLP formed the Territory government from 1974 until the [[Northern Territory general election, 2001|2001 election]]. For much of that time, it ruled the Northern Territory as a one-party state; it never faced more than nine opposition members. Indeed, the CLP's dominance was so absolute that its internal politics were seen as a bigger threat than any opposition party.<ref>[[Antony Green|Green, Antony]]. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/nt/2005/guide/summary.htm 2005 election summary]. [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 2005-04-15.</ref> This was especially pronounced in the mid-1980s, when a series of party-room coups resulted in the Territory having three Chief Ministers in four years.

At the [[Northern Territory general election, 2001|2001 election]] the Labor Party won government by one seat, ending 27 years of CLP government.<ref name="parliament.curriculum.edu.au"/> The loss marked a major turning point in Northern Territory politics, a result which was exacerbated when, at the [[Northern Territory general election, 2005|2005 election]], the ALP won a landslide victory, reducing the once-dominant party to just four members in the Legislative Assembly. The CLP even lost two seats in [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], an area where the ALP had never come close to winning any seats before.

The [[Northern Territory general election, 2008|2008 election]] saw the CLP recover from the severe loss it suffered three years earlier, increasing its representation from four to 11 members. Following the 2011 decision of Labor-turned-independent member [[Alison Anderson]] to join the CLP, this increased to CLP's representation to 12 in the Assembly, leaving the incumbent Henderson Government to govern in minority with the support of Independent MP [[Gerry Wood]].

Historically, the CLP has been particularly dominant in the Territory's two major cities, [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]/Palmerston and [[Alice Springs]]. However, in recent years Labor has pulled even with the CLP in the Darwin area; indeed, its 2001 victory was fueled by an unexpected swing in Darwin.

===2012 Return to office===
The CLP under the leadership of [[Terry Mills (Australian politician)|Terry Mills]] returned to power in the [[Northern Territory general election, 2012|2012 general election]] taking 16 out of 25 seats,<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Antony|title=Final Figures for 2012 Northern Territory Election|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2012/09/northern-territory-election-updates.html|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref> defeating the incumbent Labor Government led by [[Paul Henderson (politician)|Paul Henderson]]. In the lead up to the Territory election, CLP Senator [[Nigel Scullion]] sharply criticised the [[Gillard Government|Federal Labor Government]] for its suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia - an economic mainstay of the territory.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-12/politicians-link-suicides-to-cattle-export-ban/4256526</ref>

The election victory ended 11 years of Labor rule. The victory was also notable for the support it achieved from [[indigenous Australians|indigenous people]] in pastoral and remote electorates. Large swings were achieved in remote Territory electorates (where the indigenous population comprised around two-thirds of voters) and a total of five Aboriginal CLP candidates won election to the Assembly.<ref>http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/indigenous-vote-decided-outcome-in-the-territory/story-e6frgd0x-1226479040753</ref> Among the indigenous candidates elected were high-profile Aboriginal activist [[Bess Price]] and former Labor member [[Alison Anderson]]. Anderson was appointed Minister for Indigenous Advancement. In a nationally reported speech  in November 2012, Anderson condemned welfare dependency and a culture of entitlement in her first ministerial statement on the status of Aboriginal communities in the Territory and said the CLP would focus on improving education and on helping create real jobs for indigenous people.<ref name="theaustralian.com.au"/>

===2013 leadership spill===
On 13 March 2013, Adam Giles led a leadership coup against Terry Mills, and became the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory.<ref name="abc.net.au"/>

A year later, three indigenous CLP MPs resigned from the party. Mills had retired from politics by then, raising the prospect of the CLP being reduced to a [[minority government]] had it lost [[Blain by-election, 2014|a by-election in Mills' old seat of Blain]].<ref>Northern Territory Representation Act 1922 (Cth)</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/nt/2014/blain/ 2014 Blain by-election: Antony Green ABC]</ref> However, the CLP retained Blain despite suffering a large swing against it, allowing it to retain a bare one-seat majority. After further defections, numbers fell to [[minority government]] status.<ref name=abc1 /><ref name=abc2 />

==Federal activities==
The Territory Country Party members first contested the [[Australian federal election, 1919|1919 federal election]], with a newly established federal [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] contesting the [[Australian federal election, 1922|1922 federal election]]. The 1922 election saw the main anti-Labor party, the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] deprived of a majority, and were required to form a coalition in order to command a majority on the floor of parliament. The price for such support was the resignation of Nationalist (ex-Labor) Prime Minister, [[Billy Hughes]], who was replaced by [[Stanley Bruce]].

Since 1922 the Northern Territory has had one non-voting Member in the House of Representatives.<ref name=DocumentingDemocracy>Documenting Democracy: [http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-63.html Northern Territory Representation Act 1922 (Cth)]</ref> [[Harold George Nelson]] was the inaugural member serving between 16 December 1922 and 15 September 1934. He was elected as an Independent but later joined the Labor Party. Between 15 September 1934 and 10 December 1949 the [[Division of Northern Territory]] was held by [[Adair Blain]], an independent member. Between 10 December 1949 and 31 October 1966 the Division was held by [[Jock Nelson]], a member of the Labor Party. 

In 1966, the Country Party was established in the Northern Territory, while the Liberal Party was a small party. In recognition of this, the local Liberals supported the Country Party candidates for the sole NT seat from 1969 to 1972. An alliance had formed, primarily against the conservatives' arch-rival, the [[Australian Labor Party]]. The Territory seat was won by the Country Party's [[Sam Calder]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1966|1966 federal election]], who held the seat from 26 November 1966 to 19 September 1980. In 1968, the federal Coalition government gave the Member for Northern Territory full voting rights.<ref name=DocumentingDemocracy />

After the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 federal election]] and the subsequent [[Joint Sitting, Australian parliament, 1974|Joint Sitting of parliament]], legislation was passed to give the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the Northern Territory representation in the [[Australian Senate]], with two senators being elected.

The CLP fielded candidates at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 federal election]], winning one seat in the Senate and the non-voting seat in the House of Representatives. Since 1979, the CLP has been formally affiliated with both the federal [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] (previously National Country Party and the Country Party) and the  [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]]. The CLP contests seats for the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] in the Northern Territory rather than the Liberal or National parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clp.org.au/ |title=Country Liberal Party |publisher=Clp.org.au |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}</ref> It has full voting rights within the National Party, and observer status with the Liberal Party. 

Currently, the CLP has two representatives in federal parliament: [[Nigel Scullion]] is a [[Australian Senate|Senator]] and [[Natasha Griggs]] holds the [[Division of Solomon]] seat in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Scullion is Senate leader of the National Party and has been the [[Minister for Indigenous Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Indigenous Affairs]] since 18 September 2013 in the [[Abbott Ministry]] and [[Turnbull Ministry]], while Griggs sits with the Liberals in the House.
