{{European patent law}}
The '''European patent with unitary effect''' ('''EPUE'''), more commonly known as the '''unitary patent''', is a new type of [[European patent]] in advanced stage of adoption which would be valid in participating [[member states of the European Union]]{{refn|All EU member states except Spain, which abstained due to the exclusive use of English, French, and German languages, and Croatia, which subsequently acceded to the EU, joined the unitary patent regulation. States will only participate in the unitary patent if they ratify the [[Agreement on a Unified Patent Court|UPC Agreement]].|group=notes}}. Unitary effect can be registered for a European patent upon grant, replacing validation of the European patent in the individual countries concerned. The unitary effect means a single renewal fee, a single ownership, a single object of property, a single court (the [[Unified Patent Court]]) and uniform protection - which means that revocation as well as infringement proceedings are to be decided for the unitary patent as a whole rather than for each country individually. Licensing is however to remain possible for part of the unitary territory.

The legality of the two regulations was however challenged by Spain and Italy, who filed in total four actions for annulment, two of which were rejected, and two of which are currently pending before the [[European Court of Justice]].<ref>[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=137928&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=197732 Case C-146/13] and [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=137924&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=279995 Case C-147/13]</ref> All EU member states except [[Spain]] and [[Croatia]] participate in the enhanced cooperation.

Entry into force for the first group of ratifiers requires ratification by Germany, UK, France and at least ten additional states. Several states have initiated ratification procedures. As of July 2014 it has been ratified by five.|group=notes|name="UPC entry into force"}} and will extend to those participating member states for which the UPC Agreement had entered into force upon the registration of unitary effect.

The negotiations which resulted in the unitary patent can be traced back to various initiatives dating to the 1970s. At different times, the project, or very similar projects, have been referred to as the "European Union patent" (the name used in the EU treaties, which serve as the legal basis for EU competency), "EU patent", "Community patent", "European Community Patent", "EC patent"<ref>See for instance: European Patent Office (EPO) web site, [http://www.epo.org/topics/news/2009/20091208.html ''EU Council agrees on next steps regarding the Community patent (EU patent)''], News, 8 December 2009. Consulted on 13 December 2009</ref> and "COMPAT".<ref name="Stakeholders debate">European Commission, Internal Market, [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/smn/smn42/docs/patents_en.pdf ''Stakeholders debate future policy on patents''], Single Market News, Nr. 42, July 2006 (pdf)</ref>

By not requiring translations into a language of each contracting state, and by requiring the payment of only a single renewal fee for the group of contracting states, the unitary patent aims to be cheaper than European patents. Instead, unitary patents will be accepted in English, French, or German with no further translation required after grant.{{refn|There is a transition period of maximum 12 years during which there will be one translation made, either into English if the application is in French or German, or into any EU official language if the application was in English.|group=notes}} [[Machine translation]]s will be provided, but will be, in the words of the regulation, "for information purposes only and should not have any legal effect".<ref>Regulation 1260/2012, whereas #11</ref>  The maintenance fees, with a single fee for the whole area, are also expected to be lower compared to renewal fees for the whole area but the fees have yet to be announced.

The proposed unitary patent will be a particular type of European patent, granted under the [[European Patent Convention]]. A European patent, once granted, becomes a "bundle of nationally enforceable patents", in the states which are designated by the applicant, and the unitary effect would effectively create a single enforceable region in a subgroup of those 38 states, which may coexist with nationally enforceable patents ("classical" patents) in the remaining states.{{refn|Similarly, Switzerland and Liechtenstein created a separate unitary patent under the European Patent Convention. However, the [[unitary patent for Switzerland and Liechtenstein]] is the only possible way to obtain a patent in these two countries. It is not possible to obtain a patent only in Switzerland but not Liechtenstein, or only in Liechtenstein but not Switzerland. In contrast, the existence of the EU unitary patent will still permit a patent proprietor not to choose the EU unitary patent and to rather select specific countries.|group=notes}} "Classical", non-unitary European patents hold exclusively for single countries and require the filing of a translation in some contracting states, in accordance with {{EPC Article|65}}.{{refn|Although the filing of a translation under {{EPC Article|65}} is often referred to as "validation", this term is in fact not used in the European Patent Convention. In designated states where no translation is required, no "rubber-stamping" -or any kind of additional examination- by the national patent office of the designated state is permitted.|group=notes}}

=== Legislative history===
[[Image:Mikolaj Dowgielewicz eu minister 0c169 7655.jpg|thumb|right|In 2011, [[Mikołaj Dowgielewicz]], Polish Minister for European and Economic Affairs, said: "We have our [[wikt:back to the wall|backs to the wall]]: one or two member states are not willing to compromise and there will not be a breakthrough before the end of our [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]]."<ref name="Mosca-2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.europolitics.info/presidency-throws-in-towel-on-litigation-court-art321522.html |title=Presidency throws in towel on litigation court |author=Sophie Mosca |date=16 December 2011 |publisher=Europolitics |accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref>]]
In 2009, three draft documents were published regarding a community patent: a European patent in which the European Community was designated: 
#Council regulation on the community patent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&t=PDF&gc=true&sc=false&f=ST%208588%202009%20INIT|title=Revised proposal for a council decision on the Community patent|accessdate=26 March 2014|date=7 April 2009|work=Council of European Union}}</ref>

#Decision to open negotiations regarding this Agreement
Based on those documents, the European Council requested on 6 July 2009 an opinion from the Court of Justice of the European Union, regarding the compatibility of the envisioned Agreement with EU law: "‘Is the envisaged agreement creating a Unified Patent Litigation System (currently named European and Community Patents Court) compatible with the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community?’"<ref>{{CELEX|62009CV0001}}</ref>

In December 2010, the use of the [[enhanced co-operation]] procedure, under which [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title III: Enhanced Cooperation|Articles 326–334]] of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] provides that a group of member states of the European Union can choose to co-operate on a specific topic, was proposed by twelve Member States to set up a unitary patent applicable in all participating European Union Member States.<ref name="Tait">Nikki Tait, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fa9b799a-0799-11e0-8d80-00144feabdc0.html#axzz18DVrohfy "Brussels backs ‘single European patent’ plan"], FT.com, 14 December 2010.

In early 2011, the procedure leading to the enhanced co-operation was reported to be progressing. Twenty-five Member States had written to the European Commission requesting to participate, with Spain and Italy remaining outside, primarily on the basis of ongoing concerns over translation issues. On 15 February, the European Parliament approved the use of the enhanced co-operation procedure for unitary patent protection by a vote of 471 to 160.<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/en/pressroom/content/20110215IPR13680/html/EU-patent-Parliament-gives-go-ahead-for-enhanced-cooperation European patent: Parliament gives go ahead for enhanced cooperation], European Parliament, published: 15 February 2011.

In November 2011, negotiations on the enhanced co-operation system were reportedly advancing rapidly—too fast, in some views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europolitics.info/business-competitiveness/european-patent-moves-forward-art318386-7.html |title=European patent moves forward |date=16 November 2011 |publisher=Europolitics |accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> It was announced that implementation required an enabling European Regulation, and a Court agreement between the states that elect to take part.

===European patents===
{{main|European Patent Convention}}
European patents are granted in accordance with the provisions of the European Patent Convention,<ref>{{EPC Article|2|1}}</ref> via a [[Grant procedure before the European Patent Office|unified procedure]] before the [[European Patent Office]]. A single [[patent application]], in one language,<ref>{{EPC Article|14}}</ref> may be filed at the European Patent Office or at a national patent office of certain Contracting States.<ref name="Art75-1-b">{{EPC Article|75|1|b}}</ref>{{refn|However, [[Divisional applications under the European Patent Convention|divisional applications]] cannot be filed with a national patent office. They have to be filed with the European Patent Office ({{EPC Article|76|1}} in conjunction with {{EPC Rule|36|2}}).|group=notes}} [[Patentability|Patentable invention]]s, according to the EPC, are "any inventions, in all fields of technology, providing that they are [[Novelty under the European Patent Convention|new]], involve an [[inventive step under the European Patent Convention|inventive step]], and are susceptible of [[industrial applicability|industrial application]]."<ref>{{EPC Article|52|1}}.</ref>

In contrast to the unified character of a European patent application, a granted European patent has, in effect, no unitary character, except for the centralized [[Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|opposition procedure]] (which can be initiated within 9 months from grant, by somebody else than the patent proprietor), and the centralized [[Limitation and revocation procedures before the European Patent Office|limitation and revocation]] procedures (which can only be instituted by the patent proprietor).<ref>In addition to the opposition, limitation and revocation procedures, particular acts can still be performed before the EPO after grant, such as requesting a rectification of an incorrect designation of inventor under {{EPC Rule|21|1}}. "Rectification may [indeed] also be requested after the proceedings before the EPO are terminated." ({{EPO Guidelines|a|iii|5|6}}).</ref> In other words, a European patent in one Contracting State, i.e. a "national" European patent,{{refn|There is no consistent usage of a particular expression to refer to "the European patent in a particular designated Contracting State for which it is granted". The article uses the expression "a "national" European patent"|group=notes}} is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition, limitation and revocation procedures. The [[Enforcement of European patents|enforcement of a European patent]] is dealt with by national law.<ref>{{EPC Article|64|3}}</ref> The abandonment, revocation or limitation of the European patent in one state does not affect the European patent in other states.

The EPC provides however the possibility for a group of member states to allow European patents to have a unitary character also after grant. Until now, only Liechtenstein and Switzerland have opted to create a unified protection area (see [[Unitary patent (Switzerland and Liechtenstein)]]).<ref name=Swisstreaty>[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj1980/p393_440.pdf Treaty between the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on Patent Protection (Patent Treaty) of 22 December 1978], [[OJ EPO]] 1980, 407, or {{de icon}} [http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19780344/index.html Vertrag zwischen der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft und dem Fürstentum Liechtenstein über den Schutz der Erfindungspatente] Die Bundesbehörden der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft.</ref>

Upon filing of a European patent application, all 38 Contracting States are automatically designated,<ref>{{EPC Article|79|1}}</ref> unless, when filing the application, the applicant withdraws one or more designations. This may be important to avoid conflicts with national (non European patent) applications.<ref>{{EPO Guidelines|a|iii|11|2|4}}</ref> Designations may also be withdrawn after filing, at any time before grant. Upon grant, a European patent has immediate effect in all designated States, but to remain effective, yearly renewal fees have to be paid, in each State, and in certain countries translation requirements have to be met.

==Legal basis and implementation==
Three instruments were proposed for the implementation of the unitary patent:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legislative-initiatives/eu-patent.html|work=European Patent Office|title=Unitary patent / EU patent|date=16 May 2012|accessdate=29 June 2012}}</ref>
* Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council implementing enhanced co-operation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection
* Council Regulation implementing enhanced co-operation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection with regard to the applicable translation arrangements
* Agreement on a Unified Patent Court
The system is based on EU law as well as the European Patent Convention (EPC). {{EPC Article|142}} provides the legal basis for establishing a common system of patents for Parties to the EPC.<ref>{{EPC Article|142|1}} and its footnote 168: 
:"The group of EU member states participating in enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection implemented that cooperation by Regulation (EU) No. 1257/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation No. 1260/2012 (OJ EPO 2013, 110, 111 and 132), thereby availing itself of the authorisation given in Article 142(1) and the provisions of Part IX of the EPC. The third component of the EU "patent package" is the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court (OJ EPO 2013, 286, 287)."</ref> Previously, only Liechtenstein and Switzerland had used this possibility to create a unified protection area (see [[Unitary patent (Switzerland and Liechtenstein)]]).<ref name="Swisstreaty"/>

====Role of the European Patent Office====
Some administrative tasks relating to the European patents with unitary effect will be performed by the European Patent Office.<ref>{{cite video |people=Ingo Beckedorf |date=8–9 November 2012 |title=EPO boards of appeal and key decisions: The future of the boards in the light of the possible introduction of the unitary patent and Unified Patent Court (Part 3 of 3) |url=https://e-courses.epo.org/wbts/caselaw2012/index.html |publisher=European Patent Office |location=Munich, Germany |accessdate=16 November 2013 |minutes=5:33 to 5:45}}</ref> These tasks include the collection of [[renewal fees]] and registration of unitary effect upon grant, exclusive licenses and statements that licenses are available to any person. Decisions of the European Patent Office regarding the unitary patent are open to appeal to the Unified Patent Court, rather than to the [[EPO Boards of Appeal]].<ref>[[s:Agreement on a Unified Patent Court#Article 32 .E2.80.93 Competence of the Court|Article 32(1)i, Agreement on a Unified Patent Court]], implementing Article 9.3 of [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:361:0001:0008:EN:PDF Regulation 1257/2012]</ref>

====Translation requirements====
For a unitary patent ultimately no translation will be required, which significantly reduces the cost for protection in the whole area. However, during a transition period of maximum 12 years one translation needs to be provided, either into English if the application is in French or German, or into any EU official language if the application is in English. In addition, [[machine translation]]s will be provided, which will be, in the words of the regulation, "for information purposes only and should not have any legal effect".

In several contracting states, for "national" European patents a translation has to be filed within a three-month time limit after the publication of grant in the [[European Patent Bulletin]] under {{EPC Article|65}},{{refn|{{EPC Article|2|2}} provides that "[t]he European patent shall, in each of the Contracting States for which it is granted, have the effect of and be subject to the same conditions as a national patent granted by that State, unless this Convention provides otherwise." The provision of Article 65 EPC may therefore be viewed as an exception to Article 2(2) EPC. See also [[London Agreement (2000)]].|group=notes}} otherwise the patent is considered never to have existed (void ab initio) in that state. For the 20 parties to the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]], this requirement has already been abolished or reduced (e.g. by dispensing with the requirement if the patent is available in English, and/or only requiring translation of the [[claim (patent)|claim]]s).<ref name="translation requirements for national EPs">{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/natlaw/en/iv/index.htm|title=National law relating to EPC: IV.

====Unitary patent as an object of property====

Article 7 of Regulation 1257/2012 provides that, as an object of property, a European patent with unitary effect will be treated "in its entirety and in all participating Member States as a national patent of the participating Member State in which that patent has unitary effect and in which the applicant had her/his residence or principal place of business or, by default, had a place of business on the date of filing the application for the European patent."<ref name=Ullrich>Ullrich, Hanns, The Property Aspects of the European Patent with Unitary Effect: A National Perspective for a European Prospect?

Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2347921</ref> When the applicant had no domicile in a participating Member State, [[German law]] will apply.<ref name=Ullrich/> Ullrich has the criticized the system, which is similar to the [[Community Trademark]] and the [[Community Design]], as being "in conflict with both the purpose of the creation of unitary patent protection and with primary EU law."<ref name=Ullrich/>

===Implementation of the regulations at the EPO===
In January 2013, after the two regulations about the unitary patent had entered into force, but before the regulations applied, the participating member states in the unitary patent established (as member states of the European Patent Convention) a Select Committee of the [[Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation]] in order to prepare the work for implementation of the provisions. The committee held its inaugural meeting on 20 March 2013. The work of the Select Committee has to proceed in parallel to the work of the Preparatory Committee for the creation of the Unified Patent Court. Implementation of the Unitary Patent - including the legal, administrative and financial measures - shall be completed in due time before the entry into operation of the Unified Patent Court. In May 2015, the communicated target date for completion of the remaining preparatory work of the Select Committee was 30 June 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9107-2015-INIT/en/pdf|title=Implementing the Patent Package: Fourth progress report|format=PDF|publisher=Council of the EU|date=21 May 2015}}</ref> The Committee reached agreement on the level of the renewal fees June 2015, while it stated that a decision on the distribution of those fees among member states was in Autumn 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20150624.html|title=Business-friendly fee pattern adopted for the unitary patent|publisher=EPO|date=25 June 2015}}</ref>

The Agreement on a Unified Patent Court provides the legal basis for the Unified Patent Court: a patent court for European patents (with and without unitary effect), with jurisdiction in those countries where the Agreement is in effect. In addition to regulations regarding the court structure, it also contains substantive provisions relating to the right to prevent use of an invention and allowed use by non patent proprietors (e.g. for private non-commercial use), preliminary and permanent injunctions.

====Parties====
The Agreement was signed on 19 February 2013 by 24 EU member states, including all states then participating in the enhanced co-operation measures except [[Bulgaria]] and [[Poland]], while Italy, which did not originally join the enhanced co-operation measures but subsequently signed up, did sign the UPC agreement.<ref name="SIGN">{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/intm/135593.pdf|title=Signing of the Unified Patent Court agreement|date=19 February 2013|accessdate=19 February 2013|publisher=[[Council of the European Union]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/patent/ratification/index_en.htm|title=Unitary patent – ratification progress|accessdate=19 February 2013|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}</ref> The agreement remains open to accession for all remaining EU member states, and Bulgaria signed the agreement on 5 March.<ref name="SIGN"/><ref>{{cite press release|title=Single European Patent: a major achievement but still some way to go|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-132_en.htm?locale=en|work=European Commission|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref> Meanwhile, Poland decided to wait to see how the new patent system works before joining due to concerns that it would harm their economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldipreview.com/news/will-poland-join-the-unitary-patent-system|title=Will Poland join the Unitary Patent system?|date=5 February 2013|accessdate=9 February 2013|publisher=[[World Intellectual Property Review]]}}</ref> States which do not participate in the unitary patent regulations can still become parties to the UPC agreement, which would allow the new court to handle European patents validated in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/countries-to-sign-up-to-unitary-patent-system-/76422.aspx|title=Countries to sign up to unitary patent system|last=Wishart|first=Ian|date=14 February 2013|accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>  Entry into force for the UPC will take place after 13 states (including Germany, France and the United Kingdom as the three states with the most patents in force) have ratified the Agreement.<ref name=EUPARL/><ref name="SIGN"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/intm/135391.pdf|title=Background note – Competitiveness Council – Brussels, 18 and 19 February 2013|publisher=[[Court of Justice of the European Union]] |date=11 February 2013|accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=EPO>{{cite web |url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/unitary/faq.html|work=European Patent Organisation|title=Unitary patent – frequently asked questions |accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://consilium.europa.eu/homepage/highlights/eu-unitary-patent-–-a-historical-breakthrough?lang=en |title=EU unitary patent – a historical breakthrough |work=Council of the European Union |date=29 June 2012 |accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref> As of July 2014, the agreement has been ratified by 5 states (including 1 of the required ratifiers: France).

====Jurisdiction====
The Unified Patent Court will have exclusive jurisdiction in [[patent infringement|infringement]] and revocation proceedings involving European patents with unitary effect, and during a transition period non-exclusive jurisdiction (that the patent holder can be opt out from) regarding European patents without unitary effect in the states where the Agreement applies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/889924E4E28C5D0CC12578D3003F5046/$File/st11533_en.pdf |date=14 June 2011|work=Council of the European Union |accessdate=30 June 2012 |title=Draft agreement on a Unified Patent Court and draft Statute – Presidency text |quote=(...) the Unified Patent Court will be a court common to the Contracting Member States, thus situated within the judicial system of the European Union, with exclusive competence on their territories for European patents with unitary effect and European patents designating one or more Member States party to this Agreement}}</ref> It furthermore has jurisdiction to hear cases against decisions of the European Patent Office regarding unitary patents. As a court of several member states of the European Union it may (Court of First Instance) or must (Court of Appeal) ask prejudicial questions to the [[European Court of Justice]] when the interpretation of EU law (including the two unitary patent regulations, but excluding the UPC Agreement) is not obvious.

====Organization====
The court would have two divisions: a court of first instance and a court of appeal. The court of appeal and the registry would have their seats in Luxembourg, while the central division of the court of first instance would have its seat in Paris. The central division would have thematic branches in London and [[Munich]].<ref name="sciencebusiness27-06-12">{{cite news |url=http://bulletin.sciencebusiness.net/news/75784/Deal-reached-Unitary-patent-court-to-have-three-homes |title=Deal reached: Unitary patent court to have three homes |accessdate=29 June 2012 |date=27 June 2012 |work=Science}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/131388.pdf |title=European Council, 28/29 June 2012, Conclusions (EUCO 76/12, CO EUR 4, CONCL 2)|date=29 June 2012 |publisher=European Council (General Secretariat of the Council) |location=Brussels |accessdate=30 June 2012 |quote=Given the highly specialised nature of patent litigation and the need to maintain high quality standards, thematic clusters will be created in two sections of the Central Division, one in London (chemistry, including pharmaceuticals, classification C, human necessities, classification A), the other in Munich (mechanical engineering, classification F). }}</ref>  The court of first instance may further have local and regional divisions in all member states that wish to set up such divisions.

===Geographical scope of and request for unitary effect===
While the regulations formally apply to all 26 member states participating in the [[Enhanced cooperation#Unitary patent|enhanced cooperation for a unitary patent]], from the date the  [[Unified Patent Court Agreement|UPC agreement]] has entered into force for the first group of ratifiers,{{refn|group=notes|name="UPC entry into force"}} unitary patents will only extend to the territory of those participating member states where the UPC Agreement had entered into force when the unitary effect was registered. If the unitary effect territory subsequently expands to additional participating member states for which the UPC Agreement later enters into force, this will be reflected for all subsequently registered unitary patents, but the territorial scope of the unitary effect of existing unitary patents will not be extended to these states.<ref name="geographical extension"/>

Unitary effect can be requested up to one month after grant of the European patent, with retroactive effect from the date of grant. However, according to the ''Draft Rules Relating to Unitary Patent Protection'', unitary effect would be registered only if the European patent has been granted with the same set of [[claim (patent)|claim]]s{{refn|A European patent may be granted by the EPO with claims which are, for one or more States, different from those applicable to the other designated States. This rare situation may arise by virtue of {{EPC Rule|18|2}} or {{EPC Rule|138}}.|group=notes}} for all the 26 participating member states in the regulations,{{refn|This requires that all 26 states participating in the [[Enhanced cooperation#Unitary patent|enhanced cooperation regulations]] have been designated upon filing of the European patent application.

The unitary effect does not affect "national" European patents in states where the unitary patent does not apply. Any "national" European patents applying outside the "unitary effect" zone will co-exist with the unitary patent.<ref name="geographical extension"/>

====Special territories of participating member states====
As the unitary patent is introduced by an EU regulation, it is expected to not only be valid in the mainland territory of the participating member states that are party to the UPC, but also in those of their [[Special member state territories and the European Union|special territories]] that are part of the European Union. As of April 2014, this includes the following fourteen territories:

== Costs ==
Translation requirements as well as the requirement to pay yearly patent fees in all countries in which a European patent is designated, presently renders the European patent system costly in the European Union. In an impact assessment the European Commission estimated that the costs of obtaining a patent in all 27 EU countries would drop from over 32 000 euro (mainly due to translation costs) to 6 500 euro (for the combination of an EU, Spanish and Italian patent) due to introduction of the EU patent. Per capita costs of an EU patent were estimated at just 6 euro/million in the original 25 participating countries (and 12 euro/million in the 27 EU countries for protection with an EU, Italian and Spanish patent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/patent/sec2011-482-final_en.pdf|title=IMPACT ASSESSMENT Accompanying document to the Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection and Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection with regard to the applicable translation arrangements|work=European Commission|page=36|date=13 April 2012}}</ref>

How the EU Commission has presented the expected cost savings has however been sharply criticized as exaggerated and based on unrealistic assumptions. The EU Commission has notably considered the costs for validating a European patent in 27 countries while in reality only about 1% of all granted European patents are currently validated in all 27 contracting states. Based on more realistic assumptions, the cost savings are expected to be much lower than actually claimed by the Commission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.platow.de/eu-patent--kostenreduzierungen-deutlich-uebertrieben/4444686.html |title=EU-Patent – Kostenreduzierungen deutlich übertrieben |last=Rox |first=Thomas |date=5 June 2013 |website=platow.de |language=German |trans_title=EU Patent - Cost reductions clearly exaggerated |accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref>

==Earlier attempts==

===1970s and 1980s: proposed Community Patent Convention===
Work on a Community patent started in the 1970s, but the resulting Community Patent Convention (CPC) was a failure.

The "[[Luxembourg]] Conference on the Community Patent" took place in 1975 and the '''Convention for the European Patent for the common market''', or (Luxembourg) Community Patent Convention (CPC), was signed at Luxembourg on 15 December 1975, by the 9 member states of the [[European Economic Community]] at that time.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:41975A3490|title=Convention for the European patent for the common market|date=1976-01-26|accessdate=2015-06-27|journal=[[Official Journal of the European Communities]]|volume=L 17/1}}</ref> However, the CPC never entered into force. It was not ratified by enough countries.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wkq9BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA33|title=The Unitary EU Patent System|year=2015|first1=Justine|last1=Pila|first2=Christopher|last2=Wadlow|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|pages=33-35}}</ref>

Fourteen years later, the '''Agreement relating to Community patents''' was made at Luxembourg on 15 December 1989.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.1989.401.01.0001.01.ENG|title=Agreement relating to Community patents|date=1989-12-30|accessdate=2015-06-27|journal=[[Official Journal of the European Communities]]|volume=L 401/1}}</ref> It attempted to revive the CPC project, but also failed. This Agreement consisted of an amended version of the original Community Patent Convention. Twelve states signed the Agreement: [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], France, Germany, [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], Italy, [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], Spain, and United Kingdom. All of those states would need to have ratified the Agreement to cause it to enter into force,<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:41989A0695(01):EN:NOT 89/695/EEC: Agreement relating to Community patents, Done at Luxembourg on 15 December 1989, Article 10]</ref> but only seven did so: [[Denmark]], France, Germany, [[Greece]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], and United Kingdom.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/agreements-conventions/agreement/?aid=1989104|title=Agreement relating to Community Patents|accessdate=2015-06-27|publisher=Council of the European Union}}</ref><ref>[[Official Journal of the European Patent Office]] 4/2006 p. 328 [http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/pubs/oj006/04_06/04_3086.pdf (pdf)]</ref>

Nevertheless, a majority of member states of the EEC at that time introduced some harmonisation into their national patent laws in anticipation of the entry in force of the CPC. A more substantive harmonisation took place at around the same time to take account of the European Patent Convention and the [[Convention on the Unification of Certain Points of Substantive Law on Patents for Invention|Strasbourg Convention]].

===2000 to 2004: EU Regulation proposal===
In 2000, renewed efforts from the European Union resulted in a Community Patent [[European Union regulation|Regulation]] proposal, sometimes abbreviated as '''CPR'''. It provides that the patent, once it has been granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) in one of its procedural languages (English, German or French) and published in that language, with a translation of the claims into the two other procedural languages, will be valid without any further translation. This proposal is aimed to achieve a considerable reduction in translation costs.

Nevertheless, additional translations could become necessary in legal proceedings against a suspected infringer. In such a situation, a suspected infringer who has been unable to consult the text of the patent in the official language of the Member State in which he is domiciled, is presumed, until proven otherwise, not to have knowingly infringed the patent. To protect a suspected infringer who, in such a situation, has not acted in a deliberate manner, it is provided that the proprietor of the patent will not be able to obtain damages in respect of the period prior to the translation of the patent being notified to the infringer.

The proposed Community Patent Regulation should also establish a court holding exclusive jurisdiction to invalidate issued patents; thus, a Community Patent's validity will be the same in all EU member states. This court will be attached to the present [[European Court of Justice]] and [[Court of First Instance]] through use of provisions in the [[Treaty of Nice]].

Discussion regarding the Community patent had made clear progress in 2003 when a political agreement was reached on 3 March 2003. However, one year later in March 2004 under the Irish [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]], the [[Council of the European Union#Configurations|Competitiveness Council]] failed to agree on the details of the Regulation. In particular the time delays for translating the claims and the authentic text of the claims in case of an infringement remained problematic issues throughout discussions and in the end proved insoluble.

In view of the difficulties in reaching an agreement on the community patent,<ref>Axel H. Horns, [http://www.ipjur.com/blog2/index.php?/archives/138-A-Unified-European-Patent-System-The-Historical-Perspective.html#extended A Unified European Patent System – The Historical Perspective], IP::JUR blog, 18 February 2010. Consulted on 20 February 2010.</ref> other legal agreements have been proposed outside the European Union legal framework to reduce the cost of translation (of patents when granted) and [[lawsuit|litigation]], namely the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]], which entered into force on 1 May 2008—and which has reduced the number of countries requiring translation of European patents granted nowadays under the European Patent Convention, and the corresponding costs to obtain a European patent<ref>Bruno van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, Malwina Mejer, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/f861125075v61964/ "The London Agreement and the cost of patenting in Europe"], [[European Journal of Law and Economics]], Vol. 29, Number 2, April 2010, pages 211–237.</ref>— and the [[European Patent Litigation Agreement]] (EPLA), a proposal that has now lapsed.

====Reactions to the failure====
[[Image:ProdiBari.jpg|right|thumb|[[Romano Prodi]] (here on a picture taken in 2006) cited the failure to agree on a Europewide patent as a weak point of his five-year term as [[President of the European Commission]].]]
After the council in March 2004, [[European Commission|EU Commissioner]] [[Frits Bolkestein]] said that "The failure to agree on the Community Patent I am afraid undermines the credibility of the whole enterprise to make Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010." Adding:

{{quote|It is a mystery to me how Ministers at the so-called 'Competitiveness Council' can keep a straight face when they adopt conclusions for the Spring European Council on making Europe more competitive and yet in the next breath backtrack on the political agreement already reached on the main principles of the Community Patent in March of last year. I can only hope that one day the vested, [[protectionism|protectionist]] interests that stand in the way of agreement on this vital measure will be sidelined by the over-riding importance and interests of European manufacturing industry and Europe's competitiveness. That day has not yet come.<ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/04/58 Commission Press Communique, 12 March 2004, "Results of the Competitiveness Council of Ministers, Brussels, 11 March 2004 Internal Market, Enterprise and Consumer Protection issues"]</ref>}}

Jonathan Todd, Commission's Internal Market spokesman, declared:
{{quote|Normally, after the common political approach, the text of the regulation is agreed very quickly. Instead, some Member States appear to have changed their positions. (...) It is extremely unfortunate that European industry's competitiveness, innovation and R&D are being sacrificed for the sake of preserving narrow vested interests.<ref>[http://cordis.europa.eu/itt/itt-en/04-3/policy03.htm cordis.europa.eu, ''Patently unclear'', 26 May 2004]</ref>}}

European Commission President [[Romano Prodi]], asked to evaluate his five-year term, cites as his weak point the failure of many EU governments to implement the "[[Lisbon Agenda]]", agreed in 2001. In particular, he cited the failure to agree on a Europewide patent, or even the languages to be used for such a patent, "because member states did not accept a change in the rules; they were not coherent".<ref>[[Wall Street Journal]], 25 October 2004</ref>

====Support for the Regulation====
There is support for the Community patent from various quarters. From the point of view of the European Commission the Community Patent is an essential step towards creating a level playing field for trade within the European Union. For smaller businesses, if the Community patent achieves its aim of providing a relatively inexpensive way of obtaining patent protection across a wide trading area, then there is also support. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

For larger businesses, however, other issues come into play, which have tended to dilute overall support. In general, these businesses recognise that the current European Patent system provides the best possible protection given the need to satisfy national sovereignty requirements such as regarding translation and enforcement. The Community Patent proposal was generally supported if it would do away with both of these issues, but there was some concern about the level of competence of the proposed European Patent Court. A business would be reluctant to obtain a Europe-wide patent if it ran the risk of being revoked by an inexperienced judge. Also, the question of translations would not go away – unless the users of the system could see significant change in the position of some of the countries holding out for more of a patent specification to be translated on grant or before enforcement, it was understood that larger businesses (the bulk of the users of the patent system) would be unlikely to move away from the tried and tested European Patent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Since 2005: stalemate and new debate===
[[Image:Charlie McCreevy portrait.jpg|thumb|left|In 2007, [[Charlie McCreevy]] was quoted as saying that the proposal for an EU-wide patent was stuck in the [[mud]].]]
Thus, in 2005, the Community patent looked unlikely to be implemented in the near future. However, on 16 January 2006 the [[European Commission]] "launched a public consultation on how future action in patent policy to create an EU-wide system of protection can best take account of stakeholders' needs." The Community patent was one of the issues the consultation focused on.<ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/38&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en European Commission, Internal Market, ''Commission asks industry and other stakeholders for their views on future patent policy'', Brussels, 16 January 2006,]</ref> More than 2500 replies were received.<ref name="Stakeholders debate"/> According to the European Commission, the consultation showed that there is widespread support for the Community patent but not at any cost, and "in particular not on the basis of the Common Political Approach reached by EU Ministers in 2003".<ref name="Stakeholders debate"/>

In February 2007, [[European Commission|EU Commissioner]] [[Charlie McCreevy]] was quoted as saying:
{{quote|The proposal for an EU-wide patent is stuck in the mud.
