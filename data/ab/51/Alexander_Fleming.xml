Fleming's impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity, and because its action appeared to be rather slow, penicillin would not be important in treating infection. Fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body (<italics>in vivo</italics>) to kill bacteria effectively. Many clinical tests were inconclusive, probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic.
