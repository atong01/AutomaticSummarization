==Early life and education==
Fleming was born on 6 August  1881 at Lochfield farm near [[Darvel]], in [[Ayrshire]], Scotland. He was the third of the four children of farmer Hugh Fleming (1816–1888) from his second marriage to Grace Stirling Morton (1848–1928), the daughter of a neighbouring farmer. Hugh Fleming had four surviving children from his first marriage. He was 59 at the time of his second marriage, and died when Alexander (known as Alec) was seven.

Fleming went to [[Loudoun Moor School]] and Darvel School, and earned a two-year scholarship to [[Kilmarnock Academy]] before moving to London, where he attended the [[University of Westminster|Royal Polytechnic Institution]].<ref name="Penicillin man">{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Kevin|title=Penicillin man : Alexander Fleming and the antibiotic revolution|date=2004|publisher=Sutton|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0750931526|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP06AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT27&dq=Alexander+Fleming++Loudoun+Moor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCsQ6AEwA2oVChMIha-wmdvvxwIVDwOSCh3y2wrE#v=onepage&q=Loudoun%20Moor&f=false|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref> After working in a shipping office for four years, the twenty-year-old Fleming inherited some money from an uncle, John Fleming. His elder brother, Tom, was already a physician and suggested to his younger sibling that he should follow the same career, and so in 1903, the younger Alexander enrolled at [[St Mary's Hospital Medical School]] in [[Paddington]]; he qualified with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] degree from the school with distinction in 1906.

Fleming had been a private in the [[London Scottish Regiment]] of the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] since 1900,<ref name="lesprixnobel" /> and had been a member of the rifle club at the medical school. The captain of the club, wishing to retain Fleming in the team suggested that he join the research department at St Mary's, where he became assistant bacteriologist to Sir [[Almroth Wright]], a pioneer in [[vaccine]] therapy and immunology. In 1908, he gained a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree with Gold Medal in [[Bacteriology]], and became a lecturer at St Mary's until 1914.
Fleming served throughout [[World War I]] as a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], and was [[Mentioned in Dispatches]]. He and many of his colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France. In 1918 he returned to [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]], where he was elected Professor of Bacteriology of the [[University of London]] in 1928. In 1951 he was elected the Rector of the [[University of Edinburgh]] for a term of 3 years.

==Research==

===Work before penicillin===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Following World War I, Fleming actively searched for anti-bacterial agents, having witnessed the death of many soldiers from [[sepsis]] resulting from infected [[wounds]]. [[Antiseptics]] killed the patients' immunological defences more effectively than they killed the invading bacteria. In an article he submitted for the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' during World War I, Fleming described an ingenious experiment, which he was able to conduct as a result of his own glass blowing skills, in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during World War I. Antiseptics worked well on the surface, but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent, and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach. Sir [[Almroth Wright]] strongly supported Fleming's findings, but despite this, most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients.

==Accidental discovery==
[[File:PenicillinPSAedit.jpg|thumb|Miracle cure.]]
{{Main|History of penicillin}}
"When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionise all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer," Fleming would later say, "But I suppose that was exactly what I did."<ref name="isbn1-56308-159-8">{{cite book|last=Haven|first =Kendall F.|title=Marvels of Science : 50 Fascinating 5-Minute Reads|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|location=Littleton, Colo|year=1994|page= 182|isbn=1-56308-159-8}}</ref>

By 1927, Fleming had been investigating the properties of [[staphylococcus|staphylococci]]. He was already well-known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher, but his laboratory was often untidy. On 3 September 1928, Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent August on holiday with his family. Before leaving, he had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of his laboratory. On returning, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking ''"That's funny"''.<ref name=Brown>Brown, K. (2004). ''Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution''. 320 pp. Sutton Publishing. ISBN 0-7509-3152-3.</ref> Fleming showed the contaminated culture to his former assistant Merlin Price, who reminded him, "That's how you discovered [[lysozyme]]."<ref>Hare, R. ''The Birth of Penicillin,'' Allen & Unwin, London, 1970</ref> Fleming grew the mould in a pure culture and found that it produced a substance that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. He identified the mould as being from the ''[[Penicillium]]'' genus, and, after some months of calling it ''"mould juice"'', named the substance it released ''[[penicillin]]'' on 7 March 1929.<ref>Diggins, F. ''The true history of the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming'' Biomedical Scientist, March 2003, Insititute of Biomedical Sciences, London. (Originally published in the Imperial College School of Medicine Gazette)</ref> The laboratory in which Fleming discovered and tested penicillin is preserved as the [[Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum]] in St. Mary's Hospital, [[Paddington]].

He investigated its positive anti-bacterial effect on many organisms, and noticed that it affected bacteria such as staphylococci and many other [[Gram-positive]] pathogens that cause [[scarlet fever]], [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]] and [[diphtheria]], but not [[typhoid fever]] or [[paratyphoid fever]], which are caused by [[Gram-negative]] bacteria, for which he was seeking a cure at the time. It also affected ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]],'' which causes [[gonorrhoea]] although this bacterium is Gram-negative.

Fleming published his discovery in 1929, in the British ''Journal of Experimental Pathology,''<ref name="pmid6994200">{{cite journal | author = Fleming A | title = On the antibacterial action of cultures of a penicillium, with special reference to their use in the isolation of B. influenzae. (Reprinted from the British Journal of Experimental Pathology 10:226-236, 1929) | journal = Clin Infect Dis. | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 129–39 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6994200 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/clinids/2.1.129 }}</ref> but little attention was paid to his article. Fleming continued his investigations, but found that cultivating ''penicillium'' was quite difficult, and that after having grown the mould, it was even more difficult to isolate the antibiotic agent. Fleming's impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity, and because its action appeared to be rather slow, penicillin would not be important in treating infection. Fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body (''in vivo'') to kill bacteria effectively. Many clinical tests were inconclusive, probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic. In the 1930s, Fleming’s trials occasionally showed more promise,<ref>{{cite web|last=Rossiter|first=Peter|title=Keith Bernard Rogers|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200632/|publisher=BMJ|accessdate=4 March 2012|date=10 September 2010|quote=Keith was probably the first patient to be treated clinically with penicillin ointment.}}</ref>  and he continued, until 1940, to try to interest a chemist skilled enough to further refine usable penicillin. Fleming finally abandoned penicillin, and not long after he did, [[Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain]] at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]] in Oxford took up researching and mass-producing it, with funds from the U.S. and British governments. They started mass production after the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]]. By [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] in 1944, enough penicillin had been produced to treat all the wounded with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]].

===Purification and stabilisation===
[[File:Penicillin-G 3D.png|thumb|left|3D-model of benzylpenicillin.]]
In Oxford, [[Ernst Boris Chain]] and [[Edward Abraham]] discovered how to isolate and concentrate penicillin. Abraham was the first to propose the correct structure of penicillin.<ref>in October 1943 Abraham proposed a molecular structure which included a cyclic formation containing three carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom, the β-lactam ring, not then known in natural products. This structure was not immediately published due to the restrictions of wartime secrecy, and was initially strongly disputed, by Sir Robert Robinson among others, but it was finally confirmed in 1945 by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin using X-ray analysis." Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; "Abraham, Sir Edward Penley"</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-sir-edward-abraham-1093226.html|location=London|work=The Independent |first=Gordon|last=Lowe|title=Obituary: Sir Edward Abraham|date=13 May 1999}}</ref> Shortly after the team published its first results in 1940, Fleming telephoned [[Howard Florey]], Chain's head of department, to say that he would be visiting within the next few days. When Chain heard that Fleming was coming, he remarked ''"Good God! I thought he was dead."''

[[Norman Heatley]] suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity. This produced enough of the drug to begin testing on animals. There were many more people involved in the Oxford team, and at one point the entire Dunn School was involved in its production.

After the team had developed a method of purifying penicillin to an effective first stable form in 1940, several clinical trials ensued, and their amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in 1945.

Fleming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin, describing his fame as the ''"Fleming Myth"'' and he praised Florey and Chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug. Fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance, giving him the privilege of naming it: penicillin. He also kept, grew, and distributed the original mould for twelve years, and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin. But Sir [[Henry Harris (scientist)|Henry Harris]] said in 1998: "Without Fleming, no Chain; without Chain, no Florey; without Florey, no Heatley; without Heatley, no penicillin."<ref>Henry Harris, ''Howard Florey and the development of penicillin'', a lecture given on 29 September 1998, at the Florey Centenary, 1898–1998, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford University (sound recording) [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1610017]</ref>

===Antibiotics===
[[File:Staphylococcus aureus (AB Test).jpg|right|thumb|Modern antibiotics are tested using a method similar to Fleming's discovery.]]
Fleming's accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marks the start of modern [[antibiotics]]. Before that, several scientists had published or pointed out that mould or ''penicillium sp.'' were able to inhibit bacterial growth, and even to cure bacterial infections in animals. [[Ernest Duchesne]] in 1897 in his thesis "Contribution to the study of vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between moulds and microbes",<ref name="Duchesne 1897">[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZVXPIK Duchesne 1897], Antagonism between molds and bacteria. An English translation by Michael Witty. Fort Myers, 2013. ASIN B00E0KRZ0E and B00DZVXPIK.</ref> or also [[Clodomiro Picado Twight]] whose work at Institut Pasteur in 1923 on the inhibiting action of fungi of the "Penicillin sp" genre in the growth of staphylococci drew little interest from the direction of the Institut at the time. Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating the penicillin, and by being motivated enough to promote his discovery at a larger scale. Fleming also discovered very early that [[bacteria]] developed [[antibiotic resistance]] whenever too little penicillin was used or when it was used for too short a period. [[Almroth Wright]] had predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noticed during experiments. Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world. He cautioned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for it to be used, and that if it were used, never to use too little, or for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.

==Myths==
The popular story<ref>e.g., ''Philadelphia Enquirer'', 17 July 1945: Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 43 to Chapter 2</ref> of [[Lord Randolph Churchill|Winston Churchill's father]] paying for Fleming's education after Fleming's father saved young [[Winston Churchill|Winston]] from death is false. According to the biography, ''Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution'' by [[Kevin Brown (historian of medicine)|Kevin Brown]], Alexander Fleming, in a letter<ref>14 November 1945; British Library Additional Manuscripts 56115: Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 44 to Chapter 2</ref> to his friend and colleague Andre Gratia,<ref>see Wikipedia [[Discovery of penicillin]] article entry for 1920</ref> described this as ''"A wondrous fable."'' Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during [[World War II]]. Churchill was saved by [[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran|Lord Moran]], using [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamides]], since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in [[Carthage]] in [[Tunisia]] in 1943. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[Morning Post]]'' on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin. He was saved by the new sulphonamide drug [[sulfapyridine|Sulphapyridine]], known at the time under the research code M&B 693, discovered and produced by [[May & Baker|May & Baker Ltd]], [[Dagenham]], [[Essex]] – a subsidiary of the French group [[Rhône-Poulenc]]. In a subsequent [[radio broadcast]], Churchill referred to the new drug as ''"This admirable M&B."''<ref>A History of May & Baker 1834–1984, Alden Press 1984.</ref> It is highly probable that the correct information about the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamide]] did not reach the newspapers because, since the original sulphonamide antibacterial, [[Prontosil]], had been a discovery by the German laboratory [[Bayer]], and as Britain was at war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] at the time, it was thought better to raise British morale by associating Churchill's cure with a British discovery, penicillin.

The laboratory at St Mary's Hospital where Fleming discovered penicillin is home to the [[St Mary's Hospital, London#Fleming Museum|Fleming Museum]], a popular London attraction. His alma mater, [[St Mary's Hospital Medical School]], merged with [[Imperial College London]] in 1988. The ''Sir Alexander Fleming Building'' on the [[South Kensington]] campus was opened in 1998, where his son Robert and his great grand-daughter Claire were presented to the Queen and is now one of the main preclinical teaching sites of the [[Imperial College School of Medicine]].

His other alma mater, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the [[University of Westminster]]) has named one of its student halls of residence ''Alexander Fleming House'', which is near to [[Old Street]].
