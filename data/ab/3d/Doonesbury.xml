Mark was living in Washington, DC, working for<space/><link><target>National Public Radio</target></link>. Michael and J.J. had gotten married, and Mike had dropped out of business school to start work in an advertising agency in New York City. Zonker, still not ready for the &quot;real world&quot;, was living with Mike and J.J. until he was accepted as a medical student at his Uncle Duke's &quot;Baby Doc College&quot; in<space/><link><target>Haiti</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Prior to the hiatus, the strip's characters had aged at the tectonically slow rate standard for comic strips. But when Trudeau returned to<space/><italics>Doonesbury,</italics><space/>the characters began to age in something close to real time, as in<space/><italics><link><target>Gasoline Alley</target></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>For Better or for Worse</target></link>.</italics><space/>Since then, the main characters' ages and career developments have tracked that of standard media portrayals of baby boomers, with jobs in advertising, law enforcement, and the<space/><link><target>Dot-com bubble</target><part>dot-com boom</part></link>.

Originally, strips featuring the President of the United States would show an external view of the<space/><link><target>White House</target></link>, with dialogue emerging from inside. During the<space/><link><target>Gerald Ford</target></link><space/>administration, characters would be shown speaking to Ford at press conferences, and fictional dialogue supposedly spoken by Ford would be written as coming &quot;off-panel&quot;. Similarly, while having several characters as students in a class taught by<space/><link><target>Henry Kissinger</target></link>, the dialogue made up for Kissinger would also come from &quot;off-panel&quot; (although Kissinger had earlier appeared as a character with his face shown in a 1972 series of strips in which he met Mark Slackmeyer while the latter was on a trip to Washington). Sometimes hands, or in rare cases, the back of heads would also be seen.</paragraph><paragraph>Later, personal symbols reflecting some aspect of their character came into use. For example, during the 1980s, character Ron Headrest served as a<space/><link><target>doppelgnger</target></link><space/>for<space/><link><target>Ronald Reagan</target></link><space/>and was depicted as a computer-generated artificial-intelligence, an image based on the television character<space/><italics><link><target>Max Headroom (TV series)</target><part>Max Headroom</part></link></italics>. Members of the<space/><link><target>Bush family</target></link><space/>have been depicted as invisible. During his term as Vice President,<space/><link><target>George H. W. Bush</target></link><space/>was first depicted as completely invisible, his words emanating from a little &quot;voice box&quot; in the air. This was originally a reference to Bush's perceived low profile and his denials of knowledge of the<space/><link><target>Iran-Contra Affair</target></link>. (In one strip, published March 20, 1988, the vice president almost materialized, but only made it to an outline before reverting to invisibility.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.gocomics.com/doonesbury/1988/03/20<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Doonesbury Comic Strip, March 20, 1988</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Garry</arg><arg name="last"><space/>Trudeau</arg><arg name="work">gocomics.com<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/>1988-03-20</arg><arg name="accessdate">September 3, 2011</arg></template></extension>)</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>George W.

The point became a giant<space/><link><target>asterisk</target></link><space/>(a la<space/><link><target>Roger Maris</target></link>) following the<space/><link><target>U.S. presidential election, 2000</target><part>2000 presidential elections</part></link><space/>and the controversy over vote-counting. Later, President Bush's hat was changed to a<space/><link><target>Roman Empire</target><part>Roman</part></link><space/>military helmet (again, atop an asterisk) representing imperialism. Towards the end of his first term, the helmet became battered, with the gilt work starting to come off and with clumps of bristles missing from the top. By late 2008, the helmet had been dented almost beyond recognition. No symbol for<space/><link><target>Barack Obama</target></link><space/>has appeared in the strip; the May 30, 2009, strip had Obama and an aide wondering what the reason for this might be (off panel).<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/archive/2009/05/30'>Doonesbury Strip</link></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Other symbols include a<space/><link><target>Waffle (speech)</target><part>waffle</part></link><space/>for the indecisive<space/><link><target>Bill Clinton</target></link><space/>(chosen by popular votethe other possibility had been a flipping coin), an unexploded (but sometimes lit) bomb for the hot-tempered<space/><link><target>Newt Gingrich</target></link>, a feather for the lightweight<space/><link><target>Dan Quayle</target></link><space/>and a giant groping hand for<space/><link><target>Arnold Schwarzenegger</target></link><space/>(who is addressed by other characters as &quot;Herr Grpenfuhrer&quot;, a reference to accusations of sexual assault against Schwarzenegger).
