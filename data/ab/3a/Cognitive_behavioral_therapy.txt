It works to solve current problems and change unhelpful thinking and behavior.<ref name = CBT/> The name refers to [[Behaviour therapy|behavior therapy]], [[cognitive therapy]], and therapy based upon a combination of basic [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] principles.<ref name = CBT/> Most therapists working with patients dealing with [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] use a blend of cognitive and behavioral therapy. This technique acknowledges that there may be behaviors that cannot be controlled through [[rationality|rational thought]], but rather emerge based on prior conditioning from the environment and other external and/or internal stimuli. CBT is "problem focused" (undertaken for specific problems) and "action oriented" (therapist tries to assist the client in selecting specific strategies to help address those problems),<ref>Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. T., & Wegner, D. M. (2010). Psychology. (2nd ed., p. 600). New York: Worth Pub.</ref> or directive in its therapeutic approach. It is different from the more traditional, [[psychoanalytical]] approach, where therapists look for the unconscious meaning behind the behaviors and then diagnose the patient. Instead, behaviorists believe that disorders, such as depression, have to do with the relationship between a feared stimulus and an avoidance response, resulting in a conditioned fear, much like [[Ivan Pavlov]]. Cognitive therapists believed that conscious thoughts could influence a person’s behavior all on its own. Ultimately, the two theories were combined to create what is now known as cognitive behavioral therapy.<ref>Brewin, C. (1996). Theoretical foundations of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety and depression. Annual Review of Psychology, 47, 33-57.</ref>

CBT is effective for a variety of conditions, including [[Mood disorder|mood]], [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]], [[Personality disorder|personality]], [[Eating disorder|eating]], [[addiction]], [[substance dependence|dependence]], [[Tic disorder|tic]], and [[psychotic disorder]]s. Many CBT treatment programs have been evaluated for symptom-based diagnoses and been favored over approaches such as [[psychodynamic]] treatments.<ref>{{Cite book |author = Lambert MJ, Bergin AE, Garfield SL|editor = Lambert MJ|title = Bergin and Garfield's Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior Change|edition = 5th|year = 2004|publisher = John Wiley & Sons|location = New York|isbn = 0-471-37755-4|pages = 3–15|chapter = Introduction and Historical Overview}}</ref> However, other researchers have questioned the validity of such claims to superiority over other treatments.<ref name=Baardseth>{{cite journal | author = Baardseth T.

== Description ==
Mainstream cognitive [[behavioral therapy]] assumes that changing [[maladaptive]] thinking leads to change in [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[behavior]],<ref name="HassettAL" /> but recent variants emphasize changes in one's relationship to maladaptive thinking rather than changes in thinking itself.<ref name="HayesSC">{{cite journal |doi = 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104449|title = Open, Aware, and Active: Contextual Approaches as an Emerging Trend in the Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies|year = 2011|last1 = Hayes|first1 = Steven C.|last2 = Villatte|first2 = Matthieu|last3 = Levin|first3 = Michael|last4 = Hildebrandt|first4 = Mikaela|journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume = 7|pages = 141–68|pmid = 21219193|issue=1}}</ref> The goal of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is not to diagnose a person with a particular disease, but to look at them as a whole and decide what needs to be fixed. The basic steps in a Cognitive-Behavioral Assessment include

:Step 1: Identify critical behaviors
:Step 2: Determine whether critical behaviors are excesses or deficits
:Step 3: Evaluate critical behaviors for frequency, duration, or intensity (obtain a baseline)
:Step 4: If excess, attempt to decrease frequency, duration, or intensity of behaviors; if deficits, attempt to increase behaviors.
<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Robert|last2=Saccuzzo|first2=Dennis|title=Psychological Testing|publisher=Wadsworth|pages=415, Table 15.3}}</ref>

These steps are based on a system created by Kanfer and Saslow.<ref name="Psychological Testing">{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Robert|last2=Saccuzzo|first2=Dennis|title=Psychological Testing|publisher=Wadsworth|pages=415}}</ref> After identifying the behaviors that need changing, whether they be in excess or deficit, and treatment has occurred, the psychologist must identify whether or not the intervention succeeded. For example, "If the goal was to decrease the behavior, then there should be a decrease relative to the baseline. If the critical behavior remains at or above the baseline, then the intervention has failed." <ref name="Psychological Testing"/>

Therapists or computer-based programs use CBT techniques to help individuals challenge their patterns and beliefs and replace "errors in thinking such as overgeneralizing, magnifying negatives, minimizing positives and catastrophizing" with "more realistic and effective thoughts, thus decreasing emotional distress and self-defeating behavior." <ref name="HassettAL" /> These errors in thinking are known as [[cognitive distortions]]. Cognitive distortions can be either a pseudo- discrimination belief or an over-generalization of something.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dawes|first1=RM|title=COGNITIVE DISTORTION Monograph Supplement 4-V14|journal=Psychological Reports|date=April 1964|volume=14|issue=2|pages=443–459|doi=10.2466/pr0.1964.14.2.443}}</ref> CBT techniques may also be used to help individuals take a more open, mindful, and aware posture toward them so as to diminish their impact.<ref name="HayesSC" /> Mainstream CBT helps individuals replace "maladaptive... coping skills, cognitions, emotions and behaviors with more adaptive ones",<ref name="GatchelRJ" /> by challenging an individual's way of thinking and the way that they react to certain habits or behaviors,<ref>{{cite book |author = Kozier B|title = Fundamentals of nursing: concepts, process and practice|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=_0_pRyy9McQC|year = 2008|publisher = Pearson Education|isbn = 978-0-13-197653-5|page = 187}}</ref> but there is still controversy about the degree to which these traditional cognitive elements account for the effects seen with CBT over and above the earlier behavioral elements such as exposure and skills training.<ref name="LongmoreRJ">{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2006.08.001|title = Do we need to challenge thoughts in cognitive behavior therapy?|year = 2007|last1 = Longmore|first1 = Richard J.|last2 = Worrell|first2 = Michael|journal = Clinical Psychology Review|volume = 27|issue = 2|pages = 173–87|pmid = 17157970}}</ref>

Modern forms of CBT include a number of diverse but related techniques such as [[exposure therapy]], [[cognitive bevavioral therapy#stress inoculation training|stress inoculation training]], [[cognitive processing therapy]], [[cognitive therapy]], [[relaxation training]], [[dialectical behavior therapy]], and [[acceptance and commitment therapy]].<ref>E. B. Foa, ''Effective Treatments for PTSD: Practice Guidelines from the [[International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies]],'' Guilford, New York, NY, USA, 2nd edition, 2009.{{page needed|date = April 2013}}</ref> Some practitioners promote a form of mindful cognitive therapy which includes a greater emphasis on self-awareness as part of the therapeutic process.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Graham|first1 = Michael C.|title = Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date = 2014|publisher = Outskirts Press|isbn = 978-1-4787-2259-5}}</ref>

CBT has six phases:<ref name="GatchelRJ" />
# Assessment or [[psychological assessment]];
# Reconceptualization;
# Skills acquisition;
# Skills consolidation and application training;
# [[Generalization]] and maintenance;
# Post-treatment assessment follow-up.

The reconceptualization phase makes up much of the "cognitive" portion of CBT.<ref name="GatchelRJ" />  A summary of modern CBT approaches is given by Hofmann.<ref>{{cite book |author = Hofmann SG|title = An Introduction to Modern CBT. Psychological Solutions to Mental Health Problems|year = 2011|location = Chichester, UK|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell|isbn = 0-470-97175-4}}{{page needed|date = April 2013}}</ref>

There are different protocols for delivering cognitive behavioral therapy, with important similarities among them.<ref name="HofmannSG">{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.006|title = The Empirical Status of the "New Wave" of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|year = 2010|last1 = Hofmann|first1 = Stefan G.|last2 = Sawyer|first2 = Alice T.|last3 = Fang|first3 = Angela|journal = Psychiatric Clinics of North America|volume = 33|issue = 3|pages = 701–10|pmid = 20599141|pmc = 2898899}}</ref> Use of the term ''CBT'' may refer to different interventions, including "self-instructions (e.g. distraction, imagery, motivational self-talk), relaxation and/or [[biofeedback]], development of adaptive coping strategies (e.g. minimizing negative or self-defeating thoughts), changing maladaptive beliefs about pain, and [[goal setting]]".<ref name="GatchelRJ" /> Treatment is sometimes manualized, with brief, direct, and time-limited treatments for individual psychological disorders that are specific technique-driven. CBT is used in both individual and group settings, and the techniques are often adapted for [[self-help]] applications. Some clinicians and researchers are cognitively oriented (e.g. [[cognitive restructuring]]), while others are more behaviorally oriented (e.g. ''[[in vivo]]'' [[exposure therapy]]). Interventions such as imaginal exposure therapy combine both approaches.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Foa|first1 = Edna B.|last2 = Rothbaum|first2 = Barbara O.|last3 = Furr|first3 = Jami M.|title = Augmenting exposure therapy with other CBT procedures|journal = Psychiatric Annals|volume = 33|issue = 1|date = Jan 2003|pages = 47–53|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-04194-004|doi=10.3928/0048-5713-20030101-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1 = Jessamy|first1 = Hibberd|last2 = Jo|first2 = Usmar|url = http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20553738-this-book-will-make-you-happy|title = This book will make you happy|publisher = Quercus|isbn = 9781848662810|accessdate = 15 July 2014}}</ref>

A basic concept in some CBT treatments used in anxiety disorders is ''in vivo'' [[Exposure therapy|exposure]]. The term refers to the direct confrontation of feared objects, activities, or situations by a patient. For example, a woman with PTSD who fears the location where she was assaulted may be assisted by her therapist in going to that location and directly confronting those fears. Likewise, a person with social anxiety disorder who fears public speaking may be instructed to directly confront those fears by giving a speech.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://ptsd.about.com/od/glossary/g/invivo.htm|title = Definition of In Vivo Exposure|publisher = Ptsd.about.com|date = 2014-06-09|accessdate = 2014-08-14}}</ref> This "two-factor" model is often credited to [[Orval Hobart Mowrer|O. Hobart Mowrer]].<ref>{{Cite book |publisher = Wiley|location = New York|author = Mowrer OH|title = Learning theory and behavior|year = 1960|isbn = 0-88275-127-1}}{{Page needed|date = April 2012}}</ref> Through exposure to the stimulus, this harmful conditioning can be "unlearned" (referred to as [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] and [[habituation]]). Studies have provided evidence that when examining animals and humans that [[glucocorticoids]] may possibly lead to a more successful extinction learning during exposure therapy. For instance, [[glucocorticoids]] can prevent aversive learning episodes from being retrieved and heighten reinforcement of memory traces creating a non-fearful reaction in feared situations. A combination of [[glucocorticoids]] and exposure therapy may be a better improved treatment for treating patients with anxiety disorders.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com.mutex.gmu.edu/science/article/pii/S088761850900214X|title = Enhancing exposure therapy for anxiety disorders with glucocorticoids: From basic mechanisms of emotional learning to clinical applications|last = Bentz|first = Dorothée|date = October 29, 2009|journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders|volume = 24|issue = 2|pages = 223–30|accessdate = 2014-10-26|doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2009.10.011|pmid = 19962269|last2 = Michael|first2 = Tanja|last3 = De Quervain|first3 = Dominique J.-F.|last4 = Wilhelm|first4 = Frank H.}}</ref>

=== Schizophrenia, psychosis and mood disorders ===
Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression.<ref name="DriessenE" /> The [[American Psychiatric Association]] Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and [[interpersonal psychotherapy]] had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of [[major depressive disorder]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hirschfeld |first=Robert M.A. |doi = 10.1176/appi.books.9780890423363.50051 |doi-broken-date=2015-04-14 |chapter = Guideline Watch: Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Bipolar Disorder, 2nd Edition|year = 2006|isbn = 0-89042-336-9|volume = 1|title=APA Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Comprehensive Guidelines and Guideline Watches|chapter-url=http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/bipolar-watch.pdf |chapter-format=PDF}}</ref>{{page needed|date = April 2013}} One [[Etiology|etiological]] theory of depression is [[Aaron T. Beck]]'s cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think the way they do because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.<ref name="Neale247">{{Cite book|author = Neale JM, Davison GC|title = Abnormal psychology|edition = 8th|publisher = John Wiley & Sons|location = New York|year = 2001|page = 247|isbn = 0-471-31811-6}}</ref>

Beck also described a negative [[Beck's cognitive triad|cognitive triad]], made up of the negative schemata and cognitive biases of the person, theorizing that depressed individuals make negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future. Depressed people, according to this theory, have views such as, "I never do a good job", "It is impossible to have a good day", and "things will never get better." A negative schema helps give rise to the cognitive bias, and the cognitive bias helps fuel the negative schema. This is the negative triad. Beck further proposed that depressed people often have the following cognitive biases: [[arbitrary inference]], [[selective abstraction]], over-generalization, magnification, and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]].

In long-term [[Psychosis|psychoses]], CBT is used to complement medication and is adapted to meet individual needs. Interventions particularly related to these conditions include exploring reality testing, changing delusions and hallucinations, examining factors which precipitate relapse, and managing relapses.<ref name="GutierrezM" /><!-- cites previous two sentences --> Severeal meta-analyses suggested that CBT is effective in [[schizophrenia]],<ref name="RathodS" /><ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbm114|title = Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Schizophrenia: Effect Sizes, Clinical Models, and Methodological Rigor|year = 2007|last1 = Wykes|first1 = T.|last2 = Steel|first2 = C.|last3 = Everitt|first3 = B.|last4 = Tarrier|first4 = N.|journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin|volume = 34|issue = 3|pages = 523–37|pmid = 17962231|pmc = 2632426}}</ref> and the [[American Psychiatric Association]] includes CBT in its schizophrenia guideline as an evidence-based treatment.

According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), cognitive behavioral therapy can also be used to reduce prejudice towards others. This other-directed prejudice can cause depression in the "others," or in the self when a person becomes part of a group he or she previously had prejudice towards (i.e. deprejudice).<ref name="Cox et al.

=== With older adults ===
CBT is used to help people of all ages, but the therapy should be adjusted based on the age of the patient with whom the therapist is dealing.  Older individuals in particular have certain characteristics that need to be acknowledged and the therapy altered to account for these differences thanks to age.<ref name="Bienenfeld">{{cite journal |last = Bienenfeld|first = David|year = 2009|title = Cognitive therapy with older adults|url = http://www.healio.com/psychiatry/journals/psycann/%7B32eb9933-7d29-4539-8e63-0da2e9a2d58e%7D/cognitive-therapy-with-older-adults|journal = Psychiatric Annals|volume = 39|issue = 9|pages = 828–32|doi = 10.3928/00485713-20090821-02}}</ref>  Some of the challenges to CBT because of age include the following:

; The Cohort effect
: The times that each generation lives through partially shape its thought processes as well as values, so a 70-year-old may react to the therapy very differently from a 30-year-old, because of the different culture in which they were brought up.  A tie-in to this effect is that each generation has to interact with one another, and the differing values clashing with one another may make the therapy more difficult.<ref name="Bienenfeld" />

; Established role
:  By the time one reaches old age, the person has a definitive idea of her or his role in life and is invested in that role.  This social role can dominate who the person thinks he or she is and may make it difficult to adapt to the changes required in CBT.<ref name="Bienenfeld" />

; Mentality toward aging
:  If the older individual sees aging itself as a negative this can exacerbate whatever malady the therapy is trying to help (depression and anxiety for example).<ref name="Bienenfeld" /> Negative stereotypes and prejudice against the elderly cause depression as the stereotypes become self-relevant.<ref name="Cox et al. (2012)" />

; Processing speed decreases
:  As we age, we take longer to learn new information, and as a result may take more time to learn and retain the cognitive therapy.  Therefore, therapists should slow down the pacing of the therapy and use any tools both written and verbal that will improve the retention of the cognitive behavioral therapy.<ref name="Bienenfeld" />

===Prevention of mental illness ===

For anxiety disorders, use of CBT with people at risk has significantly reduced the number of episodes of generalized anxiety disorder and other anxiety symptoms, and also given significant improvements in explanatory style, hopelessness, and dysfunctional attitudes.<ref name="pmid20948835" /><ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1037/1522-3736.2.1.28a|title = The prevention of depression and anxiety|year = 1999|last1 = Seligman|first1 = Martin E.

== History ==

=== Philosophical roots ===
Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of CBT have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly [[Stoicism]].<ref>{{Cite book |url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&pg=PR19&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false|title = The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy|author = Donald Robertson|page = xix|year = 2010|publisher = Karnac|location = London|isbn = 978-1-85575-756-1}}</ref> For example, [[Aaron T. Beck]]'s original treatment manual for depression states, "The philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers".<ref>{{cite book |author = Beck AT, Rush AJ, Shaw BF, Emery G|year = 1979|title = Cognitive Therapy of Depression|page = 8|publisher = Guilford Press|location = New York|isbn = 0-89862-000-7}}</ref> Another example of Stoic influence on cognitive theorists is [[Epictetus]] on Albert Ellis.<ref name = Engler>Engler, B. (2006). Personality theories (7th Ed.) p. 424.

An intellectual history of psychology (3rd Ed). Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press.</ref>

=== Behavior therapy roots ===
The modern roots of CBT can be traced to the development of [[behavior therapy]] in the early 20th century, the development of cognitive therapy in the 1960s, and the subsequent merging of the two. Groundbreaking work of behaviorism began with [[John B. Watson|Watson]]'s and Rayner's studies of [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] in 1920.<ref name = Trull>Trull, T. J. (2007). Clinical psychology (7th Ed). Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth.</ref> Behaviorally-centered therapeutic approaches appeared as early as 1924<ref name="Rachman_1997">{{Cite book|author = Rachman, S|editor = Clark, D, Fairburn, CG & Gelder, MG|title = Science and practice of cognitive behaviour therapy|chapter = The evolution of cognitive behaviour therapy|pages = 1–26|year = 1997|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|isbn = 0-19-262726-0}}</ref> with [[Mary Cover Jones]]' work on the unlearning of fears in children.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1037/h0072283|title = The Elimination of Children's Fears|year = 1924|last1 = Jones|first1 = M. C.|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume = 7|issue = 5|pages = 382–390}}</ref> These were the antecedents of the development of [[Joseph Wolpe]]'s behavioral therapy in the 1950s.<ref name = Trull/> It was the work of Wolpe and Watson, which was based on [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s work on learning and conditioning, that influenced [[Hans Eysenck]] and [[Arnold Lazarus]] to develop new behavioral therapy techniques based on [[classical conditioning]].<ref name = Trull/><ref name = Corsini>Corsini, R. J. & Wedding, D. (Eds.) (2008). Current psychotherapies (8th Ed.). Belmont, CA: Thomson Brooks/Cole.</ref>

During the 1950s and 1960s, behavioral therapy became widely utilized by researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, who were inspired by the [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] learning theory of [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[Clark L. Hull]].<ref name="Rachman_1997" /> In Britain, this work was mostly focused on the neurotic disorders through the work of [[Joseph Wolpe]], who applied the findings of animal experiments to his method of [[systematic desensitization]],<ref name = Trull/> the precursor to today's fear reduction techniques.<ref name="Rachman_1997" /> British psychologist [[Hans Eysenck]] presented behavior therapy as a constructive alternative.<ref name="Rachman_1997" /><ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1037/h0063633|title = The effects of psychotherapy: An evaluation|year = 1952|last1 = Eysenck|first1 = H. J.|journal = Journal of Consulting Psychology|volume = 16|issue = 5|pages = 319–24|pmid = 13000035}}</ref>

At the same time this of Eysenck's work, [[B.F. Skinner]] and his associates were beginning to have an impact with their work on [[operant conditioning]].<ref name = Trull/><ref name = Corsini/> Skinner's work was referred to as [[radical behaviorism]] and avoided anything related to cognition.<ref name = Trull/> However, [[Julian Rotter]], in 1954, and [[Albert Bandura]], in 1969, contributed behavior therapy with their respective work on [[social learning theory]], by demonstrating the effects of cognition on learning and behavior modification.<ref name = Trull/><ref name = Corsini/>

The emphasis on behavioral factors constituted the "first wave" of CBT.<ref name = Wilson>Wilson, G. T. (2008). ''Behavior therapy''. In R. J. Corsini & D. Wedding. ''Current psychotherapies'' (8th ed.). pp 63-106. Belmont, CA: Thomson Brooks/Cole.</ref>

=== Cognitive therapy roots ===
One of the first therapists to address cognition in psychotherapy was [[Alfred Adler]] with his notion of [[Classical Adlerian psychology|basic mistakes]] and their role on unhealthy or unpleasant emotions.<ref name = AP>Mosak H. H. & Maniacci, M. (2008). ''Adlerian psychotherapy''. In R. J. Corsini & D. Wedding. ''Current psychotherapies'' (8th ed.). pp 63-106. Belmont, CA: Thomson Brooks/Cole.</ref>  Adler's work influenced the work of [[Albert Ellis]],<ref name="AP" /> who developed one of the earliest cognitive-based psychotherapies, known today as [[Rational emotive behavior therapy]], or REBT.<ref>Ellis, A. (2008). ''Rational emotive behavior therapy''. In R. J. Corsini & D. Wedding. ''Current psychotherapies'' (8th ed.). pp 63-106. Belmont, CA: Thomson Brooks/Cole.</ref>

Around the same time that rational emotive therapy, as it was known then, was being developed, [[Aaron T. Beck]] was conducting [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] sessions in his [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] practice.<ref name="EABH">Oatley, K. (2004). ''Emotions: A brief history'' p. 53. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.</ref> During these sessions, Beck noticed that thoughts were not as unconscious as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] had previously theorized, and that certain types of thinking were the culprits of emotional distress.<ref name="EABH" /> It was from this discovery that Beck developed [[cognitive therapy]] and called these thoughts "automatic thoughts".<ref name="EABH" />

It was these two therapies, rational emotive therapy and cognitive therapy, that started the "second wave" of CBT, which was the emphasis on cognitive factors.<ref name="Wilson" />

=== Behavior and cognitive therapies merge ===
Although the early behavioral approaches were successful in many of the neurotic disorders, they had little success in treating [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name="Trull" /><ref name="Rachman_1997" /><ref>Thorpe, G. L. & Olson, S. L. (1997). Behavior therapy: Concepts, procedures, and applications (2nd ed.). Boston, MA: Allyn & Bacon.</ref> Behaviorism was also losing in popularity due to the so-called "[[cognitive revolution]]". The therapeutic approaches of [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] and [[Aaron T. Beck]] gained popularity among behavior therapists, despite the earlier behaviorist rejection of "[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]]" concepts like thoughts and cognitions.<ref name="Trull" />  Both of these systems included behavioral elements and interventions and primarily concentrated on problems in the present.

In initial studies, cognitive therapy was often contrasted with behavioral treatments to see which was most effective. During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive and behavioral techniques were merged into cognitive behavioral therapy. Pivotal to this merging was the successful development of treatments for [[panic disorder]] by [[David M. Clark]] in the UK and [[David H. Barlow]] in the US.<ref name="Rachman_1997" />

Over time, cognitive behavior therapy became to be known not only as a therapy, but as an umbrella term for all cognitive-based psychotherapies.<ref name="Trull" /> These therapies include, but are not limited to, rational emotive therapy, cognitive therapy, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]], [[dialectical behavior therapy]], [[reality therapy]]/[[Glasser's choice theory|choice theory]], [[cognitive processing therapy]], [[Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing|EMDR]], and [[multimodal therapy]].<ref name ="Trull" /> All of these therapies are a blending of cognitive- and behavior-based elements.

This blending of theoretical and technical foundations from both behavior and cognitive therapies constitute the "third wave" of CBT,<ref name="Wilson" /> which is the current wave.<ref name="Wilson" /> The most prominent therapies of this third wave are dialectical behavior therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy.<ref name="Wilson" />

A typical CBT programme would consist of face-to-face sessions between patient and therapist, made up of 6-18 sessions of around an hour each with a gap of a 1–3 weeks between sessions. This initial programme might be followed by some booster sessions, for instance after one month and three months.<ref>{{cite book |title = Cognitive behavioural therapy for the management of common mental health problems|url = http://www.nice.org.uk/media/878/F7/CBTCommissioningGuide.pdf|publisher = [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]]|date = April 2008}}{{page needed|date = April 2013}}</ref> CBT has also been found to be effective if patient and therapist type in real time to each other over computer links.<ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61257-5|title = Therapist-delivered internet psychotherapy for depression in primary care: A randomised controlled trial|year = 2009|last1 = Kessler|first1 = David|last2 = Lewis|first2 = Glyn|last3 = Kaur|first3 = Surinder|last4 = Wiles|first4 = Nicola|last5 = King|first5 = Michael|last6 = Weich|first6 = Scott|last7 = Sharp|first7 = Debbie J|last8 = Araya|first8 = Ricardo|last9 = Hollinghurst|first9 = Sandra| displayauthors = 8|journal = The Lancet|volume = 374|issue = 9690|pages = 628–34|pmid = 19700005|last10 = Peters|first10 = Tim J}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.073080|title = Cost-effectiveness of therapist-delivered online cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression: Randomised controlled trial|year = 2010|last1 = Hollinghurst|first1 = S.|last2 = Peters|first2 = T.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is most closely allied with the [[scientist–practitioner model]] in which clinical practice and research is informed by a scientific perspective, clear [[operationalization]] of the problem, and an emphasis on [[measurement]], including measuring changes in cognition and behavior and in the attainment of [[goal]]s. These are often met through "[[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]]" assignments in which the patient and the therapist work together to craft an assignment to complete before the next session.<ref name="Martin">{{Unreliable medical source|date = April 2012}}

=== Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy ===
{{Main|Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy}}
Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy (CEBT) is a form of (CBT) developed initially for individuals with eating disorders but now used with a range of problems including [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and anger problems. It combines aspects of CBT and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy and aims to improve understanding and tolerance of emotions in order to facilitate the therapeutic process. It is frequently used as a 'pretreatment' to prepare and better equip individuals for longer term therapy.

=== Structured cognitive behavioral training ===
{{Main|Structured cognitive behavioral training}}
Structured cognitive behavioral training (SCBT) is a cognitive-based process with core philosophies that draw heavily from CBT. Like CBT, SCBT asserts that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. SCBT also builds on core CBT philosophy by incorporating other well-known modalities in the fields of [[behavioral health]] and [[psychology]]: most notably, [[Albert Ellis]]'s [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]]. SCBT differs from CBT in two distinct ways. Firstly, SCBT is delivered in a highly regimented format. Secondly, SCBT is a predetermined and finite training process that becomes personalized by the input of the participant. SCBT is designed with the intention to bring a participant to a specific result in a specific period of time. SCBT has been used to challenge addictive behavior, particularly with substances such as tobacco, alcohol and food; and to manage [[diabetes]] and subdue stress and anxiety. SCBT has also been used in the field of [[criminal psychology]] in the effort to reduce recidivism.

=== {{anchor|MRT}}Moral reconation therapy ===
Moral reconation therapy, a type of CBT used to help felons overcome Anti-Social Personality Disorder, slightly decreases the risk of further offending.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=LM|last2=Wormith|first2=JS|title=A meta-analysis of moral reconation therapy.|journal=International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology|date=September 2013|volume=57|issue=9|pages=1076–106|pmid=22744908|doi=10.1177/0306624x12447771}}</ref> It is generally implemented in a group format because of the risk of offenders with ASPD being given one on one therapy reinforces narcissistic behavioral characteristics, and can be used in correctional or outpatient settings.

=== Stress Inoculation Training ===
This type of therapy uses a blend of cognitive, behavioral and a some humanistic training techniques to target the stressors of the client. This usually is used to help clients better cope with their stress or anxiety after stressful events.<ref name="Meichenbaum 1996 4–7">{{cite journal|last= Meichenbaum| first = D|title = Stress Inoculation Training for Coping with Stressors| journal = The Clinical Psychologist | year = 1996|volume = 69|pages = 4–7}}</ref> This is a three phase process that trains the client to use skills that they already have to better adapt to their current stressors. The first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client self-monitoring, and a variety of reading materials. This allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client.<ref name="Meichenbaum 1996 4–7"/> Clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion- focused or problem focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. This phase ultimately prepares the client to eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking at ways to change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. The focus is conceptualization.<ref name="Meichenbaum 1996 4–7"/>

The second phase emphasizes the aspect of skills acquisition and rehearsal that continues from the earlier phase of conceptualization. The client is taught skill that help them cope with their stressors. These skills are then practised in the space of therapy. These skills involve self-regulation, problem solving, interpersonal
communication skills, etc.<ref name="Meichenbaum 1996 4–7"/>

The third and final phase is the application and following through of the skills learned in the training process. This gives the client opportunities to apply their learned skills to a wide range of stressors. Activities include role-playing, imagery, modeling, etc.
In the end, the client will have been trained on a preventative basis to inoculate personal, chronic, and future stressors by breaking down their stressors into problems they will address in long-term, short-term, and intermediate coping goals.<ref name="Meichenbaum 1996 4–7"/>

== Criticisms ==
The research conducted for CBT has been a topic of sustained controversy. While some researchers write that CBT is more effective than other treatments,<ref name=Tolin>{{cite journal | author = Tolin D.

D., & William, R. N. (1995). ''What’s behind the research? Discovering hidden assumptions in the behavioral sciences''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref><ref name=Fancher>Fancher, R. T. (1995). ''Cultures of healing: Correcting the image of American mental health care''. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company.</ref> have questioned the validity of such claims. For example, one study<ref name = Tolin/> determined CBT to be superior to other treatments in treating anxiety and depression. However, researchers<ref name = Baardseth/> responding directly to that study conducted a re-analysis and found no evidence of CBT being superior to other bona fide treatments, and conducted an analysis of thirteen other CBT clinical trials and determined that they failed to provide evidence of CBT superiority.

Additionally, a recent meta-analysis revealed that the positive effects of CBT on depression have been declining since 1977.<!-- <ref name = Johnsen2015/> --> The overall results showed two different declines in [[effect size]]s: 1) an overall decline between 1977 and 2014, and 2) a steeper decline between 1995 and 2014. Additional sub-analysis revealed that CBT studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to adhere to the Beck CBT manual had a steeper decline in effect sizes since 1977 than studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to use CBT without a manual. The authors reported that they were unsure why the effects were declining but did list inadequate therapist training, failure to adhere to a manual, lack of therapist experience, and patients' hope and faith in its efficacy waning as potential reasons.<!-- <ref name = Johnsen2015/> --> The authors did mention that the current study was limited to depression disorders only.<ref name = Johnsen2015>{{cite journal|last1=Johnsen|first1=TJ|last2=Friborg|first2=O|title=The effects of cognitive behavioral therapy as an anti-depressive treatment is falling: A meta-analysis.|journal=Psychological bulletin|date=July 2015|volume=141|issue=4|pages=747–68|pmid=25961373}}</ref>

Furthermore, other researchers<ref name = Cuijpers/> write that CBT studies have high drop-out rates compared to other treatments. At times, the CBT drop-out rates can be more than five times higher than other treatments groups. For example, the researchers provided statistics of 28 participants in a group receiving CBT therapy dropping out, compared to 5 participants in a group receiving problem-solving therapy dropping out, or 11 participants in a group receiving [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] therapy dropping out.<ref name = Cuijpers/> This high drop-out rate is also evident in the treatment of several disorders particularly anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder commonly treated by CBT. People with anorexia nervosa who are treated with CBT have a high percent chance of dropping out of therapy before completion and reverting to their aneroxia behaviors.<ref>Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan (2014). Abnormal Psychology (6 ed.). McGraw-Hill Education. p. 357. ISBN 9781259060724.</ref>

Other researchers<ref name = Glenn/> conducting an analysis of treatments for youth who self-injure found similar drop-out rates in CBT and [[Dialectical behavioral therapy|DBT]] groups. In this study, the researchers analyzed several clinical trials that measured the efficacy of CBT administered to youth who self-injure. The researchers concluded that none of them were found to be efficacious. These conclusions<ref name = Glenn/> were made using the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] Division 12 Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures to determine intervention potency.<ref name = Chambless>Chambless, D. L., Babich, K., Crits-Christoph, P., Frank, E., Gilson, M., & Montgomery, R. (1993). ''Task force on the promotion and dissemination of psychological procedures: A reported adopted by the Division 12 Board''. Unpublished report.</ref>

However, the research methods employed in CBT research have not been the only criticisms identified. Others have called CBT theory and therapy into question. For example, Fancher<ref name = Fancher/> writes the CBT has failed to provide a framework for clear and correct thinking. He states that it is strange for CBT theorists to develop a framework for determining [[Cognitive distortion|distorted thinking]] without ever developing a framework for "cognitive clarity" or what would count as "healthy, normal thinking." Additionally, he writes that irrational thinking cannot be a source of mental and emotional distress when there is no evidence of rational thinking causing psychological well-being. Or, that social psychology has proven the normal cognitive processes of the average person to be irrational, even those who are psychologically well. Fancher also says that the theory of CBT is inconsistent with basic principles and research of rationality, and even ignores many rules of logic. He argues that CBT makes something of thinking that is far less exciting and true than thinking probably is. Among his other arguments are the maintaining of the status quo promoted in CBT, the self-deception encouraged within clients and patients engaged in CBT, how poorly the research is conducted, and some of its basic tenets and norms: "The basic norm of cognitive therapy is this: except for how the patient thinks, everything is ok".<ref>Fancher, R. T. (1995). ''Cultures of healing: Correcting the image of American mental health care (p. 231)''. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company.</ref>

Meanwhile, Slife and Williams<ref name = Slife/> write that one of the hidden assumptions in CBT is that of [[determinism]], or the absence of [[free will]]. They argue that CBT invokes a type of cause-and-effect relationship with cognition. They state that CBT holds that external stimuli from the environment enter the mind, causing different thoughts that cause emotional states. Nowhere in CBT theory is agency, or free will, accounted for. At its most basic foundational assumptions, CBT holds that human beings have no free will and are just determined by the cognitive processes invoked by external stimuli.

Another criticism of CBT theory, especially as applied to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), is that it confounds the symptoms of the disorder with its causes.<ref name="psychiatrictimes.com">Berger, D. Psychiatric Times, July 30, 2013. http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-escape-binds-tight-methodology/page/0/1?cid=fb#sthash.ti9rtA48.dpuf</ref>

A major criticism has been that clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., neither subjects nor therapists in psychotherapy studies are blind to the type of treatment). They may be single-blinded, i.e. the rater may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are unblinded). The patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in.<ref name="psychiatrictimes.com" />

The importance of double-blinding was shown in a meta-analysis that examined the effectiveness of CBT when placebo control and blindedness were factored in.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Lynch D, Laws KR, McKenna PJ|year = 2010|title = Cognitive behavioral therapy for major psychiatric disorder: does it really work? A meta-analytical review of well-controlled trials|url = |journal = Psychol Med|volume = 40|issue = 1|pages = 9–24|doi = 10.1017/S003329170900590X|pmid = 19476688|last2 = Laws|last3 = McKenna}}</ref>  Pooled data from published trials of CBT in schizophrenia, MDD, and bipolar disorder that used controls for non-specific effects of intervention were analyzed. This study concluded that CBT is no better than non-specific control interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia and does not reduce relapse rates, treatment effects are small in treatment studies of MDD, and it is not an effective treatment strategy for prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder. For MDD, the authors note that the pooled effect size was very low. Nevertheless, the methodological processes used to select the studies in the previously mentioned meta-analysis and the worth of its findings have been called into question.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid = 19917145|year = 2010|last1 = Lincoln|first1 = TM|title = Letter to the editor: A comment on Lynch et al.
