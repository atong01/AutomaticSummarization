The widow, disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son.</paragraph><paragraph>As a teenager, Barry becomes strongly attached to his older cousin, Nora Brady. Though she charms him during a card game, she later shows interest in a well-off English Captain John Quin, much to Barry's dismay. Nora and her family plan to relieve their poverty with an advantageous marriage, but Barry refuses to accept the situation and shoots Quin in a duel. Barry flees to<space/><link><target>Dublin</target></link>, but en route is robbed of purse and equipment by Captain Feeney, an infamous<space/><link><target>highwayman</target></link>. Broke, Barry joins the British army, whereupon he reunites with Captain Grogan, a family friend, who informs him that, in fact, he did not kill QuinBarry's dueling pistol was loaded with<space/><link><target>tow</target></link>. The duel was staged by Nora's family to get rid of Barry so that their family finances would be secured through the marriage of Nora and Quin.</paragraph><paragraph>Barrys regiment is sent to Germany to fight in the<space/><link><target>Seven Years' War</target></link>, where Captain Grogan is fatally wounded by the French in a skirmish at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Minden</target></link>. Barry deserts the army, stealing an officer courier's uniform, horse, and identification papers. En route to neutral Holland he encounters the Prussian Captain Potzdorf, who, seeing through his disguise, offers him the choice of being turned back over to the British where he will be shot as a deserter, or enlisting in the Prussian army. Barry enlists in his second army and later receives a special commendation from<space/><link><target>Frederick the Great</target></link><space/>for saving Potzdorf's life in a battle.</paragraph><paragraph>After the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by Captain Potzdorf's uncle in the Prussian Ministry of Police to become the servant of the Chevalier de Balibari, a professional gambler. The Prussians suspect he is a spy and send Barry as an undercover agent to verify this. Barry reveals himself to the Chevalier right away and they become confederates in cheating at cards. After he and the Chevalier cheat the Prince of Tbingen at the card table, the Prince accuses the Chevalier (without proof) and refuses to pay his debt and demands satisfaction. When Barry relays this to his Prussian handlers, they (still suspecting that the Chevalier is a spy) are wary of allowing another meeting between the Chevalier and the Prince. So, the Prussians arrange for the Chevalier to be expelled from the country. Barry conveys this plan to the Chevalier, who flees in the night. The next morning, Barry, under disguise as the Chevalier, is escorted from Prussian territory by Prussian officers.</paragraph><paragraph>For the next few years, Barry and the Chevalier travel the spas and parlors of Europe, profiting from their gambling with Barry forcing payment from reluctant debtors with a duel. Seeing that his life is going nowhere, Barry decides to marry into wealth. At a gambling table in<space/><link><target>Spa</target></link>, he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon (<link><target>Marisa Berenson</target></link>). He seduces and later marries her after the death of her elderly husband, Sir Charles Lyndon (<link><target>Frank Middlemass</target></link>).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Act II</heading><list type='ident'><listitem><italics>Containing an Account of the Misfortunes and Disasters Which Befell Barry Lyndon</italics></listitem></list><paragraph>In 1773, Barry takes the Countess' last name in marriage and settles in England to enjoy her wealth, still with no money of his own. Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's 10-year-old son by Sir Charles, does not approve of the marriage and quickly comes to hate Barry, aware that Barry is merely a &quot;common opportunist&quot; and does not love his mother. The Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, but the marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and enjoys spending his wife's money in self-indulgent spending sprees while keeping his wife in dull seclusion.</paragraph><paragraph>Some years later, Barry's mother comes to live with him at the Lyndon estate. She warns her son that his position is precarious: If Lady Lyndon were to die, all her wealth would go to her first-born son Lord Bullingdon, leaving Barry penniless. Barry's mother advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself. To further this goal, he cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover and begins to expend even larger sums of money to ingratiate himself to high society. All this effort is wasted, however, during a birthday party for Lady Lyndon, where Lord Bullingdon announces his hatred of his stepfather and his intention to leave the family estate for as long as his mother remains married to Barry. Angered, Barry assaults Bullingdon before the guests. This public display of cruelty loses Barry all the powerful friends he has worked so hard to make and he is shunned socially. Bullingdon makes good on his announcement and leaves the estate and England itself for parts unknown.</paragraph><paragraph>In contrast to his mistreatment of his stepson, Barry proves a compassionate and doting father to Bryan, with whom he spends all his time after Bullingdon's departure. He cannot refuse his son anything, and succumbs to Bryan's insistence on receiving a full-grown horse for his ninth birthday. The spoiled Bryan disobeys his parents' direct instructions that Bryan ride the horse only in the presence of his father, and is thrown by the horse. Bryan dies a few days later from his injuries.</paragraph><paragraph>The grief-stricken Barry turns to alcohol, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt, who had been tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan. Left in charge of the families' affairs while Barry and Lady Lyndon grieve, Barry's mother dismisses the Reverend, both because the family no longer needs (nor can afford, due to Barry's spending debts) a tutor and for fear that his influence worsens Lady Lyndon's condition. Plunging even deeper into grief, Lady Lyndon later attempts suicide (though she ingests only enough poison to make herself ill). The Reverend and the family's accountant and emissary Graham then seek out Lord Bullingdon. Upon hearing of these events, Lord Bullingdon returns to England where he finds Barry drunk in a gentlemen's club, mourning the loss of his son rather than being with Lady Lyndon. Bullingdon demands<space/><link><target>Duel#Offense and satisfaction</target><part>satisfaction</part></link><space/>for Barry's public assault, challenging him to a duel.</paragraph><paragraph>The duel with pistols is held in a<space/><link><target>tithe barn</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="title"><space/>Kubrick: The Definitive Edition</arg><arg name="url"><space/>https://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Macmillan</arg><arg name="date"><space/>2003-09-01</arg><arg name="access-date"><space/>2015-04-19</arg><arg name="isbn"><space/>9780571211081</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Michel</arg><arg name="last"><space/>Ciment</arg><arg name="first2"><space/>Gilbert</arg><arg name="last2"><space/>Adair</arg><arg name="first3"><space/>Robert</arg><arg name="last3"><space/>Bononno</arg><arg name="page"><space/>175</arg></template></extension><space/>A coin-toss gives Bullingdon the right of first fire, but his pistol misfires as it is being cocked. Barry, reluctant to shoot Bullingdon, magnanimously<space/><link><target>Delope</target><part>fires into the ground</part></link>, but the unmoved Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end, claiming he has not yet received &quot;satisfaction&quot;. In the second round, Bullingdon shoots Barry in his left leg. At a nearby inn, a surgeon informs Barry that the leg will need to be amputated below the knee if he is to survive.</paragraph><paragraph>While Barry is recovering, Bullingdon takes control of the estate. He sends a very nervous Graham to the inn with a proposition: Bullingdon will grant Barry an<space/><link><target>Life annuity</target><part>annuity</part></link><space/>of 500 guineas per year for life on the conditions that he leave England forever and so effectively end his marriage to Lady Lyndon. Otherwise, with his credit and bank accounts exhausted, Barry's creditors and bill collectors will assuredly see that he is jailed. Defeated, Barry accepts. The narrator states that Barry goes first to Ireland with his mother, then to the European continent to resume his former profession of gambler (though without his former success) and that he never sees Lady Lyndon again. The final scene (set in December 1789) shows the middle-aged Lady Lyndon signing Barry's annuity cheque as Bullingdon looks on.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Epilogue</heading><list type='ident'><listitem><italics>It was in the reign of<space/><link><target>George III</target></link><space/>that the aforesaid personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now.</italics></listitem></list><heading level='2'>Cast</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Suits.BarryLyndon.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Original suits used in ''Barry Lyndon''</part></link><template><target>div col</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Michael Hordern</target></link><space/>(<italics>voice</italics>) as Narrator</listitem><listitem><link><target>Ryan O'Neal</target></link><space/>as Redmond Barry (later Redmond Barry Lyndon)</listitem><listitem><link><target>Marisa Berenson</target></link><space/>as Lady Lyndon</listitem><listitem><link><target>Patrick Magee (actor)</target><part>Patrick Magee</part></link><space/>as the Chevalier du Balibari</listitem><listitem><link><target>Hardy Krger</target></link><space/>as Captain Potzdorf</listitem><listitem><link><target>Gay Hamilton</target></link><space/>as Nora Brady</listitem><listitem><link><target>Godfrey Quigley</target></link><space/>as Captain Grogan</listitem><listitem><link><target>Steven Berkoff</target></link><space/>as Lord Ludd</listitem><listitem><link><target>Marie Kean</target></link><space/>as Belle, Barry's mother</listitem><listitem><link><target>Murray Melvin</target></link><space/>as Reverend Samuel Runt</listitem><listitem><link><target>Frank Middlemass</target></link><space/>as Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon</listitem><listitem><link><target>Leon Vitali</target></link><space/>as Lord Bullingdon<list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Dominic Savage</target></link><space/>as young Bullingdon</listitem></list></listitem><listitem><link><target>Leonard Rossiter</target></link><space/>as Captain John Quin</listitem><listitem><link><target>Andr Morell</target></link><space/>as Lord Wendover</listitem><listitem><link><target>Anthony Sharp</target></link><space/>as Lord Hallam</listitem><listitem><link><target>Philip Stone</target></link><space/>as Graham</listitem><listitem><link><target>David Morley (musician)</target><part>David Morley</part></link><space/>as Bryan Patrick Lyndon</listitem><listitem><link><target>Diana Krner</target><part>Diana Koerner</part></link><space/>as Lischen (German Girl)</listitem><listitem><link><target>Arthur O'Sullivan</target></link><space/>as Captain Feeney</listitem><listitem><link><target>Billy Boyle</target></link><space/>as Seamus Feeney</listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>div col end</target></template>Critic Tim Robey suggests, that the film &quot;makes you realise that the most undervalued aspect of Kubrick's genius could well be his way with actors.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="TelegraphReview"></extension><space/>He adds that the<space/><link><target>Supporting character</target><part>supporting cast</part></link><space/>is a &quot;glittering procession of<space/><link><target>Cameo appearance</target><part>cameo</part><trail>s</trail></link>, not from star names but from vital character players.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="TelegraphReview"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The cast featured Leon Vitali as the older Lord Bullingdon, who would then become Kubrick's<space/><link><target>personal assistant</target></link>, working as the<space/><link><target>casting director</target></link><space/>on his following films, and supervising film-to-video transfers for Kubrick.

In addition to potentially seeming more realistic, these methods also gave a particular period look to the film which has often been likened to 18th-century paintings (which were, of course, depicting a world devoid of electric lighting), in particular owing &quot;a lot to<space/><link><target>William Hogarth</target></link>, with whom Thackeray had always been fascinated.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="TelegraphReview"></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:William Hogarth 035.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>right</part><part>Hogarth's ''The Country Dance'' (c.1745) illustrates the type of interior scene that Kubrick sought to emulate with ''Barry Lyndon''.</part></link>According to critic Tim Robey, the film has a &quot;stately, painterly, often determinedly static quality.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="TelegraphReview"></extension><space/>For example, to help light some interior scenes, lights were placed outside and aimed through the windows, which were covered in a diffuse material to scatter the light evenly through the room rather than being placed inside for maximum use as most conventional films do. A sign of this method occurs in the scene where Barry duels Lord Bullingdon. Though it appears to be lit entirely with natural light, one can see that the light coming in through the cross-shaped windows in the tithe barn appears blue in color, while the main lighting of the scene coming in from the side is not. This is because the light through the cross-shaped windows is daylight from the sun, which when recorded on the film stock used by Kubrick showed up as blue-tinted compared to the incandescent electric light coming in from the side.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite such slight tinting effects, this method of lighting not only gave the look of natural daylight coming in through the windows, but it also protected the historic locations from the damage caused by mounting the lights on walls or ceilings and the heat from the lights.

In Thackeray's writings, events are related in the first person by Barry himself.

Instead of the omniscient author, Thackeray used the imperfect observer, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the dishonest observer, thus allowing the reader to judge for himself, with little difficulty, the probable truth in Redmond Barry's view of his life. This technique worked extremely well in the novel but, of course, in a film you have objective reality in front of you all of the time, so the effect of Thackeray's first-person story-teller could not be repeated on the screen. It might have worked as comedy by the juxtaposition of Barry’s version of the truth with the reality on the screen, but I don’t think that Barry Lyndon should have been done as a comedy."<ref>{{cite web|url">http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |title</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Kubrick also changed the plot.
