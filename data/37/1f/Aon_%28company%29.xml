The firm's risk management business, Aon Risk Solutions provides retail property/casualty, liability, and other insurance products for groups and businesses, as well as risk management services.

Clement Stone's mother bought a small Detroit insurance agency, and in 1918 brought her son into the business. Mr. Stone sold low-cost, low-benefit accident insurance, underwriting and issuing policies on-site. The next year he founded his own agency, the Combined Registry Co.</paragraph><paragraph>As the<space/><link><target>Great Depression</target></link><space/>began, Stone reduced his workforce and improved training. Forced by his son's respiratory illness to winter in the South, Stone moved to Arkansas and Texas. In 1939 he bought<space/><link><target>American Casualty Insurance Co.</target></link><space/>of Dallas, Texas. It was consolidated with other purchases as the<space/><link><target>Combined Insurance</target><part>Combined Insurance Co. of America</part></link><space/>in 1947. The company continued through the 1950s and 1960s, continuing to sell health and accident policies. In the 1970s, Combined expanded overseas despite being hit hard by the recession.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1982, after 10 years of stagnation under Clement Stone Jr., the elder Stone, then 79, resumed control until the completion of a<space/><link><target>merger</target></link><space/>with<space/><link><target>Ryan Insurance Co.</target></link><space/>allowed him to transfer control to<space/><link><target>Pat Ryan (executive)</target><part>Patrick Ryan</part></link>. Ryan, the son of a Ford dealer in Wisconsin, had started his company as an auto credit insurer in 1964. In 1976, the company bought the insurance brokerage units of the<space/><link><target>Esmark</target></link><space/>conglomerate. Ryan focused on insurance brokering and added more upscale insurance products. He also trimmed staff and took other cost-cutting measures, and in 1987 he changed Combined's name to<space/><bold>Aon</bold>. In 1992, he bought Dutch insurance broker Hudig-Langeveldt. In 1995, the company sold its remaining direct life insurance holdings to<space/><link><target>Genworth Financial</target><part>General Electric</part></link><space/>to focus on consulting.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/27/business/ge-capital-to-acquire-an-insurer.html'>GE Capital To Acquire An Insurer</link></extension><space/>The following year, it began offering hostile takeover insurance policies to small and mid-sized companies.</paragraph><paragraph>Aon built a global presence through purchases. In 1997, it bought The Minet Group, as well as insurance brokerage Alexander &amp; Alexander Services, Inc. in a deal that made Aon (temporarily) the largest insurance broker worldwide. The firm made no US buys in 1998, but doubled its employee base with purchases including Spain's largest retail insurance broker, Gil y Carvajal, and the formation of Aon Korea, the first non-Korean firm of its kind<template><target>clarify</target><arg name="date">June 2010</arg></template><space/>to be licensed there.</paragraph><paragraph>Responding to industry demands, Aon announced its new fee disclosure policy in 1999, and the company reorganised to focus on buying personal line insurance firms and to integrate its acquisitions. That year it bought Nikols Sedgwick Group, an Italian insurance firm, and formed RiskAttack (with<space/><link><target>Zurich Financial Services</target><part>Zurich US</part></link>), a risk analysis and financial management concern aimed at technology companies. The cost of integrating its numerous purchases, however, hammered profits in 1999.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite its troubles, in 2000 Aon bought Reliance Group's accident and health insurance business, as well as Actuarial Sciences Associates, a compensation and employee benefits consulting company. Later in that year, however, the company decided to cut 6% of its workforce as part of a restructuring effort. In 2003, the company saw revenues increase primarily because of rate hikes in the insurance industry. Also that year, Endurance Specialty, a Bermuda-based underwriting operation that Aon helped to establish in November 2001 along with other investors, went public. The next year Aon sold most of its holdings in Endurance.</paragraph><paragraph>In late 2007, Aon announced the divestiture of its underwriting business. With this move, the firm sold off its two major underwriting subsidiaries: Combined Insurance Company of America (acquired by ACE Limited for $2.4 billion) and Sterling Life Insurance Company (purchased by Munich Re Group for $352 million). The low margin and capital-intensive nature of the underwriting industry was the primary reason for the firm's decision to divest.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2007/12/17/85703.htm<space/></arg><arg name="title">Aon Sells Combined to ACE for $2.4 Billion; Sterling to Munich Re<space/></arg><arg name="work">Insurance Journal<space/></arg><arg name="date">17 December 2007</arg><arg name="accessdate">14 March 2013</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-12-17-1549592899_x.htm<space/></arg><arg name="title">Aon sells two insurance units for $2.75B<space/></arg><arg name="work">USA Today<space/></arg><arg name="date">17 December 2007</arg><arg name="accessdate">14 March 2013</arg></template></extension><space/>Upon completion of the move, Aon turned its attention to expanding its broking and consulting capabilities.</paragraph><paragraph>This growth strategy manifested in November 2008 when Aon announced it had acquired reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor Benfield Group Limited for $1.75 billion.
