'''Electronic commerce''', commonly written as '''e-commerce''', is the [[trade|trading]] in products or services using computer networks, such as the [[Internet]]. Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as [[mobile commerce]], [[electronic funds transfer]], [[supply chain management]], [[Online advertising|Internet marketing]], [[online transaction processing]], [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI), [[inventory management software|inventory management systems]], and automated [[data collection]] systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the [[World Wide Web]] for at least one part of the transaction's life cycle, although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail.

E-commerce businesses may employ some or all of the following:
* [[Online shopping]] web sites for retail sales direct to consumers
* Providing or participating in [[online marketplace]]s, which process third-party business-to-consumer or consumer-to-consumer sales
* [[Business-to-business]] buying and selling
* Gathering and using demographic data through web contacts and social media
* Business-to-business [[electronic data interchange]]
* Marketing to prospective and established customers by e-mail or fax (for example, with newsletters)
* Engaging in [[pretail]] for launching new products and services

==Governmental regulation==
In the United States, some electronic commerce activities are regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC). These activities include the use of commercial e-mails, online advertising and consumer [[privacy]]. The [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] establishes national standards for direct marketing over e-mail. The [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] regulates all forms of advertising, including online advertising, and states that advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/ruleroad.shtm |title= Advertising and Marketing on the Internet: Rules of the Road |publisher= [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}</ref> Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security of consumers' personal information.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/promises.html | title= Enforcing Privacy Promises: Section 5 of the FTC Act | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}</ref> As result, any corporate privacy policy related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.

Conflict of laws in cyberspace is  a major hurdle for harmonisation of legal framework for e-commerce around the world. In order to give a uniformity to e-commerce law around the world, many countries adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996) <ref name=" http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/electronic_commerce/1996Model.html">{{cite news|url= http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/electronic_commerce/1996Model.html|title= UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996)

'''Internationally''' there is the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN), which was formed in 1991 from an informal network of government customer fair trade organisations.  The purpose was stated as being to find ways of co-operating on tackling consumer problems connected with cross-border transactions in both goods and services, and to help ensure exchanges of information among the participants for mutual benefit and understanding. From this came Econsumer.gov, an ICPEN initiative since April 2001.  It is a portal to report complaints about online and related transactions with foreign companies.

There is also '''Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation''' (APEC) was established in 1989 with the vision of achieving stability, security and prosperity for the region through free and open trade and investment. APEC has an Electronic Commerce Steering Group as well as working on common privacy regulations throughout the APEC region.

In '''the United Kingdom''', The [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA)<ref>{{cite web | title = FSA | place = UK | url = http://www.fsa.gov.uk/portal/site/fsa}}</ref>  was formerly the regulating authority for most aspects of the EU's [[Payment Services Directive]] (PSD), until its replacement in 2013 by the [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]] and the [[Financial Conduct Authority]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0203b99e-797f-11df-b063-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2RAtoYsio |title=Osborne abolishes FSA and boosts Bank |publisher=Financial Times |author=George Parker and Brooke Masters |date=16 June 2010}}</ref> The UK implemented the PSD through the Payment Services Regulations 2009 (PSRs), which came into effect on 1 November 2009. The PSR affects firms providing payment services and their customers. These firms include banks, non-bank credit card issuers and non-bank merchant acquirers, e-money issuers, etc.  The PSRs created a new class of regulated firms known as payment institutions (PIs), who are subject to prudential requirements. Article 87 of the PSD requires the European Commission to report on the implementation and impact of the PSD by 1 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/209/introduction/made | title = The Payment Services Regulations 2009 |publisher= Legislation | place = UK |accessdate= 17 June 2013}}</ref>

In '''India''', the [[Information Technology Act 2000]] governs the basic applicability of [[E-commerce in India|e-commerce]].

In '''China''', the Telecommunications Regulations of the People's Republic of China (promulgated on 25 September 2000), stipulated the [[Ministry of Industry and Information Technology]] (MIIT) as the government department regulating all telecommunications related activities, including electronic commerce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/business/laws_regulations/2010-01/20/content_19273945.htm | title = Telecommunications Regulations of the People's Republic of China |date= 20 September 2000}}</ref> On the same day, The Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services released, is the first administrative regulation to address profit-generating activities conducted through the Internet, and lay the foundation for future regulations governing e-commerce in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/business/2010-01/20/content_19274704.htm | title = Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services |date= 20 September 2000}}</ref> In 28 August 2004, the eleventh session of the tenth NPC Standing Committee adopted The Electronic Signature Law, which regulates data message, electronic signature authentication and legal liability issues. It is considered the first law in China’s e-commerce legislation. It was a milestone in the course of improving China’s electronic commerce legislation, and also marks the entering of China’s rapid development stage for electronic commerce legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinabond.com.cn/Info/14129244 | title = PRC, Electronic Signature Law |date= 28 August 2004}}</ref>

==Forms==
Contemporary electronic commerce involves everything from ordering "digital" content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to "meta" services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce.

On the institutional level, big corporations and financial institutions use the internet to exchange financial data to facilitate domestic and international business. [[Data integrity]] and [[data security|security]] are pressing issues for electronic commerce.

Aside from traditional e-Commerce, the terms m-Commerce ([[mobile commerce]]) as well (around 2013) [[t-Commerce]]<ref>{{cite web |last= Hacon | first = Tom |url= http://www.governor.co.uk/news-plus-views/2013/march/t-commerce-what-the-tablet-can-do-for-brands-and-their-consumers/ |publisher=Governor Technology |title=T-Commerce&nbsp;– What the tablet can do for brands and their consumers |deadurl=no |accessdate= 2013-03-04}}</ref> have also been used.

Economists have theorized that e-commerce ought to lead to intensified price [[competition (economics)|competition]], as it increases consumers' ability to gather information about products and prices. Research by four economists at the University of Chicago has found that the growth of online shopping has also affected industry structure in two areas that have seen significant growth in e-commerce, [[book selling|bookshops]] and [[travel agencies]]. Generally, larger firms are able to use [[economies of scale]] and offer lower prices. The lone exception to this pattern has been the very smallest category of bookseller, shops with between one and four employees, which appear to have withstood the trend.<ref>{{cite news|title=Economics focus: The click and the dead|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16478931|newspaper=The Economist|date= 3–9 July 2010|page=78}}</ref> Depending on the category, e-commerce may shift the switching costs—procedural, relational, and financial—experienced by customers.<ref name="ssrn.com">Blut, Markus and Frennea, Carly and Mittal, Vikas and Mothersbaugh, David L., How Procedural, Financial and Relational Switching Costs Affect Customer Satisfaction, Repurchase Intentions, and Repurchase Behavior: A Meta-Analysis (January 20, 2015).

==Impact on supply chain management==
For a long time, companies had been troubled by the gap between the benefits which supply chain technology has and the solutions to deliver those benefits. However, the emergence of e-commerce has provided a more practical and effective way of delivering the benefits of the new supply chain technologies.<ref name="ideas.repec.org">Delia, M. 2008. Impact of E-Commerce in Supply Chain Management. [Online]. Available at: https://ideas.repec.org/a/aes/amfeco/v10y2008i24p236-253.html. Accessed 21 February 2015.</ref>

E-commerce has the capability to integrate all inter-company and intra-company functions, meaning that the three flows (physical flow, financial flow and information flow) of the supply chain could be also affected by e-commerce. The affections on physical flows improved the way of product and inventory movement level for companies. For the information flows, e-commerce optimised the capacity of information processing than companies used to have, and for the financial flows, e-commerce allows companies to have more efficient payment and settlement solutions.<ref name="ideas.repec.org"/>

In addition, e-commerce has a more sophisticated level of impact on supply chains: Firstly, the performance gap will be eliminated since companies can identify gaps between different levels of supply chains by electronic means of solutions; Secondly, as a result of e-commerce emergence, new capabilities such implementing ERP systems have helped companies to manage operations with customers and suppliers. Yet these new capabilities are still not fully exploited. Thirdly, technology companies would keep investing on new e-commerce software solutions as they are expecting investment return. Fourthly, e-commerce would help to solve many aspects of issues that companies may feel difficult to cope with, such as political barriers or cross-country changes. Finally, e-commerce provides companies a more efficient and effective way to collaborate with each other within the supply chain.<ref name="ideas.repec.org"/>

==The social impact of e-commerce==
Along with the e-commerce and its unique charm that has appeared gradually, virtual enterprise, virtual bank, network marketing, online shopping, payment and advertising, such this new vocabulary which is unheard-of and now has become as familiar to people. This reflects that the e-commerce has huge impact on the economy and society from the other side.<ref>OECD (1999), "Economic and Social Impact of Ecommerce: Preliminary Findings and Research Agenda", OECD Digital Economy Papers, No.40. OECD Publishing</ref> For instance, B2B is a rapidly growing business in the world that leads to lower cost and then improves the economic efficiency and also bring along the growth of employment.<ref>Fazlollahi, B. (2002). Strategies for eCommerce success. Hershey, PA: IRM Press.</ref>

To understand how the e-commerce has affected the society and economy, this article will mention three issues below:

1. The e-commerce has changed the relative importance of time, but as the pillars of indicator of the country’s economic state that the importance of time should not be ignored.

2. The e-commerce offers the consumer or enterprise various information they need, making information into total transparency, will force enterprise no longer is able to use the mode of space or advertisement to raise their competitive edge.<ref>Schniederjans, M. and Cao, Q. (2002). E-Commerce operations management. Singapore: World Scientific.</ref> Moreover, in theory, perfect competition between the consumer sovereignty and industry will maximize social welfare.<ref>Child, J. (1969). The business enterprise in modern industrial society. London: Collier-Macmillan</ref>

3.	In fact, during the economic activity in the past, large enterprise frequently has advantage of information resource, and thus at the expense of consumers. Nowadays, the transparent and real-time information protects the rights of consumers, because the consumers can use internet to pick out the portfolio to the benefit of themselves. The competitiveness of enterprises will be much more obvious than before, consequently, social welfare would be improved by the development of the e-commerce.

4. The new economy led by the e-commerce change humanistic spirit as well, but above all, is the employee loyalty.<ref>Qin, Z., Li, S., Chang, Y. and Li, F. (2014). E-Commerce Strategy. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</ref> Due to the market with competition, the employee’s level of professionalism becomes the crucial for enterprise in the niche market. The enterprises must pay attention to how to build up the enterprises inner culture and a set of interactive mechanisms and it is the prime problem for them. Furthermore, though the mode of e-commerce decrease the information cost and transaction cost, however, its development also makes human being are overly computer literate. In hence, emphasized more humanistic attitude to work is another project for enterprise to development. Life is the root of all and high technology are merely an assistive tool to support our quality of life.

The e-commerce is not a kind of new industry, but it is creating a new economic model. Most of people agree that the e-commerce indeed to be important and significant for economic society in the future, but actually that is a bit of clueless feeling at the beginning, this problem is exactly prove the e-commerce is a sort of incorporeal revolution.<ref>Lamersdorf, W., Tschammer, V. and Amarger, S. (2004). Building the E-Service Society. Boston, MA: Springer US.</ref> Generally speaking, as a type of business active procedure, the e-commerce is going to leading an unprecedented revolution in the world, the influence of this model far exceeded the commercial affair itself.<ref>Laudon, K. and Traver, C. (2014). E-commerce: Business, Technology, Society, 10th ed. Pearson Education.</ref> Except the mentioned above, in the area of law, education, culture and also policy, the e-commerce will continue that rise in impact. The e-commerce is truly to take human beings into the information society.

==Distribution channels==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
E-commerce has grown in importance as companies have adopted pure-click and [[Bricks and clicks|brick-and-click]] channel systems. We can distinguish pure-click and brick-and-click channel system adopted by companies.
* Pure-click or pure-play companies are those that have launched a website without any previous existence as a firm.
* Bricks-and-clicks companies are those existing companies that have added an online site for e-commerce.
* Click-to-brick online retailers that later open physical locations to supplement their online efforts.<ref>{{cite web|author=(Gap Inc/The) |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-10/click-to-brick-why-online-retailers-want-stores-in-real-life |title=Click-to-Brick: Why Online Retailers Want Stores in Real Life |publisher=Business week |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}</ref>

==Examples of new e-commerce systems==

According to eMarketer research company, "by 2017, 65.8 per cent of Britons will use smartphones".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.wiredevent.co.uk/Wired_content/uploads/2014/07/retail.pdf|title = E-Commerce is history|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

Bringing online experience into the real world, also allows the development of the economy and the interaction between stores and customers. A great example of this new e-commerce system is what the [[Burberry]] store in London did in 2012. They refurbished the entire store with numerous big screens, photo-studios, and also provided a stage for live acts. Moreover, on the digital screens which are across the store, some fashion shows´ images and advertising campaigns are displayed (William, 2014). In this way, the experience of purchasing becomes more vivid and entertaining while the online and offline components are working together.

Another example is the Kiddicare smartphone app, in which consumers can compare prices. The app allows people to identify the location of sale products and to check whether the item they are looking for is in stock, or if it can be ordered online without going to the `real´ store (William, 2014).
In the United States, the [[Walmart]] app allows consumers to check product availability and prices both online and offline. Moreover, you can also add to your shopping list items by scanning them, see their details and information, and check purchasers´ ratings and reviews.
