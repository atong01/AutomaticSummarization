A '''video game''' is an [[electronic game]] that involves human interaction with a [[user interface]] to generate visual feedback on a [[video|video device]] such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word ''video'' in ''video game'' traditionally referred to a [[raster scan|raster]] display device,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3659285.html |title= Television gaming apparatus and method | accessdate=2008-06-25 |work=United States Patents }}</ref> but it now implies any type of [[display device]] that can produce two- or three-dimensional images.

The electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms; examples of these are personal computers and [[video game console]]s. These platforms range from large [[mainframe computer]]s to small [[handheld device|handheld computing device]]s. Specialized video games such as [[arcade game]]s, while common in the 1980s, have gradually declined in use due to the widespread availability of home video game devices (e.g., [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]) and video games on desktop and laptop computers and smartphones.

The [[input device]] used for games, the [[game controller]], varies across platforms. Common controllers include [[gamepads]], mouses, keyboards, [[joystick]]s, the [[touchscreen]]s of [[mobile device]]s and buttons. In addition to video and (in most cases) audio feedback, some games include [[haptic technology|haptic]], vibration or [[force feedback]] [[peripheral]]s.

Video games have become an art form and an industry. The [[video game industry]] is of increasing commercial importance, with growth driven particularly by the emerging Asian markets and [[mobile game]]s. As of 2015, video games generated sales of [[USD]] 74 billion annually worldwide, and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable TV.

[[File:Tennis for Two - Modern recreation.jpg|thumb|''Tennis for Two'', an early [[analog computer]] game that used an [[oscilloscope]] for a display]]

Early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats. The earliest example is from 1947—a "[[Cathode ray tube]] Amusement Device" was filed for a patent on 25 January 1947, by [[Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr.]] and Estle Ray Mann, and issued on 14 December 1948, as U.S. Patent 2455992.<ref>{{US Patent|2455992}}</ref>

Inspired by radar display tech, it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets, which were drawings fixed to the screen.<ref name="PongStory">{{cite web| url = http://www.pong-story.com/intro.htm| title = Welcome to Pong-Story – Introduction| publisher = PONG-Story.com| accessdate = 2007-10-24}}</ref>

Other early examples include:
* The [[Nimrod (computing)|Nimrod]] computer at the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]]
* ''[[OXO]]'' a [[tic-tac-toe]] Computer game by [[A.S. Douglas|Alexander S. Douglas]] for the [[EDSAC]] in 1952
* ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', an electronic interactive game engineered by [[William Higinbotham]] in 1958
* ''[[Spacewar!]]'', written by [[MIT]] students Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen's on a DEC [[PDP-1]] computer in 1961.
* ''[[Pong]]'', a 1972 game by [[Atari]].

Each game used different means of display: NIMROD used a panel of lights to play the game of [[Nim]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.goodeveca.net/nimrod/| title = Welcome to...

In 1971, ''[[Computer Space]]'', created by [[Nolan Bushnell]] and [[Ted Dabney]], was the first commercially sold, coin-operated video game. It used a black-and-white television for its display, and the computer system was made of [[7400 series|74 series]] [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] [[integrated circuit|chips]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvin3m.com/arcade/cspace.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081228061939/http://www.marvin3m.com/arcade/cspace.htm |archivedate=28 December 2008 |author=Marvin Yagoda |title=1972 Nutting Associates Computer Space |year=2008}}</ref> The game was featured in the 1973 [[science fiction film]] ''[[Soylent Green]]''. ''Computer Space'' was followed in 1972 by the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], the first home console. Modeled after a late 1960s prototype console developed by [[Ralph H.

==Overview==

===Platforms===
{{See also|History of video games}}

[[File:6gencons.JPG|thumb|Different [[video game console]]s.]]
The term "platform" refers to the specific combination of [[electronic component]]s or computer hardware which, in conjunction with software, allows a video game to operate.<ref name="platformdef">{{cite web | title =platform - Definitions from Dictionary.com | publisher =Dictionary.com | url =http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/platform | accessdate =2007-11-03 }}</ref> The term "system" is also commonly used.

In common use a "[[personal computer game|PC game]]" refers to a form of media that involves a player interacting with a [[personal computer]] connected to a [[video monitor]]. [[Personal computer]]s are not dedicated platforms, so there may be differences running the same game in different hardwares, also the opennes alows some features to developers like reduced software cost,<ref>http://pc.ign.com/articles/121/1214544p1.html</ref> increased flexibility, increased innovation, emulation, creation of [[mod (video gaming)|mods]], open host for online gaming and others.

A "[[console game]]" is played on a specialized electronic device that connects to a common [[television set]] or [[Composite monitor|composite video monitor]], unlike [[personal computer|PC]]s, a console is a dedicated platform, it is manufactured by a specific company. Usually runs only games developed for it, or games from other platform made by the same company, but never its direct competitor, even if the same game is available on different platforms. It often comes with an specific [[game controller]].

A "[[Handheld game console|handheld]]" gaming device is a self-contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a user's hands. It features the console, screen, speakers and buttons in one single unit. Like consoles, handhelds are dedicated platforms, and share almost the same characteristics. Handheld hardware usually is less powerful than PC or console hardwares.

"[[Arcade game]]" generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]] which has one built-in console, controller and screen.

These distinctions are not always clear and there may be games that bridge one or more platforms. In addition to personal computers, there are multiple other devices which have the ability to play games but are not dedicated video game machines, such as [[smartphone]]s, [[PDA]]s and [[graphing calculator]]s.

The [[web browser]] has also established itself as platform in its own right while providing a [[cross-platform]] environment for video games designed to be played on a wide spectrum of hardware from personal computers to [[smartphone]]s to name a few. This in turn has generated new terms to qualify classes of web browser based games. These games may be identified based on the website that they appear, such as with "Facebook" games. Others are named based on the programming platform used to develop them, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] games.

===Genres===
{{Main|Video game genre}}

A video game, like most other forms of media, may be categorized into [[genres]]. Video game genres are used to categorize video games based on their gameplay interaction rather than [[Computer graphics|visual]] or [[narrative]] differences.<ref name=Apperley>{{cite journal |accessdate=2013-04-19 |title=Genre and game studies |journal=Simulation & Gaming |author=Apperley, Thomas H. |year=2006 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=6–23 |url=http://trac.assembla.com/CommanderAssembler/export/32/docs/Genre%20and%20game%20studies%20-%20tom-apperley.pdf |doi=10.1177/1046878105282278 }}</ref><ref name="Gamasutra">{{cite web| title=Background: The Origins of Game Genres| url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4074/the_designers_notebook_sorting_.php| author= [[Ernest W. Adams|Adams, Ernest]]| date=2009-07-09| publisher=[[Gamasutra]]| accessdate=2014-12-03}}</ref> A video game genre is defined by a set of gameplay challenges and are classified independent of their [[setting (fiction)|setting]] or game-world content, unlike other works of fiction such as [[film]]s or [[book]]s. For example, a [[shooter game]] is still a shooter game, regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in outer space.<ref name="fundamentals">{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ernest|authorlink=|author2=Andrew Rollings |title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lm1jAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Adams,+Ernest%3B+Andrew+Rollings+(2006).+Fundamentals+of+Game+Design.+Prentice+Hall&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yh93VMXTG4OtPPuygZAF&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=outer%20space&f=false|page=67}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Harteveld|first1=Casper|date= 2011-02-26|title=Triadic Game Design: Balancing Reality, Meaning and Play|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=sIcQYKcoH7IC&dq=lives+game+design&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|page= 71|isbn=1849961573|accessdate=2014-12-19}}</ref>

Because genres are dependent on content for definition, genres have changed and evolved as newer styles of video games have come into existence. Ever advancing technology and production values related to video game development have fostered more lifelike and complex games which have in turn introduced or enhanced genre possibilities (e.g., virtual pets), pushed the boundaries of existing video gaming or in some cases add new possibilities in play (such as that seen with titles specifically designed for devices like Sony's [[PlayStation Eye|EyeToy]]). Some genres represent combinations of others, such as [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, or, more commonly, MMORPGs. It is also common to see higher level genre terms that are collective in nature across all other genres such as with action, music/rhythm or horror-themed video games.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Classifications===

====Casual games====
{{Main|Casual game}}

Casual games derive their name from their ease of accessibility, simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets. Additionally, casual games frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand. Casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.

Examples of [[Video game genre|genres]] within this category are [[match three]], [[hidden object]], [[Time Management (video game genre)|time management]], [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] or many of the [[tower defense]] style games. Casual games are generally available through [[app store]]s and online retailers such as [[PopCap Games|PopCap]], [[Zylom]] and [[GameHouse]] or provided for free play through [[web portal]]s such as [[Newgrounds]].

While casual games are most commonly played on personal computers, phones or tablets, they can also be found on many of the on-line console system download services (e.g., the [[PlayStation Network]], [[WiiWare]] or [[Xbox Live]]).

====Serious games====
{{Main|Serious game}}

Serious games are games that are designed primarily to convey information or a learning experience of some sort to the player. Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game in the traditional sense of the term. Educational software does not typically fall under this category (e.g., [[touch typing]] tutors, language learning, etc.) and the primary distinction would appear to be based on the title's primary goal as well as target age demographics. As with the other categories, this description is more of a guideline than a rule.

Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although some such as [[exergaming|exergames]], [[educational game]]s, or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter. These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement. They can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject.

One of the longest running serious games franchises would be [[Microsoft Flight Simulator]] first published in 1982 under that name. The United States military uses virtual reality based simulations, such as [[VBS1]] for training exercises,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/virtual-military.htm |title= How Virtual Reality Military Applications Work | accessdate=2009-11-24 }}</ref> as do a growing number of first responder roles (e.g., police, fire fighter, EMT).<ref>*Anne Derryberry, [http://www.adobe.com/resources/elearning/pdfs/serious_games_wp.pdf "Definition of Serious games] ''Adobe.com'' August 2007 <!-- Retrieved 23 August 2009 --></ref> One example of a non-game environment utilized as a platform for serious game development would be the virtual world of ''[[Second Life]]'', which is currently used by several United States governmental departments (e.g., [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]], [[NASA]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]]), Universities (e.g., [[Ohio University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]) for educational and remote learning programs<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/4163 |title= Serious Games in Virtual Worlds: The Future of Enterprise Business Intelligence | accessdate=2009-11-24 }}</ref> and businesses (e.g., [[IBM]], [[Cisco Systems]]) for meetings and training.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/04/using_second_li_2.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090512205946/http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/04/using_second_li_2.html |archivedate= 2009-05-12 |title= Using Second Life As A Business-To-Business Tool
 | accessdate=2009-11-24 }}</ref>

[[Tactical media]] in video games plays a crucial role in making a statement or conveying a message on important relevant issues. This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people. An example of tactical media in video games would be [[newsgame]]s. These are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point.<ref name="DiGRA">{{cite web|url=http://www.wingchunsantacruz.com/gamesandart/research/newsgames-DiGRA2009.pdf |title="Newsgames: Procedural Rhetoric meets Political Cartoons" by Mike Treanor and Michael Mateas |format=PDF }}</ref> For example, Take Action Games is a game studio collective that was co-founded by Susana Ruiz and has made successful serious games. Some of these games include ''[[Darfur is Dying]]'', ''Finding Zoe'', and ''In The Balance''. All of these games bring awareness to important issues and events in an intelligent and well thought out manner.<ref>[http://takeactiongames.com/TAG/HOME.html TAKE ACTION games<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Educational games===

On 23 September 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama launched a campaign called "Educate to Innovate" aimed at improving the technological, mathematical, scientific and engineering abilities of American students. This campaign states that it plans to harness the power of interactive games to help achieve the goal of students excelling in these departments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/educate-innovate |title=Educate to Innovate &#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en |title=President Obama Launches "Educate to Innovate" Campaign for Excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (Stem) Education &#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=23 November 2009 }}</ref> This campaign has stemmed into many new opportunities for the video game realm and has contributed to many new competitions. Some of these competitions include the Stem National Video Game Competition and the [[Imagine Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/video-game-competitions-to-expand-stem-learning-in-the-united-states-71656557.html |title=Video Game Competitions to Expand Stem Learning in the United States |location=District of Columbia |publisher=Prnewswire.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://imaginecup.com/support/faq.aspx#Question1.1 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822015626/http://imaginecup.com/support/faq.aspx#Question1.1 |archivedate=2008-08-22 |title=Imagine Cup Student Competition – Support FAQ's |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=22 August 2008 }}</ref> Both of these examples are events that bring a focus to relevant and important current issues that are able to be addressed in the sense of video games to educate and spread knowledge in a new form of media. www.NobelPrize.org uses games to entice the user to learn about information pertaining to the Nobel prize achievements while engaging in a fun to play video game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/educational/ |title=Educational Games |publisher=Nobelprize.org }}</ref> There are many different types and styles of educational games all the way from counting to spelling to games for kids and games for adults. Some other games do not have any particular targeted audience in mind and intended to simply educate or inform whoever views or plays the game.

==Development==
{{Main|Game development}}
{{See also|Video game industry practices}}
[[File:Virtual-camera-system.png|thumb||Developers use various tools to create video games. Here an editor is fine-tuning the [[virtual camera system]].]]

Video game development and authorship, much like any other form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. [[Video game developer]]s, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include [[game programmer|programmers]] and [[graphic design]]ers. Over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program, including [[sound design]]ers, musicians, and other technicians; as well as skills that are specific to video games, such as the [[game designer]]. All of these are managed by [[game producer|producers]].

In the early days of the industry, it was more common for a single person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video game. As platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present, larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art, programming, cinematography, and more. This is not to say that the age of the "one-man shop" is gone, as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets,<ref name="numberofdevs">{{cite web | title =The Edge of Reason? | publisher =eurogamer.net | url =http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-edge-of-reason | accessdate =2009-11-16 }}</ref> where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited [[RAM]] or lack of dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform (e.g., some cellphones and [[PDAs]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

With the growth of the size of development teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450.<ref>[http://www.nowgamer.com/news/513/assassins-creed-ii-triples-size-of-dev-team "Assassin's Creed II dev team triples in size"], Christopher Reynolds, 18 May 2009, NOW Gamer. {{wayback|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/news/513/assassins-creed-ii-triples-size-of-dev-team |date=20150716155323 }}</ref> The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Downloadable content===
{{Main|Downloadable content}}

A phenomenon of additional game content at a later date, often for additional funds, began with digital video game distribution known as downloadable content (DLC). Developers can use [[digital distribution]] to issue new storylines after the main game is released, such as [[Rockstar Games]] with ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' (''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned|The Lost and Damned]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony|The Ballad of Gay Tony]]''), or Bethesda with ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and [[Fallout 3 downloadable content|its expansions]]. New gameplay modes can also become available, for instance, ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and its zombie modes,<ref>[http://www.giantbomb.com/downloadable-content/92-329/], Giant Bomb.</ref><ref>{{Wayback |date=20110105153819 |url=https://orders.bethsoft.com/dlc/ }}, Bethesda.</ref><ref>[http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-escalation-dlc-xbox-release-date/], Gilbert, Ben, 11 Apr 2011, Joystiq.</ref> a multiplayer mode for ''[[Mushroom Wars]]'' or a higher difficulty level for ''[[Metro: Last Light]]''. Smaller packages of DLC are also common, ranging from better in-game weapons (''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'', ''[[Just Cause 2]]''), character outfits (''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'', ''[[Minecraft]]''), or new songs to perform (''[[SingStar]]'', ''[[Rock Band]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero]]'').

===Modifications===
{{Main|Mod (computer gaming)}}

Many games produced for the PC are designed such that technically oriented consumers can modify the game. These [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]] can add an extra dimension of replayability and interest. Developers such as [[id Software]], [[Valve Software]], [[Crytek]], [[Bethesda Softworks|Bethesda]], [[Epic Games]] and [[Blizzard Entertainment]] ship their games with some of the development tools used to make the game, along with documentation to assist mod developers. The Internet provides an inexpensive medium to promote and distribute mods, and they may be a factor in the commercial success of some games.<ref name="lombardi">{{Wayback |date=20080506004712 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000484956 |title=Hollywood Reporter interviewing Doug Lombardi, Quote: "Mods absolutely helped us drive huge sales to 'Half-Life'"}}.</ref> This allows for the kind of success seen by popular mods such as the ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' mod ''[[Counter-Strike]]''.

===Cheating===
{{Main|Cheating (video games)}}

Cheating in computer games may involve [[cheat codes]] and hidden spots implemented by the game developers,<ref name="WashPost">{{cite news| title = In Game World, Cheaters Proudly Prosper| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082701059.html|work=Washington Post| author = Vargas, Jose Antonio| date = 28 August 2006| accessdate = 2007-10-24}}</ref><ref name="KonamiCode">{{cite web| url = http://www.1up.com/features/cracking-code-konami-code| title = Cracking the Code: The Konami Code| publisher = [[1UP.com]]| author = 1UP Staff| accessdate = 2007-10-24}}</ref> modification of game code by third parties,<ref name="AboutCheatCodes">{{cite web| title = Video Game Cheats and Codes – What Are Cheat Codes?| url = http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/faqglossary/a/WhatAreCheats.htm| publisher = [[About.com]]| author = Rybka, Jason| accessdate = 2007-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Why Use Cheats and Codes for Console and PC Games?| url = http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/basicgamingtipstricks/a/whyusecheats.htm| publisher = About.com| author = Rybka, Jason| accessdate = 2007-10-24}}</ref> or players exploiting a software glitch. Modifications are facilitated by either [[cheat cartridge]] hardware or a software [[trainer (games)|trainer]].<ref name="AboutCheatCodes"/> Cheats usually make the game [[Difficulty level|easier]] by providing an unlimited amount of some resource; for example weapons, health, or ammunition; or perhaps the ability to walk through walls.<ref name="KonamiCode"/><ref name="AboutCheatCodes"/> Other cheats might give access to otherwise unplayable levels or provide unusual or amusing features, like altered game colors or other graphical appearances.

===Glitches===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:UMK3 Fighter Glitch.png|thumb|Example of a color glitch from the video game ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]''  {{deletable image-caption|Thursday, 21 February 2013}}]] -->
{{Main|Glitch}}

Software errors not detected by software testers during development can find their way into released versions of computer and video games. This may happen because the glitch only occurs under unusual circumstances in the game, was deemed too minor to correct, or because the game development was hurried to meet a publication deadline. Glitches can range from minor graphical errors to serious bugs that can delete saved data or cause the game to malfunction. In some cases publishers will release updates (referred to as ''patches'') to repair glitches. Sometimes a glitch may be beneficial to the player; these are often referred to as [[Exploit (online gaming)|exploits]].

===Easter eggs===
[[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] are hidden messages or jokes left in games by developers that are not part of the main game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/easter%20egg|title=''Easter egg'' Definition|publisher=[[dictionary.com]]|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>

==Theory==
{{Main|Game studies}}

Although departments of computer science have been studying the technical aspects of video games for years, theories that examine games as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the humanities. The two most visible schools in this emerging field are [[ludology]] and [[narratology]]. Narrativists approach video games in the context of what [[Janet Murray]] calls "Cyberdrama". That is to say, their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium, one that arises out of interactive fiction. Murray puts video games in the context of the [[Holodeck]], a fictional piece of technology from ''[[Star Trek]]'', arguing for the video game as a medium in which we get to become another person, and to act out in another world.<ref>{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Janet | authorlink = Janet Murray | year = 1998 | title = Hamlet on the Holodeck | publisher = MIT Press | isbn = 0-262-63187-3}}</ref> This image of video games received early widespread popular support, and forms the basis of films such as ''[[Tron]]'', ''[[eXistenZ]]'' and ''[[The Last Starfighter]]''.

Ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea. They argue that a video game is first and foremost a game, which must be understood in terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys. [[Espen J. Aarseth]] argues that, although games certainly have plots, characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are incidental to gameplay. For example, Aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', saying that "the dimensions of [[Lara Croft]]'s body, already analyzed to death by [[film theory|film theorists]], are irrelevant to me as a player, because a different-looking body would not make me play differently... When I play, I don't even see her body, but see through it and past it."<ref>{{cite web| last = Aarseth| first = Espen J.| authorlink = Espen J. Aarseth|date=21 May 2004| url = http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/vigilant| title = Genre Trouble| publisher = Electronic Book Review | accessdate = 2006-06-14}}</ref> Simply put, ludologists reject traditional theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules, demands, and expectations imposed on the player.

While many games rely on [[Emergence|emergent principles]], video games commonly present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within the context of the game. The term "emergent narrative" has been used to describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created simply by "what happens to the player."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/502/502409p1.html |title=IGN: GDC 2004: Warren Spector Talks Games Narrative |publisher=Xbox.ign.com }}</ref> However, emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games. In general, any place where event-driven instructions occur for [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] in a game, emergent behavior will exist. For instance, take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the track: the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and/or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle. The programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the game.

== Emulation ==

{{Main|Video game console emulator}}
Emulators are softwares that allow games to run on a different platform from the original hardware by replicate the behavior of a console, they are found in [[personal computer|PC]]s, [[smartphone]]s and other [[video game console|consoles]]. Emulators emerged in the early 1990s, they are generally used to play old games, [[ROM hacking|hack existing games]], [[Fan translation of video games|translate unreleased games in an especific region]] or add enhanced features to games like improved graphics, speed up or down, bypass regional lockouts, or online multiplayer support.

In the United States, emulation without permission of the publisher is illegal. Due to great demand, began to emerge emulation officially, the first case was the [[Virtual Console]] on the [[Nintendo Wii]], it was one of [[Nintendo]]'s shares to prevent piracy.<ref>http://ap.nintendo.com/faq/</ref>

==Social aspects==

===Demographics===
{{See also|Women and video games}}
The November 2005 Nielsen Active Gamer Study, taking a survey of 2,000 regular [[gamer]]s, found that the U.S. games market is diversifying. The age group among male players has expanded significantly in the 25–40 age group. For casual online puzzle-style and simple mobile cell phone games, the gender divide is more or less equal between males and females. Females have also been found to show an attraction to online multi-player games where there is a communal experience.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} More recently there has been a growing segment of female players engaged with the aggressive style of games historically considered to fall within traditionally male genres (e.g., [[first-person shooter]]s). According to the ESRB almost 41% of PC gamers are women<ref>{{cite web | author = Guy, Hannah |year=2007 | url = http://www.pcworld.ca/news/column/a7fe9b8a0a010408019ac931643ebf2c/pg0.htm | title = Women video gamers: Not just solitaire |archiveurl= http://www.asiancanadian.net/2007/03/women-video-gamers-not-just-solitaire.html |archivedate= 12 March 2007 |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] Canada }}</ref>

When comparing today's industry climate with that of 20 years ago, women and many adults are more inclined to be using products in the industry. While the market for teen and young adult men is still a strong market, it is the other demographics which are posting significant growth. The [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA) provides the following summary for 2011 based on a study of almost 1,200 American households carried out by Ipsos MediaCT:<ref>{{cite web | author = ESA | title = Game Player Data | url = http://www.theesa.com/facts/gameplayer.asp}}</ref>
* The average gamer is 30 years old and has been playing for 12 years. Eighty-two percent of gamers are 18 years of age or older.
* Forty-two percent of all players are women and women over 18 years of age are one of the industry's fastest growing demographics.
* Twenty-nine percent of game players are over the age of 50, an increase from nine percent in 1999.
* Sixty-five percent of gamers play games with other gamers in person.
* Fifty-five percent of gamers play games on their phones or handheld device.

A 2006 academic study, based on a survey answered by 10,000 gamers, identified the [[gaymer]]s (gamers that identify as gay) as a demographic group.<ref name="first ever survey">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=7415 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060618040019/http://www.washingtonblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=7415 |archivedate=18 June 2006 |title=First-ever survey of gay videogamers |last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |date=10 June 2006 |publisher=[[Washington Blade]] |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ga&article_code=2071|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090101100249/http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ga&article_code=2071|archivedate=1 January 2009|title=Gay video game player survey |last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |date=8 June 2006 |publisher=In Newsweekly |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://i.joystiq.com/2007/02/26/gay-gamer-survey-results-with-large-hetero-inclusion/|title=Gay gamer survey results with large hetero inclusion|last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander|publisher=Joystiq}}</ref> A follow-up survey in 2009 studied the purchase habits and content preferences of people in the group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/10/08/new-gaymer-survey-explores-sexual-identity-interest-in-games/#continued |title=New 'gaymer' survey explores sexual identity, interest in games |last=Sliwinski |first= Alexander |date=8 October 2009 |publisher=Joystiq.com |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5377127/what-do-gay-gamers-want-from-their-games |title=What Do Gay Gamers Want From Their Games? |last=Fahey |first= Mike |date=8 October 2009 |publisher=Kotaku.com |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.watermarkonline.com/w-news/orlando/item/403-orlando-student-conducts-gay-gamer-survey |title=Orlando student conducts gay gamer survey |last=Hyman |first=Jamie |date=3 September 2009 |publisher=Orlando Watermark |quote=}}</ref>

===Multiplayer===
{{Main|Multiplayer video game}}

Video gaming has traditionally been a social experience. [[Multiplayer game|Multiplayer video games]] are those that can be played either competitively, sometimes in [[Electronic Sports]], or cooperatively by using either multiple input devices, or by [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseating]]. ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', arguably the first video game, was a two player game, as was its successor ''[[Pong]]''. The first commercially available game console, the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], had two controller inputs.

Since then, most consoles have been shipped with two or four controller inputs. Some have had the ability to expand to four, eight or as many as 12 inputs with additional adapters, such as the [[Multitap]]. Multiplayer [[arcade game]]s typically feature play for two to four players, sometimes tilting the monitor on its back for a top-down viewing experience allowing players to sit opposite one another.

Many early computer games for non-PC descendant based platforms featured multiplayer support. Personal computer systems from [[Atari]] and [[Commodore International|Commodore]] both regularly featured at least two game ports. PC-based computer games started with a lower availability of multiplayer options because of technical limitations. PCs typically had either one or no game ports at all. Network games for these early personal computers were generally limited to only text based adventures or [[MUD]]s that were played remotely on a dedicated server. This was due both to the slow speed of modems (300-1200-bit/s), and the prohibitive cost involved with putting a computer online in such a way where multiple visitors could make use of it. However, with the advent of widespread [[local area network]]ing technologies and Internet based online capabilities, the number of players in modern games can be 32 or higher, sometimes featuring integrated text and/or voice chat. [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]] can offer extremely high numbers of simultaneous players; ''[[Eve Online]]'' set a record with 65,303 players on a single server in 2013.<ref name="MassivelyEVEPCU">{{cite web|url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2013/05/06/eve-online-smashes-pcu-record-during-anniversary-celebrations/ |title=EVE Online smashes PCU record during anniversary celebrations |publisher=massively.joystiq.com }}</ref>

===Behavioral effects===
{{Main|Video game behavioral effects}}

It has been shown that action video game players have better [[hand–eye coordination]] and [[Motor coordination|visuo-motor skill]]s, such as their resistance to [[distraction]], their sensitivity to information in the [[peripheral vision]] and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than nonplayers.<ref>
{{cite journal| authorlink = Shawn Green (game designer)| title = Action video game modifies visual selective attention| journal = Nature| volume = 423| pages = 534–537| year = 2003| id = Green & Bavelier| doi = 10.1038/nature01647| author = Green, C. Shawn| pmid = 12774121| last2 = Bavelier| first2 = Daphne| issue = 6939}}</ref>

Researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games, involving challenges that switch attention between different locations, but not with games requiring concentration on single objects.
It has been suggested by a few studies that online/offline video gaming can be used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of different mental health concerns.{{Which|date=August 2009}}

In [[Steven Berlin Johnson|Steven Johnson]]'s book, ''[[Everything Bad Is Good for You]]'', he argues that video games in fact demand far more from a player than traditional games like ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]''. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, as well as how to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUDs]]. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crbo_books |title=Brain Candy |work=The New Yorker }}</ref> Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.<ref>{{cite web | author = Daphne Bavelier| year = 2003 | url = http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf | title = Action video game modifies visual selective attention | publisher = Nature/University of Rochester | accessdate = 29 April 2006 |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060329174957/http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf |archivedate = 29 March 2006|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American Psychological Association, certain types of video games can improve the gamers' [[dexterity]] as well as their ability to problem-solve. A study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors compared to those who did not play video games. A second study of 303 laparoscopic surgeons (82 percent men; 18 percent women) also showed that surgeons who played video games requiring spatial skills and hand dexterity and then performed a drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt and across all 10 trials than the surgeons who did not play the video games first.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/543366/ Playing Video Games Offers Learning Across Life Span] Newswise. Retrieved 17 August 2008.</ref>

The research showing benefits from action games has been questioned due to methodological shortcomings, such as recruitment strategies and selection bias, potential placebo effects, and lack of baseline improvements in control groups.<ref name=Bootetal_2011>{{cite journal |author=Boot WR, Blakely DP, Simons DJ |title=Do action video games improve perception and cognition? |journal=Front Psychol |volume=2 |issue= |pages=226 |year=2011 |pmid=21949513 |pmc=3171788 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00226 |url=}}</ref> In addition, many of the studies are [[cross-sectional]], and of the [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] interventional trials, not all have found effects.<ref name=Bootetal_2011/> A response to this pointed out that the skill improvements from action games are more broad than predicted, such as [[mental rotation]], which is not a common task in action games.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Green CS, Bavelier D |title=Learning, attentional control, and action video games |journal=Curr.

===Objections to video games===
{{Main|Video game controversies}}

Like other media, video games have been the subject of objections, controversies and censorship, for instance because of depictions of violence, sexual themes, [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco]] and other [[Recreational drug use|drugs]], [[propaganda]], profanity or [[advergaming|advertisement]]s. Critics of video games include parents' groups, politicians, religious groups and other [[advocacy group]]s. Claims that some video games cause  [[video game addiction|addiction]] or violent behavior continue to be made and to be disputed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christopherjferguson.com/SCOTUSPaper.pdf |title=Video Games and the Supreme Court: Lessons for the scientific community in the wake of Brown v EMA, 2011 |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=March 2013 }}</ref>

== Ratings and censorship ==
{{Globalize/West|section|date=September 2014}}
{{Main|Video game content rating system}}

=== ESRB ===
The [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) gives video games maturity ratings based on their content. For example, a game might be rated ''T'' for ''Teen'' if the game contained obscene words or violence. If a game contains explicit violence or sexual themes, it is likely to receive an ''M'' for ''Mature'' rating, which means that no one under 17 should play it. There is a rated "A/O" games for "Adults Only" these games have massive violence or nudity. There are no laws that prohibit children from purchasing "M" rated games in the United States.  Laws attempting to prohibit minors from purchasing "M" rated games were established in California, [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Louisiana]], but all were overturned on the grounds that these laws violated the First Amendment.<ref name="legal results">{{cite web|last=McCauley|first=Dennis|title=The Political Game: A Brief History of Video Game Legislation|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/08/18/the-political-game-a-brief-history-of-video-game-legislation/|work=joystiq.com|publisher=joystiq.com|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref> However, many stores have opted to not sell such games to children anyway. Of course, video game laws vary from country to country. One of the most controversial games of all time, ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' by Rockstar Studios, was given an [[Entertainment Software Rating Board#Restricted ratings|AO rating]] by the ESRB until Rockstar could make the content more suitable for a mature audience.

Video game manufacturers usually exercise tight control over the games that are made available on their systems, so unusual or special-interest games are more likely to appear as [[PC games]]. Free, casual, and [[browser-based game]]s are usually played on available computers, mobile phones, or [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s.

=== PEGI ===
[[Pan European Game Information]] (PEGI) is a system that was developed to standardize the game ratings in all of Europe (not just [[European Union]], although the majority are EU members), the current members are: all EU members, except Germany and the 10 accession states; [[Norway]]; [[Switzerland]]. Iceland is expected to join soon, as are the 10 EU accession states. For all PEGI members, they use it as their sole system, with the exception of the UK, where if a game contains certain material,<ref>{{cite web|title=Classification: Guidelines: Introduction|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/classification/guidelines/introduction/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110525065730/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/classification/guidelines/introduction/|archivedate=2011-05-25|publisher=British Board of Film Classification|accessdate=23 November 2011|quote=The BBFC classifies video works which are released as video recordings under the Video Recordings Act 1984. (The video games covered by the VRA are those whose exemption is forfeited under section 2(2) because they depict human sexual activity, gross violence or other matters of concern.)}}</ref> it must be rated by [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]]. The PEGI ratings are legally binding in [[Vienna]] and it is a criminal offence to sell a game to someone if it is rated above their age.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pan European Game Information|url=http://bupp.at/chancen-amp-risiken/jugendschutz/pegi/|publisher=Bundesstelle für die Positivprädikatisierung von Computer- und Konsolenspielen|accessdate=23 November 2011|language=German|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130917183141/http://bupp.at/chancen-amp-risiken/jugendschutz/pegi/ |archivedate=17 September 2013|quote=Eine Kennzeichung mit der PEGI-Altersempfehlung ist in Wien seit April 2008 verpflichtend: Es dürfen nur Spiele verkauft werden, die eine PEGI-Kennzeichnung tragen. Und es dürfen die Spiele nur an Jugendliche verkauft werden, wenn diese zumindest das Alter gemäß PEGI-Kennzeichung erreicht haben. Bis Ende 2009 gilt in der Übergangsfrist alternativ auch die Kennzeichnung der USK.}}</ref>

=== Germany: BPjM and USK ===
Stricter game rating laws mean that Germany does not operate within the PEGI. Instead, they adopt their own system of certification which is required by law. The [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (''USK'' or Voluntary Certification of Entertainment Software) checks every game before release and assigns an age rating to it – either none (white), 6 years of age (yellow), 12 years of age (green), 16 years of age (blue) or 18 years of age (red). It is forbidden for anyone, retailers, friends or parents alike, to allow a child access to a game for which he or she is underage. If a game is considered to be harmful to young people (for example because of extremely violent, pornographic or racist content), it may be referred to the BPjM (''[[Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien]]'' – Federal Verification Office for Child-Endangering Media) who may opt to place it on the Index upon which the game may not be sold openly or advertised in the open media. Such indexed titles are not "banned" and can still be legally obtained by adults, but it is considered a felony to supply these titles to a child.
