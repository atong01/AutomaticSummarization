==History==
[[File:Selige Johanna.jpg|100px|thumb|left|170px|Infanta D. [[Joan of Portugal (nun)|Joana]], daughter of King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]]]]
The presence of human settlement in the territory of Aveiro extends to the period associated with the great dolmens of pre-history, which exist in most of the region.<ref name="Historia">{{citation |editor=Câmara Municipal |publisher=Câmara Municipal de Aveiro |location=Aveiro, Portugal |year=2011 |url=http://www.cm-aveiro.pt/www/templates/TabTemplate.aspx?id_class=2348&TM=2345S2348 |title=História |language=Portuguese}}</ref>

For a long period Aveiro was important economic link in the production of salt and commercial shipping.<ref name=Historia/> It was a centre of salt exploration by the Romans and trade since 26 January 959 (from the testament of Countess Mumadona Dias to the ''cenóbio'' of Guimarães).<ref name=Historia/> During this testament, Mumadona Dias also highlighted the ancient name for Aveiro, referring to the monastery's lands in ''Alauario et Salinas'', literally, "''a gathering place or preserve of birds and of great salt''".<ref name=Historia/>

The [[Moors]] invaded and then held it until the 11th century, after which it became popular with Portuguese royalty.

===Kingdom===
[[File:Execução do Duque de Aveiro e do Marquês de Tavora.jpg|thumb|170px|left|A depiction of the execution of the Duke of Aveiro, [[José Mascarenhas]].]]
[[File:Jose Estevao Magalhaes.jpg|thumb|170px|left|José Estêvão, parliamentary and 19th century hero]]
Later, King [[John I of Portugal|John I]], on the advise of his son [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra|Peter]] (who was the [[Donatário|donatary]] of Aveiro, requested the construction of fortification walls.

King [[Duarte de Portugal|D. Duarte]] conceded in 1435 the privilege of providing an annual duty-free fair, later referred to as the ''Feira de Março'' (''March Fair''), today still an annual tradition.

The Princess [[Joan of Portugal (nun)|St. Joana]], daughter of [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] lived in Aveiro, entering the convent of Jesus, and lived their until her death on 12 May 1490. During her life her presence brought attention the town, and favoured it with an elevated level of development for the time.

The first charter ([[foral]]) was conceded by [[Manuel I of Portugal]] on 4 August 1515, as indicated in the ''Livro de Leituras Novas de Forais da Estremadura''. Its geographic position along the Aveiro River had always helped it to subsist and grow, supported by salt market, fishing and maritime commercial development.
By the beginning of the 15th century, there are already existed a great wall around the historical centre, intonating the significance of the community and growth of the population.<ref name=Historia/> This included the founding of many religious institutions and their supports, which assisted during the 17th and 18th century crises associated with silt in the waterway.<ref name=Historia/> In the winter of 1575, a terrible storm closed the entrance to its port, ending a thriving trade in [[metal]]s and [[tile]]s, and creating a reef barrier at the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The walls were subsequently demolished and used to create the docks around the new sand bar.

Between the 16th and 17th centuries, the rivers instability at the mouth (between the Ria and open ocean) resulted in the closure of the canal, impeding the use of the port of Aveiro, and creating stagnation in the waters of the lagoon. This blow to the economy creating a social and economic crisis, and resulting in the decrease in the population and emigration. It was at this time that the Church of the Miserícordia was constructed, during the Philippine Dynastic union.

In 1759, [[Joseph I of Portugal]] elevate the town to the status of city, a few months after condemning the Duke of Aveiro (a title established in 1547 by [[John III of Portugal|John III]]), José Mascarenhas, to death. As a result, Aveiro became known as '''Nova Bragança''': it was later abandoned much later, and returned to Aveiro. In 1774, by request of King Joseph, [[Pope Clement XIV]] instituted the [[Diocese of Aveiro]].

In the 19th century, the Aveirense were active during the [[Liberal Wars]], and it was José Estêvão Coelho de Magalhães, a parliamentary member who was determinant in resolving the problem of access along the Ria, and development of transport, especially the railway line between Lisbon and Porto. It was the opening of the artificial canals, completed in 1808, that allowed Aveiro to expand economically, marking the beginning in the town's growth.<ref name=Historia/>

The municipality was elevated to the status of town, centred on the its principal church, consecrated to the Archangel Michael, today the location of the ''Praça da Republica'' (having been demolished in 1835.

[[File:Aveiro Train station.jpg|thumb|235px|The old railway station]]
The local economy is fed by a series of transport networks that cross the municipal boundaries. Regional gateways include air service through the Aerodromo de Aveiro/São Jacinto (LPAV) and the Porto de Aveiro (Ílhavo/Aveiro). Rail service includes service by Alfa Pendular (between Lisbon and Braga; Lisbon and Porto; Faro and Oporto) and Intercity (between Lisbon and Porto and Lisbon and Guimarães) trains; suburban links through the Urbanos do Porto and, also, the [[Linha do Vouga]], a narrow gauge railway to Águeda and [[Sernada do Vouga]].

==Architecture==
[[File:Catedral de Aveiro.jpg|thumb|235px|The front facade of the [[Cathedral of Aveiro]]]]
The architecture of Aveiro is influenced by two phases: the pre-Kingdom era, with a number of historical monuments; and the modernist movements resulting from the expansion of economy during the 19th-20th centuries.

The city's primary landmark is the 15th century '''Monastery of Jesus''' ({{lang-pt|Mosteiro de Jesus}}), containing the tomb of King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]]'s daughter, [[Joan of Portugal (nun)|St. Joana]] (who died in 1490). The presence of this royal personage, beatified in 1693, proved to be of great benefit when she bequeathed her valuable estate to the convent. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the convent housed a school of embroidery, but was transformed into the ''Museu de Santa Joana'', or simply, the Museum of Aveiro, housing many of these handicrafts.

The abundance of 19th-20th century architectural buildings reflects the affects of the boom during that period, including many of the Art Novo and Art Deco buildings, inspired by modernist trends and Nationalist tendencies of the Estado Novo regime.<ref name=Historia/>  The best of these in the university campus, where many the nationalist architects were involved in construction projects.<ref name=Historia/>

There are several attractions in the city of Aveiro, including cathedrals, canals and the beache, including the ''Ílhavo ceramica de Vista Alegre'' and the beaches of Barra, Costa Nova do Prado, and [[Gafanha da Nazaré]].
