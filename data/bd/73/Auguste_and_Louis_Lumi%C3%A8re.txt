==History==
The Lumière brothers were born in [[Besançon]], [[France]] to '''Claude-Antoine Lumière''' and '''Jeanne Joséphine Costille Lumière'''. They moved to [[Lyon]] in 1870, where both attended [[La Martiniere Lyon|La Martiniere]], the largest technical school in Lyon.<ref>{{cite book | title = Motion Pictures | author = Gina De Angelis | publisher = The Oliver Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-881508-78-6 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=daHmkclqERYC&pg=PA34&dq=Lumi%C3%A8re+Besan%C3%A7on+Lyon&lr=&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES&ei=eqdfSaiYK4PAlQTF4tj7BQ#PPA34,M1 }}</ref> Their father, Claude-Antoine Lumière (1840–1911), ran a [[History of the camera|photographic]] firm where both brothers worked for him: Louis as a physicist and Auguste as a manager. Louis had made some improvements to the still-photograph process, the most notable being the dry-plate process, which was a major step towards moving images.

[[File:Institut Lumière - CINEMATOGRAPHE Camera.jpg|thumb|Cinématographe Lumière at the [[Institut Lumière]], France]]
It was not until their father retired in 1892 that the brothers began to create moving pictures. They patented a number of significant processes leading up to their film camera, most notably [[film perforations]] (originally implemented by [[Emile Reynaud]]) as a means of advancing the film through the camera and projector. The original [[cinématographe]] had been patented by [[Léon Guillaume Bouly]] on 12 February 1892.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Brevet FR 219.350 |url=http://cinematographes.free.fr/bouly-219350.html |quote= |publisher=''Cinematographes'' |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref>  The brothers patented their own version on 13 February 1895.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Brevet FR 245.032 |url=http://cinematographes.free.fr/lumiere-245032.html |quote= |publisher=''Cinematographes'' |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref>  The first footage ever to be recorded using it was recorded on March 19, 1895. This first film shows workers leaving the Lumière factory.

==First film screenings==
The Lumières held their first private screening of projected motion pictures in 1895.<ref>Chardère (1985), p.71. This first screening on March 22, 1895 took place in Paris, at the "Society for the Development of the National Industry", in front of an audience of 200 people – among which [[Léon Gaumont]], then director of the Comptoir de la photographie. The main focus of this conference by Louis Lumière were the recent developments in the photograph industry, mainly the research on polychromy (color photography). It was much to Lumière's surprise that the moving black-and-white images retained more attention than the colored stills photographs.</ref>  Their first public screening of films at which admission was charged was held on December 28, 1895, at [[Salon Indien du Grand Café]] in Paris.<ref>[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/presentation-du-cinematographe-lumiere/ December 28, 1895.]</ref> This history-making presentation featured ten short films, including their first film, ''[[Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory|Sortie des Usines Lumière à Lyon]]'' (''Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory'').<ref>[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html "La première séance publique payante", Institut Lumière]</ref> Each film is 17 meters long, which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds.

[[Image:Cinématographe Lumière.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The world's first film poster, for 1895's ''[[L'Arroseur arrosé]]'']] It is believed their first film was actually recorded that same year (1895)<ref>Chardère (1987), p.70: The date of the recording of their first film is in dispute. In an interview with Georges Sadoul given in 1948, Louis Lumière tells that he shot the film in August 1894. This is questioned by historians (Sadoul, Pinel, Chardère) who consider that a functional Lumière camera didn't exist before the end of 1894, and that their first film was recorded March 19th 1895, and then publicly projected March 22nd at the Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale in Paris.</ref> with [[Léon Bouly]]'s [[cinematographe|cinématographe]] device, which was patented the previous year. The cinématographe — a three-in-one device that could record, develop, and project [[film|motion picture]]s — was further developed by the Lumières.

The public debut at the Grand Café came a few months later and consisted of the following ten short films (in order of presentation):<ref>[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html Bienvenue sur Adobe GoLive 4]. Institut-lumiere.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.</ref>

#''[[Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory|La Sortie de l'Usine Lumière à Lyon]]'' (literally, "the exit from the Lumière factory in Lyon", or, under its more common English title, ''Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory''), 46 seconds
#''Le Jardinier ([[l'Arroseur Arrosé]])'' ("The Gardener", or "The Sprinkler Sprinkled"), 49 seconds

#''[[Les Forgerons]]'' ("Blacksmiths"), 49 seconds
#''[[Repas de bébé]]'' ("Baby's Breakfast" (lit. "baby's meal")), 41 seconds
#''[[Le Saut à la couverture]]'' ("Jumping Onto the Blanket"), 41 seconds
#''[[Place des Cordeliers à Lyon|La Places des Cordeliers à Lyon]]'' ("Cordeliers Square in Lyon"—a street scene), 44 seconds
#''[[La Mer (film)|La Mer (Baignade en mer)]]'' ("the sea [bathing in the sea]"), 38 seconds

The Lumières went on tour with the cinématographe in 1896, visiting [[Brussels]] (the first place a movie was played outside Paris on the Galleries Saint-Hubert on March 1. 1896), [[Bombay]], [[London]], [[Montreal]], [[New York]] and [[Buenos Aires]].

The moving images had an immediate and significant influence on popular culture with ''[[L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat]]'' (literally, "the arrival of a train at La Ciotat", but more commonly known as ''Arrival of a Train at a Station'') and ''[[Carmaux, défournage du coke]]'' (Drawing out the coke). Their [[actuality film]]s, or ''actualités'', are often cited as the first, primitive [[documentaries]]. They also made the first steps towards comedy film with the slapstick of ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé]]''.

==Early color photography==

The brothers stated that "the [[film|cinema]] is an [[invention]] without any future" and declined to sell their camera to other filmmakers such as [[Georges Méliès]]. This made many film makers upset. Consequently, their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. In parallel with their cinema work they experimented with colour photography.  They worked on a number of colour photographic processes in the 1890s including the Lippmann process (interference heliochromy) and their own 'bichromated glue' process,<ref>[http://www.ignomini.com/photographica/stereophotovintage/Trichrome/Lumiere_Trichrome.html]</ref> a subtractive colour process, examples of which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900.  This last process was commercialised by the Lumieres but commercial success had to wait for their next colour process.  In 1903 they patented a colour photographic process, the "[[Autochrome Lumière]]", which was launched on the market in 1907. Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumière, disappeared from the marketplace following  merger with [[Ilford Photo|Ilford]].<ref>[http://sdx.rhonealpes.fr/sdx/sribzh/main.xsp?execute=show_document&id=MERIMEEIA69000030 City of Lyon Document]</ref> They also invented the color plate which really got photography on the road.

==Other early cinematographers==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2010}}
The Lumière Brothers were not the only ones to claim the title of the first cinematographers. The scientific [[chronophotography]] devices developed by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] and [[Ottomar Anschütz]] in the 1880s were able to produce moving photographs, as was [[William Friese-Greene]]'s 'chronophotographic' system, demonstrated in 1890, and [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Kinetoscope]] (developed by W K-L Dickson), premiered in 1891. Since 1892, the projected drawings of [[Émile Reynaud]]'s [[Théâtre Optique]] were attracting Paris crowds to the Museé Grevin. [[Louis Le Prince]] and [[Claude Mechant]] had been shooting moving picture sequences on paper film as soon as 1888, but had never performed a public demonstration. Polish inventor, [[Kazimierz Prószyński]] had built his camera and projecting device, called [[Pleograph]], in 1894. [[Max Skladanowsky|Max and Emil Skladanowsky]], inventors of the [[Bioscop]], had offered projected moving images to a paying public one month earlier (November 1, 1895, in [[Berlin]]). Nevertheless, film historians consider the Grand Café screening to be the true birth of the cinema as a commercial medium, because the Skladanowsky brothers' screening used an extremely impractical dual system motion picture projector that was immediately supplanted by the Lumiere cinematographe.

Although the Lumière brothers were not the first inventors to develop techniques to create motion pictures, they are often credited as among the first inventors of the technology for Cinema as a mass medium, and are among the first who understood how to use it.
