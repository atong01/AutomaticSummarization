However, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular.

Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple.

However, stage, film, and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons&amp;nbsp; e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted<space/><italics><link><target>The Witness for the Prosecution</target><part>Witness for the Prosecution</part></link></italics><space/>into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in film and television productions, most famously the<space/><link><target>Charles Laughton</target></link>/<link><target>Marlene Dietrich</target></link><space/>film.)

She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<extension extension_name='ref' name="britishmuseum"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="publisher">Trustees of the British Museum</arg><arg name="url">http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx</arg><arg name="title">Agatha Christie: Archaeology</arg><arg name="accessdate">25 January 2015</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Christie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<extension extension_name='ref' name="britishmuseum"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites.

One of the stronger influences is her love of the mystical and mysterious. Many of Christie's books and short stories, set both in the Middle East and back in England, have a decidedly otherworldly influence in which religious sects, sacrifices, ceremony, and seances play a part. Such stories include &quot;The Hound of Death&quot; and &quot;The Idol House of Astarte&quot;. This theme was greatly strengthened by those times which Christie spent in the Middle East, where she was consistently surrounded by the religious temples and spiritual history of the towns and cities that they were excavating during Mallowan's archaeological work.<space/><template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">January 2015</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Use of archaeology and spirituality in her writing</heading><paragraph>Many of the settings for Christie's books were directly inspired by the many archaeological field seasons spent in the Middle East on the sites managed by her husband Max. The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them. One such site featured in her work is the temple site of<space/><link><target>Abu Simbel temples</target><part>Abu Simbel</part></link>, depicted in<space/><italics><link><target>Death on the Nile</target></link></italics>. Also there is the great detail in which she describes life at the dig site in<space/><italics><link><target>Murder in Mesopotamia</target></link></italics>. Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artifacts. Most notable are the characters of Dr. Eric Leidner in<space/><italics>Murder in Mesopotamia</italics><space/>and Signor Richetti in<space/><italics>Death on the Nile</italics>, while many minor characters were archaeologists in<space/><italics>They Came to Baghdad</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>Some of Christie's best known novels with heavy archaeological influences are:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><italics><link><target>Murder in Mesopotamia</target><part>Murder in Mesopotamia (1936)</part></link></italics><space/>the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, multiple specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had spent much of her time in very similar situations.
