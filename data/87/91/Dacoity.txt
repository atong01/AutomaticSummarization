'''Dacoity''' is a term used for "[[banditry]]" in [[Hindi]], [[Kannada]] and [[Urdu]]. The spelling is the [[anglicise|anglicized]] version of the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word and as a colloquial [[Anglo-Indian]] word with this meaning, it appears in the [[Hobson-Jobson|''Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases'']] (1903).<ref>HereThe genesis of dacoity [armed robbery by a gang] in Chambal valley [north-central India] has been a popular theme too (Bhaduri, 1972; Khan, 1981; Jatar, 1980; Katare, 1972). Again, most explanations have simply suggested feudal exploitation as the cause that provoked many people of this region to take to arms. The fact that many gangs operating in this valley were composed of higher castes and wealthy people appears to suggest that feudalism may only be a partial explanation of dacoity in Chambal valley. (Defined by Arvind Verma, in Jul-Dec 2008) "Anglo-Indian"  refers to the language, or linguistic usage. See Yule, Henry and Burnell, Arthur Coke (1886) ''[[Hobson-Jobson|Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive]]'' J. Murry, London; reprinted 1903; see page [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Z5iAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA290 page 290] of the 1903 edition for "dacoit".</ref> [[Bandit#Banditry|Banditry]] is criminal activity involving robbery by groups of armed bandits. The [[East India Company]] established the [[Thuggee and Dacoity Department]] in 1830, and the [[Thuggee and Dacoity Suppression Acts, 1836–1848]] were enacted in [[British India]] under [[Company rule in India|East India Company rule]]. Areas with ravines or forests, such as [[Chambal division|Chambal]] and [[Chilapata Forests]], were once known for dacoits.

==Etymology==
The word "dacoity" is the [[anglicise|anglicized]] version of the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''ḍakaitī'' (historically spelled ''dakaitee'', [[Hindi]]  डकैती or [[Urdu]] ڈکیتی or [[Bengali language|Bengali]] ডাকাতি), which comes from ''ḍākū'' (historically spelled ''dakoo'', [[Hindi]]: डाकू, [[Urdu]]: ڈاکو, meaning "armed robber") or [[Bengali language|Bengali]] ''ḍakat'' (ডাকাত).

In [[Urdu language|Urdu]], ''ḍākū'' ڈاکو is [[Singular number|singular]] and ''ḍakait'' ڈکیت [[plural]] for [[bandit]]s. The crime of banditry is known as ''dakaitee'' ڈکیتی.

In [[Hindi]] '''dacoity''' ([[Hindi]]: डकैती ''ḍakaitī'', [[Urdu]]: ڈکیتی ''ḍakaitī'', {{lang-bn|ডাকাতি  ''ḍakati''}}) means "armed [[robbery]]".
In [[Tamil Nadu]], the crime of banditry is known as "Dakalti".

The term '''dacoit''' ([[Hindi]]: डकैत ''ḍakait'', [[Urdu]]: ڈکیت ''ḍakait'', {{lang-bn|ডাকাত ''ḍākāt ''}}) means "a [[bandit]]", according to ''[[OED]]'' ("A member of a class of robbers in India and [[Burma]], who plunder in armed bands.") Dacoits existed in Burma as well as India, and [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s fictional Private Mulvaney was hunting Burmese "dacoits" in [[The Taking of Lungtungpen]]. [[Sax Rohmer]]'s criminal mastermind [[Fu Manchu|Dr. Fu Manchu]] also employed Burmese dacoits as his [[henchmen]]. The term was also applied, according to ''[[OED]]'', to "pirates who formerly infested the [[Ganges]] between [[Calcutta]] and [[Baharampur|Burhampore]]".

"Known Dacoit" (K.D.) is a term used by the Indian police forces to classify criminals. 
The dacoity have had a large impact in the Morena and Chambal regions.

==Dacoits==
[[File:A family of Indian dacoits (c. 1900s).jpg|thumbnail|A family of Indian dacoits]]
India's [[Phoolan Devi]]<ref>{{cite news | authors= Phoolan Devi, with Marie-Therese Cuny, and Paul Rambali, | title= The Bandit Queen of India: An Indian Woman's Amazing Journey from Peasant to International Legend | publisher = Guilford, CT: The Lyons Press, 2006 | ISBN= 978-1-59228-641-6 }}</ref> authored an autobiography and the movie ''[[Bandit Queen]]'', released in 1994, was based on her life.

[[Dadua]] was one of the most infamous dacoit in U.P. and M.P. having very strong political links. His son Veer Sing is a MLA and brother Bal Kumar patel is MP. His nephew Ram Singh is also a MLA.

[[Man Singh (dacoit)|Daku Man Singh]] '''Roopa Pandit''' committed over 1,000 armed robberies, 185 murders, and many ransom kidnappings between 1939 and 1955.<ref>Staff (5 September 1955) [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893055,00.html "India: Dead Man"] ''Time magazine''</ref>  He was involved in 90 police encounters and killed 32 police officers.<ref>Austa, Sanjay (23 August 2003) [http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030824/spectrum/main3.htm "Daku Raja becomes devta"] ''The Sunday Tribune'' Spectrum section</ref>

Daku [[Paan Singh Tomar]] was another infamous dacoit in [[Chambal Division|Chambal]]. He was an international athlete before he was a dacoit. Paan Singh Tomar became so infamous that the government had to call up around 10,000 men from BSF, CRPF and state police in an attempt to capture him. Other well known dacoits are [[Jagga Jatt]] and [[Sucha Singh Soorma]] from Punjab.

[[Veerappan]] evaded authorities for decades until he was shot and killed in 2004.<ref>{{cite news | title= Veerappan, the man behind 124 murders | url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/veer/rise1.html | year=2002 |publisher = Hindustan Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3943969.stm | work=BBC News | title='Treasure hunt' for bandit's loot | date=October 22, 2004 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> He was active for a period of years in an area covering  6,000&nbsp;km² in the states of [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]]  and [[Tamil Nadu]].

One of the most famous "ünderage dacoits" from the Chambal region is Chambal Rani, she was notorious for her exploits of looting trains and carriages mostly for grains. Although, nobody knows her real identity. The myth of the Chambal Rani and her pony was lost in the folklore of the ravines. She was known for her short height, aggressive demeanor and her demented behavior. In fact, experts on the topic suggest that the movie Bandit Queen was inspired by the life and times of Chambal Rani and not Phoolan Devi. The Gang of Chambal Rani was known to perform black magic on their victims and members of rival gangs. She has evaded the authorities for her entire life and has over 150 murder and 70 dacoity cases rgistered against her name.

Local inhabitants of Chambal, especially the Gullu Community of Chambal Vally, referred to Chambal Rani as "Chambal Ka Sherni" (Lioness of The Chambal). There are many folk songs and Noutanki plays based on the stories of her life. Songs about Chambal Rani include "Rasta Chalta Koi Nahin Loota, Na Bahino Se Chheene Haar" "Jo Bhi Mila So Baant Diya, Bahino Ko Pahinaye Bhaat" (in English: "(She) did not rob anyone who was walking the road, neither snatched the necklace of a sister (term may refer to girls)", "What ever (she) got, (she) shared")

[[Chambal Division|Chambal]] dacoit [[Nirbhay Gujjar|Nirbhay Singh Gujjar]] achieved national infamy before being killed in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.southasianpost.com/portal2/ff8080810ec3b59f010ec3d055ad00bb.do.html |title=The 'Last Lion of Chambal' gunned down by police |date=September 20, 2005 |publisher=www.southasianpost.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110716113513/http://www.southasianpost.com/portal2/ff8080810ec3b59f010ec3d055ad00bb.do.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}</ref>

Other infamous dacoits were [[The Confession of Sultana Daku|Sultana Daku]] in the [[Bijnor]] district, and Dhira, mostly active in present Amritsar, particularly in the Majitha area.

==Protection measures==
In [[Madhya Pradesh]] State, women belonging to a village defence group have been issued firearm permits to fend off dacoity.  The chief minister of the state, [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]], recognized the role the women had played in defending their villages without guns. He stated that he wanted to enable these women to better defend both themselves and their villages, and issued the gun permits to advance this goal.<ref>[http://www.learnaboutguns.com/2008/05/27/indian-women-granted-gun-permits-to-fend-off-armed-robbers/ "Indian Women Granted Gun Permits to Fend Off Armed Robbers"]  LearnAboutGuns.com</ref>

==Popular culture==
As the dacoits flourished through the 1950s–1970s, they were the subject of several films made during this era, beginning with ''[[Ganga Jamuna]]'' (1961) and Raj Kapoor’s ''[[Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai]]'' (1960), and [[Sunil Dutt]]'s  ''[[Mujhe Jeene Do]]'' (1963).<ref>{{cite web |title= THE REAL LIFE HERO|url=http://www.screenindia.com/news/THE-REAL-LIFE-HERO/318575/ |date=Jun 6, 2008|publisher=[[Screen (magazine)]]}}</ref> Other films in this genre were ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973), ''[[Mera Gaon Mera Desh]]'' (1971), and ''[[Kuchhe Dhaage]]'' (1973) both by [[Raj Khosla]]; the latter inspired the film ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), where the character of [[Gabbar Singh (character)|Gabbar Singh]] was played by [[Amjad Khan]]. ''Sholay'' became a classic in the genre, and its success led to a surge in films in this genre, including ''[[Ganga Ki Saugandh]]'' (1978) once again with Amitabh Bachchan, and Amjad Khan.

Punjabi biopic ''[[Jatt Jeona Morh (1991 film)|Jatt Jeona Morh]]'' about the noted dacoit Jatt Jeona Morh, was made in 1991; also in that same year came ''[[Jagga Daku (1991 film)|Jagga Daku]]'', based on a noted outlaw and dacoit during the British Raj, Jagga Daku.

A Hindi novel पैंसठ लाख की डकैती (Painstth Lakh ki Dacoity, 1977) was written by [[Surender Mohan Pathak]]; it was translated as ''[[The 65 Lakh Heist]]''.

Dacoits armed with pistols and swords appear in ''[[Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties]]''.

They frequently appeared in the French language ''[[Bob Morane]]'' series of novels by [[Henri Vernes]], principally as the main thugs or assassins of the hero's recurring villain, Mr. Ming.
