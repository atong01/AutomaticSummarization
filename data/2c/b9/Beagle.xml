Although the tricolour (white with large black areas and light brown shading) is the most common, Beagles can occur in any hound colour.</paragraph><paragraph>Tricoloured dogs occur in a number of shades, from the &quot;Classic Tri&quot; with a jet black saddle (also known as &quot;Blackback&quot;), to the &quot;Dark Tri&quot; (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings), to the &quot;Faded Tri&quot; (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings). Some tricoloured dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as<space/><italics>pied</italics>. These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair. Tricolour Beagles are almost always born black and white. The white areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures. (The brown may take between one and two years to fully develop.) Some Beagles gradually change colour during their lives, and may lose their black markings entirely.</paragraph><paragraph>Two-colour varieties always have a white base colour with areas of the second colour. Tan and white is the most common two-colour variety, but there is a wide range of other colours including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different coloured flecks (<italics>ticking</italics>), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick Beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue colour, similar to the colouring of the<space/><link><target>Bluetick Coonhound</target></link>.
