Fought on 22 August 1485, the battle was won by the Lancastrians. Their leader<space/><link><target>Henry VII of England</target><part>Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond</part></link>, by his victory became the first English monarch of the<space/><link><target>Tudor dynasty</target></link>. His opponent,<space/><link><target>Richard III of England</target><part>Richard III</part></link>, the last king of the House of York, was killed in the battle. Historians consider Bosworth Field to mark the end of the<space/><link><target>House of Plantagenet</target><part>Plantagenet dynasty</part></link>, making it a defining moment of English and Welsh history.</paragraph><paragraph>Richard's reign began in 1483 when he was handed the throne after his twelve-year-old nephew<space/><link><target>Edward V of England</target><part>Edward V</part></link>, for whom he was acting as<space/><link><target>Lord Protector</target></link>, was declared illegitimate and ineligible for the throne. Richard lost popularity after the boy and his younger brother disappeared after Richard incarcerated them in the<space/><link><target>Tower of London</target></link>, and Richard's support was further eroded by the popular belief he was implicated in the death of his wife. Across the<space/><link><target>English Channel</target></link><space/>in Brittany, Henry Tudor, a descendant of the greatly diminished House of Lancaster, seized on Richard's difficulties so that he could challenge Richard's claim to the throne. Henry's first attempt to invade England was frustrated by a storm in 1483, but at his second attempt he arrived unopposed on 7 August 1485 on the southwest coast of Wales. Marching inland, Henry gathered support as he made for London. Richard mustered his troops and intercepted Henry's army south of<space/><link><target>Market Bosworth</target></link><space/>in Leicestershire.<space/><link><target>Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby</target><part>Thomas, Lord Stanley</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)</target><part>Sir William Stanley</part></link><space/>brought a force to the battlefield, but held back while they decided which side it would be more advantageous to support.</paragraph><paragraph>Richard divided his army, which outnumbered Henry's, into three groups (or &quot;battles&quot;). One was assigned to the<space/><link><target>John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk</target><part>Duke of Norfolk</part></link><space/>and another to the<space/><link><target>Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland</target><part>Earl of Northumberland</part></link>. Henry kept most of his force together and placed it under the command of the experienced<space/><link><target>John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford</target><part>Earl of Oxford</part></link>. Richard's vanguard, commanded by Norfolk, attacked but struggled against Oxford's men, and some of Norfolk's troops fled the field. Northumberland took no action when signalled to assist his king, so Richard gambled everything on a charge across the battlefield to kill Henry and end the fight. Seeing the king's knights separated from his army, the Stanleys intervened; Sir William led his men to Henry's aid, surrounding and killing Richard. After the battle, Henry was crowned king below an oak tree in nearby Stoke Golding, now a residential garden.</paragraph><paragraph>Henry hired chroniclers to portray his reign favourably; the Battle of Bosworth was popularised to represent the Tudor dynasty as the start of a new age. From the 15th to 18th centuries the battle was glamorised as a victory of good over evil. The climax of<space/><link><target>William Shakespeare</target></link>'s play<space/><italics><link><target>Richard III (play)</target><part>Richard III</part></link></italics><space/>provides a focal point for critics in later film adaptations. The exact site of the battle is disputed because of the lack of conclusive data, and memorials have been erected at different locations. In 1974, the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built on a site that has since been challenged by several scholars and historians. In October 2009, a team of researchers, who had performed geological surveys and archaeological digs in the area from 2003, suggested a location two miles (3.2&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of<space/><link><target>Ambion Hill</target></link>.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Background</heading><paragraph><template><target>Further2</target><arg>[[Wars of the Roses]]</arg><arg>[[Princes in the Tower]]</arg></template></paragraph><preblock><preline><template><target>Bosworth Template</target></template></preline></preblock><paragraph>During the 15th century, civil war raged across England as the<space/><link><target>House of York</target><part>Houses of York</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>House of Lancaster</target><part>Lancaster</part></link><space/>fought each other for the English throne.
