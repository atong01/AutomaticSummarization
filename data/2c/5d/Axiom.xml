Logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be true within the system of logic they define (e.g., (<italics>A</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>B</italics>) implies<space/><italics>A</italics>), while non-logical axioms (e.g.,<space/><template><target>nowrap</target><arg name="1"><space/>''a'' + ''b''<space/></arg></template>) are actually substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory (such as<space/><link><target>arithmetic</target></link>). When used in the latter sense, &quot;axiom,&quot; &quot;postulate&quot;, and &quot;assumption&quot; may be used interchangeably. In general, a non-logical axiom is not a self-evident truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory. As modern mathematics admits multiple, equally &quot;true&quot; systems of logic, precisely the same thing must be said for logical axioms - they both define and are specific to the particular system of logic that is being invoked. To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms). There are typically multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.</paragraph><paragraph>In both senses, an axiom is any mathematical statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived. Within the system they define, axioms (unless redundant) cannot be derived by principles of deduction, nor are they demonstrable by<space/><link><target>mathematical proof</target><trail>s</trail></link>, simply because they are starting points; there is nothing else from which they logically follow otherwise they would be classified as<space/><link><target>theorem</target><trail>s</trail></link>.

Indeed, Aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated, if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates.<extension extension_name='ref'>Aristotle, Metaphysics Bk IV, Chapter 3, 1005b &quot;Physics also is a kind of Wisdom, but it is not the first kind.

One must concede the need for<space/><link><target>primitive notion</target><trail>s</trail></link>, or undefined terms or concepts, in any study. Such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and therefore useful in multiple contexts.<space/><link><target>Alessandro Padoa</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Mario Pieri</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Giuseppe Peano</target></link><space/>were pioneers in this movement.</paragraph><paragraph>Structuralist mathematics goes further, and develops theories and axioms (e.g.<space/><link><target>Field theory (mathematics)</target><part>field theory</part></link>,<space/><link><target>group (mathematics)</target><part>group theory</part></link>,<space/><link><target>topological space</target><part>topology</part></link>,<space/><link><target>linear space</target><part>vector spaces</part></link>) without<space/><italics>any</italics><space/>particular application in mind. The distinction between an &quot;axiom&quot; and a &quot;postulate&quot; disappears. The postulates of Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However, by throwing out Euclid's fifth postulate we get theories that have meaning in wider contexts,<space/><link><target>hyperbolic geometry</target></link><space/>for example. We must simply be prepared to use labels like &quot;line&quot; and &quot;parallel&quot; with greater flexibility. The development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that postulates should be regarded as purely formal statements, and not as facts based on experience.</paragraph><paragraph>When mathematicians employ the<space/><link><target>Field (mathematics)</target><part>field</part></link><space/>axioms, the intentions are even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application; the mathematician now works in complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field theory gives correct knowledge about them all.</paragraph><paragraph>It is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are &quot;propositions that are regarded as true without proof.&quot; Rather, the field axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints, then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system.</paragraph><paragraph>Modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects, and mathematics itself can be regarded as a branch of<space/><link><target>logic</target></link>.<space/><link><target>Gottlob Frege</target><part>Frege</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Bertrand Russell</target><part>Russell</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Henri Poincar</target><part>Poincar</part></link>,<space/><link><target>David Hilbert</target><part>Hilbert</part></link>, and<space/><link><target>Kurt Gdel</target><part>Gdel</part></link><space/>are some of the key figures in this development.</paragraph><paragraph>In the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any<space/><link><target>Class (set theory)</target><part>collection</part></link><space/>of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms should be<space/><link><target>consistent</target></link>; it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axiom. A set of axioms should also be non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom.</paragraph><paragraph>It was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the formalist program was Hilbert's formalization of<space/><link><target>Euclidean geometry</target></link>, and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms.</paragraph><paragraph>In a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on<space/><link><target>Georg Cantor</target><part>Cantor's</part></link><space/><link><target>set theory</target></link>. Here the emergence of<space/><link><target>Russell's paradox</target></link>, and similar antinomies of<space/><link><target>nave set theory</target></link><space/>raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent.</paragraph><paragraph>The formalist project suffered a decisive setback, when in 1931 Gdel showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of axioms (<link><target>peano arithmetic</target><part>Peano's axioms</part></link>, for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a<space/><link><target>corollary</target></link>, Gdel proved that the consistency of a theory like<space/><link><target>Peano arithmetic</target></link><space/>is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory.</paragraph><paragraph>It is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of<space/><link><target>natural number</target><trail>s</trail></link>, an<space/><link><target>Infinity</target><part>infinite</part></link><space/>but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at present, there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern<space/><link><target>ZermeloFraenkel axioms</target></link><space/>for set theory.

This was in 1935. According to Bohr, this new theory should be<space/><link><target>Probability theory</target><part>probabilistic</part></link>, whereas according to Einstein it should be<space/><link><target>deterministic</target></link>. Notably, the underlying quantum mechanical theory, i.e. the set of &quot;theorems&quot; derived by it, seemed to be identical. Einstein even assumed that it would be sufficient to add to quantum mechanics &quot;hidden variables&quot; to enforce determinism. However, thirty years later, in 1964,<space/><link><target>John Stewart Bell</target><part>John Bell</part></link><space/>found a theorem, involving complicated optical correlations (see<space/><link><target>Bell inequalities</target></link>), which yielded measurably different results using Einstein's axioms compared to using Bohr's axioms. And it took roughly another twenty years until an experiment of<space/><link><target>Alain Aspect</target></link><space/>got results in favour of Bohr's axioms, not Einstein's. (Bohr's axioms are simply: The theory should be probabilistic in the sense of the<space/><link><target>Copenhagen interpretation</target></link>.)</paragraph><paragraph>As a consequence, it is not necessary to explicitly cite Einstein's axioms, the more so since they concern subtle points on the &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;locality&quot; of experiments.</paragraph><paragraph>Regardless, the role of axioms in mathematics and in the above-mentioned sciences is different. In mathematics one neither &quot;proves&quot; nor &quot;disproves&quot; an axiom for a set of theorems; the point is simply that in the conceptual realm identified by the axioms, the theorems logically follow.
