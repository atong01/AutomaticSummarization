{{distinguish|Ammonius of Alexandria (Christian)}}
'''Ammonius Grammaticus''' was a 4th-century Egyptian priest who, after the destruction of the pagan temple at [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] (389), fled to [[Constantinople]], where he became the tutor of the ecclesiastical historian [[Socrates Scholasticus|Socrates]].<ref>Socrates Scholasticus, ''Hist. Eccl. '' 5.16.</ref>
==Life==
Ammonius was formerly identified as the  author of a treatise titled ''Peri homoíōn kai diaphórōn léxeōn'' (περὶ ὁμοίων καὶ διαφόρων λέξεων, ''On the Differences of Synonymous Expressions'').
But it seems more probable that the real author was [[Herennius Philo]] of Byblus, who was born during the reign of [[Nero]] and lived till the reign of [[Hadrian]], and that the treatise in its present form is a revision prepared by a later Byzantine editor, whose name may have been Ammonius.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
