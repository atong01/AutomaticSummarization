He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that &quot;tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different it hits the present taste.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref' name="mat"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>As the economy expanded across the world during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising.</paragraph><paragraph>In June 1836, French newspaper<space/><italics><link><target>La Presse (France)</target><part>La Presse</part></link></italics><space/>was the first to include paid advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its<space/><link><target>Profit (economics)</target><part>profitability</part></link><space/>and the formula was soon copied by all titles. Around 1840,<space/><link><target>Volney B. Palmer</target></link><space/>established the roots of the modern day advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad the copy, layout, and artwork was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of N.W. Ayer &amp; Son was founded. Ayer and Son offered to plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.<extension extension_name='ref' name="eskilson-pg58"><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="title">Graphic Design: A New History<space/></arg><arg name="last">Eskilson<space/></arg><arg name="first">Stephen J.<space/></arg><arg name="year">2007<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Yale University Press<space/></arg><arg name="location">New Haven, Connecticut<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">978-0-300-12011-0<space/></arg><arg name="page">58<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>Around the same time, in France,<space/><link><target>Charles-Louis Havas</target></link><space/>extended the services of his news agency,<space/><link><target>Havas</target></link><space/>to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.

A form of press advertising is<space/><link><target>classified advertising</target></link>, which allows private individuals or companies to purchase a small, narrowly targeted ad for a low fee advertising a product or service.

A prime example of this messaging technique is advertising campaigns to promote international travel. While advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism, some travel campaigns carry the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or region. It is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's<space/><link><target>Perception management</target><part>desired international public perception</part></link>.

Later research by a Danish team<extension extension_name='ref'>Vestergaard and Schrder,<space/><italics>The Language of Advertising</italics>, 75</extension><space/>found that advertising attempts to persuade men to improve their appearance or performance, whereas its approach to women is aimed at transformation toward an impossible ideal of female presentation. Advertising's manipulation of women's aspiration to these ideal types, as they are portrayed in film, in erotic art, in advertising, on stage, music video, and other media exposures, requires at least a conditioned rejection of female reality, and thereby takes on a highly ideological cast. Not everyone agrees: one critic viewed this monologic, gender-specific interpretation of advertising as excessively skewed and politicized.<extension extension_name='ref'>Splendora, &quot;Discourse,&quot; Review of Vestergaard and Schrder,<space/><italics>The Language of Advertising</italics><space/>in<space/><italics>Language in Society,</italics><space/>449</extension></paragraph><paragraph>More recently, research by Martin (2003) reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads, and the affective tone of the advertising.
