</ref> attempting to advance a pointed [[prolate spheroid]] ball into the opposing team's scoring area ([[end zone]]). In Canada, the term "'''football'''" may refer to Canadian football and [[American football]] collectively, or to either sport specifically, depending on context. The two sports have shared origins and are closely related but have [[comparison of Canadian and American football|significant differences]]. In particular, Canadian football has 12 players on the field per team rather than 11; the field is roughly 10 yards wider, and 10 yards longer between end-zones that are themselves 10 yards deeper; and a team has only three [[down (American football)|downs]] to gain 10 yards, which results in less [[Rush (American football)#Offense|offensive rushing]] than in the American game. In the Canadian game all players on the defending team, when a down begins, must be at least 1 yard from the line of scrimmage. (The American game has a similar "neutral zone" but it is only the width of the football.)

[[Rugby football]] in Canada originated in the early 1860s,<ref name=1860s/> and over time, the game known as Canadian football developed. Both the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and [[Football Canada]], the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1880 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union. Active teams such as the [[Toronto Argonauts]] and [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] have similar longevity. The CFL is the most popular and only major professional Canadian football league. Its championship game, the [[Grey Cup]], is one of Canada's largest sporting events, attracting a broad television audience, though it has been shrinking in recent years. In 2009, about 40% of Canada's population watched part of the game;<ref name="Houston 2006-12-20">{{Cite news  | last =Zelkovich  | first = Chris  | title = Grey Cup a ratings champion | newspaper = The Toronto Star | location = Toronto, Ontario | date=1 December 2009  | url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/football/cfl/greycup/article/732817--zelkovich-grey-cup-a-ratings-champion | accessdate=23 December 2009}}</ref> in 2014, it was closer to 33%, peaking at 5.1 million viewers in the fourth quarter.<ref>

Canadian football is also played at the high school, junior, collegiate, and semi-professional levels: the [[Canadian Junior Football League]], formed May 8, 1974, and [[Quebec Junior Football League]] are leagues for players aged 18â€“22, many post-secondary institutions compete in [[CIS football|Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] for the [[Vanier Cup]], and senior leagues such as the [[Alberta Football League]] have grown in popularity in recent years. Great achievements in Canadian football are enshrined in the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]].

Other organizations across Canada perform senior league Canadian football during the summer.

==History==<!-- This section is linked from [[Canadian Football League]] -->
The first documented football match was a practice game played on November 9, 1861, at [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]], [[University of Toronto]] (approximately {{convert|400|yd|disp=or}} west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was Sir William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.<ref name=1860s>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |work= Official Site of the Canadian Football League|title= Timeline 1860s |publisher=Canadian Football League |accessdate=13 July 2010 }}</ref>  A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The first written account of a game played was on October 15, 1862, on the Montreal Cricket Grounds. It was between the First Battalion [[Grenadier Guards]] and the Second Battalion [[Scots Fusilier Guards]] resulting in a win by the Grenadier Guards 3 goals, 2 rouges to nothing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 1864, at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on [[rugby football]].<ref name= 1860s/> The game gradually gained a following, with the Hamilton Football Club formed on November 3, 1869, (the oldest football club in Canada). Montreal formed a team April 8, 1872, Toronto was formed on October 4, 1873, and the Ottawa FBC on September 20, 1876.

This rugby-football soon became popular at Montreal's [[McGill University]]. McGill challenged [[Harvard University]] to a game, in 1874  using a hybrid game of English rugby devised by the University of McGill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1870|title=History - CFL.ca - Official Site of the Canadian Football League|work=CFL.ca|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football |title=gridiron football (sport)|work = Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=13 July 2010 }}</ref>

The first attempt to establish a proper governing body and adopted the current set of Rugby rules was the Foot Ball Association of Canada, organized on March 24, 1873 followed by the Canadian Rugby Football Union (CRFU) founded June 12, 1880,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1880|title=History - CFL.ca - Official Site of the Canadian Football League|work=CFL.ca|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref> which included teams from Ontario and Quebec. Later both the Ontario and Quebec Rugby Football Union (ORFU and QRFU) were formed (January 1883), and then the Interprovincial (1907) and Western Interprovincial Football Union (1936) (IRFU and WIFU).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/91923/Canadian-Football-League-CFL#ref283286|title=Canadian Football League (CFL)|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref> The CRFU reorganized into an umbrella organization forming the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1890|title=History - CFL.ca - Official Site of the Canadian Football League|work=CFL.ca|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref> The original forerunners to the current Canadian Football League, was established in 1956 when the IRFU and WIFU formed an umbrella organization, The Canadian Football Council (CFC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1950|title=History - CFL.ca - Official Site of the Canadian Football League|work=CFL.ca|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref> And then in 1958 the CFC left The CRFU to become The CFL.

The [[Burnside rules]] closely resembling American Football that were incorporated in 1903 by The ORFU, was an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. The Burnside Rules had teams reduced to 12 men per side, introduced the Snap-Back system, required the offensive team to gain 10 yards on three downs, eliminated the Throw-In from the sidelines, allowed only six men on the line, stated that all goals by kicking were to be worth two points and the opposition was to line up 10 yards from the defenders on all kicks. The rules were an attempt to standardize the rules throughout the country. The CIRFU, QRFU and CRU refused to adopt the new rules at first.<ref name="cfl.ca">{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1900|title=History - CFL.ca - Official Site of the Canadian Football League|work=CFL.ca|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref> [[Forward pass]]es were not allowed in the Canadian game until 1929, and touchdowns, which had been five points, were increased to six points in 1956, in both cases several decades after the Americans had adopted the same changes. The primary differences between the Canadian and American games stem from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side did not (originally, both sides had three downs, goal posts on the goal lines and unlimited forward motion, but the American side modified these rules and the Canadians did not). The Canadian field width was one rule that was ''not'' based on American rules, as the Canadian game played in wider fields and stadiums that were not as narrow as the American stadiums.

The [[Grey Cup]] was established in 1909 after being donated by [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey]], The Governor General of Canada as the championship of teams under the CRU for the Rugby Football Championship of Canada.<ref name="cfl.ca"/> Initially an amateur competition, it eventually became dominated by professional teams in the 1940s and early 1950s. The [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]], the last amateur organization to compete for the trophy, withdrew from competition in 1954. The move ushered in the modern era of Canadian professional football.

Canadian football has mostly been confined to Canada, with the United States being the only other country to have hosted a high-level Canadian football game. The CFL's controversial "[[Canadian Football League in the United States|South Division]]" as it would come to be officially known attempted to put CFL teams in the United States playing under Canadian rules between 1992 and 1995. The move was aborted after three years; the [[Baltimore Stallions]] were the most successful of the numerous Americans teams to play in the CFL, winning the [[83rd Grey Cup]]. Continuing financial losses, a lack of proper Canadian football venues, a pervasive belief that the American teams were simply pawns to provide the struggling Canadian teams with expansion fee revenue, and the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|return of the NFL to Baltimore]] prompted the end of Canadian football on the American side of the border.

In 2013, Newfoundland and Labrador became the last province to establish football at the minor league level with teams playing on the Avalon Peninsula and in Labrador City.{{cn|date=July 2015}} The province however has yet to host a college or CFL game. [[Prince Edward Island]], the smallest of the provinces, has also never hosted a CFL game.

==League play==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Canadian football is played at several levels in Canada; the top league is the professional nine-team [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). The CFL regular season begins in June, and playoffs for the [[Grey Cup]] are completed by mid-November. In cities with outdoor stadiums such as [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Winnipeg]], and [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], low temperatures and icy field conditions can seriously affect the outcome of a game.

Amateur football is governed by [[Football Canada]]. At the university level, 26 teams play in four conferences under the auspices of [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]]; the CIS champion is awarded the [[Vanier Cup]]. Junior football is played by many after high school before joining the university ranks. There are 20 junior teams in three divisions in the [[Canadian Junior Football League]] competing for the [[Canadian Bowl]]. The [[Quebec Junior Football League]] includes teams from Ontario and Quebec who battle for the Manson Cup.

[[Semi-professional]] leagues have grown in popularity in recent years, with the [[Alberta Football League]] becoming especially popular. The [[Northern Football Conference]] formed in Ontario in 1954 has also surged in popularity for former college players who do not continue to professional football. The Ontario champion plays against the Alberta champion for the "National Championship". The [[Canadian Major Football League]] is the governing body for the semi-professional game.

Women's football is starting to gain attention in Canada. The first Canadian women's league to begin operations was the [[Maritime Women's Football League]] in 2004. The largest women's league is the [[Western Women's Canadian Football League]].

==The field==
[[File:Commonwealth Stadium, Edmonton, August 2005.jpg|thumb|Edmonton's [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]]: the largest venue in the [[Canadian Football League]]]]
The Canadian football field is {{convert|150|yd|m|0}} long and {{convert|65|yd|m|0}} wide with [[end zone]]s {{convert|20|yd|m|0}} deep, and goal lines {{convert|110|yd|m|0}} apart. At each goal line is a set of {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|0}} [[goalposts]], which consist of two ''uprights'' joined by an {{convert|18+1/2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} crossbar which is {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} above the ground) is preferred. The sides of the field are marked by white sidelines, the goal line is marked in white, and white lines are drawn laterally across the field every {{convert|5|yd|m|1}} from the goal line.<ref name=conversions/> These lateral lines are called "yard lines" and often marked with the distance in yards from and an arrow pointed toward the nearest goal line. In previous decades, arrows were not used and every yard line was usually marked with the distance to the goal line, including the goal line itself which was marked with a "0"â€”in most stadiums today, only every second yard line from the nearest goal (i.e. those with distances divisible by 10) are marked with numbers, with the goal line sometimes being marked with a "G" for goal line and the centre line usually being marked with a "C" for "Centre line". "Hash marks" are painted in white, parallel to the yardage lines, at {{convert|1|yd|m|1}} intervals, {{convert|24|yd|m|1}} from the sidelines. On fields that have a surrounding [[running track]], such as [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]], [[Percival Molson Memorial Stadium|Molson Stadium]], and many [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|universities]], the end zones are often cut off in the corners to accommodate the track. In 2014, Edmonton placed turf over the track to create full end zones.[http://www.edmontonsun.com/2014/06/02/eskimos-receivers-fred-stamps-adarius-bouwman-like-the-newly-squared-off-corners] This was particularly common among U.S.-based teams during the CFL's American expansion, where few American stadiums were able to accommodate the much longer CFL field.

Until 1986,<ref>{{cite web

|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Game Rules and Regulations
|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref> the end zones were {{convert|25|yd|m}} deep, giving the field an overall length of {{convert|160|yd|m}}, and a correspondingly larger cutoff could be required at the corners.

==Play of the game==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}
Teams advance across the field through the execution of quick, distinct plays, which involve the possession of a brown, [[prolate spheroid]] ball with ends tapered to a point. The ball has two one-inch-wide white stripes.

===Start of play===
Play begins at the start of each half with one team place-kicking the ball from its own 35-yard line. Both teams then attempt to catch the ball. The player who recovers the ball may run while holding the ball, or lateral throw the ball to a teammate.

===Stoppage of play===
Play stops when the ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a ''tackle''); when a forward pass is not caught on the fly (during a scrimmage); when a touchdown (see below) or a field goal is scored; when the ball leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move forwards (called forward progress). If no score has been made, the next play starts from ''scrimmage''.

===Scrimmage===
Before scrimmage, an official places the ball at the spot it was at the stop of clock, but no nearer than 24 yards from the sideline or 1 yard from the goal line. The line parallel to the goal line passing through the ball (line from sideline to sideline for the length of the ball) is referred to as the line of scrimmage. This line is similar to "[[no-man's land]]"; players must stay on their respective sides of this line until the play has begun again. For a scrimmage to be valid the team in possession of the football must have seven players, excluding the quarterback, within one yard of the line of scrimmage. The defending team must stay a yard or more back from the line of scrimmage.

[[File:Anthony Calvillo game action, 93rd Grey Cup.jpg|thumb|right|[[Montreal Alouettes]] quarterback [[Anthony Calvillo]] looks down field with the ball during the [[93rd Grey Cup]] game at [[BC Place]].]]
On the field at the beginning of a play are two teams of 12 (unlike 11 in American football). The team in possession of the ball is the offence and the team defending is referred to as the defence.<!-- Canadian spelling uses the "c" --> Play begins with a backwards pass through the legs (the snap) by a member of the offensive team, to another member of the offensive team. This is usually the quarterback or punter, but a "direct snap" to a running back is also not uncommon. If the quarterback or punter receives the ball, he may then do any of the following:

* run with the ball, attempting to run farther down field (gaining yardage). The ball-carrier may run in any direction he sees fit (including backwards).
* ''drop-kick'' the ball, dropping it onto the ground and kicking it on the bounce. (This play is exceedingly rare in both Canadian and American football.)
* pass the ball laterally or backwards to a teammate. This play is known as a ''lateral'', and may come at any time on the play. A pass which has any amount of forward momentum is a ''forward pass'' (see below); forward passes are subject to many restrictions which do not apply to laterals.
* ''hand-off''â€”hand the ball off to a teammate, typically a halfback or the fullback.
* ''punt'' the ball; dropping it in the air and kicking it ''before'' it touches the ground. When the ball is punted, only opposing players (the receiving team), the kicker, and anyone behind the kicker when he punted the ball are able to touch the ball, or even go within five yards of the ball until it is touched by an eligible player (the no-yards rule, which is applied to all kicking plays).
* place the ball on the ground for a ''place kick''
* throw a ''[[forward pass]]'', where the ball is thrown to a receiver located farther down field (closer to the opponent's goal) than the thrower is. Forward passes are subject to the following restrictions:
** They must be made from ''behind'' the line of scrimmage
** Only one forward pass may be made on a play
** The pass must be made in the direction of an eligible receiver or pass 10 yards after the line of scrimmage

Each play constitutes a ''down''. The offence<!-- Canadian spelling uses the "c" --> must advance the ball at least ten yards towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains a new set of three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes 10 yards on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] (see below), depending on their position on the field. The team may, however use its third down in an attempt to advance the ball and gain a cumulative 10 yards.

===Change in possession===
The ball changes possession in the following instances:

* If the offence scores a field goal, the scored-against team can either scrimmage from its 35-yard line or have the scoring team kickoff from its 35-yard line.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/story/2009/05/11/sp-cfl-ruleschanges.html |title=CFL introduces 4 rule changes for 2009 season |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Company |accessdate=13 July 2010 | date=2009-05-11}}</ref>
* If a team scores a touchdown, the scoring team must kickoff from their own 35-yard line.
* If the defence scores on a safety (bringing the ball down in the offence's own end zone), they have the right to claim possession.
* If one team kicks the ball; the other team has the right to recover the ball and attempt a return. If a kicked ball goes out of bounds, or the kicking team scores a single or field goal as a result of the kick, the other team likewise gets possession.
* If the offence fails to make ten yards in three plays, the defence ''takes over on downs''.
* If the offence attempts a forward pass and it is ''intercepted'' by the defence; the defence takes possession immediately (and may try to advance the ball on the play). Note that incomplete forward passes (those which go out of bounds, or which touch the ground without being first cleanly caught by a player) result in the end of the play, and are not returnable by either team.
* If the offence ''fumbles'' (a ball carrier drops the football, or has it dislodged by an opponent, or if the intended player fails to catch a lateral pass or a snap from centre, or a kick attempt is blocked by an opponent), the ball may be recovered (and advanced) by either team. If a fumbled ball goes out of bounds, the team whose player last touched it is awarded possession at the spot where it went out of bounds. A fumble by the offence in their own end zone, which goes out of bounds, results in a safety.
* When the first half ends, the team which kicked to start the first half will receive a kickoff to start the second half.

===Rules of contact===
There are many rules to contact in this type of football. First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). Second, a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within one yard of the line of scrimmage (instead of {{convert|5|yd|m|1}} in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the quarterback, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled.

===Infractions and penalties===
Infractions of the rules are punished with ''penalties'', typically a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or 15 yards against the penalized team. Minor violations such as ''offside'' (a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized 10 yards, and severe violations of the rules (such as face-masking) are typically penalized 15 yards. Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from the original line of scrimmage, from where the violation occurred (for example, for a pass interference infraction), or from where the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result in a loss of down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect the yard line which the offence must reach to gain a first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down.

Penalties may occur before a play starts (such as offside), during the play (such as holding), or in a dead-ball situation (such as [[unsportsmanlike conduct]]).

Penalties never result in a score for the offence. For example, a point-of-foul infraction committed by the defence in their end zone is not ruled a touchdown, but instead advances the ball to the one-yard line with an automatic first down. For a distance penalty, if the yardage is greater than half the distance to the goal line, then the ball is advanced half the distance to the goal line, though only up to the one-yard line (unlike American football, in Canadian football no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line). If the original penalty yardage would have resulted in a first down or moving the ball past the goal line, a first down is awarded.

In most cases, the non-penalized team will have the option of ''declining'' the penalty; in which case the results of the previous play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule is if the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs: the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback.

===Kicking===
Canadian football distinguishes four ways of kicking the ball:

; [[Place kick]]: Kicking a ball held on the ground by a teammate, or, on a kickoff (resuming play following a score), optionally placed on a [[Tee#Kicking tee|tee]].
; [[Drop kick]]: Kicking a ball after bouncing it on the ground. Although rarely used today, it has the same status in scoring as a place kick. This play is part of the game's [[Rugby football|rugby]] heritage, and was largely made obsolete when the ball with pointed ends was adopted. Unlike the American game, Canadian rules allow a drop kick to be attempted at any time by any player, but the move is very rare.
; [[Punt (gridiron football)|Punt]]: Kicking the ball after it has been released from the kicker's hand and before it hits the ground. Punts may not score a field goal, even if one should travel through the uprights. As with drop kicks, players may punt at any time.
; Dribbled ball: A dribbled ball is one that has been kicked while not in possession of a player, for example, a loose ball following a fumble, a blocked kick, a kickoff, or a kick from scrimmage. The kicker of the dribbled ball and any player onside when the ball was kicked may legally recover the ball.

On any kicking play, all onside players (the kicker, and teammates behind the kicker at the time of the kick) may recover and advance the ball. Players on the kicking team who are not onside may not approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by the receiving team, or by an onside teammate.

===Scoring===
The methods of scoring are:

; Touchdown : Achieved when the ball is in possession of a player in the opponent's end zone, or when the ball in the possession of a player crosses or touches the plane of the opponent's goal-line, worth 6 points (5 points until 1956). A touchdown in Canadian football is often referred to as a "major score" or simply a "major."
; Conversion (or convert) : After a touchdown, the team that scored gets one scrimmage play to attempt to add one or two more points. If they make what would normally be a field goal, they score one point (a "point-after"); what would normally be a touchdown scores two points (a "two-point conversion"). In amateur games, this scrimmage is taken at the opponents' 5-yard line. The CFL formerly ran all conversion attempts from the 5-yard line as well, but starting in 2015 one-point kick attempts are taken from the 32-yard line, and two-point attempts are scrimmaged at the 3-yard line.<ref>[http://www.cfl.ca/article/major-rule-changes-approved-by-cfl-governors Major rule changes approved by CFL Governors, April 8th, 2015]</ref> No matter what happens on the convert attempt, play then continues with a kickoff (see below).
; Field goal : Scored by a drop kick or place kick (except on a kickoff) when the ball, after being kicked and without again touching the ground, goes over the cross bar and between the goal posts (or between lines extended from the top of the goal posts) of the opponent's goal, worth three points. If the ball hits the upright above the cross-bar before going through, it is '''not''' considered a dead ball, and the points are scored. (Rule 5, Sect 4, Art 4(d)) If the field goal is missed, but the ball is not returnable after crossing the dead-ball-line, then it constitutes a '''rouge''' (see below).
; Safety : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the team scored against making a play. It is worth two points. This is different from a ''single'' (see below) in that the team scored against begins with possession of the ball. The most common safety is on a third down punt from the end zone, in which the kicker decides not to punt and keeps the ball in his team's own goal area. The ball is then turned over to the receiving team (who gained the two points), by way of a kickoff from the 25 yard line or scrimmaging from the {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line on their side of the field.
; [[Single (football)|Single (rouge)]] : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal, and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the ball having been kicked from the field of play into the goal area by the scoring team. It is worth one point. This is different from a Safety (see above) in that team scored against receives possession of the ball after the score.
:Officially, the single is called a ''rouge'' ([[French language|French]] for "red") but is often referred to as a single. The exact derivation of the term is unknown, but it has been thought that in early Canadian football, the scoring of a single was signalled with a red flag. A ''rouge'' is also a method of scoring in the [[Eton field game]], which dates from at least 1815.

====Resumption of play====
Resumption of play following a score is conducted under procedures which vary with the type of score.

* Following a touchdown and convert attempt (successful or not), play resumes with the scoring team kicking off from its own 35-yard line (45-yard line in amateur leagues).
* Following a field goal, the non-scoring team may choose for play to resume either with a kickoff as above, or by scrimmaging the ball from its own 35-yard line.
* Following a safety, the scoring team may choose for play to resume in either of the above ways, or it may choose to kick off from its own 35-yard line.
* Following a single or [[rouge (football)|rouge]], play resumes with the non-scoring team scrimmaging from its own 35-yard line, unless the single is awarded on a missed field goal, in which case the non-scoring team scrimmages from either the 35-yard line or the yard line from which the field goal was attempted, whichever is greater.

===Game timing===
The game consists of two 30-minute halves, each of which is divided into two 15-minute quarters. The clock counts down from 15:00 in each quarter. Timing rules change when there are three minutes remaining in a half.
A short break interval of 2 minutes occurs after the end of each quarter (a longer break of 15 minutes at halftime), and the two teams then change goals.

In the first 27 minutes of a half, the clock stops when:
* points are scored,
* the ball goes out of bounds,
* a forward pass is incomplete,
* the ball is dead and a penalty flag has been thrown,
* the ball is dead and teams are making substitutions (e.g., possession has changed, punting situation, short yardage situation),
* the ball is dead and a player is injured, or
* the ball is dead and a captain or a coach calls a [[sport time-out|time-out]].

The clock starts again when the referee determines the ball is ready for scrimmage, except for team time-outs (where the clock starts at the snap), after a time count foul (at the snap) and kickoffs (where the clock starts not at the kick but when the ball is first touched after the kick).

In the last three minutes of a half, the clock stops whenever the ball becomes dead. On kickoffs, the clock starts when the ball is first touched after the kick. On scrimmages, when it starts depends on what ended the previous play. The clock starts when the ball is ready for scrimmage except that it starts on the snap when on the previous play
* the ball was kicked off,
* the ball was punted,
* the ball changed possession,
* the ball went out of bounds,
* there were points scored,
* there was an incomplete forward pass,
* there was a penalty applied (not declined), or
* there was a team time-out.

During the last three minutes of a half, the penalty for failure to place the ball in play within the 20-second play clock, known as "time count" (this foul is known as "delay of game" in American football), is dramatically different from during the first 27 minutes. Instead of the penalty being 5 yards with the down repeated, the base penalty (except during convert attempts) becomes loss of down on first or second down, and 10 yards on third down with the down repeated. In addition, if the referee deems repeated time count violations on third down to be deliberate, he has the right to give possession to the defensive team.

The clock does not run during convert attempts in the last three minutes of a half. If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter is extended until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter's time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter is extended one scrimmage. Note that the non-penalized team has the option to ''decline'' any penalty it considers disadvantageous, so a losing team cannot indefinitely prolong a game by repeatedly committing infractions.

===Overtime===
In the CFL, if the game is tied at the end of regulation play, then each team is given an equal number of chances to break the tie. A coin toss is held to determine which team will take possession first; the first team scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and advances through a series of downs until it scores or loses possession. If the team scores a touchdown, starting with the 2010 season, it is required to attempt a 2-point conversion.<ref name="TSN-Rules2010">{{cite web

The other team then scrimmages the ball at the same 35-yard line and has the same opportunity to score. After the teams have completed their possessions, if one team is ahead, then it is declared the winner; otherwise, the two teams each get another chance to score, scrimmaging from the other 35-yard line. After this second round, if there is still no winner, during the regular season the game ends as a tie. In a playoff or championship game, the teams continue to attempt to score from alternating 35-yard lines, until one team is leading after both have had an equal number of possessions.

In [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] football, for the [[Uteck Bowl]], [[Mitchell Bowl]], and [[Vanier Cup]], the same overtime procedure is followed until there is a winner.

===Offence===
The offensive positions found in Canadian football have, for the most part, evolved throughout the years, and are not officially defined in the rules. However, among offensive players, the rules recognize three different types of players:

; Down linemen: Down linemen are players who, at the start of every play, line up at the line of scrimmage; once in their stance they may not move until the play begins. The offence must have at least seven players lined up at the line of scrimmage on every play. The exception to this rule is the player (typically the ''centre'') who snaps the ball to the quarterback. Linemen generally do not run with the ball (unless they recover it on a fumble) or receive a hand-off or lateral pass, but there is no rule against it. Interior linemen (that is, excluding the two players at either end of the scrimmage line) are '''ineligible receivers'''; they may not receive a forward pass either. (The two [[offensive end]]s on the line of scrimmage may receive forward passes.)
; Backs: Backs line up behind the linemen; they may run with the ball, receive handoffs, laterals, and forward passes. They may also be in motion before the play starts.

Specific offensive positions include:

;Backs/Receivers:
; Quarterback: Generally the leader of the offence. Calls all plays to teammates, receives the ball off of snap, and initiates the action usually by running the ball himself, passing the ball to a receiver, or handing the ball off to another back.
; Fullback: Multiple roles including pass protection, receiving, and blocking for the running back. On short yardage situations may also carry the ball.
; Running back/Tailback: As the name implies, the main runner on the team. Also an eligible receiver and blocker on pass plays.
; Wide receiver: Lines up on the line of scrimmage, usually at a distance from the centre. Runs down the field in order to catch a forward pass from the quarterback.
; [[Slotback]]: Similar to the wide receiver, but lines up closer to the offensive line.
; Down linemen:
; Centre: Snaps the ball to the quarterback. Most important pass blocker on pass plays. Calls offensive-line plays.
; Left/right guard: Stands to the left and right of the centre helps protect the quarterback, Usually very good run blockers to open holes up the middle for runners.
; Left/right tackle: Stands on the ends of the offensive line, The biggest men on the line, usually well over {{convert|300|lb}}. Usually very good pass blockers.
; Offensive lineman: Collective name for centre, guards and tackles.

===Defence===
The rules do not constrain how the defence may arrange itself (other than the requirement that they must remain one yard behind the line of scrimmage until the play starts).

; Cornerback: Covers the wide receivers on most plays.
; Safety: Covers deep. Last line of defence, can offer run support or blitz.
; Defensive halfback: Covers the slotback and helps contain the run from going to the outside.
; Defensive back: Collective term for cornerback, safety and defensive halfback.
; Nose tackle: Lineman across from centre, tries to get past the offensive-line or take double team and open holes for blitzes.
; Defensive tackle: Inside defensive linemen try to break through the offensive line and open holes for linebackers.
; Defensive end: Main rushing lineman. Rushes the quarterback and tries to contain rushers behind the line of scrimmage.
; Defensive lineman: Collective term for defensive tackle (or nose tackle) and defensive end.
; Middle linebacker: Lines up across from the centre 3 to 4 yds/m back. Quarterback of the defence. Calls plays for lineman and linebackers.
; Weak-side linebacker: Lines up on the short side of field, and can drop into pass coverage or contain.
; Strong-side linebacker: Lines up on the opposite side and usually rushes.

===Special teams===
''Special teams'' generally refers to kicking plays, which typically involve a change in possession.

; Holder: Receives the snap on field goal tries and converts; places the ball in position and holds it to be kicked by the kicker. This position is generally filled by a reserve quarterback; occasionally the starting quarterback or punter will fill in as holder.
; Kicker: Kicks field goals, converts, kick-offs
; Punter: Punts ball, usually on third downs
; Returners: Fast, agile runners who specialize in fielding punts, field goals and kickoffs, attempting to advance them for better field position or a score.
