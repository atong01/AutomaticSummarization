For a scrimmage to be valid the team in possession of the football must have seven players, excluding the quarterback, within one yard of the line of scrimmage. The defending team must stay a yard or more back from the line of scrimmage.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Anthony Calvillo game action, 93rd Grey Cup.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part><link><target>Montreal Alouettes</target></link><space/>quarterback<space/><link><target>Anthony Calvillo</target></link><space/>looks down field with the ball during the<space/><link><target>93rd Grey Cup</target></link><space/>game at<space/><link><target>BC Place</target></link>.</part></link>On the field at the beginning of a play are two teams of 12 (unlike 11 in American football). The team in possession of the ball is the offence and the team defending is referred to as the defence. Play begins with a backwards pass through the legs (the snap) by a member of the offensive team, to another member of the offensive team. This is usually the quarterback or punter, but a &quot;direct snap&quot; to a running back is also not uncommon. If the quarterback or punter receives the ball, he may then do any of the following:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>run with the ball, attempting to run farther down field (gaining yardage).

The offence must advance the ball at least ten yards towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains a new set of three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes 10 yards on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a<space/><link><target>Field goal (football)</target><part>field goal</part></link><space/>(see below), depending on their position on the field. The team may, however use its third down in an attempt to advance the ball and gain a cumulative 10 yards.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Change in possession</heading><paragraph>The ball changes possession in the following instances:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>If the offence scores a field goal, the scored-against team can either scrimmage from its 35-yard line or have the scoring team kickoff from its 35-yard line.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="url">http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/story/2009/05/11/sp-cfl-ruleschanges.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">CFL introduces 4 rule changes for 2009 season<space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Canadian Broadcasting Company<space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">13 July 2010<space/></arg><arg name="date">2009-05-11</arg></template></extension></listitem><listitem>If a team scores a touchdown, the scoring team must kickoff from their own 35-yard line.</listitem><listitem>If the defence scores on a safety (bringing the ball down in the offence's own end zone), they have the right to claim possession.</listitem><listitem>If one team kicks the ball; the other team has the right to recover the ball and attempt a return.

If a fumbled ball goes out of bounds, the team whose player last touched it is awarded possession at the spot where it went out of bounds. A fumble by the offence in their own end zone, which goes out of bounds, results in a safety.</listitem><listitem>When the first half ends, the team which kicked to start the first half will receive a kickoff to start the second half.</listitem></list><heading level='3'>Rules of contact</heading><paragraph>There are many rules to contact in this type of football. First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). Second, a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within one yard of the line of scrimmage (instead of<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>5</arg><arg>yd</arg><arg>m</arg><arg>1</arg></template><space/>in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the quarterback, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Infractions and penalties</heading><paragraph>Infractions of the rules are punished with<space/><italics>penalties</italics>, typically a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or 15 yards against the penalized team. Minor violations such as<space/><italics>offside</italics><space/>(a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized 10 yards, and severe violations of the rules (such as face-masking) are typically penalized 15 yards. Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from the original line of scrimmage, from where the violation occurred (for example, for a pass interference infraction), or from where the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result in a loss of down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect the yard line which the offence must reach to gain a first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down.</paragraph><paragraph>Penalties may occur before a play starts (such as offside), during the play (such as holding), or in a dead-ball situation (such as<space/><link><target>unsportsmanlike conduct</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>Penalties never result in a score for the offence. For example, a point-of-foul infraction committed by the defence in their end zone is not ruled a touchdown, but instead advances the ball to the one-yard line with an automatic first down. For a distance penalty, if the yardage is greater than half the distance to the goal line, then the ball is advanced half the distance to the goal line, though only up to the one-yard line (unlike American football, in Canadian football no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line). If the original penalty yardage would have resulted in a first down or moving the ball past the goal line, a first down is awarded.</paragraph><paragraph>In most cases, the non-penalized team will have the option of<space/><italics>declining</italics><space/>the penalty; in which case the results of the previous play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule is if the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs: the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Kicking</heading><paragraph>Canadian football distinguishes four ways of kicking the ball:</paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey><link><target>Place kick</target></link></defkey><defval><space/>Kicking a ball held on the ground by a teammate, or, on a kickoff (resuming play following a score), optionally placed on a<space/><link><target>Tee#Kicking tee</target><part>tee</part></link>.</defval></listitem><listitem><defkey><link><target>Drop kick</target></link></defkey><defval><space/>Kicking a ball after bouncing it on the ground.

If they make what would normally be a field goal, they score one point (a &quot;point-after&quot;); what would normally be a touchdown scores two points (a &quot;two-point conversion&quot;). In amateur games, this scrimmage is taken at the opponents' 5-yard line. The CFL formerly ran all conversion attempts from the 5-yard line as well, but starting in 2015 one-point kick attempts are taken from the 32-yard line, and two-point attempts are scrimmaged at the 3-yard line.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.cfl.ca/article/major-rule-changes-approved-by-cfl-governors'>Major rule changes approved by CFL Governors, April 8th, 2015</link></extension><space/>No matter what happens on the convert attempt, play then continues with a kickoff (see below).</defval></listitem><listitem><defkey>Field goal<space/></defkey><defval><space/>Scored by a drop kick or place kick (except on a kickoff) when the ball, after being kicked and without again touching the ground, goes over the cross bar and between the goal posts (or between lines extended from the top of the goal posts) of the opponent's goal, worth three points.

Instead of the penalty being 5 yards with the down repeated, the base penalty (except during convert attempts) becomes loss of down on first or second down, and 10 yards on third down with the down repeated. In addition, if the referee deems repeated time count violations on third down to be deliberate, he has the right to give possession to the defensive team.</paragraph><paragraph>The clock does not run during convert attempts in the last three minutes of a half. If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter is extended until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter's time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter is extended one scrimmage.
