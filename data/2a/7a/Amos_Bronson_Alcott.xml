As an educator, Alcott pioneered new ways of interacting with young students, focusing on a conversational style, and avoided traditional punishment. He hoped to perfect the human spirit and, to that end, advocated a<space/><link><target>veganism</target><part>vegan</part></link><space/>diet before the term was coined. He was also an<space/><link><target>Abolitionism in the United States</target><part>abolitionist</part></link><space/>and an advocate for<space/><link><target>women's rights</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Born in<space/><link><target>Connecticut</target></link><space/>in 1799, Alcott had only minimal formal schooling before attempting a career as a traveling salesman. Worried about how the itinerant life might negatively impact his soul, he turned to teaching. His innovative methods, however, were controversial, and he rarely stayed in one place very long. His most well-known teaching position was at the<space/><link><target>Temple School, Boston (1830s)</target><part>Temple School</part></link><space/>in Boston. His experience there was turned into two books:<space/><italics>Records of a School</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Conversations with Children on the Gospels</italics>. Alcott became friends with<space/><link><target>Ralph Waldo Emerson</target></link><space/>and became a major figure in<space/><link><target>transcendentalism</target></link>. His writings on behalf of that movement, however, are heavily criticized for being incoherent. Based on his ideas for human perfection, Alcott founded<space/><link><target>Fruitlands (transcendental center)</target><part>Fruitlands</part></link>, a transcendentalist experiment in community living. The project was short-lived and failed after seven months. Alcott continued to struggle financially for most of his life. Nevertheless, he continued focusing on educational projects and opened a new school at the end of his life in 1879. He died in 1888.</paragraph><paragraph>Alcott married<space/><link><target>Abby May</target></link><space/>in 1830 and they eventually had four surviving children, all daughters.

Before 1830, writing (except in higher education) equated to rote drills in the rules of grammar, spelling, vocabulary, penmanship and transcription of adult texts. However, in that decade, progressive reformers such as Alcott, influenced by Pestalozzi as well as<space/><link><target>Friedrich Frbel</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Johann Friedrich Herbart</target></link>, began to advocate writing about subjects from students' personal experiences. Reformers debated against beginning instruction with rules and were in favor of helping students learn to write by expressing the personal meaning of events within their own lives. Alcott's plan was to develop self-instruction on the basis of self-analysis, with an emphasis on conversation and questioning rather than lecturing and drill, which were prevalent in the U.S. classrooms of the time. Alongside writing and reading, he gave lessons in &quot;spiritual culture&quot;, which included interpretation of the<space/><link><target>Gospel</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and advocated<space/><italics>object teaching</italics><space/>in writing instruction.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">November 2010</arg></template><space/>He even went so far as to decorate his schoolroom with visual elements he thought would inspire learning: paintings, books, comfortable furniture, and busts or portraits of<space/><link><target>Plato</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Socrates</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Jesus</target></link>, and William Ellery Channing.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Dahlstrand110"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>During this time, the Alcotts had another child.

In 1880 the school moved to the Hillside Chapel, a building next to the house, where he held conversations and, over the course of successive summers, as he entered his eighties, invited others to give lectures on themes in philosophy, religion and letters. The school, considered one of the first formal adult education centers in America, was also attended by foreign scholars. It continued for nine years.</paragraph><paragraph>In April 1882, Alcott's friend and benefactor Ralph Waldo Emerson was sick and bedridden.

Instead, beginning at the Temple School, he would appoint a daily student superintendent. When that student observed an infraction, he or she reported it to the rest of the class and, as a whole, they deliberated on punishment.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Gura</arg><arg>2007</arg><arg name="p">87</arg></template></extension><space/>At times, Alcott offered his own hand for an offending student to strike, saying that any failing was the teacher's responsibility. The shame and guilt this method induced, he believed, was far superior to the fear instilled by corporal punishment; when he used physical &quot;correction&quot; he required that the students be unanimously in support of its application, even including the student to be punished.</paragraph><paragraph>The most detailed discussion of his theories on education is in an essay, &quot;Observations on the Principles and Methods of Infant Instruction&quot;. Alcott believed that early education must draw out &quot;unpremeditated thoughts and feelings of the child&quot; and emphasized that infancy should primarily focus on enjoyment.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Bedell</arg><arg>1980</arg><arg name="p">53</arg></template></extension><space/>He noted that learning was not about the acquisition of facts but the development of a reflective state of mind.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Matteson</arg><arg>2007</arg><arg name="p">58</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Alcott's ideas as an educator were controversial.

Many of Alcott's educational principles are still used in classrooms today, including &quot;teach by encouragement&quot;, art education, music education, acting exercises, learning through experience, risk-taking in the classroom, tolerance in schools, physical education/recess, and early childhood education. The teachings of William Ellery Channing a few years earlier had also laid the groundwork for the work of most of the Concord Transcendentalists.</paragraph><paragraph>The Concord School of Philosophy, which closed following Alcott's death in 1888, was reopened almost 90 years later in the 1970s. It has continued functioning with a Summer Conversational Series in its original building at Orchard House, now run by the Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association.</paragraph><paragraph>While many of Alcott's ideas continue to be perceived as being on the liberal/radical edge, they are still common themes in society, including vegetarian/<link><target>veganism</target></link>, sustainable living, and temperance/self-control. Alcott described his sustenance as a &quot;Pythagorean diet&quot;: meat, eggs, butter, cheese, and milk were excluded and drinking was confined to well water.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Harvnb</target><arg>Baker</arg><arg>1996</arg><arg name="p">217</arg></template></extension><space/>Alcott believed that diet held the key to human perfection and connected physical well-being to mental improvement.
