These costume wearers often interact to create a subculture centered on role play, so they can be seen most often in play groups, or at a gathering or convention. A significant number of these costumes are homemade and unique, and depend on the character, idea, or object the costume wearer is attempting to imitate or represent.

Costume may refer to the style of dress particular to a nation, a class, or a period.

The most basic designs are produced to denote status, provide protection or modesty, or provide visual interest to a character. Costumes may be for, but not limited to, theater, cinema, or musical performances. Costume design should not be confused with costume coordination, which merely involves altering existing clothing, although both processes are used to create stage clothes.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Organizations</heading><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Costume Designers Guild</target></link>'s international membership includes motion picture, television, and commercial<space/><link><target>costume designer</target><trail>s</trail></link>, assistant costume designers and costume illustrators, and totals over 750 members.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Publications</heading><paragraph><italics>The Costume Designer</italics><space/>is a quarterly magazine devoted to the costume design industry.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="url">http://costumedesignersguild.com/magazine/<space/></arg><arg name="title">Current Issue<space/></arg><arg name="journal">The Costume Designer<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">[[Costume Designers Guild]]</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Notable designers and awards</heading><paragraph><link><target>List of costume designers</target><part>Notable costume designers</part></link><space/>include recipients of the<space/><link><target>Academy Award for Best Costume Design</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Tony Award for Best Costume Design</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design</target></link>.<space/><link><target>Edith Head</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Orry-Kelly</target></link>, both of whom were born late in 1897, were two of Hollywood's most notable costume designers.</paragraph><heading level='3'>DIY and homemade costumes</heading><paragraph>In the 20th century, contemporary fabric stores offered commercial patterns that could be bought and used to make a costume from raw materials.
