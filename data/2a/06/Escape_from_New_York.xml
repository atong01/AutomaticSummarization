However, Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, the top crime boss in the prison, presents them with the President's cut-off finger (still bearing a signet ring) and warns them that the Duke has taken the President hostage and that they have 24 hours to meet their sole demand: to allow all the Manhattan inmates access to the mainland.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="reason">this is NOT what happens in the film with Romero's scene!</arg><arg name="date">July 2015</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>New York Police Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to &quot;Snake&quot; Plissken, a former<space/><link><target>United States Special Operations Forces</target><part>U.S Special Forces</part></link><space/>soldier convicted of attempting to rob the<space/><link><target>Federal Reserve</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Denver, Colorado</target></link>.

He locates the wreckage of Air Force One and escape pod and tracks the President's life-monitor bracelet signal to a<space/><link><target>vaudeville</target></link><space/>theatre, only to find it on the wrist of an old man sleeping there. He meets &quot;Cabbie,&quot; who takes Snake in his armored taxi cab to Harold &quot;Brain&quot; Hellman, an advisor to the Duke who has made the<space/><link><target>New York Public Library</target></link><space/>his personal fortress.</paragraph><paragraph>Brain tells Snake that the Duke plans to unify the gangs in a mass exodus across the heavily guarded 59th Street/Queensboro Bridge, using the President as a human shield and a map Brain has created to avoid the mines.

He finds the President in a railroad car and tries to free him, but is himself captured by the Duke's men.</paragraph><paragraph>While Snake is forced to fight to the death with a very large prisoner named Slag (<link><target>Ox Baker</target></link>), Brain and Maggie trick Romero into letting them see the President. They kill Romero and three other guards and flee with the President. As Snake wins the fight, the Duke learns of Brain's treachery and rallies his gang to chase them down. Snake catches up with Brain, Maggie, and the President on the roof of the World Trade Center, intending to use Snake's glider to escape New York. After a group of crazies destroys Snake's glider, the group heads back down to the street and encounters Cabbie, who offers to take them across the bridge in his cab. When Cabbie reveals that he has the secret tape (having traded it to Romero earlier for his cabbie's hat), the President demands it, but Snake keeps it.</paragraph><paragraph>With the Duke chasing in another car, the cab is blown in half by a mine and Cabbie is killed. As they flee on foot, Brain is killed when he steps on another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, and shoots repeatedly at the Duke; he runs her over. Snake and the President reach the wall and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke kills the guards and attacks Snake, but the President, now armed atop the wall, gleefully shoots the Duke dead, mocking him in the process. Snake is lifted to safety and the implanted explosives are deactivated with seconds to spare.</paragraph><paragraph>As the President prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake for saving him. Snake asks how he feels about the people who died saving his life, but the President only offers halfhearted regret. Hauk offers Snake a job, but Snake walks away. The President's speech commences, and he offers the content of the cassette to the summit; to the President's embarrassment, the tape has been switched for Cabbie's cassette of the swing song &quot;<link><target>Bandstand Boogie</target></link>&quot;. As Snake walks away, he removes the real cassette from his pocket and tears out the magnetic tape.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Cast</heading><paragraph><template><target>columns-list</target><arg>2</arg><arg>

In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called A.T.A.C.S. (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program in order to predict and anticipate a specific criminal's every move. The robot's first test subject is America's public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when A.T.A.C.S. copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, A.T.A.C.S. sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake sucker punches the machine and destroys it. As A.T.A.C.S. shuts down, it can only ask him, &quot;Why?&quot; Snake just walks off answering, &quot;I don't need the competition&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2003,<space/><link><target>CrossGen</target></link><space/>published<space/><italics><link><target>John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles (comics)</target><part>John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles</part></link></italics>, a four-part<space/><link><target>comic book</target></link><space/>miniseries.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page</arg><arg name="title">Snake Strikes Early!
