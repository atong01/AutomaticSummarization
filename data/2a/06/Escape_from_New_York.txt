'''''Escape from New York''''' is a 1981 American [[dystopian]] [[action film]] co-written, co-scored, and directed by [[John Carpenter]]. The film is set in a then near-future 1997 in a crime-ridden [[United States]] that has converted [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]] into a [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security prison]]. Ex-soldier [[Snake Plissken]] ([[Kurt Russell]]) is given 22 hours to find the [[President of the United States]] ([[Donald Pleasence]]), who has been captured by prisoners after the crash of [[Air Force One]].

Carpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s as a reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]]. After the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on an estimated budget of $6 million.<ref name="thenumbers"/><ref name="Phantom">{{cite news | author=Phantom of the Movies | title=''Escape From New York'' rushes into a DVD world | work=Washington Weekend | pages=M24 | publisher=[[Washington Times]] | date=2003-12-11}}</ref> [[Debra Hill]] and [[Larry J. Franco]] served as the producers. The film was co-written by [[Nick Castle]], who already collaborated with Carpenter previously by portraying [[Michael Myers (character)|Michael Myers]] in ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''.

''Escape from New York'' was released in the United States on July 10, 1981. The film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $25,244,700<ref name="thenumbers"/> at the [[box office]]. It won four [[Saturn Awards]], including [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]]. The film gained a [[cult following]] and was followed by a sequel, ''[[Escape from L.A]]''.

==Plot==

In 1988, following a 400% increase in crime, the [[United States Government]] has evacuated [[Manhattan]] and turned the island into a giant maximum-security prison in which all inmates serve a [[life sentence]]. A {{convert|50|ft|m|sing=on}} containment wall surrounds the island and routes out of Manhattan have been dismantled or [[Land mine|mined]]. Armed helicopters patrol the rivers and harbor.

In 1997, while traveling to a peace summit between the [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China]], [[Air Force One]] is hijacked by a terrorist group. The President is given a security bracelet, and has a briefcase (containing an audiotape describing a powerful new bomb) handcuffed to his wrist.  He makes it to an [[escape pod]], and lands in Manhattan just before Air Force One crashes, killing everyone else aboard.

A detachment of U.S. Police Force officers is dispatched to rescue the President.  However, Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, the top crime boss in the prison, presents them with the President's cut-off finger (still bearing a signet ring) and warns them that the Duke has taken the President hostage and that they have 24 hours to meet their sole demand: to allow all the Manhattan inmates access to the mainland.{{citation needed|reason=this is NOT what happens in the film with Romero's scene!|date=July 2015}}

New York Police Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to "Snake" Plissken, a former [[United States Special Operations Forces|U.S Special Forces]] soldier convicted of attempting to rob the [[Federal Reserve]] in [[Denver, Colorado]]. He will be sent to Manhattan on a glider, and if Snake rescues the President and retrieves the cassette tape within 24 hours, Hauk will arrange a [[presidential pardon]]. To ensure he does not fly away from Manhattan, Hauk has him injected with microscopic explosives that will rupture Snake's [[carotid arteries]] within 22 hours; if Snake returns with the President and the tape in time for the summit, Hauk will neutralize the explosives.

Snake is sent into Manhattan in a stealth glider, landing atop the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. He locates the wreckage of Air Force One and escape pod and tracks the President's life-monitor bracelet signal to a [[vaudeville]] theatre, only to find it on the wrist of an old man sleeping there. He meets "Cabbie," who takes Snake in his armored taxi cab to Harold "Brain" Hellman, an advisor to the Duke who has made the [[New York Public Library]] his personal fortress.

Brain tells Snake that the Duke plans to unify the gangs in a mass exodus across the heavily guarded 59th Street/Queensboro Bridge, using the President as a human shield and a map Brain has created to avoid the mines. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie ([[Adrienne Barbeau]]) to lead him to the Duke's compound at [[Grand Central Station]]. He finds the President in a railroad car and tries to free him, but is himself captured by the Duke's men.

While Snake is forced to fight to the death with a very large prisoner named Slag ([[Ox Baker]]), Brain and Maggie trick Romero into letting them see the President. They kill Romero and three other guards and flee with the President. As Snake wins the fight, the Duke learns of Brain's treachery and rallies his gang to chase them down. Snake catches up with Brain, Maggie, and the President on the roof of the World Trade Center, intending to use Snake's glider to escape New York. After a group of crazies destroys Snake's glider, the group heads back down to the street and encounters Cabbie, who offers to take them across the bridge in his cab. When Cabbie reveals that he has the secret tape (having traded it to Romero earlier for his cabbie's hat), the President demands it, but Snake keeps it.

With the Duke chasing in another car, the cab is blown in half by a mine and Cabbie is killed. As they flee on foot, Brain is killed when he steps on another mine.  Maggie refuses to leave him, and shoots repeatedly at the Duke; he runs her over. Snake and the President reach the wall and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke kills the guards and attacks Snake, but the President, now armed atop the wall, gleefully shoots the Duke dead, mocking him in the process. Snake is lifted to safety and the implanted explosives are deactivated with seconds to spare.

As the President prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake for saving him. Snake asks how he feels about the people who died saving his life, but the President only offers halfhearted regret. Hauk offers Snake a job, but Snake walks away. The President's speech commences, and he offers the content of the cassette to the summit; to the President's embarrassment, the tape has been switched for Cabbie's cassette of the swing song "[[Bandstand Boogie]]".  As Snake walks away, he removes the real cassette from his pocket and tears out the magnetic tape.

==Development==
Carpenter originally wrote the screenplay for ''Escape from New York'' in 1976, in the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal]]. Carpenter said, "The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the President. I wrote the screenplay and no studio wanted to make it" because, according to Carpenter, "it was too violent, too scary, too weird."<ref>{{cite news | last = Yakir | first = Dan | coauthors = | title = 'Escape' Gives Us Liberty | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = October 4, 1980 | url = http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/nypost801014.html | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}</ref> He had been inspired by the film ''[[Death Wish (film)|Death Wish]]'', which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this film's philosophy but liked how it conveyed "the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, and I wanted to make a science fiction film along these lines".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maronie |first=Samuel J. |title=On the Set with ''Escape from New York'' |pages= |magazine=[[Starlog]] |number=45 |date=April 1981 |url=<!-- Keeping dead link for ref, no archive version: http://www.sphosting.com/theefnypage/pressontheset.htm -->| accessdate=}}</ref>

===Casting===
Avco-Embassy Pictures, the film's financial backer, preferred either [[Charles Bronson]] or [[Tommy Lee Jones]] to play the role of Snake Plissken to Carpenter's choice of Kurt Russell, who was trying to overcome the "lightweight" screen image conveyed by his roles in several [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] comedies. Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as "a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of [[Bruce Lee]], [[The Exterminator]], and [[Darth Vader]], with [[Clint Eastwood|Eastwood]]'s vocal-ness."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hogan |first=Richard |title=Kurt Russell Rides a New Wave in ''Escape'' Film |pages= |magazine=[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]] |year=1980 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/circus1980.html |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is "the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is." Russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program in order to develop a lean and muscular build. He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the [[eyepatch]] between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his [[depth perception]].<ref name= "Goldberg, Lee">{{cite journal|last=Goldberg |first=Lee |title=Kurt Russell&nbsp;— Two-Fisted Hero |pages= |magazine=[[Starlog]] |number=108 |date=July 1986 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>

===Pre-production===
Carpenter had just made ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' but no one wanted to hire him as a director, so he assumed that he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the intention of making ''Escape'' later. After the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', Avco-Embassy signed him and producer [[Debra Hill]] to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was ''[[The Fog]]''. Initially, the second film that he was going to make to finish the contract was ''[[The Philadelphia Experiment (movie)|The Philadelphia Experiment]]'', but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt that something was missing and recalls, "This was basically a straight [[action film]]. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see."<ref name= "Swires, Steve">{{cite journal|last=Swires |first=Steve |title=John Carpenter |pages=  |magazine=[[Starlog]] |date=July 1981 |number=48 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> He brought in [[Nick Castle]], a friend from his film school days at [[University of Southern California]] who played "[[Michael Myers (Halloween)|The Shape]]" in ''Halloween''. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.<ref>{{cite news|title=Launch of a giddy fantasy a director reaches for the stars with computer aid |last=Ryan |first=Desmond |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=1984-07-14 |page=D01}}</ref>

The film's setting proved to be a potential problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semi-destroyed version of New York City on only a shoe-string budget. He and the film's production designer [[Joe Alves]] rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot but Alves nixed that idea "because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot."<ref name= "Beeler, Michael">{{cite news | last = Beeler

 | date = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> They sent Barry Bernardi, their location manager (and associate producer), "on a sort of all-expense-paid trip across the country looking for the worst city in America," producer Debra Hill remembers.<ref name= "Beeler, Michael"/>

Bernardi suggested [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], because it was filled with old buildings "that exist in New York now, and [that] have that seedy run-down quality" that the team was looking for.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maronie |first=Samuel J. |title=From ''Forbidden Planet'' to ''Escape from New York'': A candid conversation with SFX & production designer Joe Alves |pages=|magazine=[[Starlog]] |number=46 |date=May 1981 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/starlog8105.html |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous [[St. Louis, Missouri]], had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire. Hill said in an interview, "block after block was burnt-out rubble. In some places there was absolutely nothing, so that you could see three and four blocks away."<ref name= "Beeler, Michael"/> As well, Alves found an [[Chain of Rocks Bridge|old bridge]] to double for the "69th St. Bridge". The filmmaker purchased the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them for a dollar, "so that they wouldn't have any liability," Hill remembers.<ref name= "Beeler, Michael"/> Locations across the river in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] were used, including [[Union Station (St. Louis)|Union Station]] and the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theatre]], both of which have since been renovated,<ref>{{cite news|title=Show Me the movies|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=2005-04-17|author=Williams, Joe|page=C1}}</ref> as well as the building which would eventually become the Schlafly Tap Room microbrewery.

===Production===
Carpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending on whether or not we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for about two and a half months I never saw daylight, which was really strange."<ref name="Swires, Steve"/>

The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler [[Ox Baker]]) was filmed in the Grand Hall at [[St. Louis Union Station]]. Russell has stated, "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [spiked] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape."<ref>{{cite news | last = Naha | first=Ed | title = Escape From New York | publisher = Future Life (#30) | date = November 1981 | url = http://www.theefnylapage.com/articles/Future%20Life%201981.pdf}}</ref> In addition to shooting on location in [[St. Louis]], Carpenter shot parts of the film in [[Los Angeles]]. Various interior scenes were shot on a [[sound stage]]; the final scenes were shot at the [[Sepulveda Dam]], in [[Sherman Oaks]]. New York served as a location, as did [[Atlanta]], in order to utilize their then [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|futuristic-looking rapid-transit system]].<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Louis Q&A|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|author=Berger, Jerry|date=1995-02-05|page=17}}</ref>

When it came to shooting in New York City, Carpenter managed to persuade federal officials to grant access to [[Liberty Island]]. "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the [[Statue of Liberty]] at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble."<ref name="Osborne, Robert">{{cite news | last = Osborne | first = Robert | coauthors = | title = On Location | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Hollywood Reporter]] | date = October 24, 1980 | url = http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/reporter801024.html | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}</ref>

Carpenter was interested in creating two distinct looks for the movie. "One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers. That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England."<ref name="Osborne, Robert"/>

[[File:Escape From New York Wireframe.jpg|thumb|The simulated wire-frame effect]]
Certain [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte paintings]] were rendered by [[James Cameron]], who was at the time a special effects artist with [[Roger Corman]]'s [[New World Communications|New World Pictures]].  Cameron was also one of the directors of photography on the film.

As Snake pilots the glider into the city, there are three screens on his control panel displaying [[wire-frame model|wireframe]] animations of the landing target on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and surrounding buildings. What appears on those screens was not computer-generated. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics which were very expensive at the time, even for such a simple animation. To get the animation he wanted, the effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under [[black light]] with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only the tape is visible and appears to be a 3D wireframe animation.<ref>{{cite video|title=Escape from New York (Special Edition)|date=2003|people=Atkins, Tom; Barbeau, Adrienne}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Escape from New York'' grossed $25.2 million in American theaters in summer 1981.<ref name="thenumbers"/> The film received generally positive reviews. As of April 2013, it has a rating of 83% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the critical consensus "Featuring an atmospherically grimy futuristic metropolis, Escape from New York is a strange, entertaining jumble of thrilling action and oddball weirdness." ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine commented on Carpenter, saying, "[He has a] deeply ingrained B-movie sensibility&nbsp;- which is both his strength and limitation. He does clean work, but settles for too little. He uses Russell well, however."<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = A Helluva Town | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Newsweek]] | date = July 27, 1981 | url = http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/newsweek810727.html | accessdate = 2007-05-30 }}</ref> In ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, [[Richard Corliss]] wrote, "John Carpenter is offering this summer's moviegoers a rare opportunity: to escape from the air-conditioned torpor of ordinary entertainment into the hothouse humidity of their own paranoia.

[[Cyberpunk]] pioneer [[William Gibson]] credits the film as an influence on his novel ''[[Neuromancer]]''. "I was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake 'You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad, didn't you?' It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it worked like the best SF where a casual reference can imply a lot."<ref name= "McCaffery, Larry">{{cite news

===DVD releases===
''Escape from New York'' was released on DVD twice by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] (USA), and once by Momentum Pictures (UK). One MGM release is a barebones edition containing just the theatrical trailer. Another version is the Collector's Edition, a two-disc set featuring a High Definition remastered transfer with a 5.1 Stereo audio track, two commentaries (one by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, another by producer [[Debra Hill]] and Joe Alves), a making-of featurette, the first issue of a comic book series titled ''John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles'', and the ten-minute Colorado bank robbery deleted opening sequence.<ref name="Netherby">{{cite journal| last = Netherby| first = Jennifer| title = Escape to a special edition| journal = Video Business| volume = 23| issue = 34| pages = 8| date = 2003-08-25| publisher = Reed Business Information}}</ref>

MGM's special edition of the 1981 film was not released until 2003 because the original negative had disappeared.  The workprint containing deleted scenes finally turned up in the [[Hutchinson, Kansas]] salt mine film depository.  The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a [[backstory]]. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: "After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didn't really start until Snake got to New York.

===Novelization===
In 1981, [[Bantam Books]] published a movie tie-in [[novelization]] written by [[Mike McQuay]] that adopts a lean, humorous style reminiscent of the film. The novel is significant because it includes scenes that were cut out of the film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides motivation and backstory to Snake and Hauk&nbsp;— both disillusioned war veterans&nbsp;— deepening their relationship that was only hinted at it in the film. The novel explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for [[Leningrad]] in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazy son who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel fleshes out the world that these characters exist in, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. The book explains that the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is a no-man's land, and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by nerve gas as a result of World War III.<ref name="McQuay">{{cite book|last=McQuay |first=Mike |title=Escape from New York |publisher=Bantam Books |date=May 1981 |location= |pages= |isbn=0-553-25375-1}}</ref>

===Comic Books===
[[Marvel Comics]] released the one-shot ''The Adventures of Snake Plissken'' in January 1997. The story takes place sometime between ''Escape from New York'' and before his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in ''Escape from L.A.'' Snake has robbed Atlanta's Center for Disease Control of some engineered metaviruses and is looking for buyers in Chicago. Finding himself in a deal that's really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called A.T.A.C.S. (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program in order to predict and anticipate a specific criminal's every move. The robot's first test subject is America's public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when A.T.A.C.S. copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, A.T.A.C.S. sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake sucker punches the machine and destroys it. As A.T.A.C.S. shuts down, it can only ask him, "Why?" Snake just walks off answering, "I don't need the competition".

In 2003, [[CrossGen]] published ''[[John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles (comics)|John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles]]'', a four-part [[comic book]] miniseries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2168 |title=Snake Strikes Early! 'John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles' #1 Hits The Streets One Month Early! |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2003-05-22 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> The story takes place a day or so after the events of ''Escape from New York''. Snake has been given a military [[Humvee]] after his presidential pardon and makes his way to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. Although the director's cut of ''Escape from New York'' shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was pre-planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Snake's partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, ''[[Captain Ron]]''). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed [[shootout]]. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying [[Jackie Kennedy]], leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.

[[New Line Cinema]] (one-time video distributor of the original) acquired the rights to the film from co-rights holder [[StudioCanal]], who will control the European rights, and Carpenter, who will serve as an executive producer and said, "Snake is one of my fondest creations.
