The timbre of musical instruments can be considered in the light of [[Fourier series|Fourier theory]] to consist of multiple [[harmonic]] or inharmonic ''[[harmonic series (music)|partials]]'' or [[overtones]]. Each partial is a sine wave of different [[frequency]] and [[amplitude]] that swells and decays [[ADSR envelope|over time]].

Additive synthesis most directly generates sound by adding the output of multiple sine wave generators. Alternative implementations may use pre-computed [[Wavetable synthesis|wavetables]] or the inverse [[Fast Fourier transform]].

Harmonic additive synthesis is closely related to the concept of a [[Fourier series]] which is a way of expressing a [[periodic function]] as the sum of [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] functions with [[frequencies]] equal to integer multiples of a common [[fundamental frequency]].  These sinusoids are called [[harmonic]]s, [[overtone]]s, or generally, [[Harmonic series (music)#Partial|partials]].  In general, a Fourier series contains an infinite number of sinusoidal components, with no upper limit to the frequency of the sinusoidal functions and includes a [[direct current|DC]] component (one with frequency of 0 [[Hertz|Hz]]).  [[Equal-loudness contour|Frequencies outside of the human audible range]] can be omitted in additive synthesis.  As a result only a finite number of sinusoidal terms with frequencies that lie within the audible range are modeled in additive synthesis.

A waveform or function is said to be [[periodic function|periodic]] if

: <math> y(t) = y(t+P) \ </math>

for all <math> t \,</math> and for some period <math> P \,</math>.

The [[Fourier series]] of a periodic function is mathematically expressed as:

: <math> \begin{align}
  y(t) &= \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left[ a_k \cos(2 \pi k f_0 t ) - b_k \sin(2 \pi k f_0 t ) \right] \\
       &= \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} r_k \cos\left(2 \pi k f_0 t + \phi_k \right) \\
   \end{align} </math>

where

:: <math>f_0 = 1/P\,</math> is the [[fundamental frequency]] of the waveform and is equal to the reciprocal of the period,
:: <math>a_k = r_k \cos(\phi_k) = 2 f_0 \int_{0}^P y(t) \cos(2 \pi k f_0 t)\, dt, \quad k \ge 0\,</math>
:: <math>b_k = r_k \sin(\phi_k) = -2 f_0 \int_{0}^P y(t) \sin(2 \pi k f_0 t)\, dt, \quad k \ge 1\,</math>
:: <math>r_k = \sqrt{a_k^2 + b_k^2}\,</math> is the [[amplitude]] of the <math>k\,</math>th harmonic,
:: <math>\phi_k = \operatorname{atan2}(b_k, a_k)\,</math> is the [[phase (waves)|phase offset]] of the <math>k\,</math>th harmonic. [[atan2]](&nbsp;) is the four-quadrant [[arctangent]] function,

Being inaudible, the [[direct current|DC]] component, <math>a_0/2\,</math>, and all components with frequencies higher than some finite limit, <math>K f_0\,</math>, are omitted in the following expressions of additive synthesis.

===Harmonic form===
The simplest harmonic additive synthesis can be mathematically expressed as:

: {{NumBlk|:|<math>y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k \cos\left(2 \pi k f_0 t + \phi_k \right)</math>,|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where <math>y(t)\,</math> is the synthesis output, <math>r_k\,</math>, <math>k f_0\,</math>, and <math>\phi_k\,</math> are the amplitude, frequency, and the phase offset, respectively, of the <math>k\,</math>th harmonic partial of a total of <math>K\,</math> harmonic partials, and <math>f_0\,</math> is the [[fundamental frequency]] of the waveform and the [[Piano key frequencies|frequency of the musical note]].

===Time-dependent amplitudes===

| [[File:Harmonic additive synthesis spectrum.png|280px]]

<span style="font-size:70%;line-height:130%;font-style:italic;">Problems listening to this file? See [[Media help]]</span>
|}
More generally, the amplitude of each harmonic can be prescribed as a function of time, <math>r_k(t)\,</math>, in which case the synthesis output is

: {{NumBlk|:|<math>y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(t) \cos\left(2 \pi k f_0 t + \phi_k \right)</math>.|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Each [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] <math>r_k(t)\,</math> should vary slowly relative to the frequency spacing between adjacent sinusoids.  The [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of <math>r_k(t)\,</math> should be significantly less than <math>f_0\,</math>.

===Inharmonic form===
Additive synthesis can also produce [[Inharmonicity|inharmonic]] sounds (which are [[aperiodic]] waveforms) in which the individual overtones need not have frequencies that are integer multiples of some common fundamental frequency.<ref name=smith05>

===Time-dependent frequencies===
In the general case, the [[instantaneous frequency]] of a sinusoid is the [[derivative]] (with respect to time) of the argument of the sine or cosine function.  If this frequency is represented in [[hertz]], rather than in [[angular frequency]] form, then this derivative is divided by <math>2 \pi\,</math>.  This is the case whether the partial is harmonic or inharmonic and whether its frequency is constant or time-varying.

In the most general form, the frequency of each non-harmonic partial is a non-negative function of time, <math>f_k(t)\,</math>, yielding

: {{NumBlk|:|<math>y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(t) \cos\left(2 \pi \int_0^t f_k(u)\ du + \phi_k \right).</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

===Broader definitions===
''Additive synthesis'' more broadly may mean sound synthesis techniques that sum simple elements to create more complex timbres, even when the elements are not sine waves.<ref>

It is possible to analyze the frequency components of a recorded sound giving a "sum of sinusoids" representation. This representation can be re-synthesized using additive synthesis.

==Applications==

===Musical instruments===

{{main|Synthesizer|Electronic musical instrument|Software synthesizer}}

Additive synthesis is used in electronic musical instruments.

===Speech synthesis===

{{main|Speech synthesis}}

In [[linguistics]] research, harmonic additive synthesis was used in 1950s to play back modified and synthetic speech spectrograms.<ref name="cooper1951" />

Later, in early 1980s, listening tests were carried out on synthetic speech stripped of acoustic cues to assess their significance. Time-varying [[formant]] frequencies and amplitudes derived by [[linear predictive coding]] were synthesized additively as pure tone whistles. This method is called [[sinewave synthesis]].<ref name=remez81>

Sagayama clarified the duality of LPC and CSM and provided the unified view covering LPC, PARCOR, LSR, LSP and CSM, CSM is not only an new concept of speech spectrum analysis but also a key idea to understand the linear prediction from a unified point of view. ...''

==Discrete-time equations==
In digital implementations of additive synthesis, [[discrete signal|discrete-time]] equations are used in place of the continuous-time synthesis equations.  A notational convention for discrete-time signals uses brackets i.e. <math>y[n]\,</math> and the argument <math>n\,</math> can only be integer values.  If the continuous-time synthesis output <math>y(t)\,</math> is expected to be sufficiently [[bandlimited]]; below half the [[sampling rate]] or <math>f_\mathrm{s}/2\,</math>, it suffices to directly sample the continuous-time expression to get the discrete synthesis equation. The continuous synthesis output can later be [[Nyquist&ndash;Shannon sampling theorem|reconstructed]] from the samples using a [[digital-to-analog converter]]. The sampling period is <math>T=1/f_\mathrm{s}\,</math>.

Beginning with ({{EquationNote|3}}),

: <math>y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(t) \cos\left(2 \pi \int_0^t f_k(u)\ du + \phi_k \right)</math>

and sampling at discrete times <math> t = nT = n/f_\mathrm{s} \,</math> results in

:<math> \begin{align}
 y[n] & = y(nT) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(nT) \cos\left(2 \pi \int_0^{nT} f_k(u)\ du + \phi_k \right) \\
      & = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(nT) \cos\left(2 \pi \sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_{(i-1)T}^{iT} f_k(u)\ du + \phi_k \right) \\
      & = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(nT) \cos\left(2 \pi \sum_{i=1}^{n} (T f_k[i]) + \phi_k \right) \\
      & = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k[n] \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi}{f_\mathrm{s}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_k[i] + \phi_k \right) \\
       \end{align} </math>
where

: <math>r_k[n] = r_k(nT) \,</math> is the discrete-time varying amplitude envelope
: <math>f_k[n] = \frac{1}{T} \int_{(n-1)T}^{nT} f_k(t)\ dt \,</math> is the discrete-time [[Finite difference|backward difference]] instantaneous frequency.

This is equivalent to

: <math> y[n] = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k[n] \cos\left( \theta_k[n] \right) </math>

where

:<math> \begin{align}
    \theta_k[n] &= \frac{2 \pi}{f_\mathrm{s}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_k[i] + \phi_k \\
                &= \theta_k[n-1] + \frac{2 \pi}{f_\mathrm{s}} f_k[n] \\
       \end{align} </math> for all <math>n>0\,</math><ref name="RodetDepalle_FFTm1"/>
and
: <math> \theta_k[0] = \phi_k. \,</math>
