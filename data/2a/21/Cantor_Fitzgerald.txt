'''Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P.''' is a [[financial services]] firm that was founded in 1945. It specializes in institutional equity, fixed income sales and trading, and serving the middle market with [[investment banking]] services, [[prime brokerage]], and commercial real estate financing. The firm is also active in new businesses including advisory and asset management services, gaming technology, e-commerce, and other ventures. It has more than 5,000 institutional clients.

Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. is one of 22 [[primary dealer]]s authorized to trade U.S. government securities with [[The Federal Reserve Bank of New York]]. Cantor Fitzgerald's 1,600 employees work in over 30 locations, including financial centers in the Americas, Europe, Asia/Pacific, and the Middle East.  Together with affiliates, Cantor operates in over 60 offices in 20 countries and has over 8,500 employees. In 2011, Cantor's affiliate [[BGC Partners]] expanded into commercial real estate services through its purchase of Newmark Knight Frank and the assets of Grubb & Ellis to form [[Newmark Grubb Knight Frank]].

==History==
Cantor Fitzgerald was formed in 1945 by [[B. Gerald Cantor|Bernard Gerald Cantor]] and John Fitzgerald, as an investment bank and brokerage business. It later became known for its computer-based bond brokerage, the quality of its institutional distribution business model, and as the market's premier dealer of government securities.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.cantor.com/public/aboutus|title=About Us|publisher=Cantor Fitzgerald |accessdate = February 6, 2015}}</ref>

In 1965, Cantor Fitzgerald began "large block" sales/trading of equities for institutional customers. It became the world's first electronic marketplace for U.S. Government Securities in 1972, and it was the first to offer worldwide screen brokerage services in U.S. Government Securities in 1983.

In 1991 [[Howard Lutnick]] was named President & CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and Chairman in Cantor Fitzgerald L.P. in 1996.<ref>{{Cite news| url =http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=239786&ticker=BGCP |title=Executive Profile Howard W. Lutnick|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date = February 11, 2015}}</ref>

On September 11, 2001, the firm lost 658 of its 960 New York employees in the World Trade Center attacks. Since 9/11, the firm worked to rebuild and establish a new global headquarters in Manhattan. Two years after 9/11, it launched its fixed income sales and trading group.

In 2006 the U.S. Federal Reserve added Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. to its Primary Dealer list.  In 2009, the firm launched Cantor Prime Services, a provider of multi-asset, Prime Brokerage platform exploiting its clearing, financing and execution capabilities.

Cantor Fitzgerald began building its real estate business with the launch of CCRE in 2010.

On December 5, 2014, two Cantor Fitzgerald analysts were said to be in the top 25 analysts on [[TipRanks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cantor.com/press_releases/Cantor_Fitzgerald__Co_Research_Analysts_Youssef_Squali_and_Brian_White_Recognized_In_TipRanks.html|title=Cantor Fitzgerald|publisher=|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}</ref>

On September 19, Cantor Fitzgerald made a pledge to distribute 25 percent of the firm's profits for the next five years, and committed to paying for ten years of health care, for the benefit of the families of its 658 former Cantor Fitzgerald, [[eSpeed]], and TradeSpark employees (profits which would otherwise have been distributed to the Cantor Fitzgerald [[Partnership|partners]]).<ref name="msnbc">{{Cite news| url = http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/01/technology/facebook_ipo_zuckerberg/ |title=Iconic 9/11 figures: Where are they now?|publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date = 2010}}</ref> In 2006, the company completed its promise, having paid a total of $180&nbsp;million<ref name="msnbc" /> (and an additional $17&nbsp;million from a relief fund run by Lutnick's sister, Edie).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/cantor-fitzgerald/ |title=The Encyclopedia of 9/11: Cantor Fitzgerald: The firm that lost the most. |date=August 27, 2011 |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |author=Jessica Pressler}}</ref>

Before the attacks, Cantor handled about one-quarter of the daily transactions in the multi-trillion dollar [[treasury security]] market. Cantor has since rebuilt its [[infrastructure]], thanks in part to the efforts of its London office,<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.standard.co.uk/news/cantor-fitzgerald-the-city-firm-that-rose-from-the-911-ashes-6441839.html|title=Cantor Fitzgerald... the City firm that rose from the 9/11 ashes |author= David Cohen|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]] |date =September 11, 2009}}</ref> and now has its headquarters in [[midtown Manhattan]].

On September 2, 2004, Cantor filed a [[Lawsuit|civil lawsuit]] against the [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] for allegedly providing money to the hijackers and Al Qaeda, one of a number of organizations to do so.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3646548.stm WTC agency sues Saudis over 9/11], BBC News Online, September 11, 2004</ref> It was later joined in the suit by the [[Port Authority of New York]].<ref>[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1094073283938 Port Authority to Join Suit Against Saudi Arabia Over 9/11 Attack], Associated Press, September 13, 2004</ref> Most of the claims against Saudi Arabia were dismissed on January 18, 2005.<ref>{{cite news|last=Glovin|first=David|title=Saudi Arabia Wins Dismissal From Sept. 11 Lawsuits (Update1)|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aFC0nwCtmJyc&refer=top_world_news|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=19 October 2012|date=18 January 2005}}</ref>

In December, 2013, Cantor Fitzgerald settled its lawsuit against [[American Airlines]] for $135 million. Cantor Fitzgerald was suing for loss of property and interruption of business, alleging the airline was negligent by allowing hijackers to board [[American Airlines Flight 11|Flight 11]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Cantor Fitzgerald Settles 9/11 Suit Against American Airlines for $135 Million |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/nyregion/cantor-fitzgerald-settles-9-11-lawsuit-for-135-million.html?ref=us |date=December 17, 2013 |work=The New York Times |author=Benjamin Weiser |accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>

Some executives at Cantor Fitzgerald are steaming mad at their boss, chief executive Howard Lutnick for quietly pocketing a chunk of a $135 million settlement the company received from American Airlines (AAL) over negligence related to the 9-11 terrorist attacks that killed more than 600 of the brokerage firm’s employees, the FOX Business Network has learned.   <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2014/10/03/11-settlement-distribution-stirs-ire-among-cantor-insiders/|title=9-11 Settlement Distribution Stirs Ire Among Cantor Insiders|author=Charlie Gasparino|work=Fox Business|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}</ref>
