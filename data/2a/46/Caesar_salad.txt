A '''Caesar salad''' is a [[salad]] of [[romaine lettuce]] and [[crouton]]s dressed with [[parmesan]] [[cheese]], [[lemon]] [[juice]], [[olive oil]], [[Egg (food)|egg]], [[Worcestershire sauce]], garlic, and black pepper.

It is often prepared tableside.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dHPvtWR6TkkC&pg=PA67 |page=67 |title=David Burke's New American Classics |author=David Burke |author2=Judith Choate |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2009 |isbn=9780307519436 |accessdate=February 11, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
<!-- PLEASE DO NOT add the claim that this salad is attributed to Julius Caesar. Reliable sources do not exist for this claim, so if it is added, it will just be deleted again. -->
The salad's creation is generally attributed to restaurateur [[Caesar Cardini]], an [[Italians|Italian]] immigrant who operated restaurants in Mexico and the United States.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Cesar Cardini, Creator of Salad, Dies at 60 |quote=Caesar Cardini, 60, credited with the invention of the Caesar salad, died [...] |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 5, 1956}}
</ref> Cardini was living in [[San Diego]] but also working in [[Tijuana]] where he avoided the restrictions of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].<ref name=Rosa1>{{cite news|title= Rosa Cardini |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1442086/Rosa-Cardini.html |quote=Rosa Cardini, who has died in California aged 75, turned the salad dressing created by her father, Caesar, into a staple of modern dining and a million-dollar business. Although the origin of the Caesar Salad is a topic hotly debated by epicures, the generally accepted version is that it was first popularised in the United States in the late 1920s by an Italian immigrant, born Cesare Cardini. He and his brother Alessandro moved to [[San Diego]] from [[Milan]] after the Great War and then decided to open a restaurant just across the border in Tijuana, Mexico, to attract Americans frustrated by Prohibition. |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=September 21, 2003 |accessdate=2012-02-10 }}
</ref> His daughter Rosa (1928–2003) recounted that her father invented the dish when a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] 1924 rush depleted the kitchen's supplies. Cardini made do with what he had, adding the dramatic flair of the table-side tossing "by the chef."<ref>[http://cdawriter.blogspot.com/2006_02_01_archive.html 1987 interview with Rosa Cardini, for ''Mailpac Magazine,'' LA.]</ref> A number of Cardini's staff have said that they invented the dish.<ref name="grant">In [http://www.tcpalm.com/lifestyle/columnists/bdorothy-grantb-hail-to-all-fathers-and-hail "Hail Caesar"], D.

Caesar's brother ''Alex'' had claimed to have developed the salad (he too allegedly called it "aviator's salad"). ''Livio Santini'' claimed he made the salad from a recipe of his mother, in the kitchen of Caesar's restaurant when he was 18 years old, in 1925, and that Caesar took the recipe from him.''</ref>

[[Julia Child]] said that she had eaten a Caesar salad at Cardini's restaurant when she was a child in the 1920s.<ref name='child'>{{cite book |author=[[Julia Child]] |author2=Paul Child |title=From Julia Child's Kitchen |year=1975 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |isbn=978-0394480718}}</ref> The first documentation of Caesar salad dates to 1946, when the newspaper columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] wrote:
<blockquote>The big food rage in Hollywood&mdash;the Caesar salad&mdash;will be introduced to New Yorkers by Gilmore's Steak House. It's an intricate  concoction that takes ages to prepare and contains (zowie!)  lots of garlic, raw or slightly coddled eggs,  croutons, romaine,  anchovies, parmeasan [''sic''] cheese, olive oil, vinegar and plenty of black pepper.<ref>[http://www.newspapers.com/clip/2731250/early_caesar_salad_reference/ Dorothy Kilgallen, The Voice of Broadway], News-Herald, Franklin, Penn. (Aug. 2, 1946).</ref></blockquote>

==Recipe==
According to Rosa Cardini, the original Caesar salad (unlike his brother Alex's ''Aviator's salad'')<ref name="grant"/> did not contain pieces of [[Anchovy (food)|anchovy]]; the slight anchovy flavor comes from the [[Worcestershire sauce]]. Cardini was opposed to using anchovies in his salad.<ref>"My father always used [[Lea and Perrins]] Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies are one of its ingredients. [...] He meant this to be a subtle salad, and anchovies can be overwhelming." (Above quoted 1987 interview with Rosa Cardini)</ref>

In the 1970s, Cardini's daughter said that the original recipe included whole lettuce leaves, which were meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers; [[coddled egg]]s; and Italian olive oil.<ref name='child'/>

Bottled Caesar dressings are now produced and marketed by many companies.

The trademark brands, "Cardini's", "Caesar Cardini's" and "The Original Caesar Dressing" are all claimed to date to February 1950, though they were only registered decades later,<ref>United States Patent and Trademark Office, serial numbers 73426710 "Cardini's", registered 1983 by Caesar Cardini Foods, 73782270 "The Original Caesar Dressing" and "Caesar Cardini's", registered 1989 by Dolefam Corporation, which later merged with T. Marzetti, Search at http://tess2.uspto.gov</ref> and more than a dozen varieties of bottled ''Cardini's'' dressing are available today, with various ingredients.

Many variations of the salad exist; for example, by topping a Caesar salad with grilled chicken, steak, or seafood. Certain Mexican restaurants may improvise on items such as substituting tortilla strips for croutons or [[Cotija cheese]] for the Parmesan.

==Health concerns==
There is inherent risk of infection by [[salmonella]] bacteria occasionally found in raw egg from cracked or improperly washed eggshells.<ref>[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/egg-products-preparation/egg-products-and-food-safety/ct_index/!ut/p/a1/jZFdb8IgFIZ_DZeU4-qM7q5psqib7YzZrL0x2FJKUoEA2m2_fuhu6tcmXADnfQ-c80BykpFc0r3g1AklaXM454M1zGHQG8UwTUe9Z5gkH_P0JY5huHj0htUfhiS8M__GiOC__OkdDzyYWTzjJNfU1VjISpGMM4eptC0zlmSVUiW2tGLuC1e0cNjWjDkvMM6xNqrcFc76DdPUHMGcKVSWuHMHyQq3FrJkn2RJ8tP6oOfnJAkX_fE0CSHtnxuuAPw13CbkEfBGbY6_tYrkJhz6Xg2rmGEm2Bkfrp3TTwgQtG0bVFbYYGdLGnC19yFtEWhlHG0QHDQETmlR-LXLhflWj70j6LA79XTYIbjF7lS5VnKtrCPZRalEb9-z79doDOJtuxza6AdKMIk9/ U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service ''Egg Products and Food Safety'']</ref> This is a concern with many similar dressings that are [[emulsion|emulsified]] with eggs, though generally the [[pH]] level is thought to be [[acidic]] enough to kill those bacteria. Nevertheless, later versions of the recipe call at least for briefly cooked [[coddled egg]]s or [[pasteurized]] eggs. Recipes may omit the egg and produce a "Caesar [[vinaigrette]]". Many variations of this salad exist; [[yogurt]] is sometimes substituted for the eggs to maintain a creamy texture and others call for using mayonnaise, oil and vinegar.
