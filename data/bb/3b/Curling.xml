A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation, and the skills of the curlers determine how close to the desired result the stone will achieve.

In the late sixties, competitive curlers from Calgary, such as John Mayer, Bruce Stewart, and, later, the world junior championship teams skipped by<space/><link><target>Paul Gowsell</target></link>, proved that the curling brush could be just as (or more) effective without all the blisters common to corn broom use.<extension extension_name='ref' name="curling.ca"></extension><space/>During that time period, there was much debate in competitive curling circles as to which sweeping device was more effective: brush or broom. Eventually, the brush won out with the majority of curlers making the switch to the less costly and more efficient brush. Today, brushes have replaced traditional corn brooms at every level of curling; it is rare now to see a curler using a corn broom on a regular basis.</paragraph><paragraph>Curling brushes may have fabric, hog hair, or horsehair heads.

The thrust from this lunge determines the<space/><italics>weight</italics><space/>and hence the distance the stone will travel. While not compulsory, most curlers deliver the stone while sliding out from the hack. Balance may be assisted by a broom held in the free hand with the back of the broom down so that it slides.</paragraph><paragraph>The stone is released as the thrower approaches the hog line, at which point the<space/><italics>turn</italics><space/>is imparted by a slight clockwise or anti-clockwise twist of the handle from around the two or ten o'clock position to the twelve o'clock on release.

The release rule is rarely enforced in club play unless abuse is suspected. However, in major tournaments it is strictly enforced; the &quot;eye on the hog&quot; sensor in the stone will indicate whether the stone has been legally thrown or not. The lights on the stone handle will either light up green, indicating that the stone has been legally thrown, or red, in which case the illegally thrown stone will be immediately pulled from play instead of waiting for the stone to come to rest.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Olympic Curling, Vancouver 2010 crop sweeping.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>The skip of Team Sweden joins the front end in sweeping a stone into the house at the<space/><link><target>2010 Winter Olympic Games</target></link><space/>in Vancouver</part></link></paragraph><heading level='3'>Sweeping</heading><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">April 2014</arg></template>After the stone is delivered, its trajectory is still influenced by the two sweepers under instruction from the skip. Sweeping is done for several reasons: to reduce friction underneath the stone, to decrease the amount of curl, and to clean debris from the stone's path. The stones curl more as they slow down, so sweeping early in travel tends to increase distance as well as straighten the path, and sweeping after sideways motion is established can increase the sideways distance. When sweeping, pressure and speed of the brush head are key in slightly increasing the layer of moisture that builds up under the stone.</paragraph><paragraph>One of the basic technical aspects of curling is knowing when to sweep. When the ice in front of the stone is swept, a stone will usually travel both farther and straighter. In some situations, one of the two alterations in path is not desirable. For example, a stone may have too much weight, but require sweeping to prevent curling into a guard. The team must decide which is better: getting by the guard but traveling too far, or hitting the guard.</paragraph><paragraph>Much of the yelling that goes on during a curling game is the skip calling the<space/><italics>line</italics><space/>of the shot and the sweepers calling the<space/><italics>weight</italics>. The skip evaluates the path of the stone and calls to the sweepers to sweep as necessary to maintain the intended track. The sweepers themselves are responsible for judging the weight of the stone, ensuring the length of travel is correct and communicating the weight of the stone back to the skip. Some teams use stopwatch timing, from back line to the nearest hog line as a sweeping aid. Many teams use the<space/><italics><link><target>Glossary of curling</target><part>Number System</part></link></italics><space/>to communicate in which of 10 playable zones it is estimated the stone will stop.</paragraph><paragraph>Usually, the two sweepers will be on opposite sides of the stone's path, although depending on which side the sweepers' strengths lie this may not always be the case. Speed and pressure are vital to sweeping. In gripping the broom, one hand should be one third of the way from the top (non-brush end) of the handle while the other hand should be one third of the way from the head of the broom. The angle of the broom to the ice should be so that the most force possible can be exerted on the ice. The precise amount of pressure may vary from relatively light brushing (&quot;just cleaning&quot; - to ensure debris will not alter the stone's path) to maximum-pressure scrubbing.</paragraph><paragraph>Sweeping is allowed anywhere on the ice up to the<space/><italics>tee line</italics>, as long as it is only for one's own team stones. Once the leading edge of a team stone crosses the tee line only one player may sweep it. Additionally, when a stone crosses the tee line, one player from the other team is allowed to sweep it. This is the only case that a stone may be swept by an opposing team member. In international rules, this player must be the skip; or if the skip is throwing, then the sweeping player must be the third.</paragraph><heading level='3'><italics>Burning</italics><space/>a stone</heading><paragraph>Occasionally, players may accidentally touch a stone with their broom or a body part.

These are known as<space/><italics>guard rocks</italics>. If the guard rocks are removed, they are replaced to where they were before the shot was thrown, and the opponent's stone is removed from play and cannot be replayed. This rule is known as the<space/><italics>four-rock rule</italics><space/>or the<space/><italics>free guard zone rule</italics><space/>(for a while in Canada, a &quot;three-rock rule&quot; was in place, but that rule has been replaced by the four-rock rule).</paragraph><paragraph>Originally, the Modified Moncton Rule was developed from a suggestion made by<space/><link><target>Russ Howard</target></link><space/>for the Moncton 100 cashspiel (with the richest prize ever awarded at the time in a tournament) in<space/><link><target>Moncton</target></link>,<space/><link><target>New Brunswick</target></link>, in January 1990. &quot;Howard's Rule&quot; (also known as the Moncton Rule), used for the tournament and based on a practice drill his team used, had the first four rocks in play unable to be removed no matter where they were at any time during the end. This method of play altered slightly and adopted as a Four-rock Free Guard Zone for international competition shortly after. Canada kept to the traditional rules until a three-rock Free Guard Zone rule was adopted, starting in the 1993-94 season. After several years of having the three-rock rule used for the Canadian championships and the winners then having to adjust to the four-rock rule in the World Championships, the<space/><link><target>Canadian Curling Association</target></link><space/>adopted the now-standard Free Guard Zone in the 2002-2003 season.</paragraph><paragraph>This rule, a relatively recent addition to curling, was added in response to a strategy of &quot;peeling&quot; opponents' guard stones (knocking them out of play at an angle that caused the shooter's stone to also roll out of play, leaving no stones on the ice). A team in the lead would often employ this strategy during the game. By knocking all stones out, the opponents could at best score one point (if they had the<space/><link><target>Hammer (curling)</target><part>hammer</part></link>). Alternatively, the team with the hammer could peel rock after rock, which would blank the end, keeping the last rock advantage for another end. This strategy had developed (mostly in Canada) as ice-makers had become skilled at creating a predictable ice surface and the adoption of brushes allowed greater control over the rock. While a sound strategy, this made for an unexciting game. Observers at the time noted that if two teams equally skilled in the peel game faced each other on good ice, the outcome of the game would be predictable from who won the coin flip to have last rock (or had earned it in the schedule) at the beginning of the game. The 1990<space/><link><target>Tim Hortons Brier</target><part>Brier</part></link><space/>was considered by many curling fans as boring to watch because of the near-constant peeling and the quick adoption of the Free Guard Zone the following year reflected how disliked this aspect of the game had become.</paragraph><paragraph>One strategy that has been developed by curlers in response to the Free Guard Zone (<link><target>Kevin Martin (curler)</target><part>Kevin Martin</part></link><space/>from Alberta is one of the best examples) is the &quot;tick&quot; game, where a shot is made attempting to knock (tick) the guard to the side, far enough that it is difficult or impossible to use but still remaining in play while the shot itself goes out of play. The effect is functionally identical to peeling the guard but significantly harder, as a shot that hits the guard too hard (knocking it out of play) results in its being replaced, while not hitting it hard enough can result in its still being tactically useful for the opposition. There's also a greater chance that the shot will miss the guard entirely because of the greater accuracy required to make the shot. Because of the difficulty of making this type of shot, only the best teams will normally attempt it, and it does not dominate the game the way the peel formerly did.<space/><link><target>Steve Gould (curler)</target><part>Steve Gould</part></link><space/>from Manitoba popularized ticks played across the face. These are easier to make because they impart less speed on the object stone, therefore increasing the chance that it remains in play even if a bigger chunk of it is hit.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Hammer</heading><paragraph>Last-rock or last-stone advantage in an end is called the<space/><italics>hammer</italics>. Before the game, teams typically decide who gets the hammer in the first end either by chance (such as a coin toss), by a &quot;draw-to-the-button&quot; contest, where a representative of each team shoots to see who gets closer to the centre of the rings, or, particularly in tournament settings like the Winter Olympics, by a comparison of each team's win-loss record. In all subsequent ends, the hammer belongs to the team that did not score in the preceding end. In the event that neither team scores, the hammer remains with the same team. Naturally, it is easier to score points with the hammer than without; in tournament play, the team with the hammer generally tries to score two or more points. If only one point is possible, the skip will often try to avoid scoring at all in order to retain the hammer until the next end, when two or more points may lie. This is called a<space/><italics>blank end</italics>. Scoring without the hammer is commonly referred to as<space/><italics>stealing</italics>, or<space/><italics>a steal</italics>, and is much more difficult.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Strategy</heading><paragraph>Curling is a game of strategy, tactics and skill. The strategy depends on the team's skill, the opponent's skill, the conditions of the ice, the score of the game, how many ends remain and whether the team has last-stone advantage (the<space/><italics>hammer</italics>). A team may play an end aggressively or defensively. Aggressive playing will put a lot of stones in play by throwing mostly draws; this makes for an exciting game and is very risky but the reward can be very great. Defensive playing will throw a lot of hits preventing a lot of stones in play; this tends to be less exciting and less risky. A good drawing team will usually opt to play aggressively, while a good hitting team will opt to play defensively.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Curlingdiagram.svg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Diagram of the play area in curling, showing the four-foot zone, corner guard, and centre line guard</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>If a team does not have the hammer in an end, it will opt to try to clog up the four-foot zone in the house to deny the opposing team access to the button. This can be done by throwing &quot;centre line&quot; guards in front of the house on the centre line, which can be tapped into the house later or drawn around. If a team has the hammer, they will try to keep this four-foot zone free so that they have access to the button area at all times. A team with the hammer may throw a<space/><italics>corner guard</italics><space/>as their first stone of an end placed in front of the house but outside the four-foot zone to utilize the free guard zone. Corner guards are key for a team to score two points in an end, because they can either draw around it later or hit and roll behind it, making the opposing team's shot to remove it more difficult.</paragraph><paragraph>Ideally, the strategy in an end for a team with the hammer is to score two points or more. Scoring one point is often a wasted opportunity, as they will then lose last-rock advantage for the next end. If a team cannot score two points, they will often attempt to &quot;blank an end&quot; by removing any leftover opposition rocks and rolling out; or, if there are no opposition rocks, just throwing the rock through the house so that no team scores any points, and the team with the hammer can try again the next end to score two or more with it. Generally, a team without the hammer would want to either force the team with the hammer to only one point (so that they can get the hammer back) or &quot;steal&quot; the end by scoring one or more points of their own.</paragraph><paragraph>Generally, the larger the lead a team will have in a game, the more defensively they should play. By hitting all of the opponent's stones, it removes opportunities for their getting multiple points, therefore defending the lead. If the leading team is quite comfortable, leaving their own stones in play can also be dangerous. Guards can be drawn around by the other team, and stones in the house can be tapped back (if they are in front of the tee line) or frozen onto (if they are behind the tee line). A frozen stone is difficult to remove, because it is &quot;frozen&quot; (in front of and touching) to the opponents stone. At this point, a team will opt for &quot;peels&quot;, meaning that the stones they throw will be to not only hit their opposition stones, but to roll out of play as well. Peels are hits that are thrown with the most amount of power.<template><target>clear</target></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Conceding a game</heading><paragraph>It is not uncommon at any level for a losing team to terminate the match before all ends are completed if it believes it no longer has a realistic chance of winning. Competitive games end once the losing team has &quot;run out of rocks&quot;that is, once it has fewer stones in play and available for play than the number of points needed to tie the game.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Curling metering.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Measuring which stone is closest to the centre of the house</part></link></paragraph><heading level='3'>Dispute resolution</heading><paragraph>Most decisions about rules are left to the skips, although in official tournaments, decisions may be left to the officials. However, all scoring disputes are handled by the vice skip. No players other than the vice skip from each team should be in the house while score is being determined. In tournament play, the most frequent circumstance in which a decision has to be made by someone other than the vice skip is the failure of the vice skips to agree on which stone is closest to the button. An independent official (supervisor at Canadian and World championships) then measures the distances using a specially designed device that pivots at the centre of the button. When no independent officials are available, the vice skips measure the distances.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Scoring</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:curlingscore.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>A typical curling scoreboard used at clubs, which use a method of scoring different from the ones used on television</part></link>The winner is the team having the highest number of accumulated points at the completion of ten ends. Points are scored at the conclusion of each of these ends as follows: when each team has thrown its eight stones, the team with the stone closest to the button wins that end; the winning team is then awarded one point for each of its own stones lying closer to the button than the opponent's closest stone.</paragraph><paragraph>Only stones that are<space/><italics>in the house</italics><space/>are considered in the scoring. A stone is in the house if it lies within the<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>12</arg><arg>ft</arg><arg>m</arg><arg name="sing">on</arg></template><space/>zone or any portion of its edge lies over the edge of the ring. Since the bottom of the stone is rounded, a stone just barely in the house will not have any actual contact with the ring, which will pass under the rounded edge of the stone, but it still counts. This type of stone is known as a<space/><italics>biter</italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>It may not be obvious to the eye which of two rocks is closer to the button (center) or if a rock is actually biting or not. There are specialized devices to make these determinations, but these cannot be brought out until after an end is completed. Therefore, a team may make strategic decisions during an end based on assumptions of rock position that turn out to be incorrect.</paragraph><paragraph>The score is marked on a<space/><link><target>scoreboard</target></link>, of which there are two types; the baseball type and the club scoreboard.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>The baseball-style scoreboard</bold><space/>was created for televised games for audiences not familiar with the club scoreboard. The<space/><italics>ends</italics><space/>are marked by columns 1 through 10 (or 11 for the possibility of an extra end to break ties) plus an additional column for the total. Below this are two rows, one for each team, containing the team's score for that end and their total score in the right hand column.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>The club scoreboard</bold><space/>is traditional and used in most curling clubs. Scoring on this board only requires the use of (up to) 11 digit cards, whereas with baseball-type scoring an unknown number of multiples of the digits (especially low digits like<space/><italics>1</italics>) may be needed. The numbered centre row represents all possible accumulated scores, and the numbers placed in the team rows represent the end in which that team achieved that cumulative score. If the red team scores three points in the first end (called a<space/><italics>three-ender</italics>), then a 1 (indicating the first end) is placed beside the number 3 in the red row. If they score two more in the second end, then a 2 will be placed beside the 5 in the red row, indicating that the red team has five points in total (3+2). This scoreboard works because only one team can get points in an end. However, some confusion may arise if neither team scores points in an end, this is called a<space/><italics>blank end</italics>. The blank end numbers are usually listed in the farthest column on the right in the row of the team that has the<space/><italics>hammer</italics><space/>(last rock advantage), or on a special spot for blank ends.</paragraph><paragraph>The following example illustrates the difference between the two types.

However, some curlers<template><target>who</target><arg name="date">February 2013</arg></template><space/>make a considerable portion of their income from curling. Still, curling survives as a people's sport, returning to the Winter Olympics in 1998 with men's and women's tournaments after not having been on the official Olympic program since 1924 (that year's curling competition, for men only, was confirmed as official by the<space/><link><target>International Olympic Committee</target><part>IOC</part></link><space/>in 2006). Because accuracy, strategy, skill, and experience are more valuable in curling than traditional sports virtues of speed, stamina, and strength, most competitive curlers are older than their counterparts in other sports. However, there are many young teams who turn heads, and junior curling is quite popular, with national finals being televised nationwide in Canada.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Good sportsmanship</heading><paragraph>More so than in many other team sports, good sportsmanship, often referred to as the &quot;Spirit of Curling,&quot; is an integral part of curling. This tradition is similar to the games of darts, except in curling the winner traditionally buys a round of drinks and four hot dogs for the losing team.</paragraph><paragraph>The Spirit of Curling also leads teams to congratulate their opponents for making a good shot, strong sweeping or spectacular form. Perhaps most importantly, the Spirit of Curling dictates that one never cheers mistakes, misses or gaffes by one's opponent (unlike most team sports) and one should not celebrate one's own good shots during the game beyond modest acknowledgement of the shot such as a head nod, fist bump or thumbs-up gesture. Modest congratulation, however, may be exchanged between winning team members after the match. On-the-ice celebration is usually reserved for the winners of a major tournament after winning the final game of the championship. It is completely unacceptable to attempt to throw opposing players off their game by way of negative comment, distraction or heckling.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.rcmpcc.ca/web/cccntnt.asp?app</arg><arg name="title">Spirit of Curling</arg><arg name="publisher">RCMP Curling Club, Ottawa</arg><arg name="accessdate">23 March 2013</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>A match traditionally begins with players shaking hands with and saying &quot;good curling&quot; or &quot;have a pleasant game&quot; to each member of the opposing team.

These curlers may use a device known as a &quot;delivery stick&quot;. The cue holds on to the handle of the stone and is then pushed along by the curler. At the end of delivery, the curler pulls back on the cue, which releases it from the stone. The<space/><link><target>Canadian Curling Association</target></link><space/><italics>Rules of Curling</italics><space/>allows the use of a delivery stick in club play but does not permit it in championships.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Terminology</heading><paragraph><template><target>For</target><arg>an extensive glossary of terminology</arg><arg>Glossary of curling</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Terms used to describe the game include:</paragraph><paragraph>The ice in the game may be<space/><italics>fast (keen)</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>slow</italics>. If the ice is keen, a rock will travel farther with a given amount of weight (throwing force) on it. The speed of the ice is measured in seconds. One such measure, known as &quot;hog-to-hog&quot; time, is the speed of the stone and is the time in seconds the rock takes from the moment it crosses the near hog line till it crosses the far hog line. If this number is lower, the rock is moving faster, so again low numbers mean more speed. The ice in a match will be somewhat consistent and thus this measure of speed can also be used to measure how far down the ice the rock will travel. Once it is determined that a rock taking (for example) 13 seconds to go from hog line to hog line will stop on the tee line, the curler can know that if the hog-to-hog time is matched by a future stone, that stone will likely stop at approximately the same location. As an example, on keen ice, common times might be 16 seconds for guards, 14 seconds for draws, and 8 seconds for peel weight.</paragraph><paragraph><italics>The back line to hog line speed</italics><space/>is used principally by sweepers to get an initial sense of the weight of a stone. As an example, on keen ice, common times might be 4.0 seconds for guards, 3.8 seconds for draws, 3.2 for normal hit weight, and 2.9 seconds for peel weight. Especially at the club level, this metric can be misleading, due to amateurs sometimes pushing stones on release, causing the stone to travel faster than the back-to-hog speed.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Champions and major championships</heading><paragraph><template><target>col-begin</target></template><template><target>col-break</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Curling at the Winter Olympics</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>World Curling Championships</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>World Junior Curling Championships</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>World Senior Curling Championships</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>European Curling Championships</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Continental Cup of Curling</target></link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>col-break</target></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Tim Hortons Brier</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Scotties Tournament of Hearts</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>United States Men's Curling Championship</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>United States Women's Curling Championship</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Canada Cup (curling)</target><part>Canada Cup</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>European Mixed Curling Championships</target></link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>col-end</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Notable curling clubs</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>List of curling clubs</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>hidden top</target><arg name="border"><space/>#aaa solid 1px</arg><arg name="titlestyle">text-align: center;</arg><arg name="title">Notable curling clubs</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Bemidji Curling Club</target></link><space/><link><target>Bemidji, Minnesota</target></link>, Home of the 2006 United States Men's &amp;
