However, the bow and arrow is still an effective weapon, and archers have seen action in the 21st century.<extension extension_name='ref'>Bows and arrows: deadly weapons of rural Kenya's war.

The clubs were &quot;the drawing rooms of the great country houses placed outside&quot; and thus came to play an important role in the social networks of the local upper class. As well as its emphasis on display and status, the sport was notable for its popularity with females.

The classic D-shape comes from the use of the wood of the yew tree. The sap-wood is best suited to the tension on the back of the bow, and the heart-wood to the compression on the belly.

Therefore, if one is right-eye dominant, they would hold the bow in the left hand and draw the string with the right hand. However, not everyone agrees with this line of thought. A smoother, and more fluid release of the string will produce the most consistently repeatable shots, and therefore may provide greater accuracy of the arrow flight. Some believe that the hand with the greatest dexterity should therefore be the hand that draws and releases the string. Either eye can be used for aiming, and the less dominant eye can be trained over time to become more effective for use. To assist with this, an eye patch can be temporarily worn over the dominant eye.</paragraph><paragraph>The hand that holds the bow is referred to as the<space/><italics>bow hand</italics><space/>and its arm the<space/><italics>bow arm</italics>. The opposite hand is called the<space/><italics>drawing hand</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>string hand</italics>. Terms such as<space/><italics>bow shoulder</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>string elbow</italics><space/>follow the same convention.</paragraph><paragraph>If shooting according to eye dominance, right-eye-dominant archers shooting conventionally hold the bow with their left hand. If shooting according to hand dexterity, the archer draws the string with the hand that possesses the greatest dexterity, regardless of eye dominance.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Modern form</heading><paragraph>To shoot an arrow, an archer first assumes the correct stance. The body should be at or nearly perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, with the feet placed shoulder-width apart. As an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level other stances such as the &quot;open stance&quot; or the &quot;closed stance&quot; may be used, although many choose to stick with a &quot;neutral stance&quot;. Each archer has a particular preference, but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line is a half to a whole foot-length from the other foot, on the ground.</paragraph><paragraph>To load, the bow is pointed toward the ground, tipped slightly clockwise of vertical (for a right handed shooter) and the shaft of the arrow is placed on the arrow rest or shelf. The back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the<space/><bold>nock</bold><space/>(a small locking groove located at the proximal end of the arrow). This step is called &quot;nocking the arrow&quot;. Typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane, the &quot;cock feather&quot;, is pointing away from the bow, to improve the clearance of the arrow as it passes the arrow rest.</paragraph><paragraph>A compound bow is fitted with a special type of arrow rest, known as a launcher, and the arrow is usually loaded with the cock feather/vane pointed either up, or down, depending upon the type of launcher being used.</paragraph><paragraph>The bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers, or with a mechanical arrow release. Most commonly, for finger shooters, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below, although several other techniques have their adherents around the world, involving three fingers below the arrow, or an arrow pinching technique.<space/><italics>Instinctive</italics><space/>shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves). In either the split finger or three finger under case, the string is usually placed in either the first or second joint of the fingers.</paragraph><paragraph>Another type of string hold, used on traditional bows, is the type favoured by the Mongol warriors, known as the &quot;thumb release&quot;, style. This involves using the thumb to draw the string, with the fingers curling around the thumb to add some support. To release the string, the fingers are opened out and the thumb relaxes to allow the string to slide off the thumb. When using this type of release, the arrow should rest on the same side of the bow as the drawing hand i.e. Left hand draw = arrow on left side of bow.</paragraph><paragraph>The archer then raises the bow and draws the string, with varying alignments for vertical versus slightly canted bow positions. This is often one fluid motion for shooters of recurves and longbows, which tend to vary from archer to archer. Compound shooters often experience a slight jerk during the drawback, at around midpoint where the draw weight is at its maximumbefore relaxing into a comfortable stable full draw position. The archer draws the string hand towards the face, where it should rest lightly at a fixed<space/><italics>anchor point</italics>. This point is consistent from shot to shot, and is usually at the corner of the mouth, on the chin, to the cheek, or to the ear, depending on preferred shooting style. The archer holds the bow arm outwards, toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground, though archers with hyper extendable elbows tend to angle the inner elbow toward the ground, as exemplified by the Korean archer<space/><link><target>Jang Yong-Ho</target></link>. This keeps the forearm out of the way of the bowstring.</paragraph><paragraph>In modern form, the archer stands erect, forming a &quot;T&quot;. The archer's lower<space/><link><target>trapezius muscle</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point. Some modern bows are equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length. In contrast, traditional English Longbow shooters step &quot;into the bow&quot;, exerting force with both the bow arm and the string hand arm simultaneously, especially when using bows having draw weights from 100&amp;nbsp;lbs to over 175&amp;nbsp;lbs. Heavily-stacked traditional bows (recurves, long bows, and the like) are released immediately upon reaching full draw at maximum weight, whereas compound bows reach their maximum weight in or around mid-draw, dropping holding weight significantly at full draw. Compound bows are often held at full draw for a short time to achieve maximum accuracy.</paragraph><paragraph>The arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand (see<space/><link><target>Bow draw</target></link>), or triggering the mechanical release aid. Usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid, the bow hand relaxed, and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles, as opposed to using just arm motions. An archer should also pay attention to the recoil or<space/><italics>follow through</italics><space/>of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique) that affect accuracy.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Aiming methods</heading><paragraph><template><target>Refimprove</target><arg name="date">March 2011</arg></template><link><target>File:Kyujutsu14.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>From ''<link><target>Hokusai Manga</target></link>'', 1817</part></link>There are two main forms of aiming in archery: using a mechanical or fixed sight, or barebow.</paragraph><paragraph>Mechanical sights can be affixed to the bow to aid in aiming. They can be as simple as a pin, or may use optics with magnification. They usually also have a peep sight (rear sight) built into the string, which aids in a consistent anchor point. Modern compound bows automatically limit the draw length to give a consistent arrow velocity, while traditional bows allow great variation in draw length. Some bows use mechanical methods to make the draw length consistent. Barebow archers often use a sight picture, which includes the target, the bow, the hand, the arrow shaft and the arrow tip, as seen at the same time by the archer. With a fixed &quot;anchor point&quot; (where the string is brought to, or close to, the face), and a fully extended bow arm, successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position fall on the same<space/><link><target>Predicted impact point</target><part>point</part></link>. This lets the archer adjust aim with successive shots to achieve accuracy.</paragraph><paragraph>Modern archery equipment usually includes<space/><link><target>Sight (device)</target><part>sights</part></link>. Instinctive aiming is used by many archers who use traditional bows. The two most common forms of a non-mechanical release are split-finger and three-under. Split-finger aiming requires the archer to place the index finger above the nocked arrow, while the middle and ring fingers are both placed below. Three-under aiming places the index, middle, and ring fingers under the nocked arrow. This technique allows the archer to better look down the arrow since the back of the arrow is closer to the dominant eye, and is commonly called &quot;gun barreling&quot; (referring to common aiming techniques used with firearms).</paragraph><paragraph>When using short bows or shooting from horseback, it is difficult to use the sight picture. The archer may look at the target, but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view. Aiming then involves hand-eye coordinationwhich includes proprioception and motor-muscle memory, similar to that used when throwing a ball. With sufficient practice, such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war.<extension extension_name='ref' name="lehman"><template><target>citation</target><arg name="title"><space/>Nine years among the Indians, 1870–1879

However, the energy must be imparted over a limited distance (determined by arm length) and therefore (because the projectile is accelerating) over a limited time, so the limiting factor is not work but rather<space/><link><target>Power (physics)</target><part>power</part></link>, which determined how much energy can be added in the limited time available. Power generated by muscles, however, is limited by<space/><link><target>Muscle contraction#Force-length and force-velocity relationships</target><part>forcevelocity relationship</part></link>, and even at the optimal contraction speed for power production, total work by the muscle is less than half of what it would be if the muscle contracted over the same distance at slow speeds, resulting in less than 1/4 the projectile launch velocity possible without the limitations of the forcevelocity relationship.</paragraph><paragraph>When a bow is used, the muscles are able to perform work much more slowly, resulting in greater force and greater work done. This work is stored in the bow as<space/><link><target>elastic potential energy</target></link>, and when the bowstring is released, this stored energy is imparted to the arrow much more quickly than can be delivered by the muscles, resulting in much higher velocity and, hence, greater distance. This same process is employed by frogs, which use elastic tendons to increase jumping distance. In archery, some energy dissipates through<space/><link><target>Hysteresis#Elastic hysteresis</target><part>elastic hysteresis</part></link>, reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot. Of the remaining energy, some is dampened both by the limbs of the bow and the bowstring. Depending on the arrow's elasticity, some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow, primarily because the release of the bowstring is rarely in line with the arrow shaft, causing it to flex out to one side. This is because the bowstring accelerates faster than the archer's fingers can open, and consequently some sideways motion is imparted to the string, and hence arrow nock, as the power and speed of the bow pulls the string off the opening fingers.</paragraph><paragraph>Even with a release aid mechanism some of this effect is usually experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism. This makes the arrow oscillate in flightits center flexing to one side and then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow's flight proceeds. This is clearly visible in high-speed photography of arrows at discharge. A direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when<space/><link><target>dry firing</target></link>. Dry firing refers to releasing the bow string without a nocked arrow. Because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy, all the energy stays in the bow. Some have suggested that dry firing may cause physical damage to the bow, such as cracks and fracturesand because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy dry firing produces, should never be done.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.docstoc.com/docs/75758007/The-Physics-of-Archery-AstraZeneca-Science-Teaching-Trust<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Physics of Archery AstraZeneca Science Teaching Trust<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Docstoc.com<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">26 March 2013</arg></template></extension><link><target>File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Snake Indians - Testing Bows - Walters 37194060.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part><link><target>Snake Indians</target></link><space/>- testing bows, circa 1837 by<space/><link><target>Alfred Jacob Miller</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>Walters Art Museum</target></link></part></link></paragraph><paragraph>Modern arrows are made to a specified 'spine', or stiffness rating, to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim. This flexing can be a desirable feature, since, when the spine of the shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow(string), the arrow bends or flexes around the bow and any arrow-rest, and consequently the arrow, and fletchings, have an un-impeded flight. This feature is known as the<space/><link><target>archer's paradox</target></link>. It maintains accuracy, for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on discharge, some inconsistency would be present, and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved.</paragraph><paragraph>The accurate flight of an arrow is dependent on its fletching. The arrow's manufacturer (a &quot;fletcher&quot;) can arrange fletching to cause the arrow to rotate along its axis. This improves accuracy by evening pressure buildups that would otherwise cause the arrow to &quot;plane&quot; on the air in a random direction after shooting. Even with a carefully made arrow, the slightest imperfection or air movement causes some unbalanced turbulence in air flow. Consequently, rotation creates an equalization of such turbulence, which, overall, maintains the intended direction of flight i.e. accuracy. This rotation is not to be confused with the rapid gyroscopic rotation of a rifle bullet. Fletching that is not arranged to induce rotation still improves accuracy by causing a restoring drag any time the arrow tilts from its intended direction of travel.</paragraph><paragraph>The innovative aspect of the invention of the bow and arrow was the amount of power delivered to an extremely small area by the arrow. The huge ratio of length vs. cross sectional area, coupled with velocity, made the arrow more powerful than any other hand held weapon until firearms were invented. Arrows can spread or concentrate force, depending on the application. Practice arrows, for instance, have a blunt tip that spreads the force over a wider area to reduce the risk of injury or limit penetration. Arrows designed to pierce armor in the Middle Ages used a very narrow and sharp tip (&quot;bodkinhead&quot;) to concentrate the force. Arrows used for hunting used a narrow tip (&quot;broadhead&quot;) that widens further, to facilitate both penetration and a large wound.</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>further</target><arg>Archer's paradox</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Hunting</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Bow hunting</arg></template><link><target>File:Bow compound.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>A modern compound hunting bow</part></link>Using archery to take game animals is known as &quot;bow hunting&quot;.
