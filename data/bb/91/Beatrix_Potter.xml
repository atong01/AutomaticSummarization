She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the<space/><link><target>Lake District</target></link>, developing a love of landscape, flora and fauna, all of which she closely observed and painted. Her parents discouraged her intellectual development as a young woman, but her study and watercolors of<space/><link><target>fungi</target></link><space/>led to her being widely respected in the field of<space/><link><target>mycology</target></link>. In her thirties, Potter published the highly successful children's book,<space/><italics><link><target>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</target></link></italics>.

Over the following decades, she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape. In 1913, at the age of 47, she married William Heelis, a respected local solicitor from<space/><link><target>Hawkshead</target></link>. Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of<space/><link><target>Herdwick sheep</target></link><space/>and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation. She continued to write and illustrate, and to design spin-off merchandise based on her children's books for Warne, until the duties of land management and her diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue.</paragraph><paragraph>Potter wrote about 30 books; the best known being her<space/><link><target>Beatrix Potter#Publications</target><part>23 children's tales</part></link>.

In 1930 the Heelises became partners with the National Trust in buying and managing the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate.
