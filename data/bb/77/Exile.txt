'''Exile''' means to be away from one's home (i.e. city, state or country), while either being explicitly refused permission to return and/or being threatened with imprisonment or death upon return. It can be a form of [[punishment]] and [[solitude]].<ref Name="Hobbes">{{cite book  |last=Hobbes  |first=Thomas  |title=Leviathan; Or, The Matter, Form and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil  |year=1886  |location= |page=145 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-QtAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA145&dq=Exile+can+be+a+form+of+punishment.&as_brr=1&ie=ISO-8859-1 | doi =  |id=  |publisher=George Routledge and Sons }}</ref>

It is common to distinguish between '''internal exile''', i.e., forced resettlement within the country of residence, and '''external exile''', [[deportation]] outside the country of residence.<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/internal%2Bexile ] {{wayback|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/internal%2Bexile |date=20150513154417 }}</ref> Although most commonly used to describe an individual situation, the term is also used for groups (especially ethnic or national groups), or for an entire government. Terms such as '''[[diaspora]]''' and '''[[refugee]]''' describe group exile, both voluntary and forced, and '''[[government in exile]]''' describes a government of a country that has been forced to relocate and argue its legitimacy from outside that country.

Exile can also be a self-imposed departure from one's homeland. Self-exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person that claims it, to avoid persecution or legal matters (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular thing.

Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."

==For individuals==

=== Exiled heads of state ===
In some cases the [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] [[head of state]] is allowed to go into exile following a [[coup]] or other change of government, allowing a more peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.

=== Exile of a Prophet ===
[[Baha'u'llah]], the Messenger or Manifestation of the [[Baha'i Faith]], was exiled from His homeland in [[Tehran]] to [[Baghdad]] in 1853.  Also, after a stay in the region of [[Iraq]] He was banished to [[Constantinople]] in 1863 for fear of His growing influence in the region.  Moreover, He was banished again to [[Adrianople]] in December 1863 and finally exiled to [[Akka]] in the present day [[Israel]] in 1868.

=== Avoiding tax or legal matters ===
{{main|Tax exile|Fugitive}}
A wealthy citizen who departs from a former abode for a lower tax jurisdiction (a "[[tax haven]]") in order to reduce his/her [[taxation|tax burden]] is termed a ''tax exile''. Creative people such as authors and musicians who achieve sudden wealth sometimes find themselves among this group. Examples include the British-Canadian writer [[Arthur Hailey]], who moved to the Bahamas to avoid taxes following the runaway success of his novels ''Hotel'' and ''Airport'',<ref>Stevie Cameron, ''Blue Trust: The Author, The Lawyer, His Wife, And Her Money,'' 1998</ref> and the English rock band the [[Rolling Stones]] who, in the spring of 1971 owed more in taxes than they could pay and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Members of the band all moved to France for a period of time where they recorded music for the album that came to be called ''Exile on Main Street'', the Main Street of the title referring the French Riviera.<ref>Robert Greenfield, ''Exile on Main Street: A Season in Hell with the Rolling Stones,'' 2008.</ref> In 2012, [[Eduardo Saverin]], one of the founders of Facebook, made headlines by renouncing his U.S. Citizenship before his company's [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kucera|first=Danielle|title=Facebook Co-Founder Saverin Gives Up U.S. Citizenship Before IPO|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-11/facebook-co-founder-saverin-gives-up-u-s-citizenship-before-ipo.html|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=2 November 2012}}</ref> The dual Brazilian/U.S. citizen's decision to move to Singapore and renounce his citizenship spurred a bill in the U.S. Senate, the [[Ex-PATRIOT Act]], which would have forced such wealthy "tax exiles" to pay a special tax in order to re-enter the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last=Drawbaugh|first=Kevin|title=Facebook's Saverin fires back at tax-dodge critics|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/17/us-facebook-taxes-idUSBRE84G11A20120517|accessdate=2 November 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=May 17, 2012}}</ref>

In some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal issues, such as [[litigation]] or [[criminal prosecution]]. An example of this was [[Asil Nadir]], who fled to the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] for 17 years rather than face [[prosecution]] in connection with the failed £1.7 bn company [[Polly Peck]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

=== Avoiding violence or persecution, or in the aftermath of war ===

:* Palestinians who fled bombardment from the nascent Israeli state in 1948.
:* People undertaking a religious or [[civil liberties]] role in society may be forced into exile due to threat of persecution. For example, [[nun]]s were exiled following the [[Communism|Communist]] [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|coup d'état of 1948]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-20/news/mn-233_1_bila-voda |title=For Exiled Nuns, It's Too Late : Banished by the Communist regime, Czechoslovakia's sisters of Bila Voda were symbols of persecution.

==For groups, nations and governments==

===Nation in exile===
{{main|Diaspora|Refugee}}
When large groups, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled, it can be said that this nation is in ''exile'', or '''[[Diaspora]]'''. Nations that have been in exile for substantial periods include the [[Jew]]s, who were deported by [[Babylon]]ian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] in 586 BCE and again following the destruction of the second [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in the year 70 CE. Many Jewish prayers include a yearning to return to Jerusalem and the Jewish homeland.

After the [[partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century, and following the uprisings (like [[Kościuszko Uprising]], [[November Uprising]] and [[January Uprising]]) against the partitioning powers ([[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austro-Hungary]]), many Poles have chosen&nbsp;– or been forced&nbsp;– to go into exile, forming large diasporas (known as [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]), especially in France and the United States. The entire population of [[Crimean Tatars]] (200,000) that remained in their homeland [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] was exiled on 18 May 1944 to Central Asia as a form of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[collective punishment]] on false accusations. At [[Diego Garcia]], between 1967  and 1973 the British Government forcibly removed some 2,000 [[Chagossians|Chagossian]] resident islanders to make way for a military base today jointly operated by the US and UK.

Since the [[Cuban Revolution]] over one million [[Cubans]] have left [[Cuba]]. Most of these self-identify as exiles as their motivation for leaving the island is political in nature. It is to be noted that at the time of the [[Cuban Revolution]], [[Cuba]] only had a population of 6.5 million, and was not a country that had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. Most of the exiles' children also consider themselves to be [[Cuban exile]]s. It is to be noted that under Cuban law, children of Cubans born abroad are considered Cuban Citizens.

===Government in exile===
{{main|Government in exile}}
[[File:Napoleon's exile to Elba.jpg|thumb|''The journey of a modern hero, to the island of Elba'' (1814), showing [[Napoleon I]], sword broken, being exiled to [[Elba]] at the close of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]]]]

During a foreign [[Military occupation|occupation]] or after a [[coup d'état]], a ''government in exile'' of a such afflicted country may be established abroad.  One of the most well-known instances of this is the [[Polish government-in-exile]], a government in exile that commanded [[Polish contribution to World War II|Polish armed forces]] operating outside Poland after German occupation during World War II. Other examples include the [[Free French Forces]] government of [[Charles De Gaulle]] of the same time, and the [[Central Tibetan Administration]], commonly known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the [[14th Dalai Lama]].

== Exile in drama, literature, and the arts ==

===In Greek tragedy===
[[File:Jason and Medea - John William Waterhouse.jpg|thumb|[[Jason]] and [[Medea]], by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1907]]

To wander away from the city-state (the home) is to be exposed without the protection of government (laws), friends and family. In the ancient Greek world, this was seen as a fate worse than death. [[Euripedes]]’ [[Medea]]–because of her actions (both in Iolcus and Corinth)-made herself and her family (including Jason) exiles in Corinth. She talks of her exiled state in Corinth: 'I, a desolate woman without a city... no relative at all'. Jason justifies his marriage, to a Corinth royal family member, as an attempt to better this situation: 'When I moved here from the land of Iolkos... what happier godsend could I have found than to marry the king's daughter, poor exile that I was... that I should bring up our children in a manner worthy of my house, and producing brothers to my children by you, I should place them all on level footing'.

Euripides likens all women's position to exile; in their having to leave home to serve their husbands. So Medea was doubly in exile, both in the ordinary sense, as a non-Greek foreigner, and as a woman. In the same speech, Medea talks of her status as 'a foreigner [falling] in the city['s ways]' and, on being married, 'we come to new behaviour, new customs'.

The theme of exile also appears in [[Euripedes]] [[The Bacchae]] when [[Dionysus]] sends [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]] and her sisters into exile. [[Dionysus]]: 'With your sisters you shall live in exile' and later [[Agave]] laments: 'Farewell my city...show us the way Asian women, show us the way to bitter exile'.

From [[the Bacchae]]:
: [[Dionysus]]: ''All foreign lands now dance to his [Dionysus's] drum.''
: [[Pentheus]]: ''That is why they are foreign and we're not.''
