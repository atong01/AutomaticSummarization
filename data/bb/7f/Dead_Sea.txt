The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]] for thousands of years. In the Bible, it is a place of refuge for [[David|King David]]. It was one of the world's first health resorts (for [[Herod the Great]]), and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummification]] to [[potash]] for [[fertilizer]]s. People also use the salt and the minerals from the Dead Sea to create [[cosmetics]] and herbal [[Sachet (scented bag)|sachet]]s.

The Dead Sea [[seawater|water]] has a [[density]] of 1.24&nbsp;kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to [[Buoyancy|floating]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of world geography|year=2005|publisher=Facts on File|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DJgnebGbAB8C&pg=PA237&dq=Dead+sea+has+a+density++++swimming#v=onepage&q&f=false|editor=R W McColl|page=237|isbn=9780816072293}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dspimport.com/about_the_dead_sea.html|title=Dead Sea - Composition of Dead Sea Water}}</ref>

==Etymology and toponymy==
In Hebrew, the Dead Sea is ''{{Audio|He-Dead Sea.ogg|Yām ha-Melaḥ}}'' ({{lang|he|ים המלח}}), meaning "sea of [[salt]]" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:3). In the Bible, the Dead Sea is called the Salt Sea, the Sea of the Arabah, and the Eastern Sea. The designation "Dead Sea" never appears in the Bible.

In prose sometimes the term ''{{transl|he|Yām ha-Māvet}}'' ({{lang|he|ים המוות}}, "sea of death") is used, due to the scarcity of aquatic life there.<ref>{{cite book|author1=David Bridger|author2=Samuel Wolk|title=The New Jewish Encyclopedia|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=hZqpCrG3qw0C&pg=PA109|accessdate=July 25, 2011|date=September 1976|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|isbn=978-0-87441-120-1|page=109|quote=It was named the “Dead Sea” because of the fact that no living thing can exist there, since the water is extremely salty and bitter.}}</ref> In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the Dead Sea is called {{Audio|ArDeadSea.ogg|''al-Bahr al-Mayyit''}}<ref name="ReferenceA"/> ("the Dead Sea"), or less commonly ''{{transl|ar|baḥrᵘ lūṭᵃ}}'' ({{lang|ar|بحر لوط}}, "the Sea of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]]"). Another historic name in Arabic was the "Sea of [[Neve Zohar|Zoʼar]]", after a nearby town in biblical times. The Greeks called it ''Lake Asphaltites'' ([[Attic Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἡ Θάλαττα ἀσφαλτῖτης}}, ''{{transl|el|hē Thálatta asphaltĩtēs}}'', "the Asphaltite<ref>See [[bitumen]] and [[asphalt]] for more about ''asphaltite''.</ref> sea"). The Bible also refers to it as ''{{transl|he|Yām ha-Mizraḥî}}'' ({{lang|he|ים המזרחי}}, "the Eastern sea") and ''{{transl|he|Yām ha-‘Ărāvâ}}'' ({{lang|he|ים הערבה}}, "Sea of the [[Arabah]]").

==Geography==
[[File:Dead Sea Galilee.jpg|thumb|[[Satellite photography|Satellite photograph]] showing the location of the Dead Sea]]
The Dead Sea is an [[endorheic basin|endorheic lake]] located in the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], a geographic feature formed by the [[Dead Sea Transform]] (DST). This left lateral-moving [[transform fault]] lies along the [[tectonics|tectonic]] [[plate tectonics|plate boundary]] between the [[African Plate]] and the [[Arabian Plate]]. It runs between the [[East Anatolian Fault]] zone in [[Turkey]] and the northern end of the [[Red Sea Rift]] offshore of the southern tip of [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. It is here that the Upper Jordan River/Sea of Galilee/Lower Jordan River water system comes to an end.

The [[Jordan River]] is the only major water source flowing into the Dead Sea, although there are small perennial springs under and around the Dead Sea, forming pools and [[quicksand]] pits along the edges.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tommyimages.com/Stock_Photos/Middle_East/Israel/Dead_Sea/index.html|title=Springs and quicksand at the Dead Sea|accessdate=August 27, 2008}}</ref> There are no outlet streams.

Rainfall is scarcely {{convert|100|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year in the northern part of the Dead Sea and barely {{convert|50|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the southern part.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exact-me.org/overview/p4144.htm|title=Dead Sea |publisher=Exact Me.org|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref> The Dead Sea zone's aridity is due to the [[rain shadow|rainshadow]] effect of the [[Judaean Mountains]]. The highlands east of the Dead Sea receive more rainfall than the Dead Sea itself.

To the west of the Dead Sea, the Judaean mountains rise less steeply and are much lower than the mountains to the east. Along the southwestern side of the lake is a {{convert|210|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} tall [[halite]] formation called "[[Mount Sodom]]".

==Natural history==
There are two contending hypotheses about the origin of the low elevation of the Dead Sea. The older hypothesis is that it lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the [[Red Sea Rift]], or even of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]] of [[East Africa|eastern Africa]]. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of a "step-over" discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating an extension of the crust with consequent subsidence.

Around 3.7 million years ago,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} what is now the valley of the Jordan River, Dead Sea, and the northern [[Arabah|Wadi Arabah]] was repeatedly inundated by waters from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The waters formed in a narrow, crooked bay, called by geologists the [[Sedom Lagoon]], which was connected to the sea through what is now the [[Jezreel Valley]]. The floods of the valley came and went depending on long-scale [[climate change]]. The Sedom Lagoon<ref name=Stein>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsi.gov.il/_Uploads/4739SteinF.pdf|title=The limnological history of late Pleistocene – Holocene water bodies in the Dead Sea basin|author=Mordechai Stein}}</ref> deposited beds of salt that eventually became {{convert|2.5|km|2|abbr=on}} thick.

Approximately two million years ago,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} the land between the [[Rift valley|Rift Valley]] and the Mediterranean Sea rose to such an extent that the ocean could no longer flood the area. Thus, the long lagoon became a landlocked lake. The Sedom Lagoon extended at its maximum from the [[Sea of Galilee]] in the north to somewhere around {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} south of the current southern end of the Dead Sea, and the subsequent lakes obviously never surpassed this expanse. The [[Hula Valley|Hula Depression]] was never part of any of these water bodies due to its higher elevation and the high threshold of the [[Chorazin#Geomorphology|Korazim block]] separating it from the Sea of Galilee basin.<ref name="Springer Science & Business Media">{{cite book|author1=Uri Kafri|author2=Yoseph Yechieli|title=Groundwater Base Level Changes and Adjoining Hydrological Systems.|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3642139444|page=123}}</ref>

The first prehistoric lake to follow the Sedom Lagoon is named [[Lake Amora]], followed by [[Lake Lisan]] and finally by the Dead Sea.<ref name=Stein/> The water levels and salinity of these lakes have either risen or fallen as an effect of the tectonic dropping of the valley bottom, and due to climate variation. As the climate became more arid, Lake Lisan finally shrank and became saltier, leaving the Dead Sea as its last remainder.<ref name=Stein/><ref name="Springer Science & Business Media"/>
[[File:SaltCementedPebblesDeadSea.JPG|thumb|right|Pebbles cemented with [[halite]] on the western shore of the Dead Sea near Ein Gedi.]]

In [[prehistory|prehistoric times]], great amounts of sediment collected on the floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the [[Lisan Peninsula]] and [[Mount Sodom]] (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see [[salt dome]]).

From 70,000 to 12,000 years ago, the lake's level was {{convert|100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|250|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} higher than its current level. This lake, Lake Lisan, fluctuated dramatically, rising to its highest level around 26,000 years ago, indicating a very wet climate in the [[Near East]].<ref name="SocietySociety1971">{{cite book|author1=Geochemical Society|author2=Meteoritical Society|title=Geochimica et cosmochimica acta|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3LccAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=April 12, 2011|year=1971|publisher=Pergamon Press.}}</ref> Around 10,000 years ago, the lake's level dropped dramatically, probably to even lower than today's. During the last several thousand years, the lake has fluctuated approximately {{convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}, with some significant drops and rises. Current theories as to the cause of this dramatic drop in levels rule out [[volcano|volcanic activity]]; therefore, it may have been a seismic event.

==Climate==
The Dead Sea's climate offers year-round sunny skies and dry air. It has less than {{convert|50|mm|in|0|}} mean annual rainfall and a summer average temperature between {{convert|32|and|39|C|F}}. Winter average temperatures range between {{convert|20|and|23|C|F}}. The region has weakened [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]], particularly the UVB (erythrogenic rays). Given the heavier [[atmospheric pressure]], the air has a slightly higher [[oxygen]] content (3.3% in summer to 4.8% in winter) as compared to oxygen density at sea level.<ref name=DSRC>{{cite web|title=Natural Resources|url=http://www.deadsea-health.org/new_html/general_main.html|work=Dead Sea Research Center|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.extremescience.com/dead-sea.htm|title=Lowest Elevation: Dead Sea |accessdate=May 22, 2007|work=Extreme Science}}</ref> Barometric pressures at the Dead Sea were measured between 796 and 799 mmHg and clinically compared with health effects at higher altitude.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kramer|first=MR|author2=Springer C |author3=Berkman N |author4=Glazer M |author5=Bublil M |author6=Bar-Yishay E |author7=Godfrey S |title=Rehabilitation of hypoxemic patients with COPD at low altitude at the Dead Sea, the lowest place on earth|journal=Chest|date=March 1998|volume=113|issue=3|pages=571–575|quote=PMID 9515826|url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/data/Journals/CHEST/21761/571.pdf|doi=10.1378/chest.113.3.571|pmid=9515826}}</ref> (This barometric measure is about 5% higher than sea level standard atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg, which is the global ocean mean or ATM.) The Dead Sea affects temperatures nearby because of the moderating effect a large body of water has on climate. During the winter, sea temperatures tend to be higher than land temperatures, and vice versa during the summer months. This is the result of the water's mass and [[specific heat capacity]]. On average, there are 192 days above 30C (86F) annually.<ref>{{cite web|title=Climatological Averages for Dead Sea|url=http://www.ims.gov.il/IMS/CLIMATE|publisher=IMS|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref>

Until the winter of 1978–79, when a major mixing event took place,<ref name=overturn/> the Dead Sea was composed of two stratified layers of water that differed in temperature, density, age, and salinity. The topmost {{convert|35|m|ft|0|sp=us}} or so of the Dead Sea had an average salinity of 342 [[Concentration|parts per thousand]] (in 2002), and a temperature that swung between {{convert|19|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and {{convert|37|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Underneath a zone of transition, the lowest level of the Dead Sea had waters of a consistent {{convert|22|°C|°F|abbr=on}} temperature and complete saturation of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Since the water near the bottom is [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]], the salt precipitates out of solution onto the [[seabed|sea floor]].

Beginning in the 1960s, water inflow to the Dead Sea from the Jordan River was reduced as a result of large-scale irrigation and generally low rainfall. By 1975, the upper water layer was saltier than the lower layer. Nevertheless, the upper layer remained suspended above the lower layer because its waters were warmer and thus less dense. When the upper layer cooled so its density was greater than the lower layer, the waters mixed (1978–79). For the first time in centuries, the lake was a homogeneous body of water. Since then, [[stratification (water)|stratification]] has begun to redevelop.<ref name=overturn>{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/deadsea.htm|title=Dead Sea Canal |publisher=American.edu|date=1996-12-09|accessdate=May 5, 2009}}</ref>

The mineral content of the Dead Sea is very different from that of ocean water. The exact composition of the Dead Sea water varies mainly with season, depth and temperature. In the early 1980s, the concentration of ionic species (in g/kg) of Dead Sea surface water was Cl<sup>−</sup> (181.4), Br<sup>−</sup> (4.2), SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (0.4), HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> (0.2), Ca<sup>2+</sup> (14.1), Na<sup>+</sup> (32.5), K<sup>+</sup> (6.2) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (35.2). The total salinity was 276 g/kg.<ref>I. Steinhorn, ''In Situ Salt Precipitation at the Dead Sea'', Limnol. Oceanogr. 28(3),1983, 580-583</ref> These results show that the composition of the salt, as anhydrous chlorides on a weight percentage basis, was [[calcium chloride]] (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) 14.4%, [[potassium chloride]] (KCl) 4.4%, [[magnesium chloride]] (MgCl<sub>2</sub>) 50.8% and [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) 30.4%. In comparison, the salt in the water of most [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s is approximately 85% [[sodium chloride]]. The concentration of [[sulfate]] ions (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>) is very low, and the concentration of [[bromide]] ions (Br<sup>−</sup>) is the highest of all waters on Earth.

The salt concentration of the Dead Sea fluctuates around 31.5%. This is unusually high and results in a nominal density of 1.24&nbsp;kg/l. Anyone can easily float in the Dead Sea because of natural [[buoyancy]]. In this respect the Dead Sea is similar to the [[Great Salt Lake]] in [[Utah]] in the [[United States]].

An unusual feature of the Dead Sea is its discharge of [[asphalt]]. From deep [[Petroleum seep|seeps]], the Dead Sea constantly spits up small pebbles and blocks of the black substance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bein, A. and O.

==Putative therapies==
{{Medref|date=March 2015}}
The Dead Sea area has become a location for [[health]] [[research]] and potential treatment for several reasons. The mineral content of the water, the low content of [[pollen]]s and other [[allergen]]s in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the reduced [[ultraviolet]] component of [[Sunlight|solar radiation]], and the higher [[atmospheric pressure]] at this great depth each have specific [[health effect]]s. For example, persons experiencing reduced [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] function from [[disease]]s such as [[cystic fibrosis]] seem to benefit from the increased atmospheric pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadsea-health.org/new_html/diseases_respiratory.html |title=Asthma, Cystic Fibrosis, Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease|accessdate=May 22, 2007|work=Dead Sea Research Center}}</ref>

The region's climate and low elevation have made it a popular center for assessment of putative therapies:
*[[Climatotherapy]]: Treatment which exploits local climatic features such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[Sunlight|sunshine]], [[Atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] and special atmospheric constituents
*[[Light therapy|Heliotherapy]]: Treatment that exploits the biological effects of the [[sun]]'s radiation
*[[Thalassotherapy]]: Treatment that exploits bathing in Dead Sea [[water]]

== Fauna and flora ==
[[File:Dead Sea Sunrise.jpg|thumb|Dead Sea in the morning, seen from [[Masada]]]]

The sea is called "dead" because its high salinity prevents macroscopic aquatic organisms, such as fish and [[aquatic plant]]s, from living in it, though minuscule quantities of bacteria and microbial fungi are present.

In times of flood, the salt content of the Dead Sea can drop from its usual 35% to 30% or lower. The Dead Sea temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red. Researchers from [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] found the Dead Sea to be teeming with a type of [[alga]] called ''[[Dunaliella]]''. ''Dunaliella'' in turn nourished [[carotenoid]]-containing (red-[[pigment]]ed) [[halobacteria]], whose presence caused the color change. Since 1980, the Dead Sea basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers.

Recently a group of scientists from Be'er Sheva, Israel and Germany discovered fissures in the floor of the Dead Sea by scuba diving and observing the surface. These fissures allow fresh and brackish water to enter the Dead Sea. They sampled biofilms surrounding the fissures and discovered numerous species of bacteria and archaea.<ref>[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0038319 "Microbial and Chemical Characterization of Underwater Fresh Water Springs in the Dead Sea"]</ref>

Many animal species live in the mountains surrounding the Dead Sea. Hikers can see [[ibex]], [[hare]]s, [[hyrax]]es, [[jackal]]s, [[fox]]es, and even [[Arabian Leopard|leopard]]s. Hundreds of [[bird]] species inhabit the zone as well. Both Jordan and Israel have established [[nature reserve]]s around the Dead Sea.

The delta of the Jordan River was formerly a [[jungle]] of [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus]] and [[Arecaceae|palm tree]]s. The Jewish historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] described [[Jericho]] as "the most fertile spot in [[Judea]]". In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, [[sugarcane]],{{dubious|Fatimid and Crusader period only, unless proven differently.|date=October 2015}} [[henna]], and [[Ficus sycomorus|sycamore fig]] all made the lower Jordan valley wealthy. One of the most valuable products produced by Jericho was the [[Balsam of Mecca|sap]] of the [[Commiphora|balsam]] tree, which could be made into [[perfume]]. By the 19th century, Jericho's fertility had disappeared.{{dubious|Really? Why? Source? Jordan, other streams still there, population and water needs low.|date=October 2015}}

==Human settlement==
[[File:IRBY(1823) p507 SKETCH OF THE BACKWATER AT THE SOUTH END OF THE DEAD SEA.jpg|thumbnail|Settlements and ways at the south end of the Dead Sea (1823)]]
There are several small communities near the Dead Sea. These include [[Ein Gedi]], [[Neve Zohar]] and the [[Israeli settlement]]s in the [[Megilot Regional Council]]: [[Kalya]], [[Mitzpe Shalem]] and [[Avnat]]. There is a nature preserve at Ein Gedi, and several Dead Sea hotels are located on the southwest end at [[Ein Bokek]] near Neve Zohar. [[Highway 90 (Israel)|Highway 90]] runs north-south on the Israeli side for a total distance of {{convert|565|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Metula]] on the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] border in the north to its southern terminus at the [[Egypt]]ian border near the [[Red Sea]] port of [[Eilat]].

[[Potash City]] is a small community on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, and others including Suweima. [[Highway 65 (Jordan)|Highway 65]] runs north-south on the Jordanian side from Lebanon down past the Dead Sea to the port of [[Aqaba]].

==Human history==
[[File:MountSodom061607.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Sodom]], Israel, showing the so-called "[[Lot's Wife]]" pillar (made of [[halite]] like the rest of the mountain)]]

===Biblical period===
Dwelling in caves near the Dead Sea is recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as having taken place before the Israelites came to Canaan, and extensively at the time of King David.

Just north of the Dead Sea is [[Jericho]]. Somewhere, perhaps on the southeastern shore, would be the cities mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] which were said to have been destroyed in the time of [[Abraham]]: [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom and Gomorra]] (Genesis 18) and the three other "Cities of the Plain", [[Admah]], [[Zeboim (Hebrew Bible)|Zeboim]] and [[Zoara|Zoar]] (Deuteronomy 29:23). Zoar escaped destruction when Abraham's nephew [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] escaped to Zoar from Sodom (Genesis 19:21-22). Before the destruction, the Dead Sea was a valley full of natural [[tar pit]]s, which was called the '''vale of Siddim'''. King David was said to have hidden from [[Saul]] at Ein Gedi nearby.

In {{bibleverse-lb||Ezekiel|47:8-9|HE}} there is a specific prophecy that the sea will ".. be healed'' and ''made fresh", becoming a normal lake capable of supporting [[marine biology|marine life]]. A similar prophecy is stated in {{bibleverse-lb||Zechariah|14:8|HE}}, which says that "Living waters will go out from [[Jerusalem]], half of them to the eastern sea (likely the Dead Sea) and half to the western sea (the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]])..."

===Greek and Roman period===
[[Aristotle]] wrote about the remarkable waters. The [[Nabataeans|Nabatean]]s and others discovered the value of the globs of natural [[asphalt]] that constantly floated to the surface where they could be harvested with nets. The Egyptians were steady customers, as they used asphalt in the [[embalming]] process that created [[mummy|mummies]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] knew the Dead Sea as "''Palus Asphaltites''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordnik.com/words/Asphaltites |title=Asphaltites examples from ancient sources |publisher=Wordnik.com |accessdate=2013-08-22}}</ref> (Asphalt Lake).

King [[Herod the Great]] built or rebuilt several fortresses and palaces on the western bank of the Dead Sea. The most famous was [[Masada]], where in 70 CE a small group of Jewish [[Zealotry|zealots]] fled after the fall of the destruction of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Second Temple]]. The zealots survived until 73 CE, when a siege by the [[Roman legion|X Legion]] ended in the deaths by suicide of its 960 inhabitants. Another historically important fortress was [[Machaerus]] (מכוור), on the eastern bank, where, according to Josephus, [[John the Baptist]] was imprisoned by [[Herod Antipas]] and died.<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+18.119 18.119].</ref>

Also in Roman times, some [[Essenes]] settled on the Dead Sea's western shore; [[Pliny the Elder]] identifies their location with the words, "on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast ... [above] the town of Engeda" (''Natural History'', Bk 5.73); and it is therefore a hugely popular but contested hypothesis today, that same Essenes are identical with the settlers at [[Qumran]] and that "the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]" discovered during the 20th century in the nearby caves had been their own library.

[[Josephus]] identified the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient Biblical city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. However, he referred to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-1.htm|author=Josephus|title=[[Antiquities of the Jews]]|volume=1 |chapter=9}}</ref>

Various sects of Jews settled in caves overlooking the Dead Sea. The best known of these are the [[Essenes]] of [[Qumran]], who left an extensive library known as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].<ref>Found today in the [[Shrine of the Book]] at the Israel Museum of Jerusalem</ref> The town of [[Ein Gedi]], mentioned many times in the [[Mishna]], produced [[persimmon]] for the temple's fragrance and for export, using a secret recipe. "Sodomite salt" was an essential mineral for the temple's holy incense, but was said to be dangerous for home use and could cause blindness.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pardes.org.il/online_learning/weekly-talmud/2009-02-12.php|title= Sodomite salt could cause blindness}}</ref> The Roman camps surrounding [[Masada]] were built by Jewish slaves receiving water from the towns around the lake. These towns had drinking water from the Ein Feshcha springs and other sweetwater springs in the vicinity.<ref>A synagogue mosaic floor (circa 100 BCE) at Ein Gedi repeats the Mishna, portraying a curse on whoever reveals the town's secret persimmon recipe. Papyrus parchments found in caves near the Dead Sea document the vast amount of cultivated land in the area, especially persimmon trees, but also olive and date trees</ref>

===Byzantine period===
Intimately connected with the Judean wilderness to its northwest and west, the Dead Sea was a place of escape and refuge. The remoteness of the region attracted [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[monk]]s since the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era. Their [[monastery|monasteries]], such as [[Saint George]] in Wadi Kelt and [[Mar Saba]] in the [[Judaean Desert]], are places of [[pilgrimage]].

===Modern times===
[[File:World's lowest point (1971).jpg|thumb|World's lowest (dry) point, [[Jordan]], 1971]]Explorers and scientists arrived in the area to analyze the minerals and research the unique climate. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, hundreds of religious documents dated between 150 BCE and 70 CE were found in caves near the ancient settlement of [[Qumran]], about a mile inland from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea (presently in the West Bank). They became known and famous as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. A [[golf course]] named for [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] was built by the British at [[Kalya|Kalia]] on the northern shore.

The world's lowest roads, [[Highway 90 (Israel)|Highway 90]], run along the Israeli and West Bank shores of the Dead Sea, along with Highway 65 on the [[Jordan]]ian side, at {{convert|393|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level.

The first major hotels were built in nearby [[Arad, Israel|Arad]], and since the 1960s at the [[Neve Zohar]] resort complex. On the Jordanian side, six international franchises have opened [[seaside resort]] hotels near the [[King Hussein Bin Talal Convention Center]], along with resort apartments, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea.<ref name=Arabbiz>{{cite web|author=Staff writer|url= http://www.arabianbusiness.com/property/article/12982-jordanian-secret |title=Jordan's Dead Sea Comes to Life|publisher=[[Arabian Business]]|date=May 22, 2007|accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref>

==Industry and tourism==

===British mandate period===
In the early part of the 20th century, the Dead Sea began to attract interest from chemists who deduced the sea was a natural deposit of [[potash]] (potassium chloride) and [[bromine]]. The Palestine Potash Company was chartered in 1929, after its founder, Siberian Jewish engineer and pioneer of [[Lake Baikal]] exploitation, [[Moshe Novomeysky|Moses Novomeysky]], worked for the charter for over ten years. The first plant was on the north shore of the Dead Sea at [[Kalya]] and produced potash by solar evaporation of the brine. Employing Arabs and Jews, it was an island of peace in turbulent times.<ref name = "PM Nov 1930">{{cite journal| title = Wealth From The Dead Sea | journal = Popular Mechanics | volume = 54 | issue = 5 | pages = pp. 794–798 | publisher = Hearst Magazines | location = Chicago | date = November 1930| url = http://books.google.com/?id=uOQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA794}}</ref> The company quickly grew into the largest industrial site in the Middle East,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and in 1934 built a second plant on the southwest shore, in the [[Mount Sodom]] area, south of the [[Lisan Peninsula|'Lashon' region]] of the Dead Sea. Palestine Potash Company supplied half of Britain's potash during [[World War II]], but ultimately became a casualty of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].

===Israel===
Following the 1948 war, the Kalya plant in the [[West Bank]] was shut down, having been dismantled by the [[Palmach]] prior to their retreat. Operations restarted at the southern Sodom plant in 1952, and have continued to the present.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nlWRHnz7zSsC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4 The Dead Sea: The Lake and Its Setting, edited by Tina M. Niemi, Zvi Ben-Avraham, Joel Gat]</ref> The remnants of the Palestine Potash Company were nationalised and [[Dead Sea Works]] Ltd. was established in 1952 in its stead as a [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned company]] to extract potash and other minerals from the Dead Sea. In 1995, the company was privatized and it is currently owned by [[Israel Chemicals]].

From the Dead Sea brine, Israel produces (2001) 1.77 million [[ton]]s potash, 206,000 tons elemental bromine, 44,900 tons [[sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]], 25,000 tons [[magnesium]] metal, and sodium chloride.

Israeli companies generate around US$3 billion annually from the sale of Dead Sea minerals (primarily potash and bromine) and from other products, which are derived from Dead Sea Minerals.<ref name=WorldBank>World Bank, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Department, [http://hlrn.org/img/violation/Area+C+Report+Oct-13.pdf Area C and the Future of the Palestinian Economy], October 2, 2013</ref>

Israel has 15 hotels along the Dead Sea shore, generating total revenues of $291 million in 2012. Most Israeli hotels and resorts on the Dead Sea are on a six kilometer stretch of the southern shore.<ref name=WorldBank/>

===West Bank===
The Palestinian Dead Sea Coast is about 40 kilometers long. The Palestinian economy is unable to benefit from Dead Sea chemicals due to restricted access, permit issues and the uncertainties of the investment climate.<ref name=WorldBank/> The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea chemicals industry could generate $918m incremental value added per year, "almost equivalent to the contribution of the entire manufacturing sector of Palestinian territories today".<ref name=WorldBank/>

The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea tourism industry could generate $290 million of revenues per year and 2,900 jobs.<ref name=WorldBank/> However, Palestinians have been unable to obtain construction permits for tourism-related investments on the Dead Sea.<ref name=WorldBank/> According to the World Bank, Officials in the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities state that the only way to apply for such permits is through the Joint Committees established under the Oslo Agreement, but the relevant committee has not met with any degree of regularity since 2000.<ref name=WorldBank/>

===Jordan===
[[File:Kempinski Hotel Ishtar - Dead Sea - Jordan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kempinski Hotel, one of the many hotels on the [[Jordan]]ian shore]]
On the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, [[Arab Potash]] (APC), formed in 1956, produces 2.0 million tons of potash annually, as well as sodium chloride and bromine. The plant is located at Safi, South Aghwar Department, in the [[Karak Governorate]].

Jordanian Dead Sea mineral industries generate about $1.2 billion in sales (equivalent to 4 percent of Jordan’s GDP). The Jordanian shore has 9 hotels that are classified as either 5-star or 4-star.<ref>http://www.johotels.org/HotelDetails/tabid/150/language/en-US/Default.aspx?k=Dead+sea&location=Enter+Location</ref>

===Extraction===
Both companies use extensive salt [[pan evaporation|evaporation pan]]s that have essentially diked the entire southern end of the Dead Sea for the purpose of producing [[carnallite]], potassium magnesium chloride, which is then processed further to produce potassium chloride. The [[Salt evaporation pond|ponds]] are separated by a central dike that runs roughly north-south along the international border. The [[power station|power plant]] on the Israeli side allows production of magnesium metal (by a subsidiary, Dead Sea Magnesium Ltd.).

Due to the popularity of the sea's therapeutic and healing properties, several companies have also shown interest in the manufacturing and supplying of Dead Sea salts as raw materials for body and skin care products.

==Recession and environmental concerns==
[[File:Dead sea ecological disaster 1960 - 2007.gif|thumb|right|The dwindling water level of the Dead Sea]]
Since 1930, when its surface was {{convert|1050|km2|abbr=on}} and its level was {{convert|390|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level, the Dead Sea has been monitored continuously.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/water2.html#Dead|title=Overview of Middle East Water Resources_Dead Sea|date=December 1998|accessdate=31 May 2014|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref> In recent decades, the Dead Sea has been rapidly shrinking because of diversion of incoming water from the Jordan River to the north. The southern end is fed by a canal maintained by the Dead Sea Works, a company that converts the sea's raw materials. From a water surface of {{convert|395|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level in 1970<ref>{{cite book|author=C. Klein, A. Flohn|title=Contribution to the Knowledge in the Fluctuations of the Dead Sea Level|publisher=Theoretical and Applied Climatology|volume=38|pages=151&ndash;156, 1987}}</ref> it fell {{convert|22|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|418|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level in 2006, reaching a drop rate of {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} per year. As the water level decreases, the characteristics of the Sea and surrounding region may substantially change.

The Dead Sea level drop has been followed by a [[groundwater]] level drop, causing brines that used to occupy underground layers near the shoreline to be flushed out by freshwater. This is believed to be the cause of the recent appearance of large [[sinkhole]]s along the western shore—incoming freshwater dissolves salt layers, rapidly creating subsurface cavities that subsequently collapse to form these sinkholes.<ref>{{cite book|author=M.

[[File:Dead Sea Coastal Erosion March 2012.JPG|left|thumb|Gully in unconsolidated Dead Sea sediments exposed by recession of water levels. It was excavated by floods from the [[Judean Mountains]] in less than a year.]]

In May 2009 at the [[World Economic Forum]], Jordan announced its plans to construct the "Jordan National Red Sea Development Project" (JRSP). This is a plan to convey seawater from the [[Red Sea]] near Aqaba to the Dead Sea. Water would be desalinated along the route to provide fresh water to Jordan, with the brine discharge sent to the Dead Sea for replenishment. The early planning called for developer and financier selection to be completed by year's end, with detailed design to begin in early 2010, and water delivery by 2017. Israel expressed its support and will likely benefit from some of the water delivery to its Negev region. Some hydro-power will be collected near the Dead Sea from the dramatic change in elevation on the downhill side of the project.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

At a regional conference in July 2009, officials expressed increased concerns about the declining water levels. Some suggested various industrial activities around the Dead Sea might need to be reduced. Others advised a range of possible environmental measures to restore conditions. This might include increasing the volume of flow from the Jordan River to replenish the Dead Sea. Currently, only sewage and effluent from fish ponds run in the river's channel. Experts also asserted a need for strict conservation efforts. They also said agriculture should not be expanded, sustainable support capabilities should be incorporated into the area and pollution sources should be reduced.<ref>{{cite web|url= tp://www.jpost.com/Features/Article.aspx?id=148034|title=Back from the Dead?|author=Ehud Zion Waldoks|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=July 8, 2009}}</ref>

In October 2009, the Jordanians announced accelerated plans to extract around 300 million cubic meters of water per year from the Red Sea, desalinate it for use as fresh water and send the waste water to the Dead Sea by tunnel, despite concerns about inadequate time to assess the potential environmental impact. According to Jordan's minister for water, General Maysoun Zu'bi, this project could be considered as the first phase of the [[Red Sea–Dead Sea Canal|Red Sea–Dead Sea Project]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/6285055/Jordan-to-refill-shrinking-Dead-Sea-with-salt-water.html|title=Jordan to refill shrinking Dead Sea|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=10 October 2009}}</ref>

In December 2013, Israel, Jordan and the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] signed an agreement for laying a water pipeline to link the Red Sea with the Dead Sea.
