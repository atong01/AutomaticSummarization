{{infobox antimony}}
'''Antimony''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&nbsp;'''Sb''' (from {{lang-la|stibium}}) and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;51. A lustrous gray [[metalloid]], it is found in nature mainly as the [[sulfide mineral]] [[stibnite]] (Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used for cosmetics; metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as [[lead]] upon its discovery. It was first isolated by [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]] and described in 1540.

For some time, China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the [[Xikuangshan Mine]] in [[Hunan]]. The industrial methods to produce antimony are roasting and subsequent carbothermal reduction or direct reduction of stibnite with iron.

The largest applications for metallic antimony are as alloying material for lead and tin and for lead antimony plates in [[lead–acid battery|lead–acid batteries]]. Alloying lead and tin with antimony improves the properties of the alloys which are used in [[solder]]s, [[bullet]]s and [[plain bearing]]s. Antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine-containing [[fire retardant]]s found in many commercial and domestic products. An emerging application is the use of antimony in [[microelectronics]].

[[File:SbAs lattice.png|thumb|left|Crystal structure common to Sb, [[Stibarsen|AsSb]] and gray As]]
Antimony is in the [[nitrogen group]] (group 15) and has an [[electronegativity]] of 2.05. As expected from periodic trends, it is more electronegative than [[tin]] or [[bismuth]], and less electronegative than [[tellurium]] or [[arsenic]]. Antimony is stable in air at room temperature, but reacts with [[oxygen]] if heated, to form [[antimony trioxide]], Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.<ref name="wiberg_holleman"/>{{rp|758}}

Antimony is a silvery, lustrous gray metal that has a [[Mohs scale]] hardness of 3. Thus pure antimony is too soft to make hard objects; coins made of antimony were issued in China's [[Guizhou]] province in 1931, but because of their rapid wear, their minting was discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcoinpics.co.uk/metal.html|title=Metals Used in Coins and Medals|publisher=ukcoinpics.co.uk}}</ref> Antimony is resistant to attack by acids.

Four [[allotropy|allotropes]] of antimony are known: a stable metallic form and three metastable forms (explosive, black and yellow). Metallic antimony is a [[brittle]], silver-white shiny metal. When slowly cooled, molten antimony crystallizes in a [[trigonal]] cell, [[isomorphic]] with the gray allotrope of [[arsenic]]. A rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of [[antimony trichloride]]. When scratched with a sharp implement, an [[exothermic]] reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony is formed; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of vapor derived from metallic antimony. It has the same crystal structure as [[red phosphorus]] and black arsenic, it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously. At 100&nbsp;°C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of [[stibine]] (SbH<sub>3</sub>) at −90&nbsp;°C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this [[metastability|metastable]] allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.<ref name=kirk/><ref name="cww"/><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vVhpurkfeN4C&pg=PA50|pages=50–51|title=Chemistry of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth|isbn=978-0-7514-0389-3|author=Norman, Nicholas C|date=1998}}</ref>

Metallic antimony adopts a layered structure ([[space group]] R{{overline|3}}m No. 166) in which layers consist of fused ruffled six-membered rings. The nearest and next-nearest neighbors form an irregular octahedral complex, with the three atoms in the same double layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next. This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 6.697&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, but the weak bonding between the layers leads to the low hardness and brittleness of antimony.<ref name="wiberg_holleman"/>{{rp|758}}

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of antimony}}
Antimony has two stable [[isotope]]s: <sup>121</sup>Sb with a natural abundance of 57.36% and <sup>123</sup>Sb with a natural abundance of 42.64%. It also has 35 radioisotopes, of which the longest-lived is <sup>125</sup>Sb with a [[half-life]] of 2.75&nbsp;years. In addition, 29 [[nuclear isomer|metastable]] states have been characterized. The most stable of these is <sup>120m1</sup>Sb with a [[half-life]] of 5.76&nbsp;days. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable <sup>123</sup>Sb tend to decay by [[beta decay|β<sup>+</sup> decay]], and those that are heavier tend to decay by [[beta decay|β<sup>−</sup> decay]], with some exceptions.<ref name="NUBASE">{{cite journal|first=Audi|last=Georges|title=The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|pages=3–128|publisher=Atomic Mass Data Center|date=2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2=Bersillon|first2=O.|last3=Blachot|first3=J.|last4=Wapstra|first4=A.H.}}</ref>

===Occurrence===

[[File:Stibnite.jpg|thumb|right|Stibnite]]
The abundance of antimony in the [[Earth]]'s crust is estimated at 0.2 to 0.5 [[part per million|parts per million]], comparable to [[thallium]] at 0.5 parts per million and silver at 0.07 ppm.<ref name=usgs>{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/antimony/mcs-2011-antim.pdf|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|title=Mineral Commodity Summaries: Antimony|accessdate=23 January 2012|first=James F.|last=Carlin, Jr.}}</ref> Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in over 100 [[mineral]] species. Antimony is sometimes found natively (e.g. on [[Antimony Peak]]), but more frequently it is found in the sulfide [[stibnite]] (Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>) which is the predominant ore [[mineral]].<ref name=usgs/><!--Commercial forms of antimony are generally [[ingot]]s, broken pieces, [[granular material|granules]], and cast cake. Other forms are [[powder (substance)|powder]], shot, and [[single crystal]]s.{{fact|date=February 2012}}-->

{{see also|Category:Antimony compounds}}
Antimony compounds are often classified according to their oxidation state: Sb(III) and Sb(V).<ref name=Greenwood/> The +5 [[oxidation state]] is more stable.

===Halides===
Antimony forms two series of [[halide]]s: {{chem|SbX|3}} and {{chem|SbX|5}}. The trihalides [[antimony trifluoride|{{chem|SbF|3}}]], [[antimony trichloride|{{chem|SbCl|3}}]], [[antimony tribromide|{{chem|SbBr|3}}]], and [[antimony triiodide|{{chem|SbI|3}}]] are all molecular compounds having [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]].

The trifluoride [[antimony trifluoride|{{chem|SbF|3}}]] is prepared by the reaction of [[antimony trioxide|{{chem|Sb|2|O|3}}]] with [[hydrofluoric acid|HF]]:<ref name="wiberg_holleman"/>{{rp|761–762}}
:{{chem|Sb|2|O|3}} + 6 HF → 2 {{chem|SbF|3}} + 3 {{chem|H|2|O}}

It is [[Lewis acid]]ic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions {{chem|SbF|4|-}} and {{chem|SbF|5|2-}}. Molten [[antimony trifluoride|{{chem|SbF|3}}]] is a weak [[electrical conductor]]. The trichloride [[antimony trichloride|{{chem|SbCl|3}}]] is prepared by dissolving [[stibnite|{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}}]] in [[hydrochloric acid]]:
:{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}} + 6 HCl → 2 {{chem|SbCl|3}} + 3 {{chem|H|2|S}}

The pentahalides [[antimony pentafluoride|{{chem|SbF|5}}]] and [[antimony pentachloride|{{chem|SbCl|5}}]] have [[trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry]] in the gas phase, but in the liquid phase, [[antimony pentafluoride|{{chem|SbF|5}}]] is [[polymer]]ic, whereas [[antimony pentachloride|{{chem|SbCl|5}}]] is monomeric.<ref name="wiberg_holleman">{{cite book|title=Inorganic chemistry|author=Wiberg, Egon|author2=Wiberg, Nils|author3=Holleman, Arnold Frederick|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Academic Press|date=2001|isbn =0-12-352651-5}}</ref>{{rp|761}} [[Antimony pentafluoride|{{chem|SbF|5}}]] is a powerful Lewis acid used to make the superacid [[fluoroantimonic acid]] ("H<sub>2</sub>SbF<sub>7</sub>").

Oxyhalides are more common for antimony than arsenic and phosphorus. [[Antimony trioxide]] dissolves in concentrated acid to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as SbOCl and {{chem|(SbO)|2|SO|4}}.<ref name="wiberg_holleman"/>{{rp|764}}

===Antimonides, hydrides, and organoantimony compounds===
Compounds in this class generally are described as derivatives of Sb<sup>3−</sup>. Antimony forms [[antimonide]]s with metals, such as [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) and silver antimonide ({{chem|Ag|3|Sb}}).<ref name="wiberg_holleman"/>{{rp|760}} The alkali metal and zinc antimonides, such as Na<sub>3</sub>Sb and Zn<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>, are more reactive. Treating these antimonides with acid produces the unstable gas [[stibine]], {{chem|SbH|3}}:<ref>{{cite book|title=Outlines of Chemistry&nbsp;– A Textbook for College Students|author=Kahlenberg, Louis|publisher=READ BOOKS|date=2008|isbn=1-4097-6995-X|pages=324–325}}</ref>
:{{chem|Sb|3-}} + 3 {{chem|H|+}} → {{chem|SbH|3}}
Stibine can also be produced by treating {{chem|Sb|3+}} salts with hydride reagents such as [[sodium borohydride]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}Stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature. Because stibine has a positive [[heat of formation]], it is [[thermodynamic stability|thermodynamically unstable]] and thus antimony does not react with [[hydrogen]] directly.<ref name=Greenwood>Greenwood, N.

[[Organoantimony chemistry|Organoantimony compounds]] are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with [[Grignard reagent]]s.<ref>Elschenbroich, C. "Organometallics" (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. ISBN 3-527-29390-6</ref> A large variety of compounds are known with both Sb(III) and Sb(V) centers, including mixed chloro-organic derivatives, anions, and cations. Examples include Sb(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> ([[triphenylstibine]]), Sb<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub> (with an Sb-Sb bond), and cyclic [Sb(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)]<sub>n</sub>. Pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common, examples being Sb(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>5</sub> and several related halides.

==History==
[[File:antimony-symbol.svg|70px|thumb|alt=An unshaded circle surmounted by a cross.|One of the [[alchemical symbol]]s for antimony]]
[[Antimony(III) sulfide]], Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, was recognized in [[predynastic Egypt]] as an eye cosmetic ([[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]) as early as about [[4th millennium BC|3100 BC]], when the [[cosmetic palette]] was invented.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.2006.00279.x|title=Application of Lead Isotope Analysis to a Wide Range of Late Bronze Age Egyptian Materials|date=2006|last1=Shortland|first1=A.

An artifact, said to be part of a vase, made of antimony dating to about 3000 BC was found at [[Girsu|Telloh]], [[Chaldea]] (part of present-day [[Iraq]]), and a copper object plated with antimony dating between 2500 BC and 2200 BC has been found in [[Egypt]].<ref name=kirk/> Austen, at a lecture by Herbert Gladstone in 1892<ref name=moorey>{{cite book|last=Moorey|first=P.

Moorey was unconvinced the artifact was indeed a vase, mentioning that Selimkhanov, after his analysis of the Tello object (published in 1975), "attempted to relate the metal to Transcaucasian natural antimony" (i.e. native metal) and that "the antimony objects from Transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments."<ref name=moorey/> This weakens the evidence for a lost art "of rendering antimony malleable."<ref name=moorey/>

The Roman scholar [[Pliny the Elder]] described several ways of preparing antimony sulfide for medical purposes in his treatise [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']].<ref name=mellor>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BGE6AQAAIAAJ |chapter=Antimony|page=339|title=A comprehensive treatise on inorganic and theoretical chemistry|volume=9|author=Mellor, Joseph William|date=1964}}</ref> Pliny the Elder also made a distinction between "male" and "female" forms of antimony; the male form is probably the sulfide, while the female form, which is superior, heavier, and less friable, has been suspected to be native metallic antimony.<ref>Pliny, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural history]]'', 33.33; W.H.S. Jones, the [[Loeb Classical Library]] translator, supplies a note suggesting the identifications.</ref>

The Roman naturalist [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] mentioned that antimony sulfide could be roasted by heating by a current of air. It is thought that this produced metallic antimony.<ref name=mellor />

[[File:Specola, medaglione di vannoccio biringucci.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Italian metallurgist Vannoccio Biringuccio described the first procedure of how to isolate antimony.]]

The first description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the book ''[[De la pirotechnia]]'' of 1540 by [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]]; this predates the more famous 1556 book by [[Georg Agricola|Agricola]], ''[[De re metallica]]''. In this context Agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony. The book ''Currus Triumphalis Antimonii'' (The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony), describing the preparation of metallic antimony, was published in Germany in 1604. It was purported to have been written by a [[Benedictine]] monk, writing under the name [[Basilius Valentinus]], in the 15th century; if it were authentic, which it is not, it would predate Biringuccio.{{refn|Already in 1710 Wilhelm Gottlob Freiherr von [[Leibniz]], after careful inquiry, concluded the work was spurious, there was no monk named Basilius Valentinus, and the book's author was its ostensible editor, [[Johann Thölde]] ([[circa|c.]] 1565 – c. 1624). Professional historians now agree the ''Currus Triumphalis&nbsp;...'' was written after the middle of the 16th century and Thölde was likely its author.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Priesner, Claus|editor2=Figala, Karin|date=1998|title=Alchemie.

The metal antimony was known to German chemist [[Andreas Libavius]] in 1615 who obtained it by adding iron to a molten mixture of antimony sulfide, salt and potassium [[tartrate]]. This procedure produced antimony with a crystalline or starred surface.<ref name=mellor />

With the advent of challenges to [[phlogiston theory]] it was recognized that antimony is an element forming sulfides, oxides, and other compounds, as is the case with other metals.<ref name=mellor />

===Etymology===
The ancient words for antimony mostly have, as their chief meaning, [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]], the sulfide of antimony.

The Egyptians called antimony ''mśdmt''; in [[hieroglyphs]], the vowels are uncertain, but there is an Arabic tradition that the word is ميسديميت ''mesdemet''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Albright|first=W. F.|title=Notes on Egypto-Semitic Etymology.

<hiero>O34:D46-G17-F21:D4</hiero> and is used by [[Attica|Attic]] [[Tragedy|tragic]] [[poet]]s of the 5th century BC; later Greeks also used στἰβι ''stibi'', as did [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], writing in Latin, in the first century AD. Pliny also gives the names ''stimi'' {{sic}}, ''larbaris'', [[alabaster]], and the "very common" ''platyophthalmos'', "wide-eye" (from the effect of the cosmetic). Later Latin authors adapted the word to Latin as ''stibium''. The Arabic word for the substance, as opposed to the cosmetic, can appear as إثمد ''ithmid, athmoud, othmod'', or ''uthmod''. [[Littré]] suggests the first form, which is the earliest, derives from ''stimmida'', an accusative for ''stimmi''.<ref>[[LSJ]], ''s.v.'', vocalisation, spelling, and declension vary; Endlich, p. 28; Celsus, 6.6.6 ff; Pliny ''Natural History'' 33.33; Lewis and Short: ''Latin Dictionary''. ''OED'', s. "antimony".</ref>

The use of Sb as the standard chemical symbol for antimony is due to [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], who used this abbreviation of the name ''stibium''.<ref>In his long article on chemical reactions and nomenclature – Jöns Jacob Berzelius, "Essay on the cause of chemical proportions, and on some circumstances relating to them: together with a short and easy method of expressing them," ''Annals of Philosophy'', vol. 2, pages 443–454 (1813) and vol. 3, pages 51–62, 93–106, 244–255, 353–364 (1814) – on [http://books.google.com/books?id=E8M4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA52 page 52], Berzelius lists the symbol for antimony as "St"; however, starting on [http://books.google.com/books?id=E8M4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA248 page 248], Berzelius subsequently uses the symbol "Sb" for antimony.</ref> The medieval Latin form, from which the modern languages and late [[Byzantine Greek]] take their names for antimony, is ''antimonium''. The origin of this is uncertain; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation. The [[popular etymology]], from ἀντίμοναχός ''anti-monachos'' or French ''antimoine'', still has adherents; this would mean "monk-killer", and is explained by many early [[alchemist]]s being monks, and antimony being poisonous.<ref  name=etym>{{OEtymD|antimony}}</ref>

Another popular etymology is the hypothetical Greek word ἀντίμόνος ''antimonos'', "against aloneness", explained as "not found as metal", or "not found unalloyed".<ref name=kirk>"Antimony" in ''Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology'', 5th ed. 2004. ISBN 978-0-471-48494-3</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Fernando, Diana|title=Alchemy : an illustrated A to Z|date=1998|publisher=Blandford}} Fernando even derives it from the story of how "Basil Valentine" and his fellow monastic alchemists poisoned themselves by working with antimony; ''antimonium'' is found two centuries before his time.

===Top producers and production volumes===
The [[British Geological Survey]] (BGS) reported that in 2005, the People's Republic of China was the top producer of antimony with an approximately 84% world share, followed at a distance by South Africa, Bolivia and Tajikistan. [[Xikuangshan Mine]] in [[Hunan]] province has the largest deposits in China with an estimated deposit of 2.1 million metric tons.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(03)00187-6|title=Samarium–neodymium isotope systematics of hydrothermal calcites from the Xikuangshan antimony deposit (Hunan, China): the potential of calcite as a geochronometer|date=2003|last1=Peng|first1=J.|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=200|page=129|last2=Hu|first2=R.-Z.|last3=Burnard|first3=P.

However, Roskill Consulting estimates for primary production show that in 2010 [[China]] held a 76.75% share of world supply with 120,462 tonnes (90,000 tonnes of reported and 30,464 tonnes of un-reported production), followed by [[Russia]] (4.14% share, 6,500 tonnes of production), [[Myanmar]] (3.76% share, 5,897 tonnes), [[Canada]] (3.61% share, 5,660 tonnes), [[Tajikistan]] (3.42% share, 5,370 tonnes) and [[Bolivia]] (3.17% share, 4,980 tonnes).<ref name="Roskill">{{cite web|title=Study of the Antimony market by Roskill Consulting Group|url=http://www.ancoa.com.au/RoskillCRT.pdf}}</ref>

Roskill estimates that secondary production globally in 2010 was 39,540 tonnes.<ref name="Roskill"/>

Antimony was ranked first in a Risk List published by the [[British Geological Survey]] in the second half of 2011. The list provides an indication of the relative risk to the supply of chemical elements or element groups required to maintain the current British economy and lifestyle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Risk list 2012|publisher=British Geologocal Survey |url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/statistics/riskList.html}}</ref>

Also, antimony was identified as one of 12 critical raw materials for the EU in a report published in 2011, primarily due to the lack of supply outside China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Khrennikov|first=Ilya|title=Russian Antimony Miner for iPads Looks at IPO to Challenge China|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-05/russian-antimony-miner-for-ipads-looks-at-ipo-to-challenge-china.html|date=5 March 2012|work=Bloomberg}}</ref>

Reported production of antimony in China fell in 2010 and is unlikely to increase in the coming years, according to the Roskill report. No significant antimony deposits in China have been developed for about ten years, and the remaining economic reserves are being rapidly depleted.<ref name="Roskill"/>

===Production process===
The extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality of the ore and composition of the ore. Most antimony is mined as the sulfide; lower-grade ores are concentrated by [[froth flotation]], while higher-grade ores are heated to 500–600&nbsp;°C, the temperature at which stibnite melts and is separated from the [[gangue]] minerals. Antimony can be isolated from the crude antimony sulfide by a reduction with scrap iron:<ref name="of03"/>

:{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}} + 3 Fe → 2 Sb + 3 FeS

The sulfide is converted to an oxide and advantage is often taken of the volatility of antimony(III) oxide, which is recovered from roasting.<ref name=Ullmann/> This material is often used directly for the main applications, impurities being arsenic and sulfide.<ref name="Norm">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vVhpurkfeN4C&pg=PA45|page=45|title=Chemistry of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth|isbn=978-0-7514-0389-3|author=Norman, Nicholas C|date=1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2003.10.014|title=Antimony distribution and environmental mobility at an historic antimony smelter site, New Zealand|date=2004|last1=Wilson|first1=N.J.|last2=Craw|first2=D.|last3=Hunter|first3=K.|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=129|issue=2|pages=257–66|pmid=14987811}}</ref>
Isolating antimony from its oxide is performed by a carbothermal reduction:<ref name="of03"/><ref name="Norm"/>

The lower-grade ores are reduced in [[blast furnace]]s while the higher-grade ores are reduced in [[reverberatory furnace]]s.<ref name="of03"/>

==Applications==
About 60% of antimony is consumed in [[flame retardant]]s, and 20% is used in alloys for batteries, plain bearings and solders.<ref name="of03">{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-019/of03-019.pdf|first1=C.|last1=Butterman|first2=J.F.|last2= Carlin, Jr.|date=2003|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=Mineral Commodity Profiles: Antimony}}</ref>

===Flame retardants===
Antimony is mainly used as its [[antimony trioxide|trioxide]] in making [[flame retardant|flame-proofing compounds]]. It is nearly always used in combination with halogenated flame retardants, with the only exception being in halogen-containing polymers. The formation of halogenated antimony compounds is the cause for the flame retarding effect of antimony trioxide,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZG9VFSBnIPAC&pg=PA61|chapter=Antimony trioxide and Related Compounds|title=Flame retardants for plastics and textiles: Practical applications|isbn=978-3-446-41652-9|author1=Weil|first1=Edward D|last2=Levchik|first2=Sergei V|date=4 June 2009}}</ref><!--10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00067-8--> due to reaction of these compounds with hydrogen atoms and probably also with oxygen atoms and OH radicals, thus inhibiting fire.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0010-2180(73)90006-0|title=Mass spectrometric studies of flame inhibition: Analysis of antimony trihalides in flames|date=1973|last1=Hastie|first1=John W.|journal=Combustion and Flame|volume=21|page=49}}</ref> Markets for these flame-retardant applications include children's clothing, toys, aircraft and automobile seat covers.

===Alloys===
Antimony forms a highly useful [[alloy]] with [[lead]], increasing its hardness and mechanical strength. For most applications involving lead, varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying metal. In [[lead–acid batteries]], this addition improves the charging characteristics and reduces generation of unwanted hydrogen during charging.<ref name=Ullmann/><ref>{{cite book|chapter=Types of Alloys|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1HSsx9fPAKkC&pg=PA60|title=Battery Technology Handbook|first=Heinz Albert|last=Kiehne|publisher=CRC Press|date=2003|pages=60–61|isbn=978-0-8247-4249-2}}</ref> It is used in antifriction alloys (such as [[Babbitt metal]]),<ref>{{cite book|pages=46–47|isbn=978-1-4067-4671-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KR82QRlAgUwC&pg=PA46|title=Principles of Metallography|last=Williams|first=Robert S.|publisher=Read books|date=2007}}</ref> in [[bullet]]s and [[lead shot]], [[cable]] sheathing, [[type metal]] (for example, for [[Linotype machine|linotype]] printing machines<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=IYZezyEvZ78C&pg=PA399 |title=Inorganic Chemistry&nbsp;– A Textbooks for Colleges and Schools|first=E.

==Precautions==
The effects of antimony and its compounds on human and environmental health differ widely. The massive antimony metal does not affect human and environmental health. Inhalation of antimony trioxide (and similar poorly soluble Sb(III) dust particles such as antimony dust) is considered harmful and suspected of causing cancer. However, these effects are only observed with female rats and after long-term exposure to high dust concentrations. The effects are hypothesized to be attributed to inhalation of poorly soluble Sb particles leading to impaired lung clearance, lung overload, inflammation and ultimately tumour formation, not to exposure to antimony ions (OECD, 2008). Antimony chlorides are corrosive to skin. The effects of antimony are not comparable to arsenic; this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake, metabolism and excretion between arsenic and antimony.

For oral absorption, ICRP (1994) recommended values of 10% for tartar emetic and 1% for all other antimony compounds. Dermal absorption for metals is estimated at most 1% (HERAG, 2007). Inhalation absorption of antimony trioxide and other poorly soluble Sb(III) substances (such as antimony dust) is estimated at 6.8% (OECD, 2008), whereas a value <1% is derived for Sb(V) substances. Antimony(V) is not quantitatively reduced to antimony(III) in the cell, and both species exist simultaneously.

Antimony is mainly excreted from the human body via urine. Antimony and its compounds do not cause acute human health effects, with the exception of [[antimony potassium tartrate]] ("tartar emetic"), a prodrug that is intentionally used to treat [[leishmaniasis]] patients.

Prolonged skin contact with antimony dust may cause dermatitis. However, it was agreed at the European Union level that the skin rashes observed are not substance-specific, but most probably due to a physical blocking of sweat ducts (ECHA/PR/09/09, Helsinki, 6 July 2009). Antimony dust may also be explosive when dispersed in the air; when in a bulk solid it is not combustible.<ref name=":0">{{PGCH|0036}}</ref>

Antimony is incompatible with strong acids, halogenated acids, and oxidizers; when exposed to newly formed hydrogen it may form [[stibine]] (SbH<sub>3</sub>).<ref name=":0" />

The 8 hour time weighted average (TWA) is set at 0.5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] and by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) as a legal [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the workplace. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.5 mg/m<sup>3</sup> as an 8 hour TWA.<ref name=":0" /> Antimony compounds are used as catalysts for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) production. Some studies report minor antimony leaching from PET bottles into liquids, but levels are below drinking water guidelines. Antimony concentrations in fruit juice concentrates were somewhat higher (up to 44.7&nbsp;µg/L of antimony), but juices do not fall under the drinking water regulations.
