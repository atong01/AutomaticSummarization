Cross-stitch is often executed on easily countable evenweave fabric called<space/><link><target>aida cloth</target></link>. The stitcher counts the threads in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance. This form of cross-stitch is also called<space/><bold>counted cross-stitch</bold><space/>in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch. Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric (<bold>stamped cross-stitch</bold>); the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern.</paragraph><paragraph>Fabrics used in cross-stitch include aida, linen and mixed-content fabrics called 'evenweave'. All cross stitch fabrics are technically &quot;evenweave,&quot; it refers to the fact that the fabric is woven to make sure that there are the same number of threads in an inch both left to right and top to bottom (vertically and horizontally). Fabrics are categorized by threads per inch (referred to as 'count'), which can range from 11 to 40 count. Aida fabric has a lower count because it is made with two threads grouped together for ease of stitching. Cross stitch projects are worked from a gridded pattern and can be used on any count fabric, the count of the fabric determines the size of the finished stitching.</paragraph><heading level='2'>History</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Cross stitch detail.jpg</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>200px</part><part>Detail of floral border pattern in cotton.

These samples of her stitching could be referred back to over the years. Often, motifs and initials were stitched on household items to identify their owner, or simply to decorate the otherwise-plain cloth. In the United States, the earliest known cross-stitch sampler is currently housed at<space/><link><target>Pilgrim Hall</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Plymouth, Massachusetts</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.pilgrimhall.org/s_sampler.htm'>Loara Standish Sampler</link></extension><space/>The sampler was created by Loara Standish, daughter of Captain<space/><link><target>Myles Standish</target></link><space/>and pioneer of the Leviathan stitch, circa 1653.</paragraph><paragraph>Traditionally, cross-stitch was used to embellish items like household linens, tablecloths, dishcloths, and<space/><link><target>doilies</target></link><space/>(only a small portion of which would actually be embroidered, such as a border). Although there are many cross-stitchers who still employ it in this fashion, it is now increasingly popular to work the pattern on pieces of fabric and hang them on the wall for decoration. Cross stitch is also often used to make greeting cards, pillowtops, or as inserts for box tops, coasters and trivets.</paragraph><paragraph>Multicoloured, shaded, painting-like patterns as we know them today are a fairly modern development, deriving from similar shaded patterns of<space/><link><target>Berlin wool work</target></link><space/>of the mid-nineteenth century. Besides designs created expressly for cross stitch, there are software programs that convert a photograph or a fine art image into a chart suitable for stitching.

Different wool threads, metallic threads or other novelty threads are also used, sometimes for the whole work, but often for accents and embellishments. Hand-dyed cross stitch floss is created just as the name implies - it is dyed by hand. Because of this, there are variations in the amount of color throughout the thread. Some variations can be subtle, while some can be a huge contrast. Some also have more than one color per thread, which in the right project, creates amazing results.</paragraph><paragraph>Cross stitch is widely used in traditional Palestinian dressmaking.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Related stitches and forms of embroidery</heading><paragraph><link><target>Image:Ukrainian girls.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Ukrainian girls in traditional embroidered costumes</part></link><template><target>main</target><arg>cross stitches</arg></template>Other stitches are also often used in cross-stitch, among them , , and stitches and backstitches.</paragraph><paragraph>Cross-stitch is often used together with other stitches.
