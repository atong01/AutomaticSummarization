'''Botswana''' {{IPAc-en|b|ɒ|t|ˈ|s|w|ɑː|n|ə}}, officially the '''Republic of Botswana''' ({{lang-tn|Lefatshe la Botswana}}), is a [[landlocked country]] located in Southern Africa. The citizens refer to themselves as ''Batswana'' (singular: ''Motswana'').<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13040376| title=Botswana Profile}}</ref> Formerly the British [[protectorate]] of [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]], Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] on 30 September 1966.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://generalknowledgefacts.com/2013/09/bechuanaland-was-former-name-of-botswana.html| title=Bechuanaland was the former name of Botswana }}</ref> Since then, it has maintained a strong tradition of stable [[representative democracy]], with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic [[Elections in Botswana|elections]].

Botswana is topographically flat, with up to 70 percent of its territory being the [[Kalahari Desert]]. It is bordered by [[South Africa]] to the south and southeast, [[Namibia]] to the west and north, and [[Zimbabwe]] to the northeast. Its border with [[Zambia]] to the north near [[Kazungula, Zambia|Kazungula]] is poorly defined but at most is a few hundred metres long.<ref>

A mid-sized country of just over 2 million people, Botswana is one of the [[List of countries by population density|most sparsely populated]] nations in the world. Around 10 percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city, [[Gaborone]]. Formerly one of the poorest countries in the world—with a GDP per capita of about US$70 per year in the late 1960s—Botswana has since transformed itself into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, now boasting a GDP ([[purchasing power parity]]) per capita of about $18,825 per year as of 2015, which is one of the highest in Africa.<ref name="cia"/> Its high [[gross national income]] (by some estimates the fourth-largest in Africa) gives the country a modest standard of living and the highest [[Human Development Index]] of continental [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref>http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/GNI_PPP_of_countries.htm</ref>

Botswana is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Southern African Development Community]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and the [[United Nations]]. Despite its political stability and relative socioeconomic prosperity, the country is among the hardest hit by the [[HIV/AIDS in Botswana|HIV/AIDS epidemic]], with around a quarter of the population estimated to be infected.<ref>http://www.bedia.co.bw/article.php?id_mnu=50</ref>

==History==

{{Main|History of Botswana}}
In the 19th century, hostilities broke out between [[Tswana people|Tswana]] inhabitants of Botswana and [[Southern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] tribes who were making incursions into the territory from the north-east. Tensions also escalated with the Dutch [[Boer]] settlers from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to the east. After appeals by the Batswana leaders [[Khama III]], Bathoen and Sebele for assistance, the British Government put Bechuanaland under its protection on 31 March 1885.<ref>{{cite web|title=Botswana History|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/botswana/history|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> The northern territory remained under direct administration as the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] and is modern-day Botswana, while the southern territory became part of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa. The majority of [[Setswana]]-speaking people today live in South Africa.

When the [[Union of South Africa]] was formed in 1910 out of the main British colonies in the region, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, [[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]]) and [[Swaziland]] (the High Commission Territories) were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, their inhabitants began to be consulted by the UK, and although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred, the UK kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government in 1948, which instituted [[apartheid]], and South Africa's withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961, ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South Africa. An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils to represent both Africans and Europeans. Proclamations in 1934 regulated tribal rule and powers. A European-African advisory council was formed in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council.

In June 1964, the UK accepted proposals for a democratic self-government in Botswana. The seat of government was moved in 1965 from [[Mafeking|Mafikeng]] in South Africa, to the newly established [[Gaborone]], which sits near its border. The 1965 constitution led to the first general elections and to independence on 30 September 1966. [[Seretse Khama]], a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the [[Bamangwato|Ngwato]] chiefship, was elected as the first President, going on to be re-elected twice.

The presidency passed to the sitting Vice-President, [[Quett Masire]], who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998, and was succeeded by [[Festus Mogae]], who was elected in his own right in 1999 and re-elected in 2004. The presidency passed in 2008 to [[Ian Khama]] (son of the first President), who had been serving as Mogae's Vice-President since resigning his position in 1998 as Commander of the [[Botswana Defence Force]] to take up this civilian role.

A long-running dispute over the northern border with [[Namibia]]'s [[Caprivi Strip]] was the subject of a ruling by the [[International Court of Justice]] in December 1999, which ruled that [[Kasikili Island]] belongs to Botswana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southern-eagle.com/namibia/namgeninfo.html |title=Namibia General Information |publisher=Southern-eagle.com |date=21 March 1990 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref>

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of Botswana|Climate of Botswana}}
[[File:Flying-female-Lechwe.jpg|thumb|right|A [[lechwe]] in the [[Okavango Delta]]]]
At {{convert|581730|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} Botswana is the world's 48th-largest country. It is similar in size to [[Madagascar]] or [[France]]. It lies between latitudes [[17th parallel south|17°]] and [[27th parallel south|27°S]], and longitudes [[20th meridian east|20°]] and [[30th meridian east|30°E]].

The country is predominantly flat, tending toward gently rolling [[plateau|tableland]]. Botswana is dominated by the [[Kalahari Desert]], which covers up to 70% of its land surface. The [[Okavango Delta]], one of the world's largest inland [[River deltas|delta]]s, is in the northwest. The [[Makgadikgadi Pan]], a large [[salt pan (geology)|salt pan]], lies in the north.

The [[Limpopo River]] Basin, the major landform of all of southern Africa, lies partly in Botswana, with the basins of its tributaries, the [[Notwane River|Notwane]], [[Bonwapitse River|Bonwapitse]], [[Mahalapswe River|Mahalapswe]], [[Lotsane River|Lotsane]], [[Motloutse River|Motloutse]] and the [[Shashe River|Shashe]], located in the eastern part of the country. The Notwane provides water to the capital through the [[Gaborone Dam]]. The [[Cuando River|Chobe River]] lies to the north, providing a boundary between Botswana and Namibia's [[Zambezi Region]]. The Chobe River meets with the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] at a place called [[Kazungula]] (meaning a small [[sausage tree]], a point where [[Sebitwane]] and his [[Makololo|Makololo tribe]] crossed the Zambezi into Zambia).

===Ecology===

Botswana has diverse areas of wildlife habitat. In addition to the delta and desert areas, there are [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s, where [[blue wildebeest]], [[antelope]]s, and other mammals and birds are found. Northern Botswana has one of the few remaining large populations of the endangered [[African wild dog]]. [[Chobe National Park]], found in the [[Chobe District]], has the world's largest concentration of [[African elephant]]s. The park covers about {{convert|11000|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and supports about 350 species of birds.

The Chobe National Park and [[Moremi Game Reserve]] (in the Okavango Delta) are major tourist destinations. Other reserves include the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] located in the Kalahari desert in [[Ghanzi District]]; [[Makgadikgadi Pans National Park]] and [[Nxai Pan National Park]] are in [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]] in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]. Mashatu Game Reserve is privately owned: located where the [[Shashe River]] and Limpopo River meet in eastern Botswana. The other privately owned reserve is [[Mokolodi Nature Reserve]] near Gaborone. There are also specialised sanctuaries like the  Khama Rhino Sanctuary (for rhinoceros) and Makgadikgadi Sanctuary (for flamingos). They are both located in Central District.

===Environmental problems===

[[File:Baobob tree.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[baobab tree]] (''Adansonia digitata'')]]
Botswana faces two major [[Natural environment|environment]]al problems: drought and [[desertification]]. The desertification problems predominantly stem from the severe times of drought in the country. Three quarters of the country's human and animal populations depend on groundwater due to drought. [[Groundwater]] use through deep borehole drilling has somewhat eased the effects of drought. Surface water is scarce in Botswana and less than 5% of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by rainfall. In the remaining 95% of the country, raising livestock is the primary source of rural income. Approximately 71% of the country's land is used for communal [[grazing]], which has been a major cause of the desertification and the accelerating soil erosion of the country.<ref name="rala.is">{{cite web | publisher = Rala | location = IS | url = http://www.rala.is/rade/ralareport/darkoh.pdf | title = Darkoh | format = PDF}}</ref>

Since raising livestock has proven to be profitable for the people of Botswana, the land continues to be exploited. The animal populations have continued to dramatically increase. From 1966 to 1991 the livestock population has increased from 1.7 million to 5.5 million.<ref name = "rala.is" />{{rp |64}} Similarly, the human population has increased from 574,000 in 1971 to 1.5 million in 1995, nearly a 200% increase. "Over 50% of all households in Botswana own cattle, which is currently the largest single source of rural income." "Rangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use. Degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate change."<ref name = "rala.is" /> Environmentalists report that the [[Okavango Delta]] is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock.<ref name="afrol.com">{{cite web|url= http://www.afrol.com/articles/21794 |title= Botswana, US sign 'Debt-for-Nature' agreement |publisher=Afrol |accessdate = 2010-07-04}}</ref> The Okavango Delta is one of the major semi-forested wetlands in Botswana and one of the largest inland deltas in the world; it is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animals.<ref name="afrol.com"/>

The Department of Forestry and Range Resources has already begun to implement a project to reintroduce indigenous vegetation into communities in Kgalagadi South, Kweneng North and Boteti.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = UNCCD | url = http://www.unccd.int/iydd/documents/NOTCDIB.pdf | title = NOTCDIB | format = PDF}}</ref> Reintroduction of indigenous vegetation will help with the degradation of the land. The [[United States Government]] has also entered into an agreement with Botswana, giving them $7 million US dollars to reduce Botswana's debt by $8.3 million US dollars. The stipulation of the US reducing Botswana's debt is that Botswana will focus on more extensive [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of the land.<ref name="afrol.com"/>

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] claims that poverty is a major problem behind the overexploitation of resources, including land, in Botswana. To help change this the UNDP joined in with a project started in the southern community of Struizendam in Botswana. The purpose of the project is to draw from "indigenous knowledge and traditional land management systems". The leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community, to draw them in, in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty. The UNDP also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy development<ref name = "afrol1">{{cite web | url = http://www.afrol.com/articles/13090 | title = Botswana villages fighting desertification |publisher=Afrol |accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref>

==Politics and government==
[[File:BotswanaParliament.jpg|thumb|House of the Parliament of Botswana in [[Gaborone]]]]
{{Main|Politics of Botswana|Human rights in Botswana}}
{{See also|Foreign relations of Botswana}}
The [http://www.botswanaembassy.org/sites/default/files/documents/constitution_of_botswana.pdf Constitution of Botswana] is the [[rule of law]] which protects the citizens of Botswana and represents their rights. The politics of Botswana take place in a framework of a [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Botswana]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Parliament of Botswana]]. [[Botswana general election, 2014|The most recent election]], its eleventh, was held on 24 October 2014.

Since independence was declared, the party system has been dominated by the [[Botswana Democratic Party]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Botswana 1996 (rev. 2002)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Botswana_2002?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref> Botswana ranks 30th out of 167 states in the 2012 [[Democracy Index]].<ref name=index2012>{{cite web |url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/eiu2/images/Democracy-Index-2012.pdf |title=Democracy index 2012: Democracy at a standstill |publisher=Economist Intelligence Unit |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> According to [[Transparency International]], Botswana is the least corrupt country in Africa and ranks close to Portugal and South Korea.<ref>Transparency International [http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table 2008 Corruption Perception Index 2008].

===Foreign relations and military===

{{Main|Botswana Defence Force}}
[[File:Welcome to Botswana, signs.jpg|thumb|Signs at the Botswana-[[Zimbabwe]] border, 2010]]
At the time of independence, Botswana had no armed forces. It was only after the [[Rhodesia]]n and [[South African Army|South African]] militaries struck respectively against the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] and [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-20/news/mn-6620_1_african-national-congress | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Michael | last=Parks | title=S.

The BDF has approximately 12,000 members.

Following political changes in South Africa and the region, the BDF's missions have increasingly focused on prevention of [[poaching]], [[Emergency management|preparing for disasters]], and foreign [[peacekeeping]]. The United States has been the largest single foreign contributor to the development of the BDF, and a large segment of its officer corps have received U.S. training. It is considered an apolitical and professional institution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The Botswana government gave the United States permission to explore the possibility of establishing an Africa Command ([[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]]) base in the country.

The constitution prohibits the nationalisation of private property{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and provides for an independent judiciary, and the government respects this in practice. The legal system is sufficient to conduct secure commercial dealings, although a serious and growing backlog of cases prevents timely trials. The protection of intellectual property rights has improved significantly. Botswana is ranked second only to South Africa among sub-Saharan Africa countries in the 2014 International Property Rights Index.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://internationalpropertyrightsindex.org/countries?r=A&f=ipri&o=desc | title=The International Property Rights Index 2014: Africa by Score | publisher=The International Property Rights Index | accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref>

While generally open to foreign participation in its economy, Botswana reserves some sectors for citizens. Increased foreign investment plays a significant role in the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. Investment regulations are transparent, and bureaucratic procedures are streamlined and open, although somewhat slow. Investment returns such as profits and dividends, debt service, capital gains, returns on intellectual property, royalties, franchise's fees, and service fees can be repatriated without limits.

Botswana imports refined petroleum products and electricity from South Africa. There is some domestic production of electricity from coal.

==Demographics==

{{Main|Demographics of Botswana}}
[[File:Gathering food in the Okavango.jpg|thumb|A girl in the [[Okavango Delta]]]]

The [[Tswana people|Tswana]] are the majority ethnic group in Botswana, making up 79% of the population. The largest minority ethnic groups are the [[BaKalanga]], [[San people|San]] or [[AbaThwa]] also known as Basarwa. Other tribes are [[Bayei]], Bambukushu, [[Basubia]], Baherero and Bakgalagadi. In addition, there are small numbers of whites and Indians, both groups being roughly equally small in number. [[Indians in Botswana|Botswana's Indian]] population is made up of many Indian-Africans of several generations, from Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, South Africa, and so on, as well as first generation Indian immigrants. The white population speaks English and [[Afrikaans]] and makes up roughly 3% of the population.

Since 2000, because of deteriorating economic conditions in Zimbabwe, the number of [[Zimbabweans in Botswana]] has risen into the tens of thousands.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=National and international responses to the Zimbabwean exodus: implications for the refugee protection regime|publisher=Policy Development and Evaluation Service, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]|series=Research Papers|volume=175|last=Betts|first=Alexander|last2=Kaytaz|first2=Ezra|year=2009|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/retrieveattachments?openagent&shortid=MINE-7UL4R6&file=Full_Report.pdf}}</ref>

Fewer than 10,000 San are still living the traditional [[hunter-gatherer]] style of life.

===Language===

{{Main|Languages of Botswana|Setswana}}
The official language of Botswana is English although [[Tswana language|Setswana]] is widely spoken across the country. In Setswana, [[prefix]]es are more important than they are in many other languages. These prefixes include ''Bo'', which refers to the country, ''Ba'', which refers to the people, ''Mo'', which is one person, and ''Se'' which is the language. For example, the main ethnic group of Botswana is the Tswana people, hence the name Botswana for its country. The people as a whole are Batswana, one person is a Motswana, and the language they speak is Setswana.

Other languages spoken in Botswana include [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]] (sekalanga), [[Tshwa language|Sarwa]] (sesarwa), [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]], [[Taa language|!Xóõ]] and in some parts [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]].

{{Main|Culture of Botswana}}
[[File:Khutse Kalahari Lodge.jpg|thumb|A [[rondavel]] at a lodge near the Kalahari Desert.]]
Besides referring to the language of the dominant people groups in Botswana, Setswana is the adjective used to describe the rich cultural traditions of the Batswana&mdash;whether construed as members of the Tswana ethnic groups or of all citizens of Botswana.

The Scottish writer [[Alexander McCall Smith]] has written popular novels ([[No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]] series) about Botswana that entertain as well as inform the reader about the culture and customs of Botswana.

===Music===

{{Main|Music of Botswana}}
Botswana music is mostly vocal and performed sometimes without drums depending on the occasion; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Botswana folk music has instruments such as Setinkane (a Botswana version of miniature piano), Segankure/Segaba (a Botswana version of the Chinese instrument Erhu), Moropa (Meropa -plural) (a Botswana version of the many varieties of drums), phala (a Botswana version of a whistle used mostly during celebrations. It comes in variety of forms too). Botswana cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the strings or drums. the hands are used as musical instruments too, by either clapping them together or against phathisi (goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area; it is only used by men) to create music and rhythm. For the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music as it offers a variety in string which the Segaba instrument does not have. It is the outsider that found a home within the culture. The highlight of any celebration or event that shows especially happiness is the dancing. This differs by regime, age, gender and status in the group or if it's a tribal activity, status in the community. The national anthem is [[Fatshe leno la rona]]. Written and composed by Kgalemang Tumediso Motsete, it was adopted upon independence in 1966. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Visual arts===
[[File:San apron-Botswana.jpg|thumb|left|Textile art]]
{{Main|Art of Botswana}}
In the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of [[Etsha]] and [[Gumare]] are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from Botswana from [[Mokola Palm]] and local [[dye]]s. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through colour use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for commercial use.

Other notable artistic communities include [[Thamaga Pottery]] and [[Oodi Weavers]], both located in the south-eastern part of Botswana.

The oldest paintings from both Botswana and South Africa depict hunting, animal and human figures, and were made by the Khoisan (!Kung San/Bushmen) over twenty thousand years ago within the [[Kalahari]] desert.Recently the gov't of Botswana under the quite imposing figure of commander Khama has passed draconian and repressive laws that limit freedom of speech,freedom of association and quasi banning of alcohol.The ruling party which suffered a split just prior to elections also heavily trampled on workers rights by declaring nursing,teachers and eerily diamond sorters and polishers 'essential services"denying them the right to strike or any form of protest.Things it seems are not as rosy as you might be led to believe.

===Food===

[[File:Boerewors raw.jpg|thumb|[[Boerewors]]]]
{{Main|Cuisine of Botswana}}
The cuisine of Botswana is unique but also shares some characteristics with other cuisine of Southern Africa. Examples of Botswana food are [[Pap (food)|pap]], [[boerewors]], [[samp]], [[vetkoek]] and [[Imbrasia belina|mopani worms]]. A food unique to Botswana includes [[seswaa]], heavily [[Salted meat|salted]] mashed-up meat.

===Sports===

The card game [[Contract bridge|bridge]] has a strong following; it was first played in Botswana over 30 years ago and grew in popularity during the 1980s. Many British expatriate school teachers informally taught the game in Botswana's secondary schools. The Botswana Bridge Federation (BBF) was founded in 1988 and continues to organise tournaments.

==Education==

[[File:GABS-UB Courtyard.JPG|thumb|Buildings of the new and old Botswana university. Botswana's economic growth has had a positive impact on the university.]]
{{Main|Education in Botswana}}
In Botswana only a few hundred students graduate annualy due in part to poor accreditation and monitoring of tertiary education.Certain schools such as ABM University College which is owned by a corrupt minister,one MR Molefhi a politician and tenderpreneur offers pretty low quality courses which are designed to make students time and again controversially still exists today despite numerous former and current students coming forward to complain about this and many other issues.Youth unemplyment currently hovers above or below 50% despite the official claims of 20.5%.A rather pathetic social welfare program called Ipelegeng is the gov't flagship for employment.This program employs people temporarily(one month)for cutting trees and grass for a paltry sum of US$80.This money is hardly enough to sustain one person let alone a whole family.

==Health==

{{Main|Health in Botswana}}
The [http://www.moh.gov.bw/ Ministry of Health] in Botswana is responsible for overseeing the quality and distribution of [[healthcare]] throughout the country. [[Life expectancy]] at birth was 55 in 2009 according to the World Bank, having previously fallen from a peak of 64.1 in 1990 to a low of 49 in 2002.<ref>{{cite web | title=World Bank Botswana Data |url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/botswana | accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

Like elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, the [[economic impact of AIDS]] is considerable. Economic development spending was cut by 10% in 2002–3 as a result of recurring budget deficits and rising expenditure on healthcare services. [[HIV/AIDS in Botswana|Botswana has been hit]] very hard by the [[AIDS pandemic]]; in 2006 it was estimated that life expectancy at birth had dropped from 65 to 35 years.<ref name=Kallings>{{Cite journal|journal=J Intern Med| year = 2008 | volume = 263 | issue = 3 | pages = 218–43| title=The first postmodern pandemic: 25 years of HIV/AIDS|author=Kallings LO|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01910.x |pmid=18205765|url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01910.x}}</ref> However, after Botswana's 2011 census current life expectancy is estimated at 54.06 years.<ref name="cia"/> This revision shows the difficulty of accurately estimating the prevalence and impact of HIV/AIDS in the absence of hard numbers.

The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Botswana was estimated at 24% for adults in 2006,<ref>{{cite web | publisher = UNAIDS | url = http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/HIVData/GlobalReport/2006/ | title = Global Report | year = 2006}}</ref> giving Botswana the second highest infection rate in the world after nearby [[Swaziland]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avert.org/aidsbotswana.htm |title=HIV and Aids in Botswana | publisher = Avert (International Aids Charity) | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}</ref> In 2003, the government began a comprehensive program involving free or cheap generic [[Antiretroviral drug|anti-retroviral]] drugs as well as an information campaign designed to stop the spread of the virus. With a nationwide Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission program, Botswana has reduced HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children from about 40% to just 4%. Under the leadership of [[Festus Mogae]], the Government of Botswana solicited outside help in fighting HIV/AIDS and received early support from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], the Merck Foundation, and together formed the African Comprehensive HIV AIDS Partnership (ACHAP). Other early partners include the [[Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute]], of the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and the [[Botswana-UPenn Partnership]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, universal access to treatment – defined as 80% coverage or greater – has been achieved in Botswana.<ref>[http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2011/JC2216_WorldAIDSday_report_2011_en.pdf UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2011]. unaids.org</ref>

Potential reasons for Botswana's high HIV prevalence include concurrent sexual partnerships, transactional sex, cross-generational sex, and a significant number of people who travel outside of their local communities in pursuit of work. The [[polyamory|polyamorous]] nature of many sexual relationships further impacts the health situation, to the extent that it has given rise to a Love Vocabulary<ref>{{cite web | title=Exposing Botswana's Love Vocabulary | url=http://drshem.com/2011/06/16/exposing-botswana-love-vocabulary/ | work=Exposing Botswana's Love Vocabulary | accessdate=2011-06-22}}</ref> that is unique to the region.
