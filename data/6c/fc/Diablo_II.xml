Each act follows a more or less predetermined path, although there is some random-level generation in wilderness areas and dungeons between key cities. The player progresses through the story by completing a series of quests within each act, with optional quests providing additional rewards. In contrast to the first<space/><italics>Diablo</italics>, whose levels consisted of descending deeper and deeper into a<space/><link><target>Gothic architecture</target><part>Gothic-themed</part></link><space/>dungeon and Hell,<space/><italics>Diablo II</italics><template><target>'</target></template><space/>environments are much more varied. Act I, Rogue Encampment, is a simple palisade fort placed between plains and forests and is similar to the original<space/><italics>Diablo</italics>.

After reaching the summit of Arreat, the player gains access to the Worldstone Keep (whose architecture may be reminiscent of<space/><link><target>Angkor Wat</target></link><space/>and other<space/><link><target>Hindu</target></link><space/>temples).<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/quests/<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Arreat Summit - Quests<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Classic.battle.net<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2013-09-15</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In addition to the acts, there are three sequential difficulty levels: Normal, Nightmare, and Hell; completing the game (four Acts in the original or five Acts in the expansion) on a difficulty setting will open up the next level. On higher difficulties, monsters are stronger and may be resistant or immune to an element or physical damage, experience is penalized on dying, and the player's resistances are handicapped. However, better items are rewarded to players as they go through higher difficulties. A character retains all abilities and items between difficulties, and may return to a lower difficulty at any time.</paragraph><paragraph>Players can create a hardcore character. In normal mode, the player can resurrect their character if killed and resume playing, while a hardcore character has only one life. If killed, the character is permanently dead and unplayable, and all items and equipment on that character will be lost unless another friendly character has the &quot;loot&quot; icon checked.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Item system</heading><paragraph><italics>Diablo II</italics><space/>uses a system of randomly generated equipment similar to the<space/><link><target>Diablo (video game)#Items</target><part>original ''Diablo''</part></link>, but more complicated. Weapons and armor are divided into several quality levels: normal, magical, set, rare and unique. Normal quality items are base items with a fixed set of basic properties, such as attribute requirements, maximum durability, armor rating (on armor), block chance (on shields) and damage and attack speed (on weapons). Magical quality items have violet names and one or two randomly selected bonuses, such as bonuses attributes, skills or damage, indicated by a prefix or suffix. Rare quality items have randomly generated yellow names and 2 to 6 random properties. Unique quality items have fixed names in gold text, and instead of randomized properties, they have a set of 3 to 8 preselected properties. Green-named set items have fixed names and preselected properties like unique items, and belong to specific named sets of 2 to 6 items, as well as possessing additional properties known as set bonuses which are activated by equipping multiple items from the same set. These are themed on individuals, like Civerb's cudgel, shield and amulet each provide individual bonuses which are enhanced if two or more of the items are used to equip a character. It is unusual to encounter more than one item from a set in a single playthrough of the game, so collectors need to play the game many times to accumulate all items from a set. Additionally, items can possess sockets, which can be used to upgrade items by adding gems for various bonuses.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/</extension></paragraph><paragraph><italics>Diablo II</italics><space/>includes an item crafting system. An item known as the Horadric Cube is used to combine specific recipes of 2 or more items to create a new item. For example, 3 identical lower quality gems can be combined to create a single higher quality gem, and 3 small rejuvenation potions can be combined to create a single, more powerful rejuvenation potion.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/cube.shtml</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Character classes</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Diablo II characters.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>The five character classes in ''Diablo II'' as seen during the opening selection animation.

For Act II Mustafa Waiz, a percussionist, and Scott Petersen, the game's sound designer, worked on the drum samples. Waiz played on the dumbek, djembe, and finger cymbals which gave Matt Uelmen a base upon which to build tracks around.</paragraph><paragraph>The town theme from Act II, &quot;Toru&quot;, makes strong statement of departure from the world of Act I while also maintaining a thematic connection to what had come before. It is the first time in the series to be used some radically different elements than the guitars and choral sounds that dominate both the original Diablo and the opening quarter of<space/><italics>Diablo II</italics>. The foundation of the &quot;Toru&quot; piece is found in exciting dynamics of a Chinese wind gong. The instrument radically changes color from a steady mysterious drone to a harsh, fearsome noise, that gives exotic feeling and at the same time the pacing of the second town. In all sequences of Act II with deserts and valleys, Arabic percussion sounds dominate.</paragraph><paragraph>The composer was impressed by two of the Spectrasonics music libraries,<space/><italics>Symphony of Voices</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Heart of Asia.</italics><space/>He used samples from<space/><italics>Heart of Asia</italics><space/>in the<space/><italics>Harem</italics><space/>piece from Act II.
