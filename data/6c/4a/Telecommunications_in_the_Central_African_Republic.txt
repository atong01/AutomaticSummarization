In Bangui, UN-sponsored Radio ''Ndeke Luka'' ("bird of luck") provides balanced output, and rebroadcasts international news programming. Other radio and TV stations are run by the state-run ''Radiodiffusion-Television Centrafricaine'' and provide little coverage of the political opposition. There are about two dozen privately owned radio stations. Many, such as Radio Notre Dame, run by religious organisations.<ref name=BBCNews-CAR-2013/>

Starting 24 November 2011 ''La Radio et la Télévision nationale centrafricaine (TVCA)'' (Central African Radio (CAR) and National Television) are available via satellite. This move brought state-run national radio and television coverage to the entire country.<ref>[http://www.amb-rcaparis.org/site/information-numero-35?PHPSESSID=imds7m7koruld16pia02a1ssk3 "La Radio et la télévision centrafricaine enfin sur satellite!"] {{fr icon}}, La diplomatie de Centrafrique à Paris, CAR Embassy in Paris.

* Telephone system: The network consists principally of [[microwave radio relay]] and low-capacity, low-powered [[radiotelephone]] communication; limited telephone service with less than one fixed-line connection per 100 persons; spurred by the presence of multiple mobile-cellular service providers, cellular usage is increasing from a low base; most fixed-line and mobile-cellular telephone services are concentrated in the capital, [[Bangui]] (2011).<ref name=CIAWFB-CentralAfricanRepublic-2014/>

There are currently two GSM-900 mobile operators, Telecel CAR and [[NationLink Telecom]] RCA. A third network, Centrafrique Telecom Plus closed down in late 2005 after failing to attract more than 5,000 subscribers and failing to renew its license, in accordance with the then new [[François Bozizé|Bozize government]] policies.{{citation needed |date=January 2014}}

===Internet censorship and surveillance===

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors [[e-mail]] or Internet [[chat rooms]] without judicial oversight.<ref name=USDOS-CAR-2012>[http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&dlid=204102 "Central African Republic"], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 28 March 2013. Retrieved 23 January 2014.</ref>

Although the constitution and law provide for [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press|press]], authorities occasionally arrest journalists critical of the government and in some cases the government impedes individuals’ right to free speech. Imprisonment for [[defamation]] and [[censorship]] were abolished in 2005; however, journalists found guilty of [[libel]] or [[slander]] face fines of 100,000 to eight million CFA francs ($200 to $16,000 USD). The law provides for imprisonment and fines of as much as one million CFA francs ($2,000 USD) for journalists who use the media to incite disobedience among security forces or incite persons to violence, [[hate speech|hatred]], or discrimination. Similar fines and imprisonment of six months to two years may be imposed for the publication or broadcast of false or fabricated information that "would disturb the peace."<ref name=USDOS-CAR-2012/>
