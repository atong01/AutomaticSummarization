'''Eris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪər|ɪ|s|,_|ˈ|ɛr|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἔρις}}, "Strife")<ref>Of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb ὀρίνειν ''orinein'', "to raise, stir, excite," and the proper name Ἐρινύες ''[[Erinyes]]'' have been suggested; [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] has rejected those derivations and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin (''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 459).</ref> is the [[ancient Greek religion|Greek]] [[goddess]] of chaos, strife, and discord.  Her name is the equivalent of [[Latin]] '''Discordia''', which means "discord". Eris' Greek opposite is [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], whose Latin counterpart is [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]]. [[Homer]] equated her with the war-goddess [[Enyo]], whose Roman counterpart is [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]]. The [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] is named after the goddess, as is the religion [[Discordianism]].

==Characteristics in Greek mythology==

In [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' 11–24, two different goddesses named Eris are distinguished:

<blockquote><poem>So, after all, there was not one kind of Strife alone, but all over the earth there are two. As for the one, a man would praise her when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle, being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the deathless gods, men pay harsh Strife her honour due.

But the other is the elder daughter of dark Night ([[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]]), and [[Zeus|the son of Cronus who sits above]] and dwells in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], set her in the roots of the earth: and she is far kinder to men.  She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth.  This Strife is wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and craftsman with craftsman, and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel of minstrel.</poem></blockquote>

In Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' (226–232), Strife, the daughter of Night, is less kindly spoken of as she brings forth other personifications as her children:

<blockquote>But abhorred ''Eris'' ("Strife") bare painful ''Ponos'' ("Toil/Labor"), ''[[Lethe]]'' ("Forgetfulness") and ''[[Limos (mythology)|Limos]]'' ("Famine") and tearful ''[[Algos]]'' ("Pains/Sorrows"), ''[[Hysminai]]'' ("Fightings/Combats") also, ''[[Makhai]]'' ("Battles"), ''[[Phonoi]]'' ("Murders/Slaughterings"), ''[[Androctasiai]]'' ("Manslaughters"), ''[[Neikea]]'' ("Quarrels"), ''[[Pseudologoi]]'' ("Lies/Falsehoods"),  ''[[Amphilogiai]]'' ("Disputes"), ''[[Dysnomia (mythology)|Dysnomia]]'' ("Lawlessness") and ''[[Atë|Ate]]'' ("Ruin/Folly"), all of one nature, and ''[[Horkos]]'' ("Oath") who most troubles men upon earth when anyone wilfully swears a false oath.</blockquote>

The other Strife is presumably she who appears in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Book&nbsp;IV; equated with [[Enyo]] as sister of [[Ares]] and so presumably daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]]:

<blockquote>Strife whose wrath is relentless, she is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier. She also has [[Enyalius|a son whom she named Strife]].</blockquote>

Enyo is mentioned in Book 5, and Zeus sends Strife to rouse the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] in Book 11, of the same work.

The most famous tale of Eris recounts her initiating the [[Trojan War]] by causing the [[Judgement of Paris]]. The goddesses [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and [[Aphrodite]] had been invited along with the rest of [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]] to the forced wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], who would become the parents of [[Achilles]], but Eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations.

She therefore (as mentioned at the ''[[Cypria|Kypria]]'' according to Proclus as part of a plan hatched by Zeus and [[Themis]]) tossed into the party the [[Apple of Discord]], a golden [[apple (symbolism)|apple]] inscribed ''[[Kallisti|τῇ καλλίστῃ]]'' ({{lang-grc|''tē(i) kallistē(i)''}}) &nbsp;– "For the most beautiful one", or "To the Fairest One"&nbsp;– provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient.  The hapless [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], Prince of [[Troy]], was appointed to select the fairest by [[Zeus]]. The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris' decision, and also attempted to bribe him. [[Hera]] offered political power; [[Athena]] promised infinite wisdom; and [[Aphrodite]] tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], wife of [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta]].   While Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued.

In [[Nonnus]]' ''Dionysiaca'', 2.356, when [[Typhon]] prepares to battle with Zeus:

<blockquote>Eris ("Strife") was Typhon's escort in the melée, [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] ("Victory") led Zeus to battle.</blockquote>

Another story of Eris includes Hera, and the love of [[Polytekhnos]] and [[Aedon]]. They claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus were in love. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to rack discord upon them. Polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board, and Aedon a web she had been weaving. Eris said to them, "Whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant!" Aedon won. But Polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat, so he came to Khelidon, Aedon's sister, and raped her. He then disguised her as a slave, presenting her to Aedon. When Aedon discovered this was indeed her sister, she chopped up Polytekhnos' son and fed him to Polytekhnos. The gods were not pleased, so they turned them all into birds.

==Cultural influences==

===Discordianism===
{{Main|Discordianism}}
Eris has been adopted as the patron deity of the modern [[Discordianism|Discordian]] religion, which was begun in the late 1950s by [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Gregory Hill]] and [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] under the [[pen name]]s of "[[Malaclypse the Younger]]" and "Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst". The Discordian version of Eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent Graeco-Roman original. A quote from the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', the first holy book of Discordianism, attempts to clear this up:

{{quote|One day Mal-2 consulted his [[Pineal gland|Pineal Gland]] and asked Eris if She really created all of those terrible things. She told him that She had always liked the Old Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters. "They were," She added, "victims of indigestion, you know."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>}}

The story of Eris being snubbed and indirectly starting the Trojan War is recorded in the ''Principia'', and is referred to as the [[Discordianism#Original Snub|Original Snub]]. The ''Principia Discordia'' states that her parents may be as described in Greek legend, or that she may be the daughter of Void. She is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, whereas her sister [[Aneris]] (called the equivalent of [[Harmonia (Greek goddess)|Harmonia]] by the Mythics of Harmonia) is the goddess of Order and Non-Being. Their brother is [[Spirituality (Discordianism)|Spirituality]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/64.php |title=Page 57 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>

The concept of Eris as developed by the ''Principia Discordia'' is used and expanded upon in the [[science fiction]] work ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] (in which characters from ''Principia Discordia'' appear). In this work, Eris is a major character.<ref name="starship">[http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm "Robert Anton Wilson: Searching For Cosmic Intelligence" by Jeffrey Elliot] Interview discussing novel (URL accessed 21 February 2006)</ref>

The classic [[fairy tale]] ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' is partly inspired by Eris's role in the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. Like Eris, a malevolent [[fairy]] curses a princess after not being invited to the princess' [[infant baptism|christening]].<ref>{{cite book|accessdate=2007-11-06|title=A Handbook of Greek Mythology, Including Its Extension to Rome|author=H.

==In popular culture==
Eris serves as the main antagonist of the 2003 [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] animated film ''[[Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas]]'' where she is voiced by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]. She controls a vast army of creatures resembling constellations, three of which being [[Cetus]], a giant kraken, the [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], water spirits, and the Roc, a giant white bird. She appears a black-haired woman, with blue skin, with a short-sleeved dress, and tendrils of pink smoke for legs.

In the television show, ''[[Hercules: the Legendary Journeys]]'' and its spin-off ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', Discord is a recurring antagonist, Ares's henchwoman and pseudo [[gun moll]]. Strife was reimagined as a male character, also a flunky of Ares. 

In the Cartoon Network original series, ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', Eris (voiced by [[Rachael MacFarlane]]) is a recurring character, often seen with her Golden Apple of Discord. She is an antagonist, though she is represented in a comedic fashion.

In the video game, "[[Glory of Heracles]]", Eris is a playable character, although her story is changed a bit, with her being a child, then later being romantically involved with Prometheus.

Eris makes a cameo appearance in the fantasy novel ''[[The House of Hades]]'' as one of the several children of Nyx seen in the book.

In [[Kelly McCullough]]'s ''Ravirn'' series Eris is the pole power of chaos opposing Fate as the pole of order.

In [[The New 52]] relaunched [[Wonder Woman]] title, Eris was renamed "Strife". She is sarcastic, venomous, and a drinker, though both Diana and Hermes consider her mentality to be like that of a spiteful child.<ref>http://www.comicvine.com/eris/4005-15769/</ref>

In [[EVE Online]], Eris is the name of the Gallente Interdictor.

In the Light Novel ''[[Mushoku Tensei]]'' Eris is one of the main protagonists with a very short temper.

In the [[Freedom City]] setting, Eris is a high power level antagonist, particularly for player characters with supernatural ties.

{{Genealogy of the Olympians in Greek mythology}}
It should be noted that this genealogy of the Olympians is based primarily on the ancient work ''[[Theogony|The Theogony]]''; other sources include ''[[Iliad|The Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey|The Odyssey]]'', which contain different genealogies.
