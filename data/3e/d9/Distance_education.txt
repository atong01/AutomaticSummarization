[[Massive open online courses]] (MOOCs), aimed at large-scale interactive participation and open access via the web or other network technologies, are recent developments in distance education. A number of other terms (distributed learning, e-learning, online learning, etc.) are used roughly synonymously with distance education. However distance is the oldest and mostly commonly used term globally. It is also the broadest term and has the largest collection of related research articles.

==History==
One of the earliest attempts was advertised in 1728 in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' for "Caleb Philipps, Teacher of the new method of [[Short Hand]]," who sought students who wanted to learn through weekly mailed lessons.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holmberg |first1=Börje |title=The evolution, principles and practices of distance education |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YTtdNQAACAAJ | accessdate=23 January 2011 |series=Studien und Berichte der Arbeitsstelle Fernstudienforschung der Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg [ASF] |volume= 11 |year=2005 |publisher= Bibliotheks-und Informationssystem der Universitat Oldenburg |language=German |isbn=3-8142-0933-8 | page=13}}</ref>

[[File:Isaac Pitman.jpg|Sir [[Isaac Pitman]], pioneer of distance education in the 1840s.|thumb|200x200px]]
The first distance education course in the modern sense was provided by Sir [[Isaac Pitman]] in the 1840s, who taught a system of shorthand by mailing texts transcribed into shorthand on [[postcard]]s and receiving transcriptions from his students in return for correction. The element of student feedback was a crucial innovation of Pitman's system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/134/214|author=Alan Tait|publisher=The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning|title=Reflections on Student Support in Open and Distance Learning}}</ref> This scheme was made possible by the introduction of [[Uniform Penny Post|uniform postage rates]] across [[England]] in 1840.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MEax6VBfRscC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=distance learning... a magazine for leaders volume 2 number 6|author=IAP|page=18}}</ref>

This early beginning proved extremely successful, and the Phonographic Correspondence Society was founded three years later to establish these courses on a more formal basis. The Society paved the way for the later formation of Sir Isaac Pitman Colleges across the country.<ref name=MooreKearsley>{{cite book | last= Moore | first= Michael G. |author2=Greg Kearsley | year= 2005 | title= Distance Education: A Systems View | edition= 2nd | location= Belmont, CA | publisher= Wadsworth | isbn= 0-534-50688-7}}</ref>

===University correspondence courses===
The [[University of London]] was the first university to offer distance learning degrees, establishing its [[University of London External Programme|External Programme]] in 1858. The background to this innovation lay in the fact that the institution (later known as [[University College London]]) was [[non-denominational]] and, given the intense religious rivalries at the time, there was an outcry against the "godless" university. The issue soon boiled down to which institutions had [[Academic degree|degree]]-granting powers and which institutions did not.<ref name="Rothblatt Article">{{cite web|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0018-2680%28198824%2928%3A4%3C627%3ASADT%22H%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J |title=Sheldon Rothblatt, "Review: Supply and Demand: The Two Histories of English Education", '&#39;History of Education Quarterly'&#39;, Vol. 28, No. 4., Winter, 1988, pp. 627-644 |publisher=Links.jstor.org |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>

The compromise solution that emerged in 1836 was that the sole authority to conduct the examinations leading to degrees would be given to a new officially recognized entity called the "[[University of London]]", which would act as examining body for the [[University of London]] colleges, originally [[University College London]] and [[King's College London]], and award their students [[University of London]] degrees. As [[Sheldon Rothblatt]] states, "thus arose in nearly archetypal form the famous English distinction between [[teaching]] and [[exam]]ining, here embodied in separate institutions."<ref name="Rothblatt Article" /> With the state giving examining powers to a separate entity, the groundwork was laid for the creation of a programme within the new university that would both administer examinations and award qualifications to students taking instruction at another institution or pursuing a course of self-directed study.
[[File:Portrait of William Rainey Harper.jpg|thumb|200x200px|left|[[William Rainey Harper]], encouraged the development of external university courses at the new University of Chicago in the 1890s]]

Referred to as "People's University" by [[Charles Dickens]] because it provided access to [[higher education]] to students from less affluent backgrounds, the External Programme was chartered by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1858, making the University of London the first university to offer distance learning degrees to students.<ref name="External Programme History">{{cite web|url=http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/about_us/history.shtml |title="History", University of London External Programme Website |publisher=Londonexternal.ac.uk |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="Key Facts">{{cite web|url=http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/about_us/facts.shtml |title="Key Facts", University of London External Programme Website |publisher=Londonexternal.ac.uk |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> Enrolment increased steadily during the late 19th century, and its example was widely copied elsewhere.<ref name="Guardian Article">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardianabroad.co.uk/education/article/283 |author=Tatum Anderson |title=History lessons at the people's university| date=16 May 2007 |publisher=Guardianabroad.co.uk |accessdate=27 April 2010 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.guardianabroad.co.uk/education/article/283 | archivedate= 24 May 2007}}</ref> This program is now known as the University of London International Programme and includes Postgraduate, Undergraduate and Diploma degrees created by colleges such as the London School of Economics, Royal Holloway and Goldsmiths.<ref name = "Key Facts">{{Citation | contribution = Key Facts | publisher = University of London | title = External Programme | url = http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/about_us/facts.shtml}}</ref>

In the United States, [[William Rainey Harper]], first president of the [[University of Chicago]], developed the concept of extended education, whereby the research university had satellite colleges of education in the wider community. In 1892 he also encouraged the concept of correspondence school courses to further promote education, an idea that was put into practice by [[Columbia University]].<ref>{{cite book | last1= Levinson |first1= David L | title= Community colleges: a reference handbook | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=xrnPJcb7c54C | accessdate= 23 January 2011 | year= 2005 | publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn= 1-57607-766-7 |page=69}}</ref><ref>Von V.

''Handbook of Distance Education''  pp 21-36</ref> Enrollment in the largest private for-profit school based in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], the [[International Correspondence Schools]] grew explosively in the 1890s. Originally founded in 1888 to provide training for immigrant coal miners aiming to become state mine inspectors or foremen, it enrolled 2500 new students in 1894 and matriculated 72,000 new students in 1895. By 1906 total enrollments reached 900,000. The growth was due to sending out complete textbooks instead of single lessons, and the use of 1200 aggressive in-person salesmen.<ref>Joseph F.

{{blockquote|The regular technical school or college aims to educate a man broadly; our aim, on the contrary, is to educate him only along some particular line. The college demands that a student shall have certain educational qualifications to enter it, and that all students study for approximately the same length of time, and when they have finished their courses they are supposed to be qualified to enter any one of a number of branches in some particular profession. We, on the contrary, are aiming to make our courses fit the particular needs of the student who takes them.<ref>Clark, "The Correspondence School" (1906) p 329</ref>}}

Education was a high priority in the [[Progressive Era]], as American high schools and colleges expanded greatly. For men who were older or were too busy with family responsibilities, night schools were opened, such as the [[YMCA]] school in Boston that became [[Northeastern University]]. Outside the big cities, private correspondence schools offered a flexible, narrowly focused solution.<ref>Kett, ''Pursuit of Knowledge Under Difficulties,'' p 240</ref> Large corporations systematized their training programs for new employees. The National Association of Corporation Schools grew from 37 in 1913 to 146 in 1920.  Starting in the 1880s, private schools opened across the country which offered specialized technical training to anyone who enrolled, not just the employees of one company. Starting in Milwaukee in 1907, public schools began opening free vocational programs.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Millikan|title=A Union Against Unions: The Minneapolis Citizens Alliance and Its Fight Against Organized Labor, 1903-1947|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GseChEHIysAC&pg=PA60|year=2003|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|pages=60–61}}</ref>

Only a third of the American population lived in cities of 100,000 or more population In 1920; to reach the rest, correspondence techniques had to be adopted. Australia with its vast distances was especially active; the [[University of Queensland]] established its Department of Correspondence Studies in 1911.<ref>{{cite journal | last= White | first= M | year= 1982 | title = Distance education in Australian higher education&nbsp;— a history |journal= Distance Education |volume= 3 | issue= 2 | pages =255–278 | doi=10.1080/0158791820030207}}</ref> In South Africa, the [[University of South Africa]], formerly an examining and certification body, started to present distance education tuition in 1946.

===Open Universities===
[[Image:Walton Hall Pen&Ink.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walton Hall, Milton Keynes|Walton Hall]], renovated in 1970 to act as the headquarters of the newly established [[Open University]]. ''(Artist: Hilary French)'']]
The [[Open University]] in the United Kingdom was founded by the then serving [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government under the prime minister, [[Harold Wilson]], based on the vision of [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]]. Planning commenced in 1965 under the [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Minister of State for Education]], [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Jennie Lee]], who established a model for the OU as one of widening access to the highest standards of scholarship in higher education, and set up a planning committee consisting of university vice-chancellors, educationalists and television broadcasters, chaired by Sir Peter Venables. The British Broadcasting Corporation ([[BBC]]) Assistant Director of Engineering at the time, [[James Redmond (broadcaster)|James Redmond]], had obtained most of his qualifications at [[wikt:night school|night school]], and his natural enthusiasm for the project did much to overcome the technical difficulties of using television to broadcast teaching programmes.

The Open University revolutionized the scope of the correspondence program and helped to create a respectable learning alternative to the traditional form of education. It has been at the forefront of developing new technologies to improve the distance learning service <ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Distance Education|author=Bizhan Nasseh|url=http://www.seniornet.org/edu/art/history.html}}</ref> as well as undertaking research in other disciplines. [[Walter Perry]] was appointed the OU's first vice-chancellor in January 1969, and its foundation secretary was [[Anastasios Christodoulou]]. The election of the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government under the prime minister, [[Edward Heath]], in 1970 led to budget cuts under [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Iain Macleod]] (who had earlier called the idea of an Open University "blithering nonsense").<ref>[http://www.open.ac.uk/about/ou/p3.shtml "In 1969, when the idea of The Open University was announced, it was described as "blithering nonsense" by Iain Macleod MP."]</ref> However, the OU accepted its first 25,000 students in 1971, adopting a radical open admissions policy. At the time, the total student population of conventional universities in the United Kingdom was around 130,000.

[[Athabasca University]], Canada's Open University, was created in 1970 and followed a similar, though independently developed, pattern.<ref name="byrne">{{cite book | last =Byrne | first =T. C. | authorlink =Tim Byrne | title =Athabasca University The Evolution of Distance Education | publisher = University of Calgary Press | year=  1989 |location = Calgary, Alberta | page = 135| isbn = 0-919813-51-8}}</ref> The Open University inspired the creation of Spain's [[National University of Distance Education]] (1972)<ref>{{cite web |title= History of UNED (in Spanish) | location=ES | accessdate=26 January 2012 | url= http://portal.uned.es/portal/page?_pageid=93,499271,93_20500119&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL }}</ref> and Germany's [[FernUniversität in Hagen]] (1974).<ref>{{cite web |title= Three Decades | url= http://www.fernuni-hagen.de/english/profile/3decades/learning.shtml | publisher=FernUniversität in Hage |location=UK | accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref> There are now many similar institutions around the world, often with the name "Open University" (in [[English language|English]] or in the local language).

All "open universities" use distance education technologies as delivery methodologies though some require attendance at local study centres or at regional "summer schools". Some open universities have grown to become 'mega-universities',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Daniel | first1 = Sir John S |title= Mega-Universities and Knowledge Media: Technology Strategies for Higher Education | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=Sy3nDKphDAkC | accessdate=23 January 2011 |year=1998 | publisher= Routledge | isbn= 0-7494-2634-9}}</ref> a term coined to denote institutions with more than 100,000 students.

=== Open Colleges ===
In 1976, Bernard Luskin launched Coastline Community College as a college beyond walls, combining computer assisted instruction with telecourses produced by KOCE TV, the Coast Community College District public television station. Coastline has been a landmark strategic success in helping to establish online distance learning using modern technology for learning.

==Technologies==
Although the expansion of the Internet blurs the boundaries, distance education technologies are divided into two modes of delivery: [[synchronous learning]] and [[asynchronous learning]].

In synchronous learning, all participants are "present" at the same time. In this regard, it resembles traditional classroom teaching methods despite the participants being located remotely. It requires a timetable to be organized. [[Web conferencing]], [[videoconferencing]], [[educational television]], [[instructional television]] are examples of synchronous technology, as are [[direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS), [[internet radio]], [[live streaming]], [[telephone]], and [[web-based VoIP]].<ref name="lever-duffy">{{cite book |last1=Lever-Duffy |first1=Judy |last2= McDonald |first2= Jean B |others= Ana A. Ciereszko, Al P. Mizell | title= Teaching and Learning with Technology | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=9wxKAAAAYAAJ | accessdate = 23 January 2011 | edition = 3rd |date=March 2007 | publisher=Allyn & Bacon | isbn=0-205-51191-0 | page=377}}</ref>
Web conferencing software such as Adobe Connect help to facilitate meetings in distance learning courses and usually contain additional interaction tools such as text chat, polls,hand raising, emoticons etc. These tools also support asynchronous participation by students being able to listen to recordings of synchronous sessions. Immersive environments (notably SecondLife) have also been used to enhance participant presence in distance education courses. Another form of synchronous learning that has been entering the classroom over the last couple of years is the use of robot proxies <ref>Brown, Robbie. (2013). A Swiveling Proxy That Will Even Wear a Tutu. ''New York Times.'' Retrieved from http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/education/for-homebound-students-a-robot-proxy-in-the-classroom.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0</ref> including those that allow sick students to attend classes.<ref>Elizabeth Regan. (2015). "Robot brings classroom to sick students'' Retrieved from http://www.norwichbulletin.com/article/20141109/NEWS/141109566?pagewanted=all&_r=0<nowiki/>''</ref>

In asynchronous learning, participants access course materials flexibly on their own schedules. Students are not required to be together at the same time. Mail correspondence, which is the oldest form of distance education, is an asynchronous delivery technology, as are [[message board]] forums, [[e-mail]], [[video]] and [[audio recording]]s, print materials, [[voicemail]], and [[fax]].<ref name="lever-duffy" />

The two methods can be combined. Many courses offered by both open universities and an increasing number of campus based institutions use periodic sessions of residential or day teaching to supplement the sessions delivered at a distance.<ref name="Burns">{{cite book |last1=Burns |first1=Mary | title= Distance Education for Teacher Training: Modes, Models and Methods | url= http://go.edc.org/07xd | accessdate = 10 September 2012}}</ref> This type of mixed distance and campus based education has recently come to called "[[blended learning]]" or less often "hybrid learning". Many open universities uses a blend of technologies and a blend of learning modalities (face-to-face, distance, and hybrid) all under the rubric of "distance learning."

Distance learning can also use interactive radio instruction (IRI), interactive audio instruction (IAI), online [[virtual world]]s, digital games, webinars, and webcasts, all of which are referred to as e-Learning.<ref name="Burns" /> Media psychology and media studies have evolved as research focii in the study of media effects. Each has grown into important academic areas with graduate degree programs now providing professional research, teaching and field staff to help build understanding of the behavioral implications of media. The first MA, PhD and EdD programs in Media Psychology and Media Studies were launched in 2002 by Bernard Luskin at Fielding Graduate University.

===Radio and television===
The very rapid spread of film in the 1920s and radio in the 1930s led to proposals to use it for distance education.<ref>Larry Cuban, ''Teachers and Machines: The Classroom Use of Technology Since 1920'' (1986) pp 11-18 [https://books.google.com/books?id=uQeEn1vEUSQC  online]</ref>  By 1938, at least 200 city school systems, 25 state boards of education, and many colleges and universities broadcast educational programs for the public schools.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tyson | first1 = Levering | year = 1936 | title = Ten Years of Educational Broadcasting | url = | journal = School and Society | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 225–31 }}</ref> One line of thought was to use radio as a master teacher.
:" Experts in given fields broadcast lessons for pupils within the many schoolrooms of the public school system, asking questions, suggesting readings, making assignments, and conducting tests. This mechanizes education and leaves the local teacher only the tasks of preparing for the broadcast and keeping order in the classroom."<ref>Lloyd Allen Cook, ''Community Backgrounds of Education: A Textbook and Educational Sociology'' (1938) pp 249-50</ref>
A typical setup came in Kentucky in 1948 when [[John Wilkinson Taylor (educator)|John Wilkinson Taylor]], president of the [[University of Louisville]], teamed up with the [[National Broadcasting Corporation]] to use radio as a medium for distance education, The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission endorsed the project and predicted that the "college-by-radio" would put "American education 25 years ahead." The University was owned by the city, and local residents would pay the low tuition rates, receive their study materials in the mail, and listen by radio to live classroom discussions that were held on campus.<ref>Dwayne D. Cox and William J. Morison, ''The University of Louisville'' (1999) pp 115-17</ref> [[Charles Wedemeyer]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] also promoted new methods. From 1964 to 1968, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] funded Wedemeyer's ''Articulated Instructional Media Project'' (AIM) which brought in a variety of communications technologies aimed at providing learning to an off-campus population.  The radio courses faded away in the 1950s.<ref>Cuban, ''Teachers and Machines: The Classroom Use of Technology Since 1920'' (1986)  pp 19-26</ref>  Many efforts to use television along the same lines proved unsuccessful, despite heavy funding by the [[Ford Foundation]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Christopher H.

===Internet===
{{Main|Virtual education}}The widespread use of computers and the [[internet]] have made distance learning easier and faster, and today [[virtual school]]s and [[Virtual university|virtual universities]] deliver full curricula online.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Gold|first1 = Larry|last2 = Maitland|first2 = Christine|editor1-first = Ronald A.|editor1-last = Phipps|editor2-first = Jamie P.|editor2-last = Merisotis|title = What's the difference?

However, many of the techniques developed and lessons learned with earlier media are used in Internet delivery.

In 1996 [[Jones International University]] was launched by Glenn Jones, CEO and Bernard Luskin, Chancellor as the first fully online university [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by a regional accrediting association in the US.<ref>{{cite web |title = Accreditation|url = http://www.jiu.edu/about-jiu/accreditation|publisher = Jones International University|location = US|accessdate = 23 January 2011}}</ref>

[[New York University]], for example, offers [[online degree]]s in engineering and management-related fields through [[NYU-ePoly]].  Levels of accreditation vary: widely respected universities such as Stanford University and Harvard now deliver online courses—but other online schools receive little outside oversight, and some are actually fraudulent, i.e., [[diploma mill]]s. In the US, the [[Distance Education Accrediting Commission]] (DEAC) specializes in the accreditation of distance education institutions.<ref>{{Citation |url = http://www.deac.org/accred.html|title = Accreditation|publisher = DEAC}}</ref>

Distance education has a long history, but its popularity and use has grown exponentially as more advanced technology has become available. By 2008, online learning programs were available in the [[United States]] in 44 states at the K-12 level.<ref>Olszewski-Kubilius, Paula; Corwith, Susan. "Distance Education: Where It Started and Where It Stands for Gifted Children and Their Educators." Gifted Child Today, v. 34 issue 3, 2011, p. 16-24,.</ref>

[[Internet forum]]s, online [[discussion group]] and [[online learning community]] can contribute to an efficacious distance education experience. Research shows that '''[[socialization]]''' plays an important role in some forms of distance education.<ref name="SRE4(13)2">{{Cite journal

== Paced and self paced models ==
Distance education can be delivered in a paced format similar to traditional campus based models in which learners commence and complete a course at the same time. Paced delivery is currently the most common mode of distance education delivery. Alternatively, some institutions offer self-paced programs that allow for continuous enrolment and the length of time to complete the course is set by the learner's time, skill and commitment levels. Paced courses may be offered in either synchronus mode, but self-paced courses are almost always offered asynchronously. Each delivery model offers both advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers and institutions.

Paced models are a familiar mode as they are used almost exclusively in campus based schools. Institutes that offer both distance and campus programs usually use paced models as teacher workload, student semester planning, tuition deadlines, exam schedules and other administrative details can be synchronized with campus delivery.  Student familiarity and the pressure of deadlines encourages students to readily adapt to and usually succeed in paced models. However, student freedom is sacrificed as a common pace is often too fast for some students and too slow for others. In addition life events, professional or family responsibilities can interfere with a students capability to complete tasks to an external schedule. Finally, paced models allows students to readily form communities of inquiry<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://coi.athabascau.ca|title = Community of Inquiry site|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Athabasca University|last = |first = }}</ref> and to engage in collaborative work.

Self-paced courses maximize student freedom, as not only can students commence studies on any date, but they can complete a course in as little time as a few weeks or up to a year or longer. Students often enrol in self-paced study when they are under pressure to complete programs, have not been able to complete a scheduled course, need additional courses or have pressure which precludes regular study for any length of time. The self-paced nature of the programming, though is an unfamiliar model for many students and can lead to excessive procrastination resulting in course incompletion. Assessment of learning can also be challenging as exams can be written on any day, making it possible for students to share examination questions with resulting loss of academic integrity. Finally, it is extremely challenging to organize collaborative work activities, though some schools<ref>{{Cite book|title = Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media|last = Dron|first = Jon|publisher = AU Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Anderson|first2 = Terry}}</ref> are developing cooperative models based upon networked and connectivist pedagogies,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/890/1826|title = Three generations of distance education pedagogy.|last = Anderson|first = Terry|date = 2011|journal = International Review of Research on Distance and Open Learning 12(3)|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |last2 = Dron|first2 = Jon}}</ref> for use in self-paced programs.

==Benefits==
Distance learning can expand access to education and training for both general populace and businesses since its flexible scheduling structure lessens the effects of the many time-constraints imposed by personal responsibilities and commitments.<ref name=Oblinger>{{cite journal |last=Oblinger |first=Diana G. |year=2000 |title=The Nature and Purpose of Distance Education |journal=The Technology Source |volume= |series=|issue=March/April |page= |pages= |publisher=Michigan Virtual University |location=Michigan |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode=|oclc=|id=|url=http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |language= |format=|accessdate=23 January 2011 }}</ref> Devolving some activities off-site alleviates institutional capacity constraints arising from the traditional demand on institutional buildings and infrastructure.<ref name=Oblinger /> Furthermore, there is the potential for increased access to more experts in the field and to other students from diverse geographical, social, cultural, economic, and experiential backgrounds.<ref name="Maggio, L. M. 20012">Maggio, L. M., Chenail, R., & Todd, T. (2001). Teaching family therapy in an electronic age. Journal of Systemic Therapies, 20(1), 13-23.</ref>
As the population at large becomes more involved in [[lifelong learning]] beyond the normal schooling age, institutions can benefit financially, and adult learning business courses may be particularly lucrative.<ref name=Oblinger /> Distance education programs can act as a catalyst for institutional innovation<ref name=Oblinger /> and are at least as effective as face-to-face learning programs,<ref name="Jedlicka, J. S. 20022">Jedlicka, J. S., Brown, S. W., Bunch, A. E., & Jaffe, L. E. (2002). A comparison of distance education instructional methods in occupational therapy.

Distance education can also provide a broader method of communication within the realm of education. With the many tools and programs that technological advancements have to offer, communication appears to increase in distance education amongst students and their professors, as well as students and their classmates. The distance educational increase in communication, particularly communication amongst students and their classmates, is an improvement that has been made to provide distance education students with as many of the opportunities as possible as they would receive in in-person education. The improvement being made in distance education is growing in tandem with the constant technological advancements. Present-day online communication allows students to associate with accredited schools and programs throughout the world that are out of reach for in-person learning. By having the opportunity to be involved in global institutions via distance education, a diverse array of thought is presented to students through communication with their classmates. This is beneficial because students have the opportunity to "combine new opinions with their own, and develop a solid foundation for learning.".<ref name="calpoly1">{{cite journal |title=Educational Benefits of Online Learning|pages=1–6|year=1998|url=http://blackboardsupport.calpoly.edu/content/faculty/handouts/Ben_Online.pdf|publisher=CalPoly.edu |accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>  It has been shown through research that "as learners become aware of the variations in interpretation and construction of meaning among a range of people [they] construct an individual meaning," which can help students become knowledgeable of a wide array of viewpoints in education.<ref name="calpoly1"/> To increase the likelihood that students will build effective ties with one another during the course, instructors should use similar assignments for students across different locations to overcome the influence of co-location on relationship building.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yuan|first=Y. Connie|author2=Gay, Geri|title=Homophily of Network Ties and Bonding and Bridging Social Capital in Computer-Mediated Distributed Teams|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2006|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1062–1084|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00308.x}}</ref>

The high cost of education affects students in higher education, to which distance education may be an alternative in order to provide some relief. Distance education has been a more cost-effective form of learning, and can sometimes save students a significant amount of money as opposed to traditional education. Distance education may be able to help to save students a considerable amount financially by removing the cost of transportation.<ref name="worldwidelearn2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidelearn.com/education-articles/benefits-of-online-learning.htm |title=Benefits of Online Education |publisher=Worldwidelearn.com |accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> In addition, distance education may be able to save students from the economic burden of high-priced course textbooks. Many textbooks are now available as electronic textbooks, known as e-textbooks, which can offer digital textbooks for a reduced price in comparison to traditional textbooks. Also, the increasing improvements in technology have resulted in many school libraries having a partnership with digital publishers that offer course materials for free, which can help students significantly with educational costs.<ref name="worldwidelearn2013"/>

Within the class, students are able to learn in ways that traditional classrooms would not be able to provide. It is able to promote good learning experiences and therefore, allow students to obtain higher satisfaction with their online learning.<ref name=Kirtman>{{cite journal|last=Kirtman|first=Lisa|title=Online Versus In-Class Courses: An Examination of Differences in Learning Outcomes|journal=Issues in Teacher Education|date=Fall 2009|volume=18|issue=2|pages=103–115|url=http://www1.chapman.edu/ITE/public_html/ITEFall09/12kirtman.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref> For example, students can review their lessons more than once according to their need. Students can then manipulate the coursework to fit their learning by focusing more on their weaker topics while breezing through concepts that they already have or can easily grasp.<ref name=Kirtman  /> When course design and the learning environment are at their optimal conditions, distance education can lead students to higher satisfaction with their learning experiences.<ref name=Sinclaire>{{cite journal|last=Sinclaire|first=Jollean K.|title=Student satisfaction with online learning: Lessons from organizational behavior|journal=Research in Higher Education|date=June 2011|volume=11|url=http://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/11825.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref> Studies have shown that high satisfaction correlates to increased learning.

Distance learning may enable students who are unable to attend a traditional school setting, due to [[disability]] or illness such as decreased mobility and immune system suppression, to get a good education.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Exploration of the Representation of Students with Disabilities in Distance Education|url=http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/winter144/woods_maiden_brandes144.html|accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> Children who are sick or are unable to attend classes are now able to attend them in “person” through the use of [[robot]] proxies.

Over the last few years more students are entering safely back into the classroom thanks to the help of robots.

Distance Learning may also offer a final opportunity for adolescences that are no longer permitted in the General Education population due to behavior disorders. Instead of these students having no other academic opportunities, they may continue their education from their homes and earn their diplomas, offering them another chance to be an integral part of society.

==Criticism==
Barriers to effective distance education include obstacles such as domestic distractions and unreliable technology,<ref>{{cite web|last=Östlund|first=Berit|title=Stress, disruption and community&nbsp;— Adult learners' experiences of obstacles and opportunities in distance education|url=http://www.eurodl.org/index.php?p=&sp=full&article=179|publisher=Department of Child and Youth Education, Special Education and Counselling, Umeå University|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref>  as well as students' program costs, adequate contact with teachers and support services, and a need for more experience.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jill M. |last=Galusha |title=Barriers to Learning in Distance Education |url=http://www.infrastruction.com/barriers.htm |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>

Some students attempt to participate in distance education without proper training of the tools needed to be successful in the program. Students must be provided with training on each tool that is used throughout the program. The lack of advanced technology skills can lead to an unsuccessful experience. Schools have a responsibility to adopt a proactive policy for managing technology barriers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stephens |first=D. |date=July 2007 |title=Quality issues in distance learning |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/whitepapers/quality-issues-distance-learning.pdf}}</ref>

The results of a study of Washington state community college students showed that distance learning students tended to drop out more often than their traditional counterparts due to difficulties in language, time management, and study skills.<ref>http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/online-hybrid-courses-washington.html?UID=872</ref>

Distance learning benefits may outweigh the disadvantages for students in such a technology driven society however before indulging into use of [[educational technology]] a few more disadvantages should be considered.
Some{{who|date=January 2014}} say a negative to distance education is the lack of direct face-to-face social interaction, however as more people become used to personal and social interaction online (for example dating, chat rooms, shopping, blogging etc.) it is becoming easier for learners to both project themselves and socialize with others.
Not all courses required to complete a degree may be offered online. Health care profession programs in particular, require some sort of patient interaction through field work before a student may graduate.<ref>http://www.distancelearningnet.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-distance-learning/</ref> Studies have also shown that students pursuing a medical professional graduate degree who are participating in distance education courses, favor face to face communication over professor-mediated chat rooms and/or independent studies. However, this is little to correlation between student performance when comparing the previous different distance learning strategies.<ref name="Jedlicka, J. S. 20022">Jedlicka, J. S., Brown, S. W., Bunch, A. E., & Jaffe, L. E. (2002). A comparison of distance education instructional methods in occupational therapy. Journal of Allied Health, 31(4), 247-251.</ref>

There is a theoretical problem about the application of traditional teaching methods to online courses because online courses may have no upper size limit. [[Daniel Barwick]] noted that there is no evidence that large class size is always worse or that small class size is always better, although a negative link has been established between certain types of instruction in large classes and learning outcomes; he argued that higher education has not made a sufficient effort to experiment with a variety of instructional methods to determine whether large class size is always negatively correlated with a reduction in learning outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barwick |first=Daniel W.|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/12/06/barwick |title=Views: Does Class Size Matter? |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref> Early proponents of Massive Open Online Courses ([[MOOC]])s saw them as just the type of experiment that Barwick had pointed out was lacking in higher education, although Barwick himself has never advocated for MOOCs.

There may also be institutional challenges. Distance learning is new enough that it may be a challenge to gain support for these programs in a traditional brick-and-mortar academic learning environment.<ref name="Stanton, S. 20012"/> Furthermore, it may be more difficult for the instructor to organize and plan a distance learning program,<ref name="Stebnicki, M. A. 20012"/> especially since many are new programs and their organizational needs are different from a traditional learning program.

Another benefit of distance education is one for developing countries. Judith Adler Hellman states, "In the face of the pressure on these countries to join the global information economy, distance education appears to provide the opportunity to train more people better and at lower cost."<ref name="Hellman, Judith Adler 2003">Hellman, Judith Adler. "The Riddle of Distance Education." Geneva. 1 June 2003.</ref>

Even though there are advantages in advancing industrial countries, there are still negative sides to distance education. Hellman states, "These include its cost and capital intensiveness, time constraints and other pressures on instructors, the isolation of students from instructors and their peers, instructors’ enormous difficulty in adequately evaluating students they never meet face-to-face, and drop-out rates far higher than in classroom-based courses."<ref name="Hellman, Judith Adler 2003"/>

A more complex challenge of distance education relates to cultural differences between the two sides. Distance programmes tend to be more diverse as they could go beyond the geographical borders of regions, countries, and continents, and cross the cultural borders that may exist with respect to race, gender, and religion. That requires a proper understanding and awareness of the norms, differences, preconceptions and potential conflicting issues. <ref name = "Nasiri et Mafakheri"> Nasiri, F. and Mafakheri, F. (2015).

==Educational technology==

The modern use of electronic [[educational technology]] (also called e-learning) facilitates distance learning and independent learning by the extensive use of [[Information and communications technology|Information and Communications Technology (ICT)]], replacing traditional content delivery by postal correspondence. Instruction can be synchronous and asynchronous online communication in an interactive learning environment or virtual communities, in lieu of a physical classroom. "The focus is shifted to the education transaction in the form of virtual community of learners sustainable across time."<ref>Garrison, D.R. (2011, 20 May). E-Learning in the 21st Century: A Framework for Research and Practice. New York: Taylor & Francis. ISBN 0-203-83876-9</ref>

One of the most significant issues encountered in the mainstream correspondence model of Distance Education is transactional distance. Transactional distance results from the lack of appropriate communication between learner and teacher. This gap has been observed to become wider if there is no communication between the learner and teacher and has direct implications over the learning process and future endeavors in Distance Education. Distance Education providers began to introduce various strategies, techniques, and procedures to increase the amount of interaction between learner and teacher. These measures e.g. more frequent face-to-face tutorials, increased use of Information and Communication Technologies including teleconferencing and the Internet, were designed to close the gap in transactional distance.<ref>Soekartawi, Haryono, A. & Librero, F. 2002.
