Paced delivery is currently the most common mode of distance education delivery. Alternatively, some institutions offer self-paced programs that allow for continuous enrolment and the length of time to complete the course is set by the learner's time, skill and commitment levels. Paced courses may be offered in either synchronus mode, but self-paced courses are almost always offered asynchronously. Each delivery model offers both advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers and institutions.</paragraph><paragraph>Paced models are a familiar mode as they are used almost exclusively in campus based schools. Institutes that offer both distance and campus programs usually use paced models as teacher workload, student semester planning, tuition deadlines, exam schedules and other administrative details can be synchronized with campus delivery. Student familiarity and the pressure of deadlines encourages students to readily adapt to and usually succeed in paced models. However, student freedom is sacrificed as a common pace is often too fast for some students and too slow for others. In addition life events, professional or family responsibilities can interfere with a students capability to complete tasks to an external schedule. Finally, paced models allows students to readily form communities of inquiry<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite web</target><arg name="url"><space/>https://coi.athabascau.ca</arg><arg name="title"><space/>Community of Inquiry site</arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/></arg><arg name="website"><space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Athabasca University</arg><arg name="last"><space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/></arg></template></extension><space/>and to engage in collaborative work.</paragraph><paragraph>Self-paced courses maximize student freedom, as not only can students commence studies on any date, but they can complete a course in as little time as a few weeks or up to a year or longer. Students often enrol in self-paced study when they are under pressure to complete programs, have not been able to complete a scheduled course, need additional courses or have pressure which precludes regular study for any length of time. The self-paced nature of the programming, though is an unfamiliar model for many students and can lead to excessive procrastination resulting in course incompletion. Assessment of learning can also be challenging as exams can be written on any day, making it possible for students to share examination questions with resulting loss of academic integrity. Finally, it is extremely challenging to organize collaborative work activities, though some schools<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite book</target><arg name="title"><space/>Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media</arg><arg name="last"><space/>Dron</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Jon</arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>AU Press</arg><arg name="year"><space/>2014</arg><arg name="isbn"><space/></arg><arg name="location"><space/></arg><arg name="pages"><space/></arg><arg name="last2"><space/>Anderson</arg><arg name="first2"><space/>Terry</arg></template></extension><space/>are developing cooperative models based upon networked and connectivist pedagogies,<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>Cite journal</target><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/890/1826</arg><arg name="title"><space/>Three generations of distance education pedagogy.</arg><arg name="last"><space/>Anderson</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Terry</arg><arg name="date"><space/>2011</arg><arg name="journal"><space/>International Review of Research on Distance and Open Learning 12(3)</arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/></arg><arg name="doi"><space/></arg><arg name="pmid"><space/></arg><arg name="last2"><space/>Dron</arg><arg name="first2"><space/>Jon</arg></template></extension><space/>for use in self-paced programs.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Benefits</heading><paragraph>Distance learning can expand access to education and training for both general populace and businesses since its flexible scheduling structure lessens the effects of the many time-constraints imposed by personal responsibilities and commitments.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Oblinger"><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last">Oblinger<space/></arg><arg name="first">Diana G.<space/></arg><arg name="year">2000<space/></arg><arg name="title">The Nature and Purpose of Distance Education<space/></arg><arg name="journal">The Technology Source<space/></arg><arg name="volume"><space/></arg><arg name="series"></arg><arg name="issue">March/April<space/></arg><arg name="page"><space/></arg><arg name="pages"><space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Michigan Virtual University<space/></arg><arg name="location">Michigan<space/></arg><arg name="issn"><space/></arg><arg name="pmid"><space/></arg><arg name="pmc"><space/></arg><arg name="doi"><space/></arg><arg name="bibcode"></arg><arg name="oclc"></arg><arg name="id"></arg><arg name="url">http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/<space/></arg><arg name="language"><space/></arg><arg name="format"></arg><arg name="accessdate">23 January 2011<space/></arg></template></extension><space/>Devolving some activities off-site alleviates institutional capacity constraints arising from the traditional demand on institutional buildings and infrastructure.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Oblinger"></extension><space/>Furthermore, there is the potential for increased access to more experts in the field and to other students from diverse geographical, social, cultural, economic, and experiential backgrounds.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Maggio, L.

With the many tools and programs that technological advancements have to offer, communication appears to increase in distance education amongst students and their professors, as well as students and their classmates. The distance educational increase in communication, particularly communication amongst students and their classmates, is an improvement that has been made to provide distance education students with as many of the opportunities as possible as they would receive in in-person education. The improvement being made in distance education is growing in tandem with the constant technological advancements. Present-day online communication allows students to associate with accredited schools and programs throughout the world that are out of reach for in-person learning. By having the opportunity to be involved in global institutions via distance education, a diverse array of thought is presented to students through communication with their classmates.

Transactional distance results from the lack of appropriate communication between learner and teacher. This gap has been observed to become wider if there is no communication between the learner and teacher and has direct implications over the learning process and future endeavors in Distance Education. Distance Education providers began to introduce various strategies, techniques, and procedures to increase the amount of interaction between learner and teacher. These measures e.g. more frequent face-to-face tutorials, increased use of Information and Communication Technologies including teleconferencing and the Internet, were designed to close the gap in transactional distance.<extension extension_name='ref'>Soekartawi, Haryono, A. &amp; Librero, F. 2002.
