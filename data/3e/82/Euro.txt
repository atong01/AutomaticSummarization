==Administration==
[[File:European Central Bank - building under construction - Frankfurt - Germany - 13.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[European Central Bank|central bank]] has [[Seat of the European Central Bank|its seat]] in [[Frankfurt]] (Germany) and is in charge of the monetary policy of the [[Eurozone|euro area]].]]
{{Main|European Central Bank|Maastricht Treaty|Eurogroup}}

The euro is managed and administered by the [[Frankfurt]]-based [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) and the [[Eurosystem]] (composed of the [[central bank]]s of the eurozone countries). As an independent central bank, the ECB has sole authority to set [[monetary policy]]. The Eurosystem participates in the printing, minting and distribution of [[euro banknotes|notes]] and [[euro coins|coins]] in all member states, and the operation of the eurozone payment systems.

The 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]] obliges most EU member states to adopt the euro upon meeting certain monetary and budgetary [[Euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]], although not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Euro |publisher=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/index_en.htm |accessdate=29 January 2009}}</ref> while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.

==Issuing modalities for banknotes==
Since 5 January 2002, the national central banks (NCBs) and the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] have issued euro banknotes on a joint basis.<ref name="Scheller">The European Central Bank history, role and functions by Hanspeter K. Scheller Second Revised Edition 2006, ISBN 92-899-0022-9 (print) ISBN 92-899-0027-X (online) page 103 at the pdf online version</ref> Euro banknotes do not show which central bank issued them. Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of the total value of banknotes issued by the Eurosystem.<ref name="Scheller"/> In practice, the ECB's banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of the euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares in the capital key of the ECB,<ref name="Scheller"/> calculated using national share of European Union population and national share of European Union GDP, equally weighted.<ref>

===Coins and banknotes===
{{Main|Euro coins|Euro banknotes}}

[[File:Euro coins and banknotes.jpg|left|thumb|Euro coins and banknotes of various denominations.]]

The euro is divided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cents]] (sometimes referred to as ''euro cents'', especially when distinguishing them from other currencies, and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins). In Community legislative acts the plural forms of ''euro'' and ''cent'' are spelled without the ''s'', notwithstanding normal English usage.<ref name="ec.europa.eu" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication6336_en.pdf |title=Spelling of the words "euro" and "cent" in official Community languages as used in Community Legislative acts |accessdate=26 November 2008 |author=European Commission |format=PDF}}</ref> Otherwise, normal English plurals are sometimes used,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/translation/writing/style_guides/english/style_guide_en.pdf |title=English Style Guide: A handbook for authors and translators in the European Commission |accessdate=16 November 2008 |author=European Commission Directorate-General for Translation |format=PDF}}; {{cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370303.htm |title=Interinstitutional style guide, 7.3.3. Rules for expressing monetary units |accessdate=16 November 2008 |author=European Union}}</ref> with many [[Linguistic issues concerning the euro|local variations]] such as ''centime'' in France.

All circulating coins have a ''common side'' showing the denomination or value, and a map in the background. Due to the [[Languages of the European Union|linguistic plurality of Europe]], the Latin alphabet version of ''euro'' is used (as opposed to the less common Greek or Cyrillic) and [[Arabic numerals]] (other text is used on national sides in national languages, but other text on the common side is avoided). For the denominations except the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, the map only showed the 15 member states which were members when the euro was introduced. Beginning in 2007 or 2008 (depending on the country) the old map is being replaced by a map of Europe also showing countries outside the Union like Norway. The 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, however, keep their old design, showing a geographical map of Europe with the 15 member states of 2002 raised somewhat above the rest of the map. All common sides were designed by [[Luc Luycx]]. The coins also have a ''national side'' showing an image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin. Euro coins from any member state may be freely used in any nation that has adopted the euro.

==History==
{{Main|History of the euro}}

===Introduction===
{{Euro adoption past|group="note"}}

The euro was established by the provisions in the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]]. To participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet [[Euro convergence criteria|strict criteria]], such as a budget [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] of less than three per cent of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than sixty per cent of GDP (both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction), low inflation, and [[interest]] rates close to the EU average. In the Maastricht Treaty, the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union which would result in the introduction of the euro.

Economists who helped create or contributed to the euro include [[Fred Arditti]], [[Neil Dowling]], [[Wim Duisenberg]], [[Robert Mundell]], [[Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa]] and [[Robert Tollison]].{{Citation needed|reason=What are the criteria for inclusion in this list|date=December 2009}} (For [[macroeconomic]] theory, see [[#Optimal currency area|below]].)

The name "euro" was officially adopted in [[Madrid]] on 16 December 1995.<ref name="madrid1995"/> Belgian [[Esperantist]] [[Germain Pirlot]], a former teacher of French and history is credited with naming the new currency by sending a letter to then [[President of the European Commission]], [[Jacques Santer]], suggesting the name "euro" on 4 August 1995.<ref>{{Cite news| title= Germain Pirlot 'uitvinder' van de euro | url= http://www.ikso.net/vikipedio/artikeleuro.jpg | publisher=De Zeewacht | language= Dutch | date=16 February 2007 | accessdate=21 May 2012 }}</ref>

Due to differences in national conventions for [[rounding]] and significant digits, all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out using the process of [[Triangulation (finance)|triangulation]] via the euro. The ''definitive'' values of one euro in terms of the [[exchange rate]]s at which the currency entered the euro are shown on the right.

The rates were determined by the [[Council of the European Union]],<ref group="note">by means of Council Regulation 2866/98 (EC) of 31 December 1998.</ref> based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU) would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; it was not a currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the [[pound sterling]]) that day.

The procedure used to fix the conversion rate between the [[Greek drachma]] and the euro was different, since the euro by then was already two years old. While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced, the conversion rate for the Greek drachma was fixed several months beforehand.<ref group="note">by Council Regulation 1478/2000 (EC) of 19 June 2000</ref>

The currency was introduced in non-physical form ([[traveller's cheque]]s, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as [[legal tender]] until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.

The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the [[Deutsche Mark|mark]] officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from several years to forever (the latter in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Latvia for banknotes and coins; also, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Slovakia will accept banknotes forever, but not coins). The earliest coins to become non-convertible were the Portuguese [[Portuguese escudo|escudos]], which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022.{{clear}}

[[File:Government surplus or deficit (EU-USA-UK).png|thumb|Budget deficit of the euro area compared to the United States and the UK.]]

Following the U.S. financial crisis in 2008, fears of a [[sovereign debt crisis]] developed in 2009 among fiscally conservative investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in [[2000s European sovereign debt crisis timeline|early 2010]].<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61F0W720100216 |title= Peripheral euro zone government bond spreads widen |agency=Reuters   |author=George Matlock |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16009099 | title=Acropolis now | work=The Economist | date= 29 April 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> This included eurozone members [[Economy of Greece|Greece]],<ref name=wsj>{{Cite news| author=Brian Blackstone, Tom Lauricella, and Neil Shah | title = Global Markets Shudder: Doubts About U.S. Economy and a Debt Crunch in Europe Jolt Hopes for a Recovery |  work=The Wall Street Journal | date = 5 February 2010 | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704041504575045743430262982.html |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> [[Economy of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Economy of Portugal|Portugal]] and also some EU countries outside the area.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.thenewamerican.com/index.php/world-mainmenu-26/europe-mainmenu-35/3274-greek-debt-crisis-worsens | title= Greek Debt Crisis Worsens | author=Bruce Walker |date=9 April 2010 |publisher=[[The New American]] |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Iceland, the country which experienced the largest [[2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis|crisis in 2008]] when its entire international banking system collapsed, has emerged less affected by the sovereign-debt crisis as the government was unable to bail the banks out.

According to the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] in 2011, "[I]f the [euro area] is treated as a single entity, its [economic and fiscal] position looks no worse and in some respects, rather better than that of the US or the UK" and the budget deficit for the euro area as a whole is much lower and the euro area's government debt/GDP ratio of 86% in 2010 was about the same level as that of the United States. "Moreover", they write, "private-sector indebtedness across the euro area as a whole is markedly lower than in the highly leveraged [[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] economies". The authors conclude that the crisis "is as much political as economic" and the result of the fact that the euro area lacks the support of "institutional [[paraphernalia]] (and mutual bonds of solidarity) of a state".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/eiu2/images/EuroDebtPaperMarch2011.pdf |title=State of the Union: Can the euro zone survive its debt crisis?|page=4 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Economist Intelligence Unit]] |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref>

The crisis continued with S&P downgrading nine euro-area countries, including France, then downgrading the entire [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF) fund.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In May 2012, socialist [[François Hollande]] was elected as president of France and a month later the French socialist legislative position was strengthened, while German leader [[Angela Merkel]] "has appeared to be floundering and been badly let down by her advisers in recent months", one commentator said. As such, "serious discord between French and German monetary decision-makers was [comparable to that of] ... 1992–93, at the height of the crisis over the [[European Monetary System]], the forerunner to EMU" ([[European Monetary Union]]). "[H]itherto relatively dormant signs of [[Euroscepticism|euro skepticism]] in German public opinion and throughout industry have been multiplying in recent months, making Hollande's proposals increasingly unpalatable to a broad swathe of German opinion. Although considerable controversy will continue to swirl over Greece and Spain, the real battle lines over the future of the euro will be drawn up between Germany and France", the commentary concluded.<ref>[[David Marsh (financial specialist)|David Marsh]], "[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/vote-for-french-left-weakens-merkels-position-2012-06-11?link=home_carousel Vote for French Left weakens Merkel’s position]", ''[[MarketWatch]]'', 11 June 2012.

===Direct usage===
The euro is the sole currency of 19 [[European Union member states|EU member states]]: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. These countries constitute the "[[eurozone]]", some 332&nbsp;million people in total as of 2013.<ref name="2013_data_sheet">{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/pdf13/2013-population-data-sheet_eng.pdf|title=2013 World Population Data Sheet|author=[[Population Reference Bureau]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2013-10-01}}</ref>

With all but two of the remaining EU members obliged to join, together with future members of the EU, the [[enlargement of the eurozone]] is set to continue. Outside the EU, the euro is also the sole currency of Montenegro and Kosovo and several [[Microstates and the European Union|European microstates]] (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City) as well as in four [[Special member state territories and the European Union|overseas territories of EU members]] that are not themselves part of the EU ([[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]] and [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]). Together this direct usage of the euro outside the EU affects nearly 3&nbsp;million people.

It is also gaining increasing international usage as a trading currency in Cuba,<ref>{{Cite news| title= Cuba to adopt Euro in foreign trade | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/210441.stm |publisher=BBC News  | date=8 November 1998 | accessdate=2 January 2008 }}</ref> North Korea, and Syria.<ref>{{Cite news| title= US row leads Syria to snub dollar | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4713622.stm |publisher=BBC News  | date=14 February 2006 | accessdate=2 January 2008 }}</ref> There are also various currencies pegged to the euro (see below).

===Use as reserve currency===
Since its introduction, the euro has been the second most widely held international [[reserve currency]] after the U.S. dollar. The share of the euro as a reserve currency has increased from 18% in 1999 to 27% in 2008. Over this period the share of the U.S. dollar fell from 71% to 64% and the Yen fell from 6.4% to 3.3%. The euro inherited and built on the status of the [[Deutsche Mark]] as the second most important reserve currency. The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies: according to the [[International Monetary Fund]]<ref name="external1">{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/cofer/eng/cofer.pdf |title=Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER)&nbsp;– Updated COFER tables include first quarter 2009 data.

The possibility of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wage.wisc.edu/uploads/Working%20Papers/chinnfrankel_NBER_eurotopcurrency.pdf |title=Will the Euro Eventually Surpass the Dollar As Leading International Reserve Currency? |format=PDF |accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> Former [[US Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] gave his opinion in September 2007 that it is "absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency".<ref>{{Cite news| title=Euro could replace dollar as top currency&nbsp;– Greenspan | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSL1771147920070917 | accessdate=17 September 2007 | date=17 September 2007 |agency=Reuters  }}</ref> In contrast to Greenspan's 2007 assessment, the euro's increase in the share of the worldwide currency reserve basket has slowed considerably since 2007 and since the beginning of the worldwide [[credit crunch]] related recession and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]].<ref name="external1"/>

With the exception of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Macedonia (which had pegged their currencies against the Deutsche Mark) and Cape Verde (formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo), all of these non-EU countries had a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their currencies to the euro. Pegging a country's currency to a major currency is regarded as a safety measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies, as the euro is seen as a stable currency, prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.

Within the EU several currencies have a peg to the euro, in most instances as a precondition to joining the eurozone. The [[Bulgarian lev]] was formerly pegged to the Deutsche Mark; one other EU member state has a direct peg due to ERM II: the [[Danish krone]].

In total, as of 2013, 182&nbsp;million people in Africa use a currency pegged to the euro, 27&nbsp;million people outside the eurozone in Europe, and another 545,000 people on Pacific islands.<ref name="2013_data_sheet" />

==Economics==

===Optimal currency area===
{{Further|Optimum currency area}}

In economics, an optimum currency area, or region (OCA or OCR), is a geographical region in which it would maximise economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency. There are two models, both proposed by [[Robert Mundell]]: the [[Optimum currency area#OCA with stationary expectations|stationary expectations model]] and the [[Optimum currency area#OCA with international risk sharing|international risk sharing model]]. Mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro.<ref>A Plan for a European Currency, 1973 by Mundell</ref> However, even before the creation of the single currency, there were concerns over diverging economies. Before the [[late-2000s recession]] the chances of a state leaving the euro, or the chances that the whole zone would collapse, were considered extremely slim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1014341 |title=The Breakup of the Euro Area by Barry Eichengreen :: SSRN |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> However the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] led to former [[British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] claiming the eurozone could not last in its current form.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13839381 |title=Greek debt crisis: Straw says eurozone 'will collapse' |publisher=BBC |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> Part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the euro was set up. John Lanchester, writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', explains it thus:

<blockquote>The guiding principle of the currency, which opened for business in 1999, were supposed to be a set of rules to limit a country's annual deficit to three per cent of gross domestic product, and the total accumulated debt to sixty per cent of G.D.P. It was a nice idea, but by 2004 the two biggest economies in the euro zone, Germany and France, had broken the rules for three years in a row.<ref>John Lanchester, "Euro Science," ''New Yorker'', 10 October 2011.</ref> </blockquote>

===Transaction costs and risks===
{{Most traded currencies|group="note"}}

The most obvious benefit of adopting a single currency is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., [[credit card]]s, [[debit card]]s and [[cash machine]] withdrawals).

The absence of distinct currencies also theoretically removes [[exchange rate]] risks, although the imposition of transfer restrictions in [[2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis]] means that the situation is not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.

Financial markets on the continent are expected to be far more [[market liquidity|liquid]] and flexible than they were in the past. The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone. However, although transaction costs were reduced, some studies have shown that [[risk aversion]] has increased during the last 40 years in the Eurozone.<ref>Benchimol, J., 2014. [https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/reecon/v68y2014i1p39-56.html Risk aversion in the Eurozone], [[Research in Economics]], vol. 68, issue 1, pp. 39–56.</ref>

===Price parity===
Another effect of the common European currency is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because of the [[law of one price]]. Differences in prices can trigger [[arbitrage]], i.e., [[speculation|speculative]] trade in a [[commodity]] across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w8402 |title=Market Integration and Convergence to the Law of One Price: Evidence from the European Car Market |publisher=Nber.org |accessdate=5 January 2009}}</ref>

===Macroeconomic stability===
Low levels of inflation are the hallmark of stable and modern economies. Because a high level of inflation acts as a tax ([[seigniorage]]) and theoretically discourages investment, it is generally viewed as undesirable. In spite of the downside, many countries have been unable or unwilling to deal with serious inflationary pressures. Some countries have successfully contained them by establishing largely independent central banks. One such bank was the [[Bundesbank]] in Germany; as the European Central Bank is modelled on the Bundesbank,<ref name="bundesbank">{{Cite book|title=The History of the Bundesbank: Lessons for the European Central Bank |last=de Haan |first=Jakob |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-21723-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EaIV0OWlaokC |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref> it is independent of the pressures of national governments and has a mandate to keep inflation low. Member countries that join the euro hope to enjoy the macroeconomic stability associated with low levels of inflation. The ECB (unlike the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] in the United States of America) does not have a second objective to sustain growth and employment.

Many national and corporate [[bond (finance)|bonds]] denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have lower interest rates than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the [[nominal interest rate]] on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency with low levels of inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.

Unfortunately, there is also a cost in structurally keeping inflation lower than in the United States, UK, and China. The result is that seen from those countries, the euro has become expensive, making European products increasingly expensive for its largest importers. Hence export from the euro zone becomes more difficult. This is one of the main reasons why economic growth inside the euro zone now lags behind growth in other large economies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} This effect is strongest in European countries with a weak economy.

In general, those in Europe who own large amounts of euros are served by high stability and low inflation. Those who now need to earn euros, including those countries who need to pay interest on large debts, are likely better served with a slightly less strong euro leading to more export. Because with a lower euro, investors would see better chances for (companies in) southern European countries to grow themselves out of the crisis. As a result, investing there would become less risky, and that would push interest rates for southern countries more in line with the European average.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The contradiction here is that high macroeconomic stability in the form of ongoing historically low inflation over time leads to economic problems, creating higher interest rates and political and economic instability for the weaker partners.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

====Trade====
A 2009 consensus from the studies of the introduction of the euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.de/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp594.pdf |title=The euro's trade effects |format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref> although one study suggested an increase of only 3%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/klaassen/index_files/trend27_forthcoming.pdf |title=The Euro Effect on Trade is not as Large as Commonly Thought|format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref> while another estimated 9 to 14%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1079383 |title=SSRN-Estimating the Euro Effects on Trade with Propensity Score Matching by Pandej Chintrakarn |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref> However, a [[meta-analysis]] of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by [[publication bias]] and that the underlying effect may be negligible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/670658078011l5r1/ |title=Rose effect and the euro: is the magic gone? |work=Review of World Economics |accessdate=13 July 2010}}</ref> Furthermore, studies accounting for [[Time trend analysis|time trend]] reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gomes|first1=Tamara|last2=Graham|first2=Chris|last3=Helliwel|first3=John|last4=Takashi|first4=Kano|last5=Murray|first5=John|last6=Schembri|first6=Lawrence|title=The Euro and Trade: Is there a Positive Effect?|url=http://www2.dse.unibo.it/soegw/paper/GomGraHelKanoMurrayS.pdf|publisher=Bank of Canada|date=August 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=H.|first1=Berger|last2=V.|first2=Nitsch|title=Zooming out: The trade effect of the euro in historical perspective|journal=Journal of International Money and Finance|volume=27|issue=8|pages=1244–1260|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026156060800096X}}</ref> These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.

====Investment====
Physical investment seems to have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eu-financial-system.org/fileadmin/content/Dokumente_Events/second_conference/Dvorak.pdf |title=The Impact of the Euro on Investment: Sectoral Evidence|format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref> Regarding foreign direct investment, a study found that the intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afse.fr/docs/congres_2005/docs2005/Sousa.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5njSL0hxe|archivedate=22 February 2010 |title=Does the single currency affect FDI?|publisher=AFSE.fr |format=PDF |accessdate=30 May 2010}}</ref> Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.wu-wien.ac.at/rof/papers/pdf/Bris-Koskinen-Nilsson_Euro%20Effects.pdf |title=The Real Effects of the Euro: Evidence from Corporate Investments |format=PDF |accessdate=30 May 2010}}</ref>

====Inflation====
The introduction of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the introduction of the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies.<ref>{{Cite journal|author = Paolo Angelini |author2=Francesco Lippi | title = Did Prices Really Soar after the Euro Cash Changeover?

====Exchange rate risk====
One of the advantages of the adoption of a common currency is the reduction of the risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates. It has been found that the introduction of the euro created "significant reductions in market risk exposures for nonfinancial firms both in and outside of Europe".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VFG-4KB14MN-1&_user=121712&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000009979&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=121712&md5=9da59b5525252985a70618a2dafbc141 |title=The impact of the introduction of the Euro on foreign exchange rate risk exposures |work=Journal of Empirical Finance |publisher=ScienceDirect |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref> These reductions in market risk "were concentrated in firms domiciled in the eurozone and in non-Euro firms with a high fraction of foreign sales or assets in Europe".

====Financial integration====
The introduction of the euro seems to have had a strong effect on European financial integration. According to a study on this question, it has "significantly reshaped the European financial system, especially with respect to the securities markets [...] However, the real and policy barriers to integration in the retail and corporate banking sectors remain significant, even if the wholesale end of banking has been largely integrated."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/iiis/documents/discussion/pdfs/iiisdp139.pdf |title=The Euro and Financial Integration|format=PDF |date=May 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref> Specifically, the euro has significantly decreased the cost of trade in bonds, equity, and banking assets within the eurozone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WMC-4TXF7WY-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=2c6125b54140decec22b1a1afcb622e0 |title=The geography of asset trade and the euro: Insiders and outsiders |work=Journal of the Japanese and International Economies |publisher=ScienceDirect |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref> On a global level, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has led to an integration in terms of investment in bond portfolios, with eurozone countries lending and borrowing more between each other than with other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=925858 |title=SSRN-Global Bond Portfolios and EMU by Philip R.

====Effect on interest rates====
[[File:Long-term interest rates of eurozone countries since 1993.png|thumb|300px|Long-term interest rates of Euro countries, 1993–2012]]

As of January 2014, and since the introduction of the euro, interest rates of most members countries (particularly those with a weak currency), have decreased. The countries whose interest rates fell most as a result of the adoption of the euro are Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. These very countries have had the most serious sovereign financing problems.

The effect of declining interest rates, combined with excess liquidity continually provided by the ECB, made it easier for banks within the countries in which interest rates fell the most, and their linked sovereigns, to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investmentweek.co.uk/investment-week/opinion/2076100/redwood-origins-euro-crisis |title=Redwood:   The origins of the euro crisis |publisher=Investmentweek.co.uk |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> Following the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ip-global.org/2011/02/01/farewell-fair-weather-euro/ |title=Farewell, Fair-Weather Euro &#124; IP&nbsp;– Global-Edition |publisher=Ip-global.org |accessdate=16 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110317161013/http://www.ip-global.org:80/2011/02/01/farewell-fair-weather-euro/ |archivedate=17 March 2011 }}</ref> This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.

====Price convergence====
The evidence on the convergence of prices in the eurozone with the introduction of the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ecb.eu/events/pdf/conferences/emu/sessionV_Angeloni_Paper.pdf |title=Price setting and inflation dynamics: did EMU matter |format=PDF |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://opus.zbw-kiel.de/volltexte/2009/7575/pdf/200906dkp.pdf |title=Price convergence in the EMU?

====Tourism====
A study suggests that the introduction of the euro has had a positive effect on the amount of tourist travel within the EMU, with an increase of 6.5%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=983231 |title=SSRN-The Effect of EMU on Tourism by Salvador Gil-Pareja, Rafael Llorca-Vivero, José Martínez-Serrano |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref>

==Exchange rates==
[[File:EUR-USD.PNG|thumb|300px|Euro-US Dollar exchange rate, starting from 2002]]

===Flexible exchange rates===
The ECB targets [[interest rate]]s rather than [[exchange rate]]s and in general does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This is because of the implications of the [[Mundell–Fleming model]], which implies a central bank cannot (without [[capital control]]s) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the [[money supply]] results in a [[depreciation]] of the currency. In the years following the [[Single European Act]], the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or [[floating exchange rate|floating]]. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low interest rates and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners. However, in 2010, the euro started on a sharp decline. Starting at U.S$1.60 in 2008, and dropping to [[US$]]1.04 in 2015. The [[Canadian Dollar]] despite seeing a decline in value against the [[USD]], has seen a growth in [[EURO]] -> [CAD].

===Against other major currencies===
The euro is the second-most widely held [[reserve currency]] on earth after the U.S. dollar. After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate against the other major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 (25 October vs the U.S. dollar, 26 October vs Japanese Yen, 3 May vs Pound Sterling). Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 (15 July vs U.S. dollar, 23 July vs Japanese Yen, 29 December vs Pound Sterling). With the advent of the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|global financial crisis]] the euro initially fell, only to regain later. Despite pressure due to the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] the euro remained stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110822-701343.html |title= Euro Stable Despite Debt Crisis Says Schaeuble |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= 22 August 2011 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> In November 2011 the euro's exchange rate index&nbsp;– measured against currencies of the bloc's major trading partners&nbsp;– was trading almost two percent higher on the year, approximately at the same level as it was before the crisis kicked off in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/11/15/uk-markets-euro-mystery-idUKLNE7AE02520111115 |title= Puzzle over euro's 'mysterious' stability |work=[[Reuters]] |date= 15 November 2011}}</ref>

==Criticism==

===Unemployment===
Nobel memorial prize-winning economist [[James Meade]] thought that a central bank should not make price stability the objective of aggregate demand management. When prices are likely to be pushed up due to increase of indirect taxes or adverse terms-of-trade shocks, the surge in prices must be cancelled out by decline in domestic money wage costs, as long as such a price stability policy is adopted.<ref name=meade1978ngdp>J. Meade, The Economic Journal, vol 88, No 351, (1978)</ref> There would be unemployment in the all industrial sectors under a price stabilisation policy, suggesting that in the short run the elasticity of demand for labour is low.

Under the ECB's price stabilisation policy, many people in the eurozone have difficulty finding a job. The unemployment rate of Spain is around 25 percent in 2014, and an economic forecast says that the figure will not decrease below 20 percent until 2017.<ref>[http://www.brecorder.com/world/global-business-a-economy/196991-bank-of-spain-says-domestic-demand-surge-likely-to-slow-in-q3.html Bank of Spain says domestic demand surge likely to slow in Q3] Business recorder, Business and Economy, 24 Sep 2014</ref>

ELSTAT, the statistics agency of Greece, shows that Greece's unemployment rate was 27 percent in June 2014.<ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/09/11/uk-greece-unemployment-idUKKBN0H60S620140911 Greek unemployment dips to 27 percent in June] Reuters UK, 11 sep 2014</ref> OECD forecasts that Greece's unemployment rate will remain around 27 percent until 2016. Due to long-term unemployment, skills of jobless persons have been depreciated and their motivation of finding jobs has been lost, which causes the country's level of unemployment to remain high.<ref>[http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/09/03/oecd-report-greek-unemployment-will-remain-at-27/ OECD Report: Greek Unemployment Will Remain at 27%] D.

Spain's youth unemployment rate is 53.8 percent in July 2014, and this is the highest figure in the eurozone.<ref name=ffi2014aug29U>[http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1028130.shtml Eurozone unemployment unchanged at 11.5% in July] Finfacts Ireland, EU economy, 29 Aug 2014</ref> This figure is comparable to 53.1 percent of the Greek youth unemployment in May 2014.

In July 2014, the averaged unemployment rate of the eurozone is 11.7 percent, slight decrease from 11.9 percent in 2013.<ref name=IFS2014augIMFU /><ref name=ffi2014aug29U />

Likewise, [[Paul Krugman]] argued that the existence of a single shared currency across the entire eurozone, in combination with tight money policies of the ECB (motivated by insistence of Germany on low inflation), placed much of the Southern Europe in a state of permanent high unemployment. According to Krugman, during the period between the creation of the euro and the 2008 financial crisis, countries of Southern Europe experienced abnormally high rates of wage growth due to high influx of investor money. Between 2000 and 2008, unit labor costs actually declined slightly in Germany, but rose by 30% in Spain and Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/how-restore-competitiveness-eu|title=Diverging competitiveness among EU nations: Constraining wages is the key }}</ref> This created an imbalance that put these countries at competitive disadvantage relative to Northern Europe. Returning to full employment at this point requires that the labor costs gap is somehow cancelled. If Spain and Greece had their own currencies, this would have easily happened through exchange rate adjustment. Since they don't, it can either happen through a decrease in nominal wages in Spain and Greece, also known as "internal devaluation", (an extremely difficult and slow process, since nominal wages, in general, exhibit [[Nominal rigidity|downward rigidity]]), or through an equal increase in nominal wages (i.e. inflation) in Northern Europe, which does not happen because of active resistance from Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/revenge-of-the-optimum-currency-area/?_r=0|title=Revenge of the Optimum Currency Area}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/dnwr-in-the-ea/|title=DNWR in the EA}}</ref>
