Another part of the nation moved west with the<space/><link><target>Helvetii</target></link><space/>into southern France, which was one of the events leading to the interventions of Julius Caesar's Gaulish campaign of 58 BC.

Many Suebic tribes from the Bohemian region took part in such movements westwards, even settling as far away as Spain and Portugal.

The Slavic influx was divided into two or three waves. The first wave came from the southeast and east, when the Germanic<space/><link><target>Lombards</target></link><space/>left Bohemia (c. 568 AD). Soon after, from the 630s to 660s, the territory was taken by<space/><link><target>Samo</target></link>'s tribal confederation.

The<space/><link><target>Utraquists</target></link><space/>began to lay the groundwork for an agreement with the Catholic Church and found the more radical views of the Taborites distasteful.

During the<space/><link><target>Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas</target><part>Revolution of 1848</part></link>, many Czech nationalists called for autonomy for Bohemia from Habsburg Austria, but the revolutionaries were defeated. The old Bohemian Diet, one of the last remnants of the independence, was dissolved, although the Czech language experienced a rebirth as<space/><link><target>romantic nationalism</target></link><space/>developed among the Czechs.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1861, a new elected Bohemian Diet was established. The renewal of the old Bohemian Crown (<link><target>Kingdom of Bohemia</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Margraviate of Moravia</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia</target></link>) became the official political program of both Czech liberal politicians and the majority of Bohemian aristocracy (&quot;state rights program&quot;), while parties representing the German minority and small part of the aristocracy proclaimed their loyalty to the centralistic Constitution (so-called &quot;Verfassungstreue&quot;). After the defeat of Austria in the<space/><link><target>Austro-Prussian War</target></link><space/>in 1866, Hungarian politicians achieved the<space/><link><target>Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867</target></link>, ostensibly creating equality between the Austrian and Hungarian halves of the empire. An attempt by the Czechs to create a tripartite monarchy (Austria-Hungary-Bohemia) failed in 1871. However, the &quot;state rights program&quot; remained the official platform of all Czech political parties (except for social democrats) until 1918.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Twentieth century</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Czechoslovakia01.png</target><part>thumb</part><part>250px</part><part>right</part><part>Bohemia (westernmost area) within Czechoslovakia between 1918 and 1938</part></link><link><target>File:Karlovy Vary Czech Rep.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>The Bohemian town of<space/><link><target>Karlovy Vary</target></link></part></link>After World War I, Bohemia (as the largest and most populous land) became the core of the newly formed country of<space/><link><target>Czechoslovakia</target></link>, which combined Bohemia,<space/><link><target>Moravia</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Czech Silesia</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Upper Hungary</target></link><space/>(present-day<space/><link><target>Slovakia</target></link>) and<space/><link><target>Carpathian Ruthenia</target></link><space/>into one state. Under its first president,<space/><link><target>Tom Masaryk</target></link>, Czechoslovakia became a liberal democratic republic but serious issues emerged regarding the Czech majority's relationship with the native German and Hungarian minorities.</paragraph><paragraph>Following the<space/><link><target>Munich Agreement</target></link><space/>in 1938, the border regions of Bohemia historically inhabited predominantly by ethnic Germans (the<space/><link><target>Sudetenland</target></link>) were annexed to<space/><link><target>Nazi Germany</target></link>; this was the only time in Bohemian history that its territory was politically divided.

Any open opposition to German occupation was brutally suppressed by the Nazi authorities and many Czech patriots were executed as a result.

This severely depopulated the area and from this moment on locales were only referred to in their Czech equivalents regardless of their previous demographic makeup. In 1946, per the<space/><link><target>Potsdam Agreement</target></link>, and under the stipulation that it be placed &quot;under Polish administration&quot; the post war Communist Party backed by the Soviet Union re-established Czechoslovakia.

In February 1948 the non-communist members of the government resigned in protest against arbitrary measures by the communists and their Soviet protectors in many of the state's institutions. Gottwald and the communists responded with a coup d'tat and installed a pro-Soviet authoritarian state.</paragraph><paragraph>Beginning in 1949, Bohemia ceased to be an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia, as the country was divided into administrative regions. Between 1949 and 1989 Czechoslovakia (from 1960 officially called Czechoslovak Socialistic Republic) became a Soviet satellite even though there was not a Soviet army present until 1968 (interestingly enough, surrounding countries including Eastern Austria were occupied by the Red Army) when Czechoslovak Communist Party started to reform and democratize itself. This &quot;<link><target>Prague Spring</target></link>&quot; process was stopped abruptly by an invasion of 'brotherly' armies of Warsaw Pact in August 1968. &quot;Temporary stationing&quot; of Soviet army following the invasion ended in 1991.
