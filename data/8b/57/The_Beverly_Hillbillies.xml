A surveyor for the OK Oil Company realizes the size of the oil field, and the company pays him a fortune for the right to drill on his land. Patriarch Jed moves with his family into a mansion next door to his banker (Milburn Drysdale, of the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills), in the wealthy<space/><link><target>Beverly Hills, California</target></link>, where he brings a moral, unsophisticated, and minimalistic lifestyle to the swank, sometimes self-obsessed and superficial community.<space/><link><target>Double entendre</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>and cultural misconceptions are the core of the sitcom's humor. Plots often involve the outlandish efforts Drysdale makes to keep the Clampetts in Beverly Hills and their money in his bank.

Jed is the son of Luke Clampett and his wife, and has a sister called Myrtle. A principal character of the show, Jed is a good-natured man; he is the apparent head of the family. Jed's wife (Elly May's mother) died but is referred to in the episode &quot;Duke Steals A Wife&quot; as Rose Ellen. Jed is shown to be an expert marksman and is extremely loyal to his family and kinfolk. The huge oil pool in the swamp he owned was the beginning of his rags-to-riches journey to Beverly Hills. Although he longs for the old ways back in the hills, he makes the best of being in Beverly Hills. Whenever he has anything on his mind, he sits on the curbstone of his mansion and whittles until he comes up with the answer.

Paul Henning, the show's creator/producer quickly disposed of the idea of Granny being Jed's mother, which would have changed the show's dynamics, making Granny the matriarch and Jed subordinate to her. Granny can be aggressive but is often overruled by Jed. She is a Confederate to the core, defending President Jefferson Davis, the Stars and Bars, and the simple life. Short-fused and easily angered, Granny fancies herself a &quot;dunked&quot; (not &quot;sprinkled&quot;) Christian with forgiveness in her heart. She abhors &quot;revenuers&quot; and blue-coat Yankees. A self-styled &quot;M.D.&quot;&amp;nbsp; &quot;mountain doctor&quot;&amp;nbsp; she claims to have an edge over expensive know-nothing city physicians. In lieu of anesthesia, Granny uses her &quot;<link><target>moonshine</target><part>white lightning</part></link>&quot; brew before commencing on painful treatments such as leech bleeding and yanking teeth with pliers.</paragraph><paragraph>Short and scrappy, Granny often wields a double-barreled, 12-gauge shotgun and fires it numerous times during the run of the show (in a first-season episode she chases Milburn Drysdale with it when she finds out his mother's family had a feud with her family back in the hills). She fires it once at the front lawn when Jed is witching for water and several times on the skeet shooting range. During the mock Indian invasion she believed she was shooting live shells, though Milburn Drysdale had removed the buckshot to protect the actors portraying the Indians. She fires rock salt and bacon rind at a crow during the &quot;Happy Valley&quot; episode, and again at the back of an armored truck in which Milburn Drysdale was taking refuge. She fires at (and hits in the posterior) Milburn Drysdale with rocksalt believing he is the ghost of &quot;Lady Clemintine&quot; ending their second visit to &quot;Clampett Castle&quot; in<space/><link><target>Kent</target></link>,<space/><link><target>England</target></link><space/>which was filmed at<space/><link><target>Penshurst Place</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="author">Kent Film Office</arg><arg name="url">http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1967/10/the-beverly-hillbillies-1967/</arg><arg name="title">Kent Film Office The Beverly Hillbillies Article</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Granny also fires &quot;Lady Fingers&quot; (which Elly had baked for Jethro to take to the Army Reserve) into the posterior of an actor portraying Gen.

Without her glasses, Granny is extremely nearsighted&amp;nbsp; once in a crossover with the<space/><link><target>Petticoat Junction</target></link><space/>show, Granny mistakes a dog for a baby child and a coffee pot for a telephone. Two of Granny's phobias are &quot;Injuns&quot; (she actually buys wigs so the Clampetts won't be &quot;scalped&quot;) and the &quot;cement pond&quot; (swimming poolshe has a fear of water). In a long<space/><link><target>story arc</target></link><space/>in the show's ninth season, Elly May dates a<space/><link><target>United States Navy</target><part>U.S. Navy</part></link><space/>frogman, which confuses Granny: After seeing the frogman climb out of the pool in his skin-diving wear, she thinks that anyone who swims in the pool will be turned into a frog. She also has a peculiar way of retelling the<space/><link><target>War Between The States</target></link>, in which she thinks the South has won and<space/><link><target>Jefferson Davis</target></link><space/>is the president, while calling<space/><link><target>Sherman's March to the Sea</target><part>Sherman's March</part></link><space/>&quot;Sherman's Retreat to the Sea&quot;. Any attempts to correct her meet with failure. She is also known for slicing off switches to use on Jethro, mainly whenever he goes too far with his idiotic schemes.</paragraph><paragraph>There are references to Granny growing up in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. From episode 9: &quot;When I was a girl back in Tennessee, I set so many boys' hearts on fire that they took to calling that neck of the woods<space/><italics>The Smoky Mountains</italics>.&quot; In season 9, episode 23, she says she is from<space/><link><target>Limestone, Tennessee</target></link>.

He drove the Clampett family to their new home in California and stayed on with them to further his education. The whole family boasts of Jethro's &quot;sixth-grade education&quot; but nevertheless feels he is a bit of an idiot. Jethro is simply naive in the first season of the show but becomes incredibly ignorant and pompous as the series progresses. He often shows off his cyphering abilities with multiplication and &quot;go-zin-ta's&quot;, as in &quot;five gozinta five one times, five gozinta ten two times&quot;, etc. The tallest student in his class in the town of Oxford because of his age, he is often impressing others that he graduated &quot;highest in his class at Oxford, 6 ft 2&quot;. In Beverly Hills, he decides to go to college.

Another running gag is that Jethro is known as the &quot;six-foot stomach&quot; for his ability to eat: in one episode, he eats a jetliner's entire supply of steaks; in another, Jethro tries to set himself up as a Hollywood agent for cousin &quot;Bessie&quot; with a fee of 10,000 bananas for Bessie and 1,000 bananas for Jethro.

Milburn is the Commerce Bank's tightwad president and the friendly bumpkins' confidant. The haughty Mrs. Drysdale boasts of a heritage that traces back to the Mayflower, but Milburn's concerns are strictly monetary. When suffering an anxiety attack, Milburn sniffs a stack of money and is quickly revived. Another time Miss Hathaway discovered that whenever Jed Clampett took money out of his pocket Drysdale's blood pressure would either go up or down depending on whether Jed was going to spend the money or not. Whenever Drysdale gets a taste of Granny's &quot;Tennessee Tranquilzer&quot; (<link><target>moonshine</target></link>), his face turns red. In the interest of keeping the Clampetts' account at all costs, Mr. Drysdale is prone to appease them, and says that anything they do is unquestionably right. He often forces others, especially his secretary, to placate the Clampetts by granting their unorthodox requests. A running gag is that Drysdale-as President of the Commerce bank of Beverly Hills-is in a feud with a rival bank President {of the Merchant Bank of Beverly Hills} as to<space/><italics>whom</italics><space/>will have custody of Jed Clampett's millions.</paragraph><paragraph>Although wife Margaret, a blue-blooded Bostonian, has obvious disdain for the &quot;peasant&quot; and &quot;dreadful&quot; hillbillies, she tacitly agrees to tolerate them (rather than Milburn lose their ever growing accountwhich is $96,000,000 in 1969, equal to $<template><target>formatnum:</target></template><space/>today).

Though she always carries out his wishes, she is inherently decent and is frequently put off by her boss's greed. When she is annoyed with him, as is often the case, especially when one of Drysdale's schemes goes too far, she usually and forcefully says, &quot;Chief!&quot; Jane is genuinely fond of the family (to the Clampetts, she is considered family; even Granny, the one most dead-set against living in California, likes her very much); Jane actually harbors something of a crush on Jethro for most of the series' run. At first, she mistakes the Clampetts as servants until Drysdale told her who they really are (which almost costs her her job).</paragraph><paragraph>Miss Hathaway frequently has to &quot;rescue&quot; Drysdale from his idiotic schemes, receiving little or no thanks for her efforts. In one episode, she and Granny, disguised as &quot;<link><target>Geisha#&quot;Geisha girls&quot;</target><part>geisha girl</part><trail>s</trail></link>&quot;, finally have enough and &quot;crown&quot; Drysdale and Jethro, who have made one too many comments about women serving men. Jane is loyal to Drysdale, as well, despite her misgivings toward his avarice and greed. In one episode, the Clampetts, feeling money has corrupted them, give all of their money to Virginia &quot;Ginny&quot; Jennings (<link><target>Sheila Kuehl</target></link>), a college student. While Drysdale moans the loss of the money, Jane immediately tells him to stop thinking about the Clampetts and start trying to get the Jennings account. Eventually, everyone discovered Jennings' real motives, and she was gone, with the Clampetts getting their money back, and things were as they were before.
