He argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed, and thus no one can have direct access to reality, given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brain's responses to reality.

During the<space/><link><target>World War I</target><part>First World War</part></link><space/>Korzybski served as an<space/><link><target>Military intelligence</target><part>intelligence officer</part></link><space/>in the<space/><link><target>Russia</target><trail>n</trail></link><space/>Army. After being wounded in a leg and suffering other injuries, he moved to North America in 1916 (first to<space/><link><target>Canada</target></link>, then the<space/><link><target>United States</target></link>) to coordinate the shipment of<space/><link><target>artillery</target></link><space/>to Russia. He also lectured to Polish-American audiences about the conflict, promoting the sale of<space/><link><target>war bonds</target></link>. After the War, he decided to remain in the United States, becoming a<space/><link><target>Naturalization</target><part>naturalized citizen</part></link><space/>in 1940. He met Mira Edgerly,<extension extension_name='ref'>http://american-miniatures20c.blogspot.com/2007/06/edgerly-mira-portrait-of-three-sisters.html</extension><space/>a painter of portraits on ivory, shortly after the Armistice, and married her in January 1919. Their marriage lasted until his death.</paragraph><paragraph>His first book,<space/><italics>Manhood of Humanity</italics>, was published in 1921. In the book, he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind: mankind as a &quot;<link><target>General semantics#The major premises</target><part>time-binding</part></link>&quot; class of life (humans perform time binding by the transmission of knowledge and abstractions through time which are accreted in cultures).</paragraph><heading level='2'>General semantics</heading><paragraph>Korzybski's work culminated in the initiation of a discipline that he named<space/><link><target>general semantics</target></link><space/>(GS). This should not be confused with<space/><link><target>semantics</target></link>. The basic principles of general semantics, which include time-binding, are described in the publication<space/><xhtml:cite><italics>Science and Sanity</italics></xhtml:cite>, published in 1933. In 1938 Korzybski founded the<space/><link><target>Institute of General Semantics</target></link><space/>in Chicago.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.generalsemantics.org/about-us/history/</extension><space/>The post-World War II housing shortage in Chicago cost him the Institute's building lease, so in 1946, he moved the Institute to<space/><link><target>Lakeville (Salisbury, Connecticut)</target><part>Lakeville, Connecticut</part></link>, U.S., where he directed it until his death in 1950.</paragraph><paragraph>Korzybski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by (1) the structure of their nervous systems, and (2) the<space/><link><target>structure</target></link><space/>of their languages. Humans cannot experience the world directly, but only through their &quot;abstractions&quot; (nonverbal impressions or &quot;gleanings&quot; derived from the nervous system, and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language). These sometimes mislead us about what is the case. Our understanding sometimes lacks<space/><italics>similarity of structure</italics><space/>with what is actually happening.</paragraph><paragraph>He sought to train our awareness of abstracting, using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science. He called this awareness, this goal of his system, &quot;consciousness of abstracting&quot;. His system included the promotion of attitudes such as &quot;I don't know; let's see,&quot; in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science. Another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet, an experience he termed, &quot;silence on the objective levels&quot;.</paragraph><heading level='2'>&quot;To be&quot;</heading><paragraph>Many devotees and critics of Korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form &quot;is&quot; of the more general verb &quot;to be.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Alfred Korzybski,<space/><italics>Selections from Science and Sanity</italics>, 2010.</extension><space/>His system, however, is based primarily on such terminology as the different &quot;orders of abstraction,&quot; and formulations such as &quot;consciousness of abstracting.&quot; It is often said<template><target>Request quotation</target><arg name="date">September 2012</arg></template><space/>that Korzybski<space/><italics>opposed</italics><space/>the use of the verb &quot;to be.&quot; This is a profound exaggeration (see &quot;criticisms&quot; below).</paragraph><paragraph>He thought that<space/><italics>certain uses</italics><space/>of the verb &quot;to be&quot;, called the &quot;is of identity&quot; and the &quot;is of<space/><link><target>E-prime#The different functions of .27to be.27</target><part>predication</part></link>&quot;, were faulty in structure, e.g., a statement such as, &quot;Elizabeth is a fool&quot; (said of a person named &quot;Elizabeth&quot; who has done something that we regard as foolish). In Korzybski's system, one's assessment of Elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than Elizabeth herself. Korzybski's remedy was to<space/><italics>deny</italics><space/>identity; in this example, to be aware continually that &quot;Elizabeth&quot; is<space/><italics>not</italics><space/>what we<space/><italics>call</italics><space/>her. We find Elizabeth not in the verbal domain, the world of words, but the nonverbal domain (the two, he said, amount to different orders of abstraction). This was expressed by Korzybski's most famous premise, &quot;<link><target>Map-territory relation</target><part>the map is not the territory</part></link>&quot;. Note that this premise uses the phrase &quot;is not&quot;, a form of &quot;to be&quot;; this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon &quot;to be&quot; as such. In fact, he said explicitly<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">September 2012</arg></template><space/>that there were no structural problems with the verb &quot;to be&quot; when used as an<space/><link><target>E-prime#The different functions of .27to be.27</target><part>auxiliary verb</part></link><space/>or when used to state existence or location. It was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb &quot;to be,&quot; as long as one was aware of their structural limitations.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Anecdotes</heading><paragraph>One day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit. A few students took a biscuit. &quot;Nice biscuit, don't you think,&quot; said Korzybski, while he took a second one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words &quot;Dog Cookies.&quot; The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them wanted to vomit, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet. &quot;You see,&quot; Korzybski remarked, &quot;I have just demonstrated that people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>R.
