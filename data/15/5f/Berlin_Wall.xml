Those who let themselves be recruited objectively serve West German Reaction and militarism, whether they know it or not. Is it not despicable when for the sake of a few alluring job offers or other false promises about a "guaranteed future" one leaves a country in which the seed for a new and more beautiful life is sprouting, and is already showing the first fruits, for the place that favours a new war and destruction?

Is it not an act of political depravity when citizens, whether young people, workers, or members of the intelligentsia, leave and betray what our people have created through common labour in our republic to offer themselves to the American or British secret services or work for the West German factory owners, [[Junker]]s, or militarists? Does not leaving the land of progress for the morass of an historically outdated social order demonstrate political backwardness and blindness? ...

By stemming the exodus of people from East Germany, the East German government was able to reassert its control over the country: in spite of discontent with the wall, economic problems caused by dual currency and the black market were largely eliminated. The economy in the GDR began to grow. But, the wall proved a public relations disaster for the communist bloc as a whole. Western powers portrayed it as a symbol of communist tyranny, particularly after East German border guards shot and killed would-be defectors.

Visas for day trips restricted to East Berlin were issued without previous application in a simplified procedure at the border crossing. However, East German authorities could refuse entry permits without stating a reason. In the 1980s, visitors from the western part of the city who wanted to visit the eastern part had to exchange at least DM 25 into East German currency at the poor exchange rate of 1:1. It was forbidden to export East German currency from the East, but money not spent could be left at the border for possible future visits. Tourists crossing from the west had to also pay for a visa, which cost DM 5; West Berliners did not have to pay this.</paragraph><paragraph>West Berliners initially could not visit East Berlin or East Germany at all - all crossing points were closed to them between 26 August 1961 and 17 December 1963. In 1963, negotiations between East and West resulted in a limited possibility for visits during the Christmas season that year (<italics><template><target>lang</target><arg>de</arg><arg>Passierscheinregelung</arg></template></italics>). Similar, very limited arrangements were made in 1964, 1965 and 1966.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1971, with the<space/><link><target>Four Power Agreement on Berlin</target></link>, agreements were reached that allowed West Berliners to apply for visas to enter East Berlin and East Germany regularly, comparable to the regulations already in force for West Germans. However, East German authorities could still refuse entry permits.</paragraph><paragraph>East Berliners and East Germans could not, at first, travel to West Berlin or West Germany at all. This regulation remained in force essentially until the fall of the wall, but over the years several exceptions to these rules were introduced, the most significant being:</paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>Elderly pensioners could travel to the West starting in 1965</listitem><listitem>Visits of relatives for important family matters</listitem><listitem>People who had to travel to the West for professional reasons (for example, artists, truck drivers, musicians, writers, etc.)</listitem></list><paragraph>However, each visit had to be applied for individually and approval was never guaranteed. In addition, even if travel was approved, GDR travellers could exchange only a very small amount of<space/><link><target>East German Mark</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>into<space/><link><target>Deutsche Mark</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(DM), thus limiting the financial resources available for them to travel to the West. This led to the West German practice of granting a small amount of DM annually (<italics><link><target>Begrungsgeld</target></link></italics>, or welcome money) to GDR citizens visiting West Germany and West Berlin to help alleviate this situation.</paragraph><paragraph>Citizens of other East European countries were in general subject to the same prohibition of visiting Western countries as East Germans, though the applicable exception (if any) varied from country to country.</paragraph><paragraph>Allied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces could enter and exit East Berlin without submitting to East German passport controls, purchasing a visa or being required to exchange money. Likewise, Soviet military patrols could enter and exit West Berlin. This was a requirement of the post-war<space/><link><target>Allied Control Council</target><part>Four Powers</part></link><space/>Agreements. A particular area of concern for the Western Allies involved official dealings with East German authorities when crossing the border, since Allied policy did not recognize the authority of the GDR to regulate Allied military traffic to and from West Berlin, as well as the Allied presence within Greater Berlin, including entry into, exit from, and presence within East Berlin.</paragraph><paragraph>The Allies held that only the Soviet Union, and not the GDR, had authority to regulate Allied personnel in such cases. For this reason, elaborate procedures were established to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when engaged in travel through the GDR and when in East Berlin. Special rules applied to travel by Western Allied military personnel assigned to the<space/><link><target>Military Liaison Missions</target></link><space/>accredited to the commander of Soviet forces in East Germany, located in<space/><link><target>Potsdam</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Allied personnel were restricted by policy when travelling by land to the following routes:</paragraph><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Transit between West Germany and West Berlin</defkey><defval></defval></listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem><bold>Road:</bold><space/>the Helmstedt-Berlin autobahn (A2) (Checkpoints Alpha and Bravo respectively).

Instead, the Allied forces operated a series of official (duty) trains that traveled between their respective duty stations in West Germany and West Berlin. When transiting the GDR, the trains would follow the route between Helmstedt and Griebnitzsee, just outside of West Berlin. In addition to persons traveling on official business, authorized personnel could also use the duty trains for personal travel on a space-available basis. The trains traveled only at night, and as with transit by car, Soviet military personnel handled the processing of duty train travelers.</listitem></list><list type='def'><listitem><defkey>Entry into and exit from East Berlin</defkey><defval></defval></listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Checkpoint Charlie</target></link><space/>(as a pedestrian or riding in a vehicle)</listitem></list><paragraph>As with military personnel, special procedures applied to travel by diplomatic personnel of the Western Allies accredited to their respective embassies in the GDR.

Regarding travel to East Berlin, such persons could also use the Friedrichstrae train station to enter and exit the city, in addition to Checkpoint Charlie.
