Colorado is part of the [[Western United States]], the [[Southwestern United States]], and the [[Mountain States]]. Colorado is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|8th most extensive]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|22nd most populous]] of the [[50 United States]]. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,355,866 on July 1, 2014, an increase of 6.50% since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name=PopEstUS>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2014/tables/NST-EST2014-01.xls|title=Table 1.

The state was named for the [[Colorado River]], which [[Conquistador#North America exploration|Spanish travelers]] named the ''Río Colorado'' for the [[Wiktionary:ruddy|ruddy]] ({{lang-es|[[Wiktionary:colorado|colorado]]}}) silt the river carried from the mountains. The [[Territory of Colorado]] was organized on February 28, 1861, and on August 1, 1876, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed a proclamation admitting Colorado to the [[United States|Union]] as the 38th state. Colorado is nicknamed the "[[List of U.S. state nicknames|Centennial State]]" because it became a state 28 days after the [[century|centennial]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

Colorado is bordered by [[Wyoming]] to the north, [[Nebraska]] to the northeast, [[Kansas]] to the east, [[Oklahoma]] to the southeast, [[New Mexico]] to the south, [[Utah]] to the west, and [[Arizona]] to the southwest, at the [[Four Corners]]. Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains, forests, [[High Plains (United States)|high plains]], [[mesa]]s, [[canyon]]s, [[plateau]]s, rivers, and [[Desert|desert lands]].

[[Denver]] is the capital and the [[Colorado municipalities by population|most populous city]] of Colorado. Residents of the state are properly known as "[[List of people from Colorado|Coloradoans]]", although the term "Coloradan" is used in modern times.<ref name=statestyle>[http://ccs.colostate.edu/style_guide/style_guide_az.aspx#state_names Writers Style Guide], Colorado State University.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Colorado}}
Colorado is notable for its diverse geography, ranging from alpine mountains, arid plains and deserts with huge sand dunes, deep canyons, sandstone and granite rock formations, rivers, lakes, and lush forests. 
The borders of Colorado were originally defined to be lines of latitude and longitude, making its shape a latitude-longitude* quadrangle which stretches from [[37th parallel north|37°N]] to [[41st parallel north|41°N]] latitude and from [[25th meridian west from Washington|102°03'W]] to [[32nd meridian west from Washington|109°03'W]] longitude ([[25th meridian west from Washington|25°W]] to [[32nd meridian west from Washington|32°W]] from the [[Washington Meridian]]).<ref name=Colorado_Enabling_Act/> Colorado, [[Wyoming]] and [[Utah]] are the only states which have boundaries defined solely by lines of latitude and longitude

===Mountains===
{{See also|Mountain peaks of Colorado}}
The summit of [[Mount Elbert]] at {{convert|4401.2|m|order=flip}} elevation in [[Lake County, Colorado|Lake County]] is the highest point in Colorado and the Rocky Mountains of North America.<ref name=Mount_Elbert>{{cite ngs|id=KL0637|designation=Mount Elbert|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref> Colorado is the only U.S. state that lies entirely above 1000 meters elevation. The point where the [[Arikaree River]] flows out of [[Yuma County, Colorado]], and into [[Cheyenne County, Kansas]], is the lowest point in Colorado at {{convert|1011|m|order=flip}} elevation. This point, which holds the distinction of being the highest low elevation point of any state,<ref name=USGS>{{cite web| date = April 29, 2005| url = http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest| title = Elevations and Distances in the United States| publisher = U.S. Geological Survey| accessdate =October 19, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=U.S. Geological Survey |title=Elevations and Distances |url=http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |accessdate=September 8, 2006}}</ref> is higher than the high elevation points of 18 states and the District of Columbia.
[[File:Picketwire Canyon.jpg|thumb|A view of the arid high plains in Southeastern Colorado]]
[[File:Calhanpm.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Calhan Paint Mines]] on the Colorado Eastern Plains]]

===Plains===
A little less than one half of the area of Colorado is flat and rolling land. East of the Rocky Mountains are the [[Colorado Eastern Plains]] of the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]], the section of the Great Plains within Nebraska at elevations ranging from roughly {{convert|3350|to|7500|ft|m}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.summitpost.org/colorado-county-highpoints/532245|title=Colorado County Highpoints|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> The Colorado plains are usually thought of as [[prairie]]s, but actually they have many patches of [[deciduous forests]], [[butte]]s, and [[canyons]], much like the high plains in New Mexico as well. Eastern Colorado is presently mainly covered in farmland, along with small farming villages and towns. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is fair, averaging from {{convert|15|to|25|in|mm}} annually.<ref name=ccc>{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/climateofcolorado.php|title=Climate of Colorado|last1=Doesken|first1=Nolan J.|last2=Pielke |first2=Roger A., Sr.|authorlink2=Roger A. Pielke|last3=Bliss |first3=Odilia A.P.|date=January 2003|publisher=Colorado Climate Center – Department of Atmospheric Science – [[Colorado State University]]|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>
[[maize|Corn]], wheat, [[hay]], [[soybeans]], and [[oats]] are all typical crops, and most of the villages and towns in this region boast both a [[water tower]] and a [[grain elevator]]. As well as the farming of crops, Eastern Colorado has a good deal of livestock raising, such as at cattle ranches and [[Intensive pig farming|hog farms]] and [[irrigation]] water is available from the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams, and also from subterranean sources, including [[artesian well]]s. However, heavy use of ground water from wells for irrigation has caused underground water reserves to decline.
[[File:Condiv.JPG|thumb|[[Front Range]] Peaks west of Denver]]

===Front range===
Most of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The only other significant population centers are the cities of [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]], and [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], all in western Colorado.

===Continental Divide===
[[File:Continental-Divide Monarch-Pass 2012-10-28.JPG|thumb|left|[[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at [[Monarch Pass]]]]
The [[Continental Divide of the Americas]] extends along the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope of Colorado]]. Drainage water west of the Continental Divide flows to the southwest via the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] into the [[Gulf of California]].

Within the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins.  In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Park County, Colorado)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.

===Southern region===
[[File:Mt Herard sand.JPG|thumb|left|The tallest dunes in North America at [[Great Sand Dunes National Park]] in southern Colorado]]
In southmost Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]], and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.
[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|right|The high desert lands that make up the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado]]

===Peaks===
{{main|Mountain peaks of Colorado}}
To the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Evans]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].
[[File:SANJUANMTNS.JPG|thumb|Peaks of the [[San Juan Mountains]]]]

The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain about 53 peaks that are {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [[Colorado fourteeners|fourteeners]].<ref>{{cite web|author=U.S. Forest Service|title=Rocky Mountain Region 14ers |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/recreation/14ers/ |accessdate=November 6, 2009}}</ref> These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [[conifer]]s and [[aspen]]s up to the [[tree line]], at an elevation of about {{convert|12140|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in southern Colorado to about {{convert|10500|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in northern Colorado. Above this only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year round.

Much of the alpine snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few snowcapped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. [[Mount Elbert]] is the highest summit of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of North America all lie within the state.

===Colorado Western Slope===
[[File:Grand Valley, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The Grand Valley in Western Colorado, a large valley made up of high desert terrain. The city of Grand Junction is located in the heart of the valley]]
The Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] and the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]) or by evaporation in its arid areas. The Colorado River flows through [[Glenwood Canyon]] and then through an arid valley made up of desert from [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]] to [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute]], through the desert canyon of [[De Beque Canyon]], and into the arid desert of [[Grand Valley (Colorado)|Grand Valley]], where the city of Grand Junction is located. Also prominent in or near the southern portion of the Western Slope are the [[Grand Mesa]], which lies to the southeast of Grand Junction; the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range; and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]], a high arid region that borders Southern Utah.

The city of [[Grand Junction, Colorado]] is the largest city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [[television broadcasting]] west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Higher education in and near the Western Slope can be found at [[Colorado Mesa University]] in Grand Junction, [[Western State College of Colorado]] in Gunnison, [[Fort Lewis College]] in Durango, and [[Colorado Mountain College]] in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs.

Grand Junction is located along [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], the only major highway in Western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]]. This railroad also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s [[California Zephyr]] passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways.

[[File:Colorado National Monument (4939640266).jpg|thumb|right|The Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction. The monument is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations]]

The Western Slope lies in close proximity to multiple notable destinations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]], with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]].

The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which is not only a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeds. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado.

From west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands, desert plateaus, alpine mountains, National Forests, relatively flat grasslands, scattered forests, buttes, and canyons in the western edge of the [[Great Plains]]. The famous [[Pikes Peak]] is located just west of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=5689 |name=Pikes Peak, Colorado |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}</ref>

Desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as the [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Canon City, Colorado|Canon City]], [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Canyon of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Ute Mountain]], [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado National Monument]], and other areas surrounding the [[Uncompahgre Plateau]] and [[Uncompahgre National Forest]].

[[File:Four Corners Monument (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Four Corners Monument]], with [[Ute Mountain]] in the distance]]
Colorado is one of four states in the United States that share a common geographic point the [[Four Corners]] together with Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. At this intersection, it is possible to stand in four states at once.

==Climate==
The [[climate]] of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the [[Mountain States]] region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate.

As a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.

===Eastern Plains===
[[File:PivotWithDrops.JPG|thumb|[[Center pivot irrigation|Center-pivot irrigation]] of wheat growing in [[Yuma County, Colorado|Yuma County]]]]

The climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: [[Cold semi-arid climate|''BSk'']]) with low [[humidity]] and moderate [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|mm|abbr=on}} annually. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to the space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds.

In summer, this area can have many days above 95&nbsp;°F (35&nbsp;°C) and often 100&nbsp;°F (38&nbsp;°C).<ref name="Climate of Colorado">[http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm DRI.edu] Western Regional Climate Center. Retrieved October 24, 2006.</ref> On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to −10&nbsp;°F (−4 to −23&nbsp;°C). About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from [[thunderstorm]]s, which can be severe, and from major [[snowstorm]]s that occur in the winter and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.<ref name="Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=096427&refer=&cityname=Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America|title=Denver, Colorado Travel Weather Averages|publisher=Weatherbase |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>

In much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[chinook wind]]s which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70&nbsp;°F (21&nbsp;°C) or higher in the winter.<ref name="Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America" /> The average July temperature is 55&nbsp;°F (13&nbsp;°C) in the morning and 90&nbsp;°F (32&nbsp;°C) in the afternoon. The average January temperature is 18&nbsp;°F (−8&nbsp;°C) in the morning and 48&nbsp;°F (9&nbsp;°C) in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40&nbsp;°F (22&nbsp;°C).

===West of the plains and foothills===
West of the plains and foothills, the weather of Colorado is much less uniform. Even places a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography of the area. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate, which becomes an [[alpine climate]] at higher elevations. Humid [[microclimate]]s also exist in some areas. Generally, the wettest season in western Colorado is winter while June is the driest month.

The mountains have mild summers with many days of high temperatures between 60 and 85&nbsp;°F (16 and 29&nbsp;°C), although thunderstorms can cause sudden but brief drops in temperature. The winters bring abundant, powdery snowfall to the mountains with plenty of sunshine between major storms. The western slope has high summer temperatures similar to those found on the plains, while the winters tend to be slightly cooler due to the lack of warming winds common to the plains and Front Range. Other areas in the west have their own unique climate.

===Extreme weather===
[[File:October Snow in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Snow highlights the rugged mountains, as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains.]]

Extreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although the majority of extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental Divide in the spring and summer, yet are usually brief. [[Hail]] is a common sight in the mountains east of the divide and in the northwest part of the state. The Eastern Plains have had some of the biggest hail storms in North America.<ref name=ccc/>

The Eastern Plains are part of the extreme western portion of [[Tornado Alley]]; some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 [[Limon, Colorado|Limon]] [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado and the 2008 [[Windsor, Colorado|Windsor]] [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF3]] tornado, which devastated the small town.<ref>{{cite web

 | url =http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/16408116/detail.html}}</ref>
The plains are also susceptible to occasional floods, which are caused both by [[thunderstorm]]s and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather. Denver's record in 1901 for the number of consecutive days above  90&nbsp;°F (32&nbsp;°C) was broken during the summer of 2008. The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.<ref>{{cite web

 | publisher =[[National Weather Service]]
 | accessdate =October 10, 2009
 | url =http://www.crh.noaa.gov/bou/?n=consec90}}</ref>

Much of Colorado is a very dry state averaging only {{convert|17|in|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation per year statewide and rarely experiences a time when some portion of the state is not in some degree of drought.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/pdfs/ahistoryofdrought.pdf|title=A History of Drought|format=PDF |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of [[wildfire]]s in the state, such as the [[Hayman Fire]], one of the largest wildfires in American history, and the [[Fourmile Canyon#Fourmile Canyon Fire|Fourmile Canyon Fire]] of 2010, which until the [[Waldo Canyon Fire]] of June 2012, and the [[Black Forest Fire]] of June 2013, was the most destructive wildfire in Colorado's recorded history.

However, some of the mountainous regions of Colorado receive a huge amount of moisture from winter snowfalls. The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the [[Yampa River]], the [[Colorado River]], the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]], the North Platte River, and the South Platte River.
[[File:Overlook of Yampa River.jpg|thumb|250px|The Yampa River, from a high overlook]]

Water flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of the southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, as well as the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas. A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently), the flow of water reaches northern Mexico.

===Earthquakes===
Despite its mountainous terrain, Colorado is relatively quiescent seismically. The [[U.S.]] [[National Earthquake Information Center]] is located in [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]].

On August 22, 2011, a 5.3 [[Seismic scale|magnitude]] earthquake occurred nine miles [[Boxing the compass|WSW]] of the city of [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]].<ref>[http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsus/Maps/US2/36.38.-106.-104.php ] {{wayback|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsus/Maps/US2/36.38.-106.-104.php |date=20130117052953 }}</ref> There were no casualties and only a small amount of damage was reported.

{{Main|History of Colorado|Timeline of Colorado history}}
The region that is today the state of Colorado has been inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for more than 13,000 years. The [[Lindenmeier Site]] in [[Larimer County, Colorado|Larimer County]] contains [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating from approximately 11200 BC to 3000 BC. The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a [[Human migration|major migration route]] that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]] lived in the [[valley]]s and [[mesa]]s of the [[Colorado Plateau]].<ref>"[http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/genocide-native-americans-ethnic-cleansing.html Genocide Wiped Out Native American Population ]", Discovery News, September 20, 2010.</ref> The [[Ute Nation]] inhabited the mountain valleys of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Western Rocky Mountains]], even as far east as the Front Range of present day. The [[Apache]] and the [[Comanche]] also inhabited Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. At times, the [[Arapaho Nation]] and the [[Cheyenne Nation]] moved west to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]].

The U.S. acquired a territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim by [[Spain]] to the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas River Basin]] as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of [[Santa Fé de Nuevo Méjico]]. In 1806, [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and expelled from Mexico the following July.

The U.S. relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the U.S. admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Territory of Missouri]] to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[state of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and remained so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-Onís Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835–1836 fomented a dispute between the U.S. and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the U.S. with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848.
[[File:Mexican Cession in Mexican View.PNG|thumb|Map of the Mexican cession, with the white representing the territory the United States received from Mexico. Well over half of Colorado was received during this treaty.]]

Most American [[settler]]s traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], namely the new goldfields of California, or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of the [[State of Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass (Wyoming)]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the rivers [[Green River (Utah)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]]. The federal government of the U.S. flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government, because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and sanctioned [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[state of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Mexican American]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], later to become Colorado's first permanent [[European American|Euro-American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]].
[[File:Anasazi Heritage Center.jpg|thumb|The Anasazi Heritage Center in [[Dolores, Colorado|Dolores]]]]

In 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.

The gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.

===Territory act===
[[File:1860 colorado territory map.png|thumb|left|The territories of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] before the creation of the [[Territory of Colorado]]]]
Thirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].<ref name=ColoradoTerritory>{{cite web | url = http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/territory.pdf | title = An Act to provide a temporary Government for the Territory of Colorado | format = PDF | publisher = [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress]] | date = February 28, 1861 | accessdate =June 12, 2007}}</ref> The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged today. The name Colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the [[Colorado River]] originated in the territory.<ref name=Colorado_River>Early explorers identified the [[Gunnison River]] in Colorado as the [[headwaters]] of the Colorado River. The [[Colorado River|Grand River]] in Colorado was later tentatively identified as the primary headwaters of the river. Finally in 1916, [[E.C. LaRue]], the Chief Hydrologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], identified the Green River in southwestern Wyoming as the proper headwaters of the actual, overall Colorado River.</ref> In 1776, Spanish priest [[Silvestre Vélez de Escalante]] recorded that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the area knew the river as ''[[:es:Rio Colorado|el Rio Colorado]]'' for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.<ref>{{cite web |author=State of Colorado – Division of Information Technologies |url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/symbemb.htm#Name|title=State Names and Nicknames |accessdate=November 15, 2006}}</ref> In 1859, a [[U.S. Army]] [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=Macomb>Report of the exploring expedition from Santa Fé, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859: under the command of Capt. J. N. Macomb, Corps of topographical engineers, Volume 1 [https://archive.org/stream/reportofexplorin00unitrich#page/n5/mode/2up @ archive.org]</ref> The Macomb party designated the confluence as the source of the Colorado River.

On April 12, 1861, [[South Carolina]] artillery opened fire on [[Fort Sumter]] to start the [[American Civil War]]. While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause.

In 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and ran off 500 of their horses and mules. The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [[San Antonio]] in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.

In 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming [[U.S. President|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the [[Sand Creek massacre]].

In the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a few stayed and developed mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in Colorado Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to [[Julesburg, Colorado|Weir]], now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [[San Juan Mountains]] on the [[Ute tribe|Ute Indian]] reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year.

The discovery of a major silver lode near [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]] in 1878 triggered the [[Colorado Silver Boom]]. The [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] of 1890 invigorated silver mining, and Colorado's last, but greatest, gold strike at [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers. Colorado women were granted the [[suffrage|right to vote]] beginning on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [[universal suffrage]] and the first one by a [[popular vote]] (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered.

Colorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] met in Denver in 1908. By the [[United States Census, 1930|U.S. Census in 1930]], the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s, but a major wave of [[immigration]] following World War II boosted Colorado's fortune. Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy, and high technology became an important economic engine. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.

Three [[warship]]s of the [[U.S. Navy]] have been named the USS ''[[USS Colorado|Colorado]]''. The first USS ''Colorado'' was named for the Colorado River. The later two ships were named in honor of the state, including the [[battleship]] USS ''[[USS Colorado (BB-45)|Colorado]]'' which served in [[War in the Pacific|World War II in the Pacific]] beginning in 1941. At the time of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], this USS ''Colorado'' was located at the naval base in San Diego, Calif. and hence went unscathed.

People of [[Hispanic and Latino American]] (of any race made) heritage, made up 20.7% of the population.<ref>http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&prodType=table</ref> According to the 2000 Census, the largest ancestry groups in Colorado are [[German American|German]] (22%) including of Swiss and [[Austrians|Austrian]] nationalities, [[Mexican-American|Mexican]] (18%), Irish (12%), and English (12%). Persons reporting [[German American|German ancestry]] are especially numerous in the Front Range, the Rockies (west-central counties) and Eastern parts/High Plains.

Colorado has a high proportion of [[Hispanic]], mostly [[Mexican-American]], citizens in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado Springs, as well as the smaller cities of Greeley and Pueblo, and elsewhere. Colorado is well known for its strong Latino culture and presence. Southern, Southwestern, and Southeastern Colorado has a large number of [[Hispanos]], the descendants of the early Mexican settlers of colonial Spanish origin. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported Colorado's population as 8.2% Hispanic and 90.3% non-Hispanic white.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For The United States, Regions, Divisions, and States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> The Hispanic population of Colorado has continued to grow quickly over the past decades. By 2012, Hispanics made up 21% of Colorado's population, and [[Non-Hispanic White]]s made up 69%.<ref name="quickfacts.census.gov"/>

Colorado, like New Mexico, is very rich in Spanish idioms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elcastellano.org/palabra.php?id=946 |title=talking about Colorado in "nada" |publisher=Elcastellano.org |date=June 30, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref>

Colorado also has some large African-American communities located in Denver, in the neighborhoods of Montbello, Five Points, Whittier, and many other East Denver areas. A relatively large population of African Americans are also found in Colorado Springs on the east and southeast side of the city. The state has sizable numbers of Asian-Americans of [[Mongolian American|Mongolian]], [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Filipino American|Filipino]], [[Koreans|Korean]], [[Southeast Asian]] and [[Japanese American|Japanese]] descent. The highest population of Asian Americans can be found on the south and southeast side of Denver, as well as some on Denver's southwest side. The Denver metropolitan area is considered more liberal and diverse than much of the state when it comes to political issues and environmental concerns.

There were a total of 70,331 births in Colorado in 2006. (Birth Rate of 14.6). In 2007, non-Hispanic whites were involved in 59.1% of all the births.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr57/nvsr57_12.pdf |title=National Vital Statistics Reports, Volume 57, Number 12, (March 18, 2009) |format=PDF |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> Some 14.06% of those births involved a non-Hispanic white person and someone of a different race, most often with a couple including one Hispanic. A birth where at least one Hispanic person was involved counted for 43% of the births in Colorado.<ref>[http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/scripts/htmsql.exe/cohid/natalityPub.hsql CDPHE.state.co.us<!-- Bot generated title -->], COHID Birth Data Request</ref> As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], Colorado has the seventh highest percentage of Hispanics (20.7%) in the U.S. behind [[New Mexico]] (46.3%), California (37.6%), Texas (37.6%), [[Arizona]] (29.6%), [[Nevada]] (26.5%), and Florida (22.5%). Per the 2000 census, the Hispanic population is estimated to be 918,899 or approximately 20% of the state total population. Colorado has the 5th largest population of [[Mexican-Americans]] behind California, Texas, Arizona, and Illinois. In percentages, Colorado has the 6th highest percentage of Mexican-Americans behind New Mexico, California, Texas, Arizona, and Nevada.<ref>[http://www.statemaster.com/state/CO-colorado/peo-people<!-- Bot generated title -->], Statemaster Colorado</ref>

In 2011, 46% of Colorado's population younger than the age of one were minorities, meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white.<ref>[http://www.adworks.org/pdf/LosingGround_e-book.pdf That state is Colorado.

The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] estimates that the total state product in 2010 was $257.6 billion.<ref>{{cite web|title=GDP by State|url=http://greyhill.com/gdp-by-state|publisher=Greyhill Advisors|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref> [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita (nominal)|Per capita personal income]] in 2010 was $51 940, ranking Colorado 11th in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/spi/2009/pdf/spi0309.pdf |title=References |format=PDF |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> The state's economy broadened from its mid-19th century roots in mining when irrigated agriculture developed, and by the late 19th century, raising livestock had become important. Early industry was based on the extraction and processing of minerals and agricultural products. Current agricultural products are cattle, wheat, [[dairy product]]s, [[maize|corn]], and [[hay]].

The [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] is also a major economic force in the state with many important federal facilities including [[NORAD]] (North American Aerospace Defense Command), [[United States Air Force Academy]], Schriever Air Force Base located approximately 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of [[Peterson Air Force Base]], and Fort Carson, both located in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] within El Paso County; [[NOAA]], the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ([[NREL]]) in Golden, and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]; [[U.S. Geological Survey]] and other government agencies at the [[Denver Federal Center]] near [[Lakewood, Colorado|Lakewood]]; the [[Denver Mint]], [[Buckley Air Force Base]], the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals]] and the [[Byron G.

In addition to these and other [[Independent Agencies of the United States Government|federal agencies]], Colorado has abundant [[United States National Forest|National Forest]] land and four [[List of National Parks of the United States|National Parks]] that contribute to federal ownership of {{convert|24615788|acre|km2|0}} of land in Colorado, or 37% of the total area of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.state.co.us/resource/documents/TotalCOLandOwnership.xls|title=Colorado Land Ownership by County (acres) |date=January 1997 |first=Tony|last=Frank |format=Excel |publisher=Colorado Department of Agriculture |accessdate=July 15, 2007|archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20060116094720/http%3A//www.ag.state.co.us/resource/colorado_land_ownership.html |archivedate = January 16, 2006}} [http://www.ag.state.co.us/resource/colorado_land_ownership.html Colorado Department of Agriculture: Land Ownership]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref>
In the second half of the 20th century, the industrial and service sectors have expanded greatly. The state's economy is diversified and is notable for its concentration of scientific research and high-technology industries. Other industries include [[food processing]], transportation equipment, [[Mechanical engineering|machinery]], [[chemical engineering|chemical products]], the extraction of metals such as gold (see [[Gold mining in Colorado]]), silver, and [[molybdenum]]. Colorado now also has the largest annual production of beer of any state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2007/nov/24/reuteman-colorado-rides-on-fat-tire-to-beer/ |title=Colorado rides on Fat Tire to beer heights |publisher=Rockymountainnews.com |date=November 24, 2007 |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}</ref> Denver is an important financial center.

A number of nationally known brand names have originated in Colorado factories and laboratories. From [[Denver#Economy|Denver]] came the forerunner of telecommunications giant [[Qwest Corporation|Qwest]] in 1879, [[Samsonite]] luggage in 1910, [[Gates Corporation|Gates]] belts and hoses in 1911, and [[Russell Stover Candies]] in 1923. Kuner canned vegetables began in [[Brighton, Colorado|Brighton]] in 1864. From [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]] came [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] beer in 1873, [[CoorsTek]] industrial ceramics in 1920, and [[Jolly Rancher]] candy in 1949. [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|CF&I]] railroad rails, wire, nails and pipe debuted in [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]] in 1892. [[Imperial Sugar|Holly Sugar]] was first milled from beets in [[Holly, Colorado|Holly]] in 1905, and later moved its headquarters to Colorado Springs. The present-day [[Swift & Company|Swift]] packed meat of [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]] evolved from Monfort of Colorado, Inc., established in 1930. [[Estes Industries|Estes]] model rockets were launched in [[Penrose, Colorado|Penrose]] in 1958. [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] has been the home of [[Woodward Governor Company]]'s motor controllers (governors) since 1870, and [[Oral irrigator|Waterpik]] dental water jets and showerheads since 1962. [[Celestial Seasonings]] herbal teas have been made in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] since 1969. [[Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory]] made its first candy in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] in 1981.

Colorado has a flat 4.63% [[income tax]], regardless of income level. Unlike most states, which calculate taxes based on federal ''adjusted gross income'', Colorado taxes are based on ''taxable income'' – income after federal exemptions and federal itemized (or standard) deductions.<ref>Colorado individual income tax return (2005) [http://www.revenue.state.co.us/PDF/05104f.pdf Revenue.state.co.us].

Retrieved September 26, 2006.</ref> Colorado's state [[sales tax]] is 2.9% on retail sales. When state revenues exceed state constitutional limits, according to Colorado's [[Taxpayer Bill of Rights]] legislation, full-year Colorado residents can claim a sales tax refund on their individual state income tax return. Many counties and cities charge their own rates in addition to the base state rate. There are also certain county and special district taxes that may apply.

Real estate and personal business property are taxable in Colorado. The state's senior property tax exemption was temporarily suspended by the Colorado Legislature in 2003. The tax break is scheduled to return for assessment year 2006, payable in 2007.

As of August 2014, the state's unemployment rate is 5.3%.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/lau/ Bls.gov]; Local Area Unemployment Statistics</ref>

===Philanthropy===
Major philanthropic organizations based in Colorado, include the [[Daniels Fund]], the Anschutz Family Foundation, the [[Gates Family Foundation]], the El Pomar Foundation and the [[Boettcher Foundation]] grant each year from approximately $7 billion<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cof.org/files/Documents/Government/StateGiving/CO.pdf |title=Philanthropy in Colorado |website=Colorado Association of Funders |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019131121/http://www.cof.org/files/Documents/Government/StateGiving/CO.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013}}</ref> of assets.

===Natural resources===
[[File:Grand Junction Trip 92007 131.JPG|thumb|An [[oil well]] in western Colorado]]
Colorado has significant [[hydrocarbon]] resources. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], Colorado hosts seven of the Nation's 100 largest natural gas fields and two of its 100 largest [[oil field]]s. Conventional and unconventional natural gas output from several Colorado basins typically account for more than 5 percent of annual U.S. natural gas production. Colorado's [[oil shale]] deposits hold an estimated {{convert|1|Toilbbl|km3}} of oil – nearly as much oil as the entire world's proven oil reserves; the economic viability of the oil shale, however, has not been demonstrated.<ref>{{cite web

[[Uranium mining in Colorado]], United States, goes back to 1872, when pitchblende ore was taken from gold mines near Central City, Colorado. The Colorado uranium industry has seen booms and busts, but continues to this day. Not counting byproduct uranium from phosphate, Colorado is considered to have the third largest uranium reserves of any US state, behind Wyoming and New Mexico.

Uranium price increases from 2001 to 2007 prompted a number of companies to revive uranium mining in Colorado. However, price drops and financing problems in late 2008 have forced some companies to cancel or scale back uranium-mining projects. There are no currently producing uranium mines in Colorado.

Colorado's high Rocky Mountain ridges and eastern plains offer [[wind power]] potential, and geologic activity in the mountain areas provides potential for [[geothermal electricity|geothermal power]] development. Much of the state is sunny and could produce [[solar power in Colorado|solar power]]. Major rivers flowing from the Rocky Mountains offer [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] resources. Corn grown in the flat eastern part of the state offers potential resources for [[ethanol]] production.

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Colorado}}
[[File:Colorado.JPG|thumb|left|A Colorado state welcome sign]]

Colorado's primary mode of transportation (in terms of passengers) is its highway system. [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|Interstate&nbsp;25]] (I-25) is the primary north–south highway in the state, connecting Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Denver, and Fort Collins, and extending north to Wyoming and south to New Mexico. [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|I-70]] is the primary east–west corridor. It connects Grand Junction and the mountain communities with Denver, and enters Utah and Kansas. The state is home to a network of US and Colorado highways that provide access to all principal areas of the state. Smaller communities are only connected to this network via county roads.

[[File:DIA.jpg|thumb|right|The main terminal of Denver International Airport evokes the peaks of the [[Front Range]].]]
[[Denver International Airport]] (DIA) is the fourth busiest domestic U.S. airport and thirteenth [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|busiest world airport]]<ref>[http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&cp=1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ Year to Date Passenger Traffic]</ref> DIA handles by far the largest volume of commercial air traffic in Colorado, and is the busiest U.S. hub airport between Chicago and the Pacific coast, making Denver the most important airport for connecting passenger traffic in the western United States.
Denver International Airport is the primary hub for low-cost carrier [[Frontier Airlines]], with routes throughout North America. It is also the fourth-largest hub of the world's largest airline, [[United Airlines]]. DIA is a [[focus city]] for [[Southwest Airlines]], which since commencing service to Denver in January 2006, has added over 50 destinations, making Denver its fastest-growing market. Denver International Airport is the only airport in the United States to have implemented an [[ISO 14001]]-certified environmental management system covering the entire airport.<ref>{{cite web |title=2009 Annual Report|url=http://business.flydenver.com/community/enviro/documents/annualReport2009.pdf|work=City & County of Denver Department of Aviation|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref>

Extensive public transportation bus services are offered both intra-city and inter-city—including the Denver metro area's extensive RTD services. The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD) operates the popular [[RTD Bus & Light Rail]] transit system in the [[Denver Metropolitan Area]]. As of January 2013 the RTD rail system had 170 light rail vehicles, serving {{convert|47|mi|km}} of track.

[[File:California Zephyr--Eastbound meets Westbound in Glenwood Canyon.jpg|thumb|left|The westbound and eastbound ''[[California Zephyr]]s'' meet in the [[Glenwood Canyon]].]]
[[Amtrak]] operates two rail passenger lines through Colorado, including the Glenwood Canyon route of the famed [[California Zephyr]], one of America's legendary passenger trains.
Colorado's contribution to world railroad history was forged principally by the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] which began in 1870 and wrote the book on mountain railroading. In 1988 the "Rio Grande" acquired, but was merged into, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] by their joint owner [[Philip Anschutz]]. On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], creating the largest railroad network in the United States. The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific's principal competitor in western U.S. railroading. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.

Colorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage. It is integral to the U.S. economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |title=Railroads and States |publisher=Aar.org |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>

===State government===
{{See also|Political party strength in Colorado}}
Like the federal government and all other U.S. states, Colorado's [[Constitution of the State of Colorado|state constitution]] provides for three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches.

The [[Governor of Colorado]] heads the state's executive branch. The current governor is [[John Hickenlooper]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. Colorado's other statewide elected executive officers are the [[Lieutenant Governor of Colorado]] (elected on a [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with the Governor), [[Secretary of State of Colorado]], [[Colorado State Treasurer]], and [[Attorney General of Colorado]], all of whom serve four-year terms.

===Special districts===
The state of Colorado has more than 3,000 districts with taxing authority. These districts may provide schools, law enforcement, fire protection, water, sewage, drainage, irrigation, transportation, recreation, infrastructure, cultural facilities, business support, redevelopment, or other services.

Some of these districts have authority to levy sales tax and well as property tax and use fees. This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado. There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.

Some of the more notable Colorado districts are:
* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties
* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties
** It is a 0.1% retail sales and use tax (one penny on every $10).
** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.
** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three "tiers" among which receipts are allocated by percentage.
*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.
*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.
*** Tier III has over 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, and natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding to the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.
** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.
* The Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the [[Denver Broncos]]' stadium [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]]
* Local Improvement Districts (LID) within designated areas of southeast Jefferson and Boulder counties
* Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) taxes at varying rates in Basalt, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, Gunnison County

Colorado is considered a [[swing state]] in both state and federal elections. Coloradans have elected 17 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, only voting for the Democratic candidate in 1964 and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state by the turn of the century, and voted consecutively for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.

Colorado politics has the contrast of conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and a few western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.

The state of Colorado is represented by its two [[United States Senator]]s:
* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 2]] – [[Cory Gardner]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2015–
* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 3]] – [[Michael Bennet]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2009–
Colorado is represented by seven [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]]:
* [[Colorado's 1st congressional district]] – [[Diana DeGette]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 1997–
* [[Colorado's 2nd congressional district]] – [[Jared Polis]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2009–
* [[Colorado's 3rd congressional district]] – [[Scott Tipton]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2011–
* [[Colorado's 4th congressional district]] – [[Ken Buck]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2015–
* [[Colorado's 5th congressional district]] – [[Doug Lamborn]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2007–
* [[Colorado's 6th congressional district]] – [[Mike Coffman]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2009–
* [[Colorado's 7th congressional district]] – [[Ed Perlmutter]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2007–

===Significant bills passed in Colorado===
On the November 8, 1932 ballot, Colorado approved the [[Repeal of Prohibition|repeal of alcohol prohibition]] more than a year before the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified.

In 2012, voters amended the state constitution to protect [[Colorado Amendment 64|"personal use" of marijuana for adults]], establishing a framework to regulate [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in a manner similar to [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. The first recreational marijuana shops in Colorado, and by extension the United States, opened their doors on January 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Healy|first=Jack|title=Colorado Stores Throw Open Their Doors to Pot Buyers|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/us/colorado-stores-throw-open-their-doors-to-pot-buyers.html?_r=0|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref>
