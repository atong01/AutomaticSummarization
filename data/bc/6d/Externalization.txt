{{About|the general case|externalization of cost, in the context of economics|externality}}

'''Externalization''' means to put something outside its original borders, especially to put a human function outside the human body.  The opposite of externalization is [[internalization]].

In a concrete sense, by taking notes, we can externalize the function of [[memory]] which normally belongs in the [[Human brain|brain]].

In a more abstract sense, by [[making excuses]], we can externalize the [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] associated with our actions.

In [[Freud]]ian psychology, externalization is an [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[defence mechanism|defense mechanism]] by which an individual "[[psychological projection|projects]]" his or her own internal characteristics onto the outside world, particularly onto other people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Title Projection, identification, projective identification |first=Joseph |last=Sandler|publisher= Karnac Books|year= 1988|isbn=0-946439-40-0}}</ref> For example, a patient who is overly argumentative might instead perceive others as argumentative and himself as [[blame shifting|blameless]].

Like other defense mechanisms, externalization is a protection against [[anxiety]] and is, therefore, part of a healthy, normally functioning mind. However, if taken to excess, it can lead to the development of a [[neurosis]].

Externalization can also be used in the context of a corporation. A corporation that [[externality|externalizes its costs]] onto society and the environment is not taking full responsibility and ownership of these costs. An example might be the discharge of untreated toxic waste into a river where people wash and fish.
