A '''concept album''' is a studio album where all musical or lyrical ideas contribute to [[narrative|a single overall theme or unified story]].<ref>Shuker, Roy: ''Popular Music: The Key Concepts'', page 5. ISBN 0-415-28425-2. 2002.</ref> In contrast, typical studio albums consist of a number of unconnected songs (lyrically and otherwise) performed by the artist. It has been argued<ref name=Shute>{{cite book|last=Shute|first=Gareth|title=Concept Albums|year=2013|publisher=Investigations Publishing|location=Auckland|page=13|url=}}</ref> that concept albums should refer only to albums that bring in themes or story lines from outside of music, given that a collection of love songs or songs from within a certain genre are not usually considered to be a "concept album."

==History==
{{See also|Album era}}

===1940s–1960s===
[[Woody Guthrie]]'s ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'' (1940) is regarded as one of the first concept albums, consisting exclusively of semi-autobiographical songs about the hardships of American migrant labourers during the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news|title=The return of concept album|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-return-of-concept-album-1796064.html|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=2 October 2009}}</ref> [[Merle Travis]]' ''[[Folk Songs of the Hills]]'' (1947) can be considered a concept album as it exclusively features songs about working life on railroads and in coal mines.

In the early 1950s, before the advent of rock and roll, concept albums were prevalent in jazz music. Singer [[Frank Sinatra]] recorded several concept albums, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955; songs about loneliness and heartache) and ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1958; songs about world travel).<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=5Ny7Z1c-4zEC&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Restless in the promised land |author=Jim Cullen |page=98 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield, 2001 |accessdate=9 April 2011 |isbn= 978-1-58051-093-6 |date= 1 June 2001}}</ref> Singer/pianist [[Nat King Cole]]'s concept albums include ''After Midnight'' (1956; collaborations with jazz instrumentalists in the style of late-night jam sessions) and "Penthouse Serenade" (1955; songs detailing the "cocktail piano" era.).

After finding success with stand-alone singles, country icon [[Johnny Cash]] turned to themed albums, such as ''[[Songs of Our Soil]]'' (1959; songs about death and mortality), ''[[Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian]]'' (1961) and ''[[Blood, Sweat and Tears (album)|Blood, Sweat and Tears]]'' (1963; songs about blue-collar workers).

====Early rock concept albums====
{{Specific-section|date=September 2014}}
Since ''Colorful Ventures'' (1961), [[The Ventures]] became known for releasing concept albums, including surf music, country, outer space, television themes, and psychedelic music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandcastlevi.com/ventures/venthst.htm |title=The Fabulous Ventures – Band History |publisher=Sandcastle V.I. |date= |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref> [[Bobby Vinton]]'s ''[[Blue on Blue (Bobby Vinton album)|Blue on Blue]]'', a concept album containing all songs with the word "blue" in the title, produced two top-10 hits, the title track and "[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]."

In 1966, several albums were deemed as concept albums by their thematically-linked songs, and became inspiration for other artists to follow. [[The Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' portrayed [[Brian Wilson]]'s state of mind at the time, and was in turn a major inspiration to [[Paul McCartney]]. Album writers Brian Wilson and Tony Asher insist that the narrative was not intended, though Wilson has stated that the idea of the record being a "concept album" is mainly within the way the album was produced and structured.<ref>Laura Tunbridge, The Song Cycle, (Cambridge University Press, 2011), ISBN 0-521-72107-5, p.173.</ref> Later in 1966, Wilson began work on ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', an intentional narrative, though it was scrapped and later revived in November 2011. ''[[Freak Out!]]'', [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]]'s sardonic farce about rock music and America as a whole, and ''[[Face to Face (The Kinks album)|Face to Face]]'' by [[The Kinks]], the first collection of [[Ray Davies]]'s idiosyncratic character studies of ordinary people, are conceptually oriented albums. However, of the three, only ''Pet Sounds'' attracted a large commercial audience.

''Save for a Rainy Day'', by [[Jan & Dean]], had a concept featuring all rain-themed songs. In between each song there is a sound of rain. [[Dean Torrence]] recorded this album in 1966 as Jan & Dean soon after [[Jan Berry]] had his car crash near Dead Man's Curve in California. Torrence posed with Berry's brother Ken for the album cover photos. [[Columbia Records]] released one single from the project ("Yellow Balloon") as did the song's writer, [[Gary Zekley]], with [[The Yellow Balloon (band)|The Yellow Balloon]], but with legal wrangles scuttling Torrence's Columbia deal and Berry's disapproval of the project, ''Save for a Rainy Day'' remained a self-released album on the J&D Record Co. label (JD-101).<ref>Studio and Legal documentation in possession of Mark A. Moore.</ref> [[Sundazed Records]] reissued ''Save for a Rainy Day'' in 1996 in CD and vinyl formats, as well as the collector's vinyl 7" companion EP, "Sounds For A Rainy Day," featuring four instrumental versions of tracks from the album.

[[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', released in June 1967, would later bring about the notion of the concept album, with the earlier prototypes and examples from [[traditional pop music]] and other genres sometimes forgotten. Original reception described the album as a concept by select definitions of the term. There was, at some stage during the making of the album, an attempt to relate the material to firstly the idea of aging, then as an obscure radio play about the life of an ex-army bandsman and his shortcomings. These concepts were lost in the final production. While debate exists over the extent to which ''Sgt. Pepper'' qualifies as a true concept album, there is no doubt that its reputation as such helped inspire other artists to produce concept albums of their own, and inspired the public to anticipate them. [[John Lennon|Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]] distanced themselves from the "concept album" tag as applied to that album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595610/1_sgt_peppers_lonely_hearts_club_band |title=Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: Rolling Stone |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1 November 2003 |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

''[[Days of Future Passed]]'', released the same year as ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'', was fellow British musicians [[The Moody Blues]]' first concept album. Originally presented with an opportunity to rock out [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9 "From the New World"]] by their new stereophonic label, the band instead forged ahead to unify their own orchestral-based threads of a day in the life of a common man.<ref>{{cite web|last = Eder|first = Bruce|authorlink = |coauthors = |title = The Moody Blues: Biography| work = |publisher = AMG [All Music Group, a subsidiary of Macrovision]| year = 2009|url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4948/biography|pure_url=yes}}| format = |doi = |accessdate =28 July 2009}}</ref>

''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' by [[The Who]] followed with its concept of a [[pirate radio]] broadcast. Within the record, joke commercials recorded by the band and actual [[jingle]]s from recently outlawed pirate radio station [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] were interspersed between the songs, ranging from pop songs to [[hard rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]], culminating with a mini-opera titled "Rael."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6598681/113_the_who_sell_out |title=113) The Who Sell Out: Rolling Stone |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1 November 2003 |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

In October 1967, British psychedelic rock group [[Nirvana (UK band)|Nirvana]] released their debut album, ''[[The Story of Simon Simopath]]'', to moderate commercial success. The songs' lyrics depict the life and death of the titular hero, blending various [[Mythology|mythological themes]], such as the existence of [[centaur]]s and [[goddess]]es, with those of [[science fiction]].

''[[S.F. Sorrow]]'' by British group the [[Pretty Things]], released in December 1968, is generally considered to be among the first creatively successful rock concept albums, in that each song is part of an overarching unified concept – the life story of the main character, Sebastian Sorrow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/reviews/article/24787/prettythings-sf |title=The Pretty Things: S.F. Sorrow – PopMatters Music Review |publisher=PopMatters |date=6 January 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

The album ''[[Head (The Monkees album)|Head]]'' by [[The Monkees]], released in 1968, and the soundtrack to the movie of the same name, was their final album and only concept album. It contains psychedelic songs that ventured away from their usual pop rock offerings such as "[[Porpoise Song (Theme from Head)|Porpoise Song]]". It also contains "Do I Have To Do This All Over Again" and "Can You Dig It", which are very different from their usual songs.

''[[The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands]]'' was a facetious effort from [[The Turtles]], who were at war with their record label [[White Whale Records]]. The album, released in November 1968, portrayed a [[battle of the bands]] between various widely varying fictional bands (all portrayed by the Turtles). It spawned two hits: "[[You Showed Me]]," written by members of [[The Byrds]]; and "[[Elenore]]," a spoof of their earlier hits and sarcastic response to White Whale (who had constantly pressured the band for more [[sunshine pop]] hits in the vein of their earlier work) that thanks to slick production became a hit in its own right.

The [[rock opera]] ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'', released in April 1969, was composed by [[Pete Townshend]] and performed by [[The Who]]. This acclaimed work was presented over [[Double album|two LPs]] and it took the idea of thematically based albums to a much higher appreciation by both critics and the public. It was also the first story-based concept album of the rock era (as distinct from the ''song-cycle'' style album) to enjoy commercial success. The Who went on to further explorations of the concept album format with their follow-up project ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'', which was abandoned before completion, and with their 1973 rock opera, ''[[Quadrophenia]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004122/Pete-Townshend.html |title=Pete Townshend Biography – Discography, Music, Lyrics, Album, CD, Career, Famous Works, and Awards |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

Five months after the release of ''Tommy'', [[The Kinks]] released another concept album, ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]'' (September 1969), written by [[Ray Davies]]; though considered by some a rock opera, it was originally conceived as the score for a proposed but never realised BBC television drama. It was the first of several concept albums released by the band through the first few years of the 1970s. These were: ''[[Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One]]'' (1970), ''[[Muswell Hillbillies]]'' (1971), ''[[Preservation: Act 1]]'' (1973), ''[[Preservation: Act 2]]'' (1974), ''[[Soap Opera (album)|Soap Opera]]'' (1975) and ''[[Schoolboys in Disgrace]]'' (1976).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001298/Ray-Davies.html |title=Ray Davies Biography – Discography, Music, Lyrics, Album, CD, Career, Famous Works, and Awards |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

===1970s–1990s===
{{Specific-section|date=September 2014}}
[[File:DarkSideOfTheMoon1973.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pink Floyd]] in mid-performance of ''[[Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973)]]
[[Pink Floyd]] released four concept albums during the 1970s; ''[[Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973),'' [[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), [[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|''Animals'']] (1977), and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979).<ref>{{Citation | title = Pink Floyd Biography | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p76669/biography|pure_url=yes}} | last = Unterberger | first = Richie | publisher = allmusic.com | accessdate =2 August 2009}}</ref>

In addition to Britain, bands from the European mainland were pushing the limitations of the three-minute song format, regularly requiring two sides of a single LP to complete a statement.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} [[Magma (band)|Magma]], from France, debuted in 1970 with an eponymous concept album, ''[[Magma (album)|Magma]]'', about refugees fleeing a doomed Earth to settle on the fictional planet Kobaïa. From Greece, [[Aphrodite's Child]], helmed by keyboardist [[Vangelis]], released ''[[666 (Aphrodite's Child album)|666]]'' in 1972. The double album, based on various passages from [[The Bible]], was controversial for its title and sleeve notes. Italy's [[Banco del Mutuo Soccorso]] released ''[[Darwin!]]'' in 1972, a success that lead to the band to signing with [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]]'s [[Manticore Records]]. [[Triumvirat]], a German progressive rock band signed with [[EMI]] to produce several concept albums including ''[[Mediterranean Tales]]'', ''[[Pompeii (album)|Pompeii]]'' and in 1975, what is considered by many{{Who|date=August 2013}} to be a masterpiece of the genre, ''[[Spartacus (Triumvirat album)|Spartacus]]''.

The Americas also produced their share of concept albums during this period.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} From 1975 to 1979, Canadian progressive power trio [[Rush (band)|Rush]] released three albums containing sidelong epics, regarded by some as concept albums (though not actually concept albums by strict definition of the term; that is, none of the other songs on the album have anything to do with each other or the 20-minute sidelong epic, so there is no pervasive concept or story). The first of these was released in 1975, titled ''[[Caress of Steel]]''. The second was their breakthrough album, ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'', released the following year in 1976. Their third was released in 1978, ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]''.

Concept albums were hardly the exclusive product of progressive rock bands in the 1970s. From Country to Glam, artists from all genres would embrace the popularity of the LP to explore broader concepts that the 45 would have made impossible.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} [[Michael Nesmith]] blossomed creatively after quitting [[The Monkees]], as an originator of what would become [[Country rock]]  and in 1974 released the elaborately packaged concept album ''[[The Prison: A Book with a Soundtrack]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} [[Willie Nelson]] is a pioneer of concept albums within country music.<ref>Stimeling, T.D. (2011). "‘Phases and stages, circles and cycles’: Willie Nelson and the concept album". ''Journal of Popular Music, 30''(3),389-408.</ref>  In 1974 he released ''[[Phases and Stages]]'' describing a divorce from the viewpoint of the woman on Side One and the man on Side Two. His 1975 album, ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'', about the fatal estrangement of a cowboy from his unfaithful wife, followed and would reach #1 on the American country charts.

[[Dolly Parton]]'s 1973 concept album ''[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]]'' told the story of her rural Appalachian childhood, culminating in the song "Down on Music Row", which detailed her departure at age 18 for Nashville to embark on her career; her 1981 album ''[[9 to 5 and Odd Jobs]]'' (built around her hit song "[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|Nine to Five]]"), was a concept album that focused on work and employment.

Although the progressive rock genre had begun to decline in popularity by the late 1970s, concept albums were still proving successful for well-established progressive rock bands, and a new subgenre, [[neo-progressive rock]], emerged in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/neo-prog-ma0000012218 | title= Neo-Prog | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>

[[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] reinvented themselves as a sleek trio with the release of 1980's ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]''. This tale of fame, wealth, success and lost love was arguably the band's first full LP concept since 1974's ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]''. It was a huge commercial success, becoming their first [[List of UK Albums Chart number ones of the 1980s|UK number one album]], and began a new, pop-oriented era for the band. "[[Turn It On Again]]" became the band's second UK top ten single.<ref name="David Roberts">David Roberts. ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]''. Guinness World Records Limited</ref> Whether ''Duke'' qualifies as a concept album is a matter of some confusion.

Inspired by ''[[The Wall]]'', glam rock band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] recruited Lou Reed for lyrical assistance and released ''[[Music from "The Elder"]]'' in 1981. Due to the album's radical departure in musical style compared to Kiss's previous offerings, ''Music from "The Elder"'' became the group's poorest selling and charting album in their history. It has, however, grown in cult status since its release.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1985, the British [[neo-progressive rock]] band [[Marillion]] achieved their only [[List of UK Albums Chart number ones of the 1980s|UK number one album]] – and the best-selling album of their career – with ''[[Misplaced Childhood]]'', a concept album featuring lyrics by frontman [[Fish (singer)|Fish]] which were partly autobiographical. The album was played as two continuous pieces of music on the two sides of the vinyl and produced the band's two biggest hit singles, "[[Kayleigh]]" and "[[Lavender (Marillion song)|Lavender]]".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/misplaced-childhood-mw0000190815 | title= Misplaced Childhood | publisher=AllMusic | first=John | last=Franck | accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref> The band's follow-up in 1987, ''[[Clutching at Straws]]'', has also been described as a concept album.<ref>{{cite book |last=Borthwick |first=Stuart |title=Popular Music Genres: An Introduction |year=2004|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0748617456}} "the linked songs in a concept album (Clutching At Straws)"</ref>

In 1988, British heavy metal pioneers, [[Iron Maiden]] released their only concept album to date, [[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (album)|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]], which focused on concepts of prophecies, premonitions, good vs. evil and follows a vague story line of a boy who possess special powers due to his bloodline. The album has been highly praised critically and it debuted at No. 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. This progressive metal style proved extremely influential and would later be copied by many other progressive metal bands. 

[[Styx (band)|Styx]] continued to have multiplatinum albums with their 1981 release ''[[Paradise Theater (album)|Paradise Theater]]'' (a concept album about a decaying theater in Chicago which became a metaphor for childhood and American culture) and 1983's ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'' (a science fiction rock opera about a future where moralists imprison rockers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/features/article/8636/concept-albums-are-once-again-in-vogue-in-the-digital-age/ |title=Music Feature &#124; Concept Albums Are Once Again in Vogue in the Digital Age |publisher=PopMatters |date= |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref> The elaborate concept would produce the band's last top ten hit in the U.S. with  "Mr. Roboto", but arguments over the direction of the band toward increasingly dramatic concept productions led to breakup in 1984.

In the 1990s [[neo-progressive rock]] had all but faded from popular music, but some bands, such as Marillion, still had a sizeable cult fanbase. Their 1994 concept album, ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'', was described as "the most complex Marillion release to date",<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/brave-mw0000108993 | title= Brave | publisher=AllMusic | first=Dale | last=Jensen | accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref> and became the final Marillion album to reach the UK top ten.<ref name="David Roberts"/> With the advent of [[alternative rock]], however, a number of artists still continued to use the format within that genre. Other concept albums to then emerge not only from rock, but also from hiphop were to soon follow, especially in the mafioso themed, N.Y. stylized music of acts like [[Mobb Deep]], [[Capone-N-Noreaga]], and other Wu-tang works.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===2000s–present===
[[Arcade Fire]]'s 2010 concept album ''[[The Suburbs (album)|The Suburbs]]'' debuted at #1 and won [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the 2011 [[Grammy Awards]]. Its themes focus on regret and lost youth.

[[Black Veil Brides]] album [[Wretched and Divine: The Story of the Wild Ones]] is a concept album made in 2012 with some of the songs in a film called [[Legion of the Black]]. The plot follows a young girl, called Eve Black, who is a big fan of the band, but no one understands her ([[Wretched and Divine]]) and when she tries to fight back against everyone, she is placed inside a mental hospital ([[Lost It All]]). The following happens in her mind as she tries to escape. A woman is running from a soldier of the organization called "F.E.A.R." and is caught and killed (I Am Bulletproof). [[Andy Biersack]], the band's singer, finds her and brings her back to his base camp, where "The Wild Ones" and the [[Legion of the Black]] hide (also "Lost It All"), and, along with the Legion, cremate her remains ([[New Year's Day]]). The following night, soldiers of F.E.A.R. kidnap some of the members of the Legion (Days Are Numbered). Finally fed up with F.E.A.R, The group rallies together (Resurrect the Sun). Meanwhile, someone gives the girl the key to her cell and she escapes to a church ([[Overture]]). They storm the tower where F.E.A.R. lays and rescue all their captives and defeat F.E.A.R.'s armies and sees the fall of F.E.A.R (Shadows Die). There, she becomes a Wild One (Done for You and [[In the End]]). Also, the leader of F.E.A.R, played by Wil Francis, rises up and makes new soldiers, hinting that a sequel could be made.[[Andy Biersack]] played The Prophet, [[Christian Coma]] played The Destroyer, Jeremy Miles Fergoson ([[Jinxx]]) played The Mystic, [[Jake Pitts]] played The Mourner, [[Ashley Purdy]] The Deviant and Alicia Vigil played Eve Black.

All of [[Coheed and Cambria]]'s studio albums are concept albums, but in their case the idea is taken a step further: their entire discography is putatively one grand conceptual interpretation of an epic story authored by lead singer [[Claudio Sanchez]] in [[graphic novel]]s titled ''[[The Amory Wars]]''.

[[Danny Brown (rapper)|Danny Brown]]'s ''[[XXX (Danny Brown album)|XXX]]'', released in 2011, is considered a concept album about growing up, the fall of Detroit, and the impact of drugs on both.<ref>{{cite web|title=Danny Brown - XXX|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.16367/title.danny-brown-announces-free-album-xxx-due-august-15th|publisher=Listen At Work|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>  The album received critical acclaim, including being named SPIN's #1 rap album of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=SPIN's 40 Best Rap Albums of 2011|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/spins-40-best-rap-albums-2011/?page=0%252C7|publisher=SPIN|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>
[[Dream Theater]]'s [[Octavarium]] is based on the human personality, and its connection to an octave, having eight 'bad' traits and 5 'good' traits. The title track details each of the band member's own struggle with the Octavarium. The album was released on January seventh, in 2005.

[[The Flaming Lips]] concept ''[[Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots]]'' was a commercial and critical success in 2002 even winning a Grammy Award for [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].

[[Green Day]]'s concept ''[[American Idiot]]'' was released in 2004. The album describes the story of a central character named Jesus of Suburbia. After its release it went on to achieve success worldwide, charting in 27 countries and peaking at number one in 19 of them, including the US and the UK. It also won a Grammy in 2005 for Best Rock Album and was nominated for Album of the Year.

[[Linkin Park]]'s 4th studio album ''[[A Thousand Suns]]'', released in 2010 is widely regarded as a partial concept album. The album alludes to the [[human condition]] and focuses on the human fear of nuclear warfare. A Thousand Suns was met with highly polarized reception by critics and fans alike, with a number reviewers praising the album's bold direction while many others dismissed it as a general disappointment. The album spent 30 weeks on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' and sold 2,600,000 copies worldwide as of June 2014.

[[Marina And The Diamonds]] album, [[Electra Heart]], is a concept album about the embodiment of "female identity", with the main character Electra Heart portraying herself in the form of several female archetypes, known as the "Idle Teen", "Homewrecker", "Beauty Queen", and "Housewife". Diamandis released eleven music videos through YouTube during the promotional campaign for Electra Heart. The album was her second album, released in 2012, and the record debuted at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] with first-week sales of 21,358 copies.

[[My Chemical Romance]]'s ''[[The Black Parade]]'' is a concept album describing the death of a cancer patient. He dies halfway through the album and continues to reflect on his life throughout the rest of the album. Released on October 23, 2006, it is largely considered to be [[My Chemical Romance]]'s pinnacle work. ''[[Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys]]'' is another concept album set in 2019. The band members embody their alteregos the Killjoys – rocking renegades on a mission to destroy an evil corporation (Better Living Industries) with help from pirate-radio DJ Dr. Death. The album was released on November 22, 2010 and was the final full studio album My Chemical Romance released.

[[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]]'s 2nd studio album, [[The Defamation of Strickland Banks]] released in 2010, narrates the tale of a fictional character, Strickland Banks, a British soul singer who is falsely accused of rape by an obsessed groupie.

[[Starset]]'s album Transmissions is a concept album recorded from 2013-2014. The narrative begins under the directive of a character named Dr. Ashton Wise, who the Ohio-based band claims to be acting as the mouthpiece for the Starset Society, a fictional collective whose aim is to publish major scientific discoveries that have been silenced by the government and other agencies. The album is centered around a supposed transmission of human origin that was broadcast from the constellation [[Ophiuchus]], which foretells the future and demise of mankind. Led by frontman Dustin Bates (frontman for [[Downplay]]), Starset set up an elaborate online presence—complete with scientific videos, documents, links to shadowy agencies, etc. -- that led up to the album's eventual release in 2014. The first two singles, "Carnivore" and "My Demons," appeared in 2013, introducing the band's dramatic style, which includes electronic elements, strings, heavy alt-rock, and mysterious sample recordings surrounding the theme of the album.

[[Taylor Swift]]'s 2010 album ''[[Speak Now]]'' is considered a concept album revolving mainly about things that were unspoken in the past and the power to tell the truth. The album is one of the best selling albums of the years 2010 and 2011. ''Speak Now'' notably charted all its fourteen standard edition songs on the Billboard Hot 100.

[[Lady Gaga]]'s 2009 EP ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' is another example of a concept album, as Lady Gaga described each track to be a 'monster' she has encountered, "my 'Fear of Sex Monster,' my 'Fear of Alcohol Monster,' my 'Fear of Love Monster,' my 'Fear of Death Monster,' my 'Fear of Loneliness Monster,' etc...".

Finnish folk-epic metal band [[Turisas]]'s 2nd and 3rd studio albums, [[The Varangian Way]] (2007) and [[Stand Up and Fight (album)|Stand Up and Fight]] (2011), narrate the journey of a band of Nordic warriors who travel to [[Constantinople]] in the 11th century and enlist to fight for the [[Byzantine Empire]] against various Middle Eastern invaders. Several songs feature a plot involving the [[Varangian Guard]], the elite bodyguard of the Byzantine emperor, and the lyrics incorporate, inter alia, Greek honorific titles, period battle cries and other overt historical references. The two albums constitute a pseudo-historical narrative and have been considered by reviewers a form of 'public history'.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Appendix Vol. 1.
