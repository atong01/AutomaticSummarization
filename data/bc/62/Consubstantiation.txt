'''Consubstantiation''' is a theological doctrine that (like [[Transubstantiation]]) attempts to describe the nature of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Eucharist]] in concrete [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] terms. It holds that during the [[sacrament]], the fundamental "[[Substance theory|substance]]" of the body and blood of [[Christ]] are present ''alongside'' the substance of the bread and wine, which remain present.

The doctrine of consubstantiation is often held in contrast to the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]]. While some Lutherans use the term "consubstantiation" to describe their doctrine, many reject it as not accurately reflecting the eucharistic doctrine of [[Martin Luther]], the [[sacramental union]].<ref name=WELS/><ref>F.L.

Lutherans believe that the bread and the wine are present in a natural manner in the Lord’s Supper and Christ’s true body and blood are present in an illocal, supernatural manner. |accessdate=26 Jan 2015 }}</ref>

In [[England]] in the late 14th century, there was a political and religious movement known as [[Lollardy]]. Among much broader goals, the Lollards affirmed a form of consubstantiation—that the Eucharist remained physically bread and wine, while becoming spiritually the body and blood of Christ. Lollardy survived up until the time of the [[English Reformation]].

Literary critic [[Kenneth Burke]]'s dramatism takes this concept and utilizes it in secular rhetorical theory to look at the [[dialectic]] of unity and difference within the context of [[logology]].<ref>http://bradley.bradley.edu/~ell/burke.html</ref>
