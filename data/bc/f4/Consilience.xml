That is, when multiple sources of evidence are in agreement, the conclusion can be very strong even when none of the individual sources of evidence are very strong on their own.

Accessed: 17 October 2015.</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Description</heading><paragraph>Consilience requires the use of independent methods of measurement, meaning that the methods have few shared characteristics. That is, the mechanism by which the measurement is made is different; each method is dependent on an unrelated natural phenomenon. For example, the accuracy of laser rangefinding measurements is based on the scientific understanding of<space/><link><target>laser</target><trail>s</trail></link>, while satellite pictures and meter sticks rely on different phenomena. Because the methods are independent, when one of several methods is in error, it is very unlikely to be in error in the<space/><italics>same way</italics><space/>as any of the other methods, and a difference between the measurements will be observed.<extension extension_name='ref' group="note">Note that this is not the same as performing the same measurement several times. While repetition does provide evidence because it shows that the measurement is being performed consistently, it would not be consilience and would be more vulnerable to error.</extension><space/>If the scientific understanding of the properties of lasers were inaccurate, then the laser measurement would be inaccurate but the others would not.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>As a result, when several different methods agree, this is strong evidence that<space/><italics>none</italics><space/>of the methods are in error and the conclusion is correct. This is because of a greatly reduced likelihood of errors: for a consensus estimate from multiple measurements to be wrong, the errors would have to be similar for all samples and all methods of measurement, which is extremely unlikely.<space/><link><target>Random errors</target></link><space/>will tend to cancel out as more measurements are made, due to<space/><link><target>regression to the mean</target></link>;<space/><link><target>systematic errors</target></link><space/>will be detected by differences between the measurements (and will also tend to cancel out since the direction of the error will still be random). This is how<space/><link><target>Scientific theory</target><part>scientific theories</part></link><space/>reach high confidence over time, they build up a large degree of evidence which converges on the same conclusion.<extension extension_name='ref' group="note">Statistically, if three different tests are each 90% reliable when they give a positive result, a positive result from all three tests would be 99.9% reliable; five such tests would be 99.999% reliable, and so forth. This requires the tests to be<space/><link><target>statistically independent</target></link>, analogous to the requirement for independence in the methods of measurement.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>When results from different strong methods do appear to conflict, this is treated as a serious problem to be reconciled.

Those techniques with the fewest (or no) shared characteristics provide the strongest consilience and result in the strongest conclusions. This also means that confidence is usually strongest when considering evidence from different fields, because the techniques are usually very different.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>For example, the theory of<space/><link><target>evolution</target></link><space/>is supported by a convergence of evidence from<space/><link><target>genetics</target></link>,<space/><link><target>molecular biology</target></link>,<space/><link><target>paleontology</target></link>,<space/><link><target>geology</target></link>,<space/><link><target>biogeography</target></link>,<space/><link><target>comparative anatomy</target></link>,<space/><link><target>comparative physiology</target></link>, and many other fields.<extension extension_name='ref' name="SciAm"><italics>Scientific American</italics>, March 2005. &quot;The Fossil Fallacy.&quot;<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-fossil-fallacy'>Link.</link></extension><space/>In fact, the evidence within each of these fields is itself a convergence providing evidence for the theory. (As a result, to disprove evolution, most or all of these independent lines of evidence would have to be found to be in error.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Shermer"></extension>) The strength of the evidence, considered together as a whole, results in the strong scientific consensus that the theory is correct.<extension extension_name='ref' name="SciAm"></extension><space/>In a similar way, evidence about the<space/><link><target>history of the universe</target></link><space/>is drawn from astronomy, astrophysics, planetary geology, and physics.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Shermer"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Finding similar conclusions from multiple independent methods is also evidence for the reliability of the methods themselves, because consilience eliminates the possibility of all potential errors that do not affect all the methods equally. This is also used for the validation of new techniques through comparison with the consilient ones. If only partial consilience is observed, this allows for the detection of errors in methodology; any weaknesses in one technique can be compensated for by the strengths of the others. Alternatively, if using more than one or two techniques for every experiment is infeasible, some of the benefits of consilience may still be obtained if it is well-established that these techniques usually give the same result.</paragraph><paragraph>Consilience is important across all of science, including the social sciences,<extension extension_name='ref'>For example, in linguistics: see<space/><italics>Converging Evidence: Methodological and theoretical issues for linguistic research, edited by Doris Schonefeld.</italics><space/><link type='external' href='http://books.google.ca/books?id=nGKT-2VwO0UC&amp;amp;pg=PT92&amp;amp;dq=Converging+Evidence&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=ipfuT_jrOIjpqAHnrp2OAg&amp;amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Converging%20Evidence&amp;amp;f=false'>Link.</link></extension><space/>and is often used as an argument for<space/><link><target>scientific realism</target></link><space/>by philosophers of science.

The concept that all the different areas of research are studying one real, existing universe is an apparent explanation of why scientific knowledge determined in one field of inquiry has often helped in understanding other fields.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Deviations from consilience</heading><paragraph>Consilience does not forbid deviations: in fact, since not all experiments are perfect, some deviations from established knowledge are expected. However, when the convergence is strong enough, then new evidence inconsistent with the previous conclusion is not usually enough to outweigh that convergence. Without an equally strong convergence on the new result, the weight of evidence will still favor the established result. This means that the new evidence is most likely to be wrong.</paragraph><paragraph>Science<space/><link><target>denialism</target></link><space/>(for example,<space/><link><target>HIV/AIDS denialism</target><part>AIDS denialism</part></link>) is often based on a misunderstanding of this property of consilience. A denier may promote small gaps not yet accounted for by the consilient evidence, or small amounts of evidence contradicting a conclusion without accounting for the pre-existing strength resulting from consilience. More generally, to insist that all evidence converge precisely with no deviations would be nave falsificationism,<extension extension_name='ref' name="Lakatos">For example, see<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/pmo/eng/Lakatos-Falsification.pdf'>Imre Lakatos.</link>, in<space/><italics>Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge</italics><space/>(1970).</extension><space/>equivalent to considering a single contrary result to<space/><link><target>Falsifiability</target><part>falsify</part></link><space/>a theory when another explanation, such as equipment malfunction or misinterpretation of results, is much more likely.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Lakatos"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' group="note">More generally, anything which results in a false positive or false negative.</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>In history</heading><paragraph>Historical evidence also converges in an analogous way. For example: if five ancient historians, none of whom knew each other, all claim that<space/><link><target>Julius Caesar</target></link><space/>seized power in Rome in 49 BCE, this is strong evidence in favor of that event occurring even if each individual historian is only partially reliable. By contrast, if the same historian had made the same claim five times in five different places (and no other types of evidence were available), the claim is much weaker because it originates from a single source. The evidence from the ancient historians could also converge with evidence from other fields, such as archaeology: for example, evidence that many senators fled Rome at the time, that the battles of<space/><link><target>Caesars civil war</target></link><space/>occurred, and so forth.</paragraph><paragraph>Consilience has also been discussed in reference to<space/><link><target>Holocaust denial</target></link>.<space/><template><target>quote</target><arg name=""We [have now discussed] eighteen proofs all converging on one conclusion...the deniers shift the burden of proof to historians by demanding that ''each'' piece of evidence, independently and without corroboration between them, prove the Holocaust.
