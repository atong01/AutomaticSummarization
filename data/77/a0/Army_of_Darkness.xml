Filming took place in California in 1991.<space/><italics>Army of Darkness</italics><space/>premiered on October 9, 1992 at the Sitges Film Festival, and was released in the United States on February 19, 1993. It grossed $11.503 million domestically and another $10 million outside the USA for a total worldwide gross of $21.5 million. Critical response was positive. Since its video release it has acquired a massive<space/><link><target>Cult film</target><part>cult following</part></link>, along with the other two films in the trilogy. The film was dedicated to<space/><link><target>Irvin Shapiro</target></link>, who died during the film's production in 1989 on New Year's Day. The effects artist on the film was Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger from KNB Effects.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Plot</heading><paragraph>After being pulled through a<space/><link><target>time portal</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Ash Williams</target></link><space/>(<link><target>Bruce Campbell</target></link>) lands in<space/><link><target>A.D.</target></link><space/>1300, where he is soon captured by Lord Arthur's (<link><target>Marcus Gilbert (actor)</target><part>Marcus Gilbert</part></link>) men, who suspect him to be an agent for Duke Henry (Richard Grove), with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he fights off a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man (<link><target>Ian Abercrombie</target></link>). After demanding Henry and his men be set free (as he knew Henry was innocent, and his persecution was simply a<space/><link><target>witch hunt (disambiguation)</target><part>witch hunt</part></link>) and killing a deadite in full view of everyone, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He also grows attracted to Sheila (<link><target>Embeth Davidtz</target></link>), the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.</paragraph><paragraph>According to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is to retrieve the<space/><italics><link><target>Necronomicon#In popular culture</target><part>Necronomicon Ex-Mortis</part></link></italics>, a book with magical powers. After bidding goodbye to Sheila, Ash starts his search for the<space/><italics>Necronomicon</italics>. As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash through the woods. Fleeing, he ducks into a windmill where he crashes into a mirror. The small reflections of Ash climb out from the shattered mirror and torment him. One of the reflections dives down Ash's throat and uses his body to become a life-sized clone of Ash and attack him, after which Ash kills and buries the clone.</paragraph><paragraph>When he arrives at the<space/><italics>Necronomicon</italics><template><target>'</target></template>s location, he finds three books instead of one. Ash eventually finds the real one and attempts to say the magic phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely&amp;nbsp; &quot;<link><target>Klaatu barada nikto</target></link>&quot;. However, forgetting the last word, he tries to trick the book by mumbling and coughing the missing word. He then grabs the book from the cradle, and rushes back to the castle, while the dead rise from graves all around. During Ash's panicked ride back, his evil copy rises from his grave and unites the Deadites into the Army of Darkness.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite causing the predicament faced by the medieval soldiers, Ash initially demands to be returned to his own time. However, Sheila is captured by a Flying Deadite, and later transformed into a Deadite. Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the army of the dead. Reluctantly, the people agree to join Ash. Using scientific knowledge from textbooks in the trunk of his 1973<space/><link><target>Oldsmobile 88</target><part>Oldsmobile Delta 88</part></link>, and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the Deadites and Evil Ash, saving Sheila and bringing peace between Arthur and Henry in the process. The Wise Men return him to his own time, giving him a potion to drink after reciting the magic phrase.</paragraph><paragraph>Back in the present, Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at his job, working in housewares at a store called &quot;S-Mart&quot;. As he talks to a girl who is interested in his story, a surviving deadite, allowed to come to the present due to Ash again forgetting the last word of the magic phrase, attacks the customers. Ash attacks and kills it using a<space/><link><target>Winchester rifle</target></link><space/>from the store's Sporting Goods department, finally ending the deadite threat.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Original ending</heading><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">April 2015</arg></template>The original ending, preferred by Raimi and Campbell themselves, in which Ash oversleeps in the cave and wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future, was restored to the film for the UK VHS release, which also had the S-Mart ending put in as a post-credit extra. This scene has been restored on the<space/><italics>Army of Darkness: Director's Cut</italics><space/>Region 3 DVD released by<space/><link><target>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</target></link>, the &quot;director's cut bootleg edition&quot; DVD and the double-disc DVD, which also featured the S-Mart ending of the film. The S-Mart ending was shot for the American release; the studio wanted to end the film on a high note for the character of Ash. Raimi believed Ash to be more of a fool, which is why he liked to torture him so much in his films; Ash being a goof and drinking too much potion was in his character.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Cast</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Bruce Campbell</target></link><space/>as<space/><link><target>Ash Williams</target></link>/Evil Ash</listitem><listitem><link><target>Embeth Davidtz</target></link><space/>as Sheila</listitem><listitem><link><target>Marcus Gilbert (actor)</target><part>Marcus Gilbert</part></link><space/>as Lord Arthur</listitem><listitem><link><target>Ian Abercrombie</target></link><space/>as Wise man</listitem><listitem>Richard Grove as Duke Henry the Red</listitem><listitem>Timothy Patrick Quill as Blacksmith</listitem><listitem>Michael Earl Reid as Gold Tooth</listitem><listitem><link><target>Bridget Fonda</target></link><space/>as Linda</listitem><listitem><link><target>Patricia Tallman</target></link><space/>as Possessed witch</listitem><listitem><link><target>Ted Raimi</target></link><space/>as Cowardly warrior / Second supportive villager / Anthony, the S-Mart clerk</listitem><listitem><link><target>Angela Featherstone</target></link><space/>as S-Mart store girl</listitem><listitem>Noah Gillespie as Pit monster</listitem></list><heading level='2'>Production</heading><paragraph>Plans to make a third<space/><italics><link><target>Evil Dead</target></link></italics><space/>film had been circulating for a number of years, even prior to the production of<space/><italics><link><target>Darkman</target></link></italics>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Muir"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="last"><space/>Muir<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>John Kenneth<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink"><space/>John Kenneth Muir<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>The Unseen Force: The Films of Sam Raimi<space/></arg><arg name="work"><space/></arg><arg name="page"><space/>152<space/></arg><arg name="language"><space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>Applause<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>2004<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/></arg></template></extension><space/><italics><link><target>Evil Dead II</target></link></italics><space/>made enough money internationally that<space/><link><target>Dino De Laurentiis</target></link><space/>was willing to finance a sequel.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Muir"></extension><space/>Director and script writer<space/><link><target>Sam Raimi</target></link><space/>drew from a variety of sources, including literature with<space/><italics><link><target>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</target></link></italics><space/>and<space/><link><target>Jonathan Swift</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>Gulliver's Travels</target></link></italics><space/>and films like<space/><italics><link><target>The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)</target><part>Jason and the Argonauts</part></link></italics>, and<space/><link><target>The Three Stooges</target></link>.<space/><italics>Evil Dead II</italics>, according to<space/><link><target>Bruce Campbell</target></link>, &quot;was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Warren"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="last"><space/>Warren<space/></arg><arg name="first"><space/>Bill<space/></arg><arg name="authorlink"><space/>Bill Warren (film historian and critic)<space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>The Evil Dead Companion<space/></arg><arg name="work"><space/></arg><arg name="page"><space/>143<space/></arg><arg name="language"><space/></arg><arg name="publisher"><space/>St. Martin's Griffin<space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/>2000<space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate"><space/></arg></template></extension><space/>Promotional drawings were created and published in<space/><italics><link><target>Variety (magazine)</target><part>Variety</part></link></italics><space/>during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot.
