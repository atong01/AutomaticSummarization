In [[Greek mythology]], '''Cerberus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɜr|b|ər|ə|s}};<ref name="m-w">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Cerberus|title= Cerberus|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=2009-07-16}}</ref> {{lang-grc-gre|Κέρβερος}} ''Kerberos'' {{IPA-el|ˈkerberos|}}), often called the "hound of Hades", is a monstrous [[polycephaly|multi-headed]] dog, who guards the gates of the [[underworld]], preventing the dead from leaving. He was the offspring of the monsters [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]] and [[Typhon]], and is usually described as having three heads, a serpent for a tail, with snakes protruding from various parts of his body. Cerberus is primarily known for his capture by [[Heracles]], one of Heracles' [[Labours of Hercules|twelve labours]].

Descriptions of Cerberus vary, including the number of his heads. Cerberus was usually three-headed, though not always. Cerberus had a multi-headed heritage. His father was the multi snake-headed [[Typhon]],<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D304 300&ndash;314], [[Acusilaus]], fragment 6 (Freeman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B75GgVdxYT0C&pg=PA15 p. 15]), [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html Preface], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae4.html 151], and [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' (or ''Fall of Troy'') [https://archive.org/stream/falloftroy00quin#page/272/mode/2up 6.260&ndash;268 (pp. 272&ndash;275)] all have Cerberus as the offspring of Typhon and Echidna, while [[Bacchylides]], Ode [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0064%3Abook%3DEp%3Apoem%3D5 5.56&ndash;62], [[Sophocles]], ''[[Women of Trachis]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0196%3Acard%3D1076 1097&ndash;1099],  [[Callimachus]], fragment 515 Pfeiffer (Trypanis, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/callimachus-fragments_uncertain_location/1973/pb_LCL421.259.xml?result=2&rskey=li3r52 pp. 258&ndash;259]), and  [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0028:book=4:card=481&highlight=Echidna 4.500&ndash;501], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0028:book=7:card=404&highlight=Cerberian 7.406&ndash;409] all have Cerberus as the offspring of Echidna without naming a father.</ref> and Cerberus was the brother of three other multi-headed monsters, the multi-snake-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]]; [[Orthrus]], the two-headed dog who guarded the Cattle of [[Geryon]]; and the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], who had three heads, that of a lion, a goat, and a snake.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D306 309&ndash;324] (although it is not certain whom Hesiod meant as the mother of the Chimera: Echidna, the Hydra, or Ceto); [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.5.10 2.5.10], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.3.1 2.3.1]; [[Hyginus]],  ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html#Preface Preface].</ref> And, like these close relatives, Cerberus was, with only the rare iconographic exception, multi-headed.

In the earliest description of Cerberus, [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' (c. 8th – 7th century BC), Cerberus has fifty heads, while [[Pindar]] (c. 522 – c. 443 BC) gave him one hundred heads.<ref>Gantz  p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 105, with n. 182; [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+311 311&ndash;312]; [[Pindar]], fragment F249a/b SM, from a lost Pindar poem on Heracles in the underworld, according to a scholia on the ''Iliad''.</ref> However, later writers almost universally give Cerberus three heads.<ref>Ogden 2013a, pp. 105&ndash;106, with n. 183; [[Sophocles]], ''[[Women of Trachis]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+22 22&ndash;25] ("three-bodied"), [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0196%3Acard%3D1076 1097&ndash;1099]; [[Euripides]], ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+610 610&ndash;611], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+1276 1276&ndash;1278]; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Verg.+A.+6.417 6.417&ndash;421] ("triple-throated", "three fierce mouths"), ''[[Georgics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=46DDD4DE402FC078B3A0CA9C8025544E?doc=Verg.+G.+4.483 4.483] ("triple jaws"); [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D4%3Acard%3D416 4.449&ndash;451] ("three-visaged mouths", "triple-barking"); [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Agamemnon'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-agamemnon/2004/pb_LCL078.199.xml 859&ndash;862 (pp. 198&ndash;199)] ("triple chains"), ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.53.xml?result=16&rskey=CRLRlQ 60&ndash;62 (pp. 52&ndash;53)] ("triple necks"), [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.111.xml?result=16&rskey=CRLRlQ 782&ndash;784 (pp. 110&ndash;111)]; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12].</ref> An exception is the Latin poet [[Horace]]'s Cerberus which has a single dog head, and one hundred snake heads.<ref>West, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XCaYMyW1YQQC&pg=PA108 p. 108]; Ogden 2013a, p. 107; [[Horace]], ''Odes'' 3.11.17&ndash;20 (West, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XCaYMyW1YQQC&pg=PA101 pp. 101&ndash;103]) ("a hundred snakes ... triple-tongued"), ''Odes'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0025%3Abook%3D2%3Apoem%3D13 2.13.33&ndash;36] ("hundred-headed"), ''Odes'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0025:book=2:poem=19 2.19.29&ndash;32] ("triple tongue").</ref>

In art Cerberus is most commonly depicted with two heads (visible), never more than three, and occasionally only one.<ref>Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106. According to Gantz, "Presumably the frequent variant of two heads arose from logistical problems in draftmanship," and Ogden wonders if "such images salute or establish a tradition of a two-headed Cerberus, or are we to imagine a third head concealed behind the two that can be seen?"</ref> On one of his two earliest depictions (c. 590&ndash;580 BC), a cup from [[Argos]], now lost, Cerberus is shown as a normal single-headed dog.<ref>Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106, with n. 184 (which also mentions a relief ''pithos'' fragment (c.  590&ndash;570) which seems to show a single lion-headed Cerberus); ''LIMC'' [http://www.limc.ch/public/monument_view.aspx?id=7081 Herakles 2553].</ref> The first appearance of a three-headed Cerberus occurs on a mid sixth century BC cup from [[Laconia]].<ref>Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106, with n. 185; ''LIMC'' [http://www.limc.ch/public/monument_view.aspx?id=13918 Herakles 2605].</ref>

Horace's many snake-headed Cerberus followed a long tradition of Cerberus being part snake. This is perhaps already implied as early as Hesiod, with his mother being the half-snake [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], and his father the snake-headed Typhon. The lost Argos cup shows snakes protruding from Cerberus' body, while the mid sixth-century BC Laconian cup gives Cerberus a snake tail. In the literary record, the first certain indication of Cerberus' serpentine nature comes from the rationalized account of [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] (fl. 500&ndash;494 BC), who makes Cerberus a large poisonous snake.<ref>[[Hecataeus of Miletus]], ''FGrH'' 1 F27 (''apud'' [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+3.25.5 3.25.5]); Ogden 2013a, p. 107.</ref> [[Plato]] refers to Cerberus' composite nature,<ref>[[Plato]] ''[[Republic]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D588c 588c].</ref> and [[Euphorion of Chalcis]] (3rd century BC) describes Cerberus as having multiple snake tails, and presumably in connection to his serpentine nature, associates Cerberus with the creation of the poisonous [[Acontium|aconite]] plant.<ref>Euphorian, fragment 71 Lightfoot (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.301.xml pp. 300&ndash;303]); Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg=PA69 pp. 69&ndash;70]; Ogden 2013a, p. 107.</ref> [[Virgil]] has snakes writhe around Cerberus' neck,<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Verg.+A.+6.417 6.419],</ref> [[Ovid]]'s Cerberus has a venomous mouth,<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D4%3Acard%3D481 4.500&ndash;501].</ref> while [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] gives Cerberus a mane consisting of snakes, and a single snake tail.<ref>[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.113.xml 785&ndash;812 (pp. 112&ndash;113)].

Cerberus was given various other traits. According to [[Euripides]], Cerberus not only had three heads but three bodies,<ref>[[Euripides]] ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+22 22&ndash;25].</ref> and according to Virgil he had multiple backs.<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Verg.+A.+6.417 6.422].</ref> Cerberus ate raw flesh (according to Hesiod),<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D304 311].</ref> had eyes which flashed fire (according to Euphorion), a three-tongued mouth (according to Horace) and acute hearing (according to Seneca).<ref>[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.113.xml 788&ndash;791 (pp. 112&ndash;113)].</ref>

As early as [[Homer]] we learn that Heracles was sent by [[Eurystheus]], the king of [[Tiryns]], to bring back Cerberus from [[Hades]].<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+8.367 8.367&ndash;368]; compare with ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=942966DAA722FA1A71797BE2B6F2624E?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D601 11.620&ndash;626]. Heracles is also given the task by Eurystheus in [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], ''FGrH'' 1 F27 (''apud'' [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+3.25.5 3.25.5]), [[Euripides]], ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+1276 1276&ndash;1278], ''Pirithous'' ''TrGF'' 43 F1 lines 10&ndash;14 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg=PA70 p. 70]; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.647.xml pp. 646&ndash;647]); [[Euphorion of Chalcis]], fragment 71 Lightfoot (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.301.xml pp. 300&ndash;303]); [[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.1]; [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html#32 32].</ref> According to [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], this was the twelfth and final labour imposed on Heracles.<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12]. So also in Euphorion, fragment 71 Lightfoot 13 (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.303.xml pp. 302&ndash;303]), and [[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]], ''[[Chiliades]]'' 2.36.388&ndash;389 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dG0GAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA55 pp. 55&ndash;56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n32/mode/1up p. 33]). [[Euripides]], ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+22 22&ndash;25], calls this labor the last. However according to [[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.2] this labor was the eleventh and next to last, the twelfth being the [[Apples of the Hesperides]].</ref> In a fragment from a lost play ''Pirithous'', (attributed to either [[Euripides]]  or his contemporary [[Critias]])  Heracles says that, although Eurystheus commanded him to bring back Cerberus, it was not from any desire to see Cerberus, but only because Eurystheus thought that the task was impossible.<ref>''Pirthous'' ''TrGF'' 43 F1 lines 10&ndash;14 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg=PA70 p. 70]; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.647.xml pp. 646&ndash;647]); Ogden 2013a, p. 113.</ref>

Heracles was aided in his mission by his being an initiate of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. Euripides has his initiation being "lucky" for Heracles in capturing Cerberus.<ref>[[Euripides]] ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+612 612&ndash;613]; Papadopoulou, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O3A-MUBefHYC&pg=PA163 p. 163].</ref> And both [[Diodorus Siculus]] and Apollodorus say that Heracles was initiated into the Mysteries, in preparation for his descent into the underworld. According to Diodorus, Heracles went to Athens, where [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]], the son of [[Orpheus]], was in charge of the initiation rites,<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.1&ndash;2].</ref> while according to Apollodorus, he went to [[Eumolpus]] at [[Eleusis]].<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12], which adds that, since it was unlawful for foreigners to be initiated, Heracles was adopted by Pylius, and that before Heracles could be inititated, he first had to be "cleansed of the slaughter of the centaurs"; see also Frazer, n. 2.</ref>

Heracles also had the help of [[Athena]] and [[Hermes]].

===Theseus and Pirithous===
While in the underworld, Heracles met the heroes [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]], where the two companions were being held prisoner by Hades for attempting to carry off [[Persephone]], and, along with bringing back Cerberus, Heracles also managed (usually) to rescue Theseus, and in some versions Pirithous as well.<ref>Gantz, pp. 291&ndash;295.</ref> According to Apollodorus, Heracles found Theseus and Pirithous near the gates of Hades, bound to the "Chair of Forgetfulness, to which they grew and were held fast by coils of serpents", and when they saw Heracles, "they stretched out their hands as if they should be raised from the dead by his might", and Heracles was able to free Theseus, but when he tried to raise up Pirithous, "the earth quaked and he let go."<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+Epit.+E.1.24 E.1.24].</ref>

The earliest evidence for the involvement of Theseus and Pirithous in the Cerberus story, is found on a shield-band relief (c. 560 BC) from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], where Theseus and Pirithous (named) are seated together on a chair, arms held out in supplication, while Heracles approaches, about to draw his sword.<ref>''LIMC'' [http://www.limc.ch/public/monument_view.aspx?id=10523 Herakles 3519]; Gantz, p. 292.</ref> The earliest literary mention of the rescue occurs in Euripides, where Heracles saves Theseus (with no mention of Pirithous).<ref>[[Euripides]] ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+1169 1169&ndash;1170.]; Gantz, p. 293.</ref> In the lost play ''Pirithous'', both heroes are rescued,<ref>Gantz, P. 293; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.637.xml pp. 637]; ''Pirithous'' ''TrGF'' 43 F1 Hypothesis (Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.640.xml pp. 640&ndash;641]).</ref> while in the rationalized account of [[Philochorus]], Heracles was able to rescue Theseus, but not Pirithous.<ref>[[Philochorus]], ''FGrH'' 328 F18b (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir5FhAQbcfAC&pg=PA73 p. 73]); Ogden 2013a, p. 109.

===Capture of Cerberus===
There are various versions of how Heracles accomplished Cerberus' capture. According to Apollodorus, Heracles asked Hades for Cerberus, and Hades told Heracles he would allow him to take Cerberus only if he "mastered him without the use of the weapons which he carried", and so, using his lion-skin as shield, Heracles squeezed Cerberus around the head until he submitted.<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 2.5.1].</ref>

In two early sources Cerberus' capture seems to involve Heracles fighting Hades. Homer has Hades injured by an arrow shot by Heracles,<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+5.395 5.395&ndash;397].</ref> while on the early sixth-century BC lost Argos cup, Heracles is shown attacking Hades with a stone.<ref>Ogden 2013a, p. 111. Compare with Seneca, ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.53.xml 48&ndash;51 (pp. 52&ndash;53)], where Heracles brings back "spoils of triumph over that conquered king ... subdued Dis".</ref> A scholium to the ''Iliad'' passage, explains that Hades had commanded that Heracles "master Cerberus without shield or Iron". Heracles did this, by (as in Apollodorus) using his lion-skin instead of his shield, and making stone points for his arrows, but when Hades still opposed him, Heracles shot Hades in anger.<ref>Schol. [[Homer]] ''[[Iliad]]'' 5.395&ndash;397 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg=PA66 p. 66]); Ogden 2013a, p. 112.</ref> Consistent with the no iron requirement, the iconographic tradition, from c. 560 BC, often shows Heracles using his wooden club against Cerberus.<ref>Ogden 2013a, p. 111.</ref>

Euripides, has Amphitryon ask Heracles: "Did you conquer him in fight, or receive him from the goddess [i.e. Persephone]? To which, Heracles answers: "In fight",<ref>[[Euripides]] ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+610 610&ndash;613]. This question is echoed in Seneca, ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.111.xml 760&ndash;761 (pp. 110&ndash;111)], where Amphitryon asks "Is it spoil [Heracles] brings, or a willing gift from his uncle.</ref> and the ''Pirithous'' fragment says that Heracles "overcame the beast by force".<ref>''Pirithous'' ''TrGF'' 43 F1 Hypothesis (Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.640.xml pp. 640&ndash;641]).</ref> However, according to Diodorus, Persphone welcomed Heracles "like a brother" and gave Cerberus "in chains" to Heracles.<ref name="4.26.1"/> Aristophanes, has Heracles gag and seize Cerberus, then run off,<ref>[[Aristophanes]], ''[[Frogs]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0032%3Acard%3D460 465&ndash;469].</ref> while Seneca has Heracles again use his lion-skin as shield, and his wooden club, to subdue Cerberus, after which a quailing Hades and Persephone, allow Heracles to lead a chained and submissive Cerberus away.<ref>[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.113.xml 797&ndash;812 (pp. 112&ndash;113)].</ref> Cerberus is often shown being chained, and Ovid tells that Heracles dragged Cerberus with chains of [[adamant]].<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D404 7.409&ndash;413].</ref>

===Exit from the underworld===
There were several locations which were said to be the place where Heracles brought up Cerberus from the underworld. Seneca has Heracles return with Cerberus at Tainaron, the same place he had entered.<ref>[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.103.xml 663 (pp. 102&ndash;105)] (entrance), [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.111.xml 813 (pp. 112&ndash;113)] (exit). Seneca's account may reflect a much older tradition rationalized by [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], ''FGrH'' 1 F27 (''apud'' [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+3.25.5 3.25.5]), see Ogden 2013a, p. 112.</ref> Apollodorus, who has Heracles descend at Tainaron, has him exit at [[Troezen]].<ref name="2.5.12">[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12].</ref> The geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] tells us that there was a temple at Troezen with "altars to the gods said to rule under the earth", where it was said that, in addition to Cerberus being "dragged" up by Heracles, [[Semele]] was supposed to have been been brought up out of the underworld by [[Dionysus]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.31.2 2.31.2]. See also [[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]], ''[[Chiliades]]'' 2.36.404 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dG0GAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA55 pp. 55&ndash;56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n32/mode/1up p. 33]), which has Cerberus brought up at Troezen.</ref>

Euphorion has Cerberus brought up at [[Heraclea Pontica]],<ref>[[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]], fragment 41 Lightfoot (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.273.xml pp. 272&ndash;275]).</ref> the same place which Xenophon had earlier associated with Heracles' descent. And Euphorion and Ovid make Cerberus the cause of the poisonous plant [[Aconitum|aconite]], which grew in abundance at [[Heraclea Pontica]]. According to Euphorion, when Heracles brought Cerberus up from the underworld, Cerberus "vomited gall" from which the [[Aconitum|aconite]] plant grew up,<ref>[[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]], fragment 41a Lightfoot (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.273.xml pp. 272&ndash;275]); Ogden 2013a, pp. 107&ndash;108.</ref> while according to Ovid, upon leaving the underworld, as Cerberus was being dragged by Heracles from a cave, dazzled by the unaccustomed daylight, Cerberus spewed out a "poison-foam", which made the aconite plants growing there poisonous.<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D404 7.413&ndash;419].</ref> Seneca's Cerberus too, like Ovid's, reacts violently to his first sight of daylight. Enraged, the previously submissive Cerberus struggles furiously, and Heracles and Theseus must together drag Cerberus into the light.<ref>[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.113.xml?result=16&rskey=CRLRlQ 797&ndash;821 (pp. 112&ndash;115)]; see also ''Agamemnon'', [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-agamemnon/2004/pb_LCL078.199.xml 859&ndash;862 (pp. 198&ndash;199)], which has Cerberus "fearing the colour of the unknown light."</ref>

Pausanias reports that according to local legend Cerberus was brought up through a chasm in the earth dedicated to Clymenus (Hades) next to the sanctuary of [[Chthonia]] at [[Ermioni|Hermione]], and in Euripides' ''Heracles'', thought Euripides does not say that Cerberus was brought out there, he has Cerberus kept for a while in the "grove of [[Chthonia]]" at Hermione.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.35.10 2.35.10]; [[Euripides]], ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+610 615].</ref> Pausanias also mentions that at Mount Laphystion in Boeotia, that there was a statue of Heracles [[Charops (mythology)|Charops]] ("with bright eyes"), where the Boeotians said Heracles brought up Cerberus.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.34.5 9.34.5].</ref>

Other locations which perhaps were also associated with Cerberus being brought out of the underworld include, [[Hierapolis]], [[Thesprotia]], and Emeia near [[Mycenae]].<ref>Ogden 2013a, pp. 112&ndash;113.</ref>

===Cerberus presented to Eurystheus, returned to Hades===
In some accounts, after bringing Cerberus up from the underworld, Heracles paraded the captured Cerberus through Greece. Euphorion, has Heracles lead Cerberus through Midea in [[Argolis]], as women and children watch in fear,<ref>Euphorion, fragment 71 Lightfoot  14&ndash;15 (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.303.xml pp. 302&ndash;303]).</ref> and [[Diodorus Siculus]] says of Cerberus, that Heracles "carried him away to the amazement of all and exhibited him to men"<ref name="4.26.1"/> while Seneca has Juno complain of Heracles "highhandedly parading the black hound through Argive cities."<ref>[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.53.xml?result=16&rskey=CRLRlQ 46&ndash;62 (pp. 52&ndash;53)].</ref> and has Heracles greeted by laurel-wreathed crowds, "singing" his praises.

Then, according to Apollodorus, Heracles showed Cerberus to Eurystheus, as commanded, after which he returned Cerberus to the underworld.<ref name="2.5.12"/> However, according [[Hesychius of Alexandria]], Cerberus escaped, presumably returning to the underworld on his own.<ref>[[Hesychius of Alexandria]]
s.v. [https://archive.org/stream/hesychiialexand00schmgoog#page/n276/mode/1up ''eleutheron hydor''] (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg=PA69 pp. 69&ndash;70]); Ogden 2013a, p. 114.</ref>

== In literature ==
[[File:Cerbere.jpg|thumb|Cerberus, as illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]] in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.]]
Cerberus is featured in many prominent works of Greek and Roman literature, most famously in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Peisandros of Rhodes]]' [[epic poem]] the ''[[Labours of Hercules]]'', the story of [[Orpheus]] in [[Plato]]'s ''Symposium'', and in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'',<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D8%3Acard%3D335 8.367&ndash;368].</ref> which is the only known reference to one of Heracles' labours which first appeared in a literary source.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Most occurrences in ancient literature revolve around the basis of the threat of Cerberus being overcome to allow a living being access to the underworld; in the ''Aeneid'' Cerberus was lulled to sleep after being tricked into eating drugged honeycakes and Orpheus put the creature to sleep with his music. In [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', Canto VI, the "great worm" Cerberus is found in the Third Circle of Hell, where he oversees and rends to pieces those who have succumbed to [[gluttony]], one of the [[seven deadly sins]].<ref>Dante. ''Divine Comedy'' [http://www.everypoet.com/archive/poetry/dante/dante_i_06.htm Inferno, canto VI]</ref>

In the [[Cerberus (constellation)|constellation Cerberus]] introduced by  [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687, Cerberus is sometimes substituted for the "branch from the tree of the golden apples" fetched by Atlas from the garden of the Hesperides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/cerberus.htm |title=Ian Ridpath, "Star Tales" |publisher=Ianridpath.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>

== In art ==
Numerous references to Cerberus have appeared in ancient [[Greek art|Greek]] and [[Roman art]],<ref>Bloomfield, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RaoLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA534 pp. 534&ndash;525]</ref> found in [[archaeological]] ruins and often including in statues and architecture, inspired by the mythology of the creature. Cerberus' depiction in ancient art is not as definitive as in literature; the poets and linguists of ancient Greece and Rome mostly agreed on the physical appearance (with the notable exception mentioned above in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' in which he had 50 heads). His depiction in classical art mostly shows the recurring motif of serpents, but the number of heads differs. A statue in the [[Galleria Borghese]] depicts Cerberus with three heads sitting by the side of Hades, while a bronze sculpture depicting Heracles' twelfth labour shows the demi-god leading a two-headed Cerberus from the underworld. The majority of vases depicting the twelfth task also show Cerberus as having two heads. Classical critics have identified one of the earliest works of Cerberus as "the most imaginative," that being a Laconian vase created around 560 BC in which Cerberus is shown with three-heads and with rows of serpents covering his body and heads.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Companion to Classical Mythology|first1=Robert |last1=Lenardon |first2=Mark |last2=Morford |first3=Michael |last3=Sham |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=0-19-514725-1}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
[[File:RomanCerberus.JPG|thumb|right|Detail of [[sculpture]] of god [[Hades]] with Cerberus]]
The name "Cerberus" is a [[Latinised]] version of the Greek ''Kerberos''. The etymology is uncertain. Ogden<ref>Ogden 2013a, p. 105.</ref> refers to attempts to establish an Indo-European etymology as "not yet successful".  It has been claimed to be related to the [[Sanskrit]] word सर्वरा ''sarvarā'', used as an epithet of one of the dogs of [[Yama]], from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word *''k̑érberos'', meaning "spotted".<ref>

Lincoln notes a similarity between Cerberus and the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] dog [[Garmr]], relating both names to a Proto-Indo-European root ''*ger-'' "to growl" (perhaps with the suffixes ''-*m/*b'' and ''-*r''). However, as Ogden observes, this analysis actually requires ''Kerberos'' and ''Garmr'' to be derived from two ''different'' Indo-European roots (*''ker-'' and *''gher-'' respectively), and so does not actually establish a relationship between the two names.

The use of a dog is uncertain,<ref>

==Explanations==
There have been many attempts to explain the depiction of Cerberus.<ref name="pp. 525–526"/> A 2nd century CE Greek known as [[Heraclitus the paradoxographer]] - not to be confused with the 5th century BCE Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]] - claimed [[Euhemerism|euhemeristically]] that Cerberus had two pups that were never away from their father, and that Cerberus was in fact a normal (though very large) dog, but that artists incorporating the two pups into their work made it appear as if his two children were in fact extra heads. Classical historians have dismissed Heraclitus the paradoxographer's explanation as "feeble". Mythologers have speculated that if Cerberus were given his name in Trikarenos it could be interpreted as "three karenos".
