==Career==
Leary began working as a comedian in the Boston comedy scene of the 1980s at the underground club Play It Again Sam's. But his first real gig was at the Rascals Comedy Club as part of the TV show ''The Rascals Comedy Hour'' on October 18, 1990. He also wrote and appeared on a local comedy series, ''[[The Late, Late Show]]'', hosted by his friend [[Lenny Clarke]] and written by writer [[Martin Olson]]. Leary and Clarke both spoke about their early affiliations and influences in the Boston comedy scene in the documentary film ''[[When Standup Stood Out]]'' (2006). It was during this time that he developed his stage persona. He also appeared in skits on the [[MTV]] game show ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'', playing such characters as [[Keith Richards]] of the [[Rolling Stones]], the "brother" of co-host [[Colin Quinn]], and artist [[Andy Warhol]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Leary first earned fame when he ranted about [[R.E.M.]] in an early 1990s MTV [[sketch comedy|sketch]]. Several other commercials for MTV quickly followed, in which Leary would rant at high speeds about a variety of topics, playing off the then-popular and growing [[Alternative rock|alternative scene]]. One of these rants serves as an introduction to the video of "Shamrocks and Shenanigans (Boom Shalock Lock Boom)" by [[House of Pain]]. He released two [[album (Music)|records]] of his [[stand-up comedy]]: ''[[No Cure for Cancer]]'' (1993) and ''[[Lock 'N Load (album)|Lock 'n Load]]'' (1997). In late 2004, he released the [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Merry Fuckin' Christmas|Merry F#%$in' Christmas]]'', which included a mix of new music, previously unreleased recordings, and some tracks from ''Lock 'n Load''. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 1993, his [[sarcasm|sardonic]] song about the stereotypical American male, "[[Asshole (song)|Asshole]]", achieved much notoriety.  However, this bit was allegedly stolen from [[Louis CK]], discussed by Louis on an interview on the "Opie and Anthony Show". It was voted #1 in an [[Australia]]n youth radio poll (the [[Triple J Hottest 100]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100_08/history/1993.htm|title=TripleJ Hottest 100-1993|publisher=ABC Radio|location=Australia}}</ref> The song was used as part of the [[Holsten Brewery|Holsten Pils]] series of ads in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], in which Leary was participating, with adapted lyrics criticizing a drunk driver.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkz12OslGhU|title=Denis Leary: 'He's An Asshole' - Anti-Drink Driving Campaign|publisher=YouTube|date=January 18, 2008|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref> The single was a minor hit there, peaking at No. 58 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January 1996.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd|location=London, UK|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=315}}</ref>

[[File:Denis Leary Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg|thumb|right|Leary and his wife Ann Lembeck at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival]]
Leary has been married to author Ann Lembeck Leary since 1989.<ref name="Ann Leary - The Official Site"/> They met when he was her instructor in an English class at [[Emerson College]].

Leary describes himself as a [[John F. Kennedy|Jack Kennedy]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] with some [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] ideologies, such as support for the military. Leary told [[Glenn Beck]], "I was a life-long Democrat, but now at my age, I've come to realize that the Democrats suck, and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] suck, and basically the entire system sucks. But you have to go within the system to find what you want."<ref name=beck>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0707/04/gb.01.html|title=Honest Questions with Denis Leary|publisher=CNN|date=July 4, 2007|accessdate=April 26, 2010|first=Glenn|last=Beck}}</ref>

Leary has said of his religious beliefs, "I'm a [[lapsed Catholic]] in the best sense of the word. You know, I was raised with Irish parents, Irish immigrant parents. My parents, you know, prayed all the time, took us to Mass. And my father would sometimes swear in [[Irish language|Gaelic]]. It doesn't get more religious than that. But, no, after a while, they taught us wrong. I didn't raise my kids with the fear of God. I raised my kids with the sense of, you know, to me, Jesus was this great guy...."<ref name=beck />

==Leary Firefighters Foundation==
{{Main|Leary Firefighters Foundation}}
On December 3, 1999, six [[firefighter]]s from Leary's hometown of Worcester were killed in the [[Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire]]. Among the dead were Leary's cousin Jerry Lucey and his close childhood friend Lt. Tommy Spencer.<ref name="smokeinterview" /> In response, the comedian founded the [[Leary Firefighters Foundation]]. Since its creation in the year 2000, the foundation has distributed over $2.5 million ([[United States dollar|USD]]) to fire departments in the Worcester, Boston, and [[New York City]] areas for equipment, training materials, new vehicles, and new facilities. Leary won $125,000 for the foundation on the game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)#Special editions|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''. Leary has close ties with 107.3/[[WAAF (FM)|WAAF]], which in 2000 released the station album ''Survive This!'' Part of the proceeds from this album were donated to the Leary Firefighters Foundation. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A separate fund run by Leary's foundation, the [[Fund for New York's Bravest]], has distributed over $2 million to the families of the 343 firemen killed in the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 in addition to providing funding for necessities such as a new mobile command center, first responder training, and a high-rise simulator for the [[New York City Fire Department]]'s training campus. As the foundation's president, Leary has been active in all of the fundraising. In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in New Orleans, Leary donated over a dozen boats to the [[New Orleans Fire Department]] to aid in rescue efforts in future disasters. The foundation also rebuilt entire NOLA firehouses. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Controversy==

===Allegations of plagiarism===
For many years, Leary had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. When Leary's [[comedy album]] ''[[No Cure for Cancer]]'' was released, many people believed Leary had stolen Hicks's act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.<ref name="evolutionBook">{{cite book|title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution|last1=Booth|first1=Kevin|last2=Bertin|first2=Michael|year=2005|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0-00-719829-9}}</ref> In April 1993, the ''Austin Comedy News'' remarked on the similarities of Leary's performance, "Watching Leary is like seeing Hicks from two years ago. He smokes with the same mannerisms. (Hicks recently quit) He sports the same attitude, the same clothes. He touches on almost all of the same themes. Leary even invokes [[Jim Fixx]]." When asked about this, Hicks told the magazine, "I have a scoop for you. I stole his [Leary's] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gavinsblog.com/probill.htm|title=Profile: Bill Hicks|first=Doug|last=Stern|date=April 1993|work=Austin Comedy News|accessdate=October 22, 2006}}</ref>

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks' material, comedic persona and attitude.<ref name="evolutionBook" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92 | title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | first=Joe |last=Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | date=September 27, 2005 | accessdate=December 21, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview | last=Rogan | first=Joe | work=Playboy |date=October 2003}}</ref><ref name="hicksfaq">{{cite web | url=http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html | title=Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions | first=Tim|last= McIntire | year=1998 | publisher=BillHicks.com | archivedate=October 11, 2006 | accessdate=October 28, 2006}}</ref> One similar routine was about the band [[Judas Priest]], during which Hicks says, "I don't think we lost a cancer cure."<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Hicks, Bill |year=1989 | title=Sane Man | medium=Stand-up comedy | location=USA | publisher=Roadrunner Records}}</ref>

During Leary's 2003 [[Comedy Central Roast]], comedian [[Lenny Clarke]], a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, "Wish I had gotten these to you sooner." This joke was cut from the final broadcast.<ref>{{cite news | last=Ziano III | first=Nick A. |title=Roasting a comic, they turn up the flames, gently | work=Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030811054820/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml|archivedate=August 11, 2003|date=August 10, 2003}}</ref>

The feud is also mentioned in [[Cynthia True]]'s biography ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story'':
{{quote|text=Leary was in Montreal to host the "Nasty Show," at Club Soda, and Colleen was coordinating the talent so she was standing backstage when she heard Leary doing material that sounded incredibly similar to old Hicks riffs, including his perennial [[Jim Fixx]] joke: ("[[Keith Richards]] outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut dude. The plot thickens."). When Leary came offstage, Colleen, more stunned than angry, said, "Hey, you know that's Bill Hicks' material! Do you know that's his material?" Leary stood there, stared at her without saying a word and briskly left the dressing room.<ref name="oouuos">{{cite book|title=American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story|first=Cynthia|last=True|year=2002|publisher=Harper Paperbacks|isbn=0-380-80377-1}}</ref>}}

According to the book, True said upon hearing a tape of Leary's album ''No Cure for Cancer'', "Bill was furious. All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. [[Milton Berle]] and [[Robin Williams]] were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill's act and ''recorded'' it."<ref name="oouuos"/>

In a 2008 appearance on ''[[The Opie and Anthony Show]]'', comedian [[Louis CK]] claimed that Leary stole his "I'm an asshole" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhxqnCyoGo|title=Denis Leary ripped off "I'm An Asshole" from Louis CK|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming that he (Leary) co-wrote the song with Chris Phillips.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g81LCwrU-7k&feature=related|title=Denis Leary responds to Louis CK claiming he stole "I'm An Asshole" from him|work=Opie & Anthony Show|date=November 18, 2008|accessdate=December 1, 2012|publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

===Autism===
In his 2008 book ''[[Why We Suck|Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid]]'', Leary wrote:{{quote|There is a huge boom in [[Autism spectrum disorder|autism]] right now because inattentive mothers and competitive dads want an explanation for why their dumb-ass kids can't compete academically, so they throw money into the happy laps of shrinks... to get back diagnoses that help explain away the deficiencies of their junior morons. I don't [care] what these crackerjack whack jobs tell you — your kid is not autistic. He's just stupid. Or lazy. Or both.}}

In response to the controversy, Leary stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about the trend of unwarranted over-diagnosis of autism, which he attributed to American parents seeking an excuse for behavioral problems and under-performance. Later, he apologized to parents with autistic children whom he had offended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/news/denis-leary-says-autism-Criticism-taken-out-of-context|title=Denis Leary Says Autism Criticism Taken 'Out of Context'|date=October 16, 2008|work=Us Weekly|accessdate=May 22, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018134220/http://www.usmagazine.com/news/denis-leary-says-autism-Criticism-taken-out-of-context|archivedate=October 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/2008_10_28_Denis_Leary_Tells_Parents:_I_m_Sorry:_%E2%80%98Raising_Children_With_Autism__Deserves_Admiration__Comic_Says/srvc=home&position=0|title=Denis Leary Tells Parents: I'm Sorry|first=Laurel J.|last=Sweet|date=October 28, 2008|work=Boston Herald|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref>
