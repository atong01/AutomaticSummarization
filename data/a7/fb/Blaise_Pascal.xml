The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them upfirst principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.</paragraph><paragraph>Pascal also used<space/><italics>De l'Esprit gomtrique</italics><space/>to develop a theory of<space/><link><target>definition</target></link>. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent.

At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a<space/><link><target>vacuum</target></link>, some invisible matter was present. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and that this substance was forever in motion. Furthermore, &quot;Everything that is in motion must be moved by something,&quot;<space/><link><target>Aristotle</target></link><space/>declared.<extension extension_name='ref'>Aristotle,<space/><italics>Physics</italics>, VII, 1.</extension><space/>Therefore, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal's time, a vacuum was an impossibility.
