Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. One kinship cue is facial resemblance. One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons. Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, and this has been found to increase helping behavior. Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group. Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study. This effect was especially strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.<extension extension_name='ref' name="AEP1"></extension></listitem><listitem>Vested interests.

The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts.

This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner. It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling. It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help. Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits, resources, and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics.<extension extension_name='ref' name="AEP1"></extension></listitem></list><list type='ident'><listitem>Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else.

One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.<extension extension_name='ref' name="AEP1"></extension><space/>Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic.

While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man.

Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them.

A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what I cause: if I cause suffering, then as a natural consequence I will experience suffering; if I cause happiness, then as a natural consequence I will experience happiness.</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Karma in Buddhism</arg></template>In Buddhism,<space/><italics>karma</italics><space/>(Pli<space/><italics>kamma</italics>) is strictly distinguished from<space/><bold><italics><link><target>vipaka</target><part>vipka</part></link></italics></bold>, meaning &quot;fruit&quot; or &quot;result&quot;.

Any action is understood to create &quot;seeds&quot; in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results (Pli<space/><italics>vipaka</italics>) when they meet the right conditions.

Motivation usually makes the difference between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be &quot;bad&quot; in that it creates unpleasant results for the &quot;actor.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>In Buddhism, karma is not the only cause of all that happens.

Jainism preaches the view of<space/><link><target>Ahimsa</target></link><space/>to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first Thirthankar, Rishabh introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.</paragraph><paragraph>Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>Non-violence (Ahimsa);</listitem><listitem>Truthfulness (Satya);</listitem><listitem>Non-stealing (Asteya);</listitem><listitem>Celibacy (Brahmacharya);</listitem><listitem>Non-possession or non-materialism (Aparigraha);</listitem></list><paragraph>A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride (ego) by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment.</paragraph><paragraph>The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become Siddha (Param-atma &quot;highest soul&quot;). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders. The &quot;great vows&quot; (mahavrata) are prescribed for monks and &quot;limited vows&quot; (anuvrata) are prescribed for householders. In other words, the house-holders are encouraged to practice the five cardinal principles of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possessiveness with their current practical limitations while the monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Christianity</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:StThomasMount Theresa.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>Statue of<space/><link><target>Mother Teresa</target></link><space/>in India</part></link>Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the<space/><link><target>Gospel</target></link>, especially in the<space/><link><target>Sermon on the Mount</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Sermon on the Plain</target></link>. From biblical to medieval<space/><link><target>Christian traditions</target></link>, tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of &quot;disinterested love&quot;, as in the<space/><link><target>Paul the Apostle</target><part>Pauline</part></link><space/>phrase &quot;love seeks not its own interests.&quot; In his book<space/><italics>Indoctrination and Self-deception,</italics><space/>Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>St Thomas Aquinas</target></link><space/>interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself'<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>Leviticus</target></link><space/>19 and Matthew 22</extension><space/>as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.<extension extension_name='ref'><italics><link><target>Summa Theologica</target></link></italics>, II:II Quaestio 25, Article 4</extension><space/>Considering that &quot;the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship&quot; and quotes Aristotle that &quot;the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves,&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>Nichomachean Ethics</target></link><space/>IX.4 1166a1</extension><space/>he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily lifesince the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above,<space/><link><target>Auguste Comte</target><part>Comte</part></link><space/>was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.</paragraph><paragraph>Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God.<space/><link><target>Thomas Jay Oord</target></link><space/>has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action.
