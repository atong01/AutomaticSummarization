An algorithm's key length is distinct from its original<space/><link><target>Password strength</target><part>cryptographic security</part></link>, which is a logarithmic measure of the fastest known computational attack on the algorithm, also measured in bits. The security of an algorithm cannot exceed its key length (since any algorithm can be cracked by<space/><link><target>brute force attack</target><part>brute force</part></link>), but it can be smaller. For example,<space/><link><target>Triple DES</target></link><space/>has a key size of 168 bits but provides at most 112 bits of security, since an attack of complexity 2<xhtml:sup>112</xhtml:sup><space/>is known.

Many ciphers are actually based on publicly known<space/><link><target>algorithm</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>or are<space/><link><target>open source</target></link><space/>and so it is only the difficulty of obtaining the key that determines security of the system, provided that there is no analytic attack (i.e., a 'structural weakness' in the algorithms or protocols used), and assuming that the key is not otherwise available (such as via theft, extortion, or compromise of computer systems). The widely accepted notion that the security of the system should depend on the key alone has been explicitly formulated by<space/><link><target>Auguste Kerckhoffs</target></link><space/>(in the 1880s) and<space/><link><target>Claude Shannon</target></link><space/>(in the 1940s); the statements are known as<space/><link><target>Kerckhoffs' principle</target></link><space/>and Shannon's Maxim respectively.</paragraph><paragraph>A key should therefore be large enough that a brute force attack (possible against any encryption algorithm) is infeasible &amp;ndash; i.e., would take too long to execute.<space/><link><target>Claude Shannon</target><part>Shannon's</part></link><space/>work on<space/><link><target>information theory</target></link><space/>showed that to achieve so called<space/><italics><link><target>perfect secrecy</target></link></italics>, the key length must be at least as large as the message and only used once (this algorithm is called the<space/><link><target>One-time pad</target></link>). In light of this, and the practical difficulty of managing such long keys, modern cryptographic practice has discarded the notion of perfect secrecy as a requirement for encryption, and instead focuses on<space/><italics><link><target>computational security</target></link></italics>, under which the computational requirements of breaking an encrypted text must be infeasible for an attacker.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>preferred number</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>commonly used as key sizes (in bits) are powers of two, potentially multiplied with a small odd integer.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Key size and encryption system</heading><paragraph>Encryption systems are often grouped into families. Common families include symmetric systems (e.g.<space/><link><target>Advanced Encryption Standard</target><part>AES</part></link>) and asymmetric systems (e.g.<space/><link><target>RSA (algorithm)</target><part>RSA</part></link>); they may alternatively be grouped according to the central<space/><link><target>algorithm</target></link><space/>used (e.g.<space/><link><target>elliptic curve cryptography</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>As each of these is of a different level of cryptographic complexity, it is usual to have different key sizes for the same level of security, depending upon the algorithm used. For example, the security available with a 1024-bit key using asymmetric RSA is considered approximately equal in security to an 80-bit key in a symmetric algorithm (Source:<space/><link><target>RSA Security</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>The actual degree of security achieved over time varies, as more computational power and more powerful mathematical analytic methods become available. For this reason cryptologists tend to look at indicators that an algorithm or key length shows signs of potential vulnerability, to move to longer key sizes or more difficult algorithms. For example<space/><template><target>As of</target><arg>2007</arg><arg>05</arg><arg name="lc">on</arg></template>, a 1039 bit integer was factored with the<space/><link><target>special number field sieve</target></link><space/>using 400 computers over 11 months.<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.pcworld.com/article/132184/article.html'>Researcher: RSA 1024-bit Encryption not Enough</link></extension><space/>The factored number was of a special form; the special number field sieve cannot be used on RSA keys.

According to Professor Gilles Brassard, an expert in quantum computing: &quot;The time needed to factor an RSA integer is the same order as the time needed to use that same integer as modulus for a single RSA encryption. In other words, it takes no more time to break RSA on a quantum computer (up to a multiplicative constant) than to use it legitimately on a classical computer.&quot; The general consensus is that these public key algorithms are insecure at any key size if sufficiently large quantum computers capable of running Shor's algorithm become available.
