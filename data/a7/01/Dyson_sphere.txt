A '''Dyson sphere''' is a hypothetical [[megastructure]] that completely encompasses a [[star]] and captures most or all of its power output. The concept was first described by [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his science fiction novel, ''[[Star Maker]]'' (1937), and later popularized by [[Freeman Dyson]] in his 1960 paper, "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation".<ref name="search">{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|year= 1960 |url=http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SETI1.HTM |title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation|author= [[Freeman Dyson|Freemann J. Dyson]]|pages= 1667–1668 |volume =131 |doi= 10.1126/science.131.3414.1667|pmid=17780673|issue=3414|bibcode = 1960Sci...131.1667D }}</ref> Dyson speculated that such structures would be the logical consequence of the escalating energy needs of a technological civilization and would be a necessity for its long-term survival. He proposed that searching for such structures could lead to the detection of advanced, intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]]. Different types of Dyson spheres and their energy-harvesting ability would correspond to levels of technological advancement on the [[Kardashev scale]].

Since then, other variant designs involving building an artificial structure or series of structures to encompass a star have been proposed in [[exploratory engineering]] or described in [[science fiction]] under the name "Dyson sphere". These later proposals have not been limited to solar-power stations, with many involving [[space habitat|habitation]] or [[industry|industrial]] elements. Most fictional depictions describe a solid [[#Dyson shell|shell of matter]] enclosing a star, which is considered the least plausible variant of the idea (see [[#Dyson shell|below]]). In May 2013, at the Starship Century Symposium in San Diego, Dyson repeated his comments that he wished the concept had not been named after him.<ref>http://starshipconf.ucsd.edu/</ref>

== Origin of concept ==
{{see also|Future energy development}}
The concept of the Dyson sphere was the result of a [[thought experiment]] by physicist and mathematician [[Freeman Dyson]], when he theorized that all technological civilizations constantly increased their demand for energy. He reasoned that if human civilization expanded energy demands long enough, there would come a time when it demanded the ''total'' energy output of the [[Sun]]. He proposed a system of orbiting structures (which he referred to initially as a ''shell'') designed to intercept and collect all energy produced by the Sun. Dyson's proposal did not detail how such a system would be constructed, but focused only on issues of energy collection, on the basis that such a structure could be distinguished by its unusual emission spectrum in comparison to a star. His 1960 paper "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation", published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', is credited with being the first to formalize the concept of the Dyson sphere.<ref name="search"/>

However, Dyson was not the first to advance this idea.  He was inspired by the mention of the concept in the 1937 [[science fiction novel]] ''[[Star Maker]]'',<ref>{{cite book |title=Disturbing the Universe |last=Dyson |first=Freeman |year=1979 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-01677-4 |page=211 |quote=Some science fiction writers have wrongly given me the credit of inventing the artificial biosphere.

Gallun]], and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] who seem to have explored similar concepts in their work.<ref name = dsfaq-as-first-2012-01>{{Cite web

== Feasibility ==
Although such megastructures may be theoretically possible, all plans to build a fixed-in-place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. However, parts of the technology, like orbiting satellites and [[solar sail]]s, have already been developed. Deployment of [[spacecraft]] and [[satellite]]s using [[photovoltaics]] might be seen as the first small steps towards building a [[#Dyson swarm|Dyson swarm]].<ref name="canbuild">{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#BUILT| title= Dyson FAQ: Can a Dyson sphere be built using realistic technology? | accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref> However, the number of craft required to obtain, transmit, and maintain a complete Dyson sphere far exceeds the present-day industrial capabilities. [[George Dvorsky]] has advocated use of [[self-replicating robots]] to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term.<ref name=dvorsky2012>{{cite web |url=http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2012/03/how-to-build-dyson-sphere-in-five.html |title=How to build a Dyson sphere in five (relatively) easy steps |last1=Dvorsky |first1=George |date=2012-03-20 |access-date=June 2015 }}</ref> Some have suggested that such habitats could be built around [[white dwarf]]s<ref>{{citejournal|title=Dyson Spheres around White Dwarfs|authors=İbrahim Semiz, Salim Oğur|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04376}}</ref> and even pulsars.<ref>Z. Osmanov, [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05131v3.pdf On the search for artificial Dyson-like structures around pulsars]. Int. J. Astr. Bio. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1473550415000257</ref>

== Variants ==
In fictional accounts, the Dyson-sphere concept is often interpreted as an artificial hollow [[sphere]] of [[matter]] around a star. This perception is based on a literal interpretation of Dyson's original short paper introducing the concept. In response to letters prompted by this paper, Dyson replied, "A solid shell or ring surrounding a star is mechanically impossible. The form of 'biosphere' which I envisaged consists of a loose collection or swarm of objects traveling on independent orbits around the star."<ref>{{cite journal| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume= 132|year= 1960|pages= 250–253|title= Letters and Response, Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation|author= [[Freeman Dyson|F. J. Dyson]], J. Maddox, P. Anderson, E. A. Sloane|doi= 10.1126/science.132.3421.252-a|pmid= 17748945| issue= 3421}}</ref>

=== Dyson swarm ===
[[File:Dyson Ring.PNG|thumb|A '''Dyson ring''' — the simplest form of the Dyson swarm — to scale. Orbit is 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] in radius, collectors are 1.0{{e|7}} km in diameter (10 [[Gigametre|Gm]] or ~25 times the Earth–Moon distance), spaced 3 degrees from center to center around the orbital circle.]]
[[File:Dyson Swarm.png|thumb|A relatively simple arrangement of multiple Dyson rings of the type pictured above, to form a more complex Dyson swarm. Rings' orbital radii are spaced 1.5{{e|7}} km with regard to one another, but average orbital radius is still 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]. Rings are rotated 15 degrees relative to one another, around a common axis of rotation.]]

The variant closest to Dyson's original conception is the "Dyson swarm". It consists of a large number of independent constructs (usually [[solar power satellite]]s and [[Space colonization|space habitats]]) orbiting in a dense formation around the star. This construction approach has advantages: components could be sized appropriately, and it can be constructed incrementally.<ref name="canbuild"/> Various forms of [[wireless energy transfer]] could be used to transfer energy between components and Earth.

Disadvantages resulting from the nature of [[Astrodynamics|orbital mechanics]] would make the arrangement of the orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the ''Dyson ring'', in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Tech/Megascale/dyson_page.html|title=Some Sketches of Dyson Spheres|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref> Another potential problem is the increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.

As noted [[Dyson sphere#Search for extra-terrestrial intelligence|below]], such a cloud of collectors would alter the light emitted by the star system. However, the disruption compared to a star's overall natural emitted spectrum would most likely be too small to be noticed on Earth.<ref name="search"/>

=== Dyson bubble ===
[[File:Dyson Bubble.png|thumb|A '''Dyson bubble''': an arrangement of [[statite]]s around a star, in a non-orbital pattern. As long as a statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to its star, it can hover at any point in space near its star. This relatively simple arrangement is only one of an infinite number of possible statite configurations, and is meant as a contrast for a Dyson swarm only. Statites are pictured as the same size as the collectors pictured above, and arranged at a uniform 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] distance from the star.
]]

A second type of Dyson sphere is the "Dyson bubble". It would be similar to a Dyson swarm, composed of many independent constructs (usually [[solar power satellite]]s and [[space habitat]]s) and likewise could be constructed incrementally.

Unlike the Dyson swarm, the constructs making it up are not in orbit around the star, but would be [[statite]]s—satellites suspended by use of enormous [[light sail]]s using [[radiation pressure]] to counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs would not be in danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of [[radiation pressure]] and the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/sunlight_exerts_pressure.htm| title= Sunlight Exerts Pressure| accessdate=2006-03-02}}</ref>), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.

The practicality of this approach is questionable with modern [[material science]], but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun would have an overall [[density]] of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail.<ref name="stable"/> To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17{{e|20}} kg, which is about the same mass as the asteroid [[2 Pallas|Pallas]].<ref name="FAQ enough"/> Another illustration: Regular printing [[paper]] has a density of around 80 g/m<sup>2</sup>.

Such a material has not yet been produced in the form of a working light sail. The lightest carbon-fiber [[light sail|light-sail]] material currently produced has a density—without payload—of 3 g/m<sup>2</sup>, or about four times as heavy as would be needed to construct a solar statite.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html| title=SPACE.com Exclusive: Breakthrough In Solar Sail Technology | first=Greg| last=Clark| publisher=Space.com| year=2000| accessdate=2006-03-02| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060114020015/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->| archivedate=2006-01-14}}</ref> 

A single sheet of [[graphene]], the two-dimensional form of carbon, has a density of only 0.37&nbsp;mg per square meter,<ref>{{citation | first = Mitali | last = Kakran | contribution = Graphene: The New Wonder Material!!! | title = IET present around the world | date = 2011 | url = http://conferences.theiet.org/patw/-documents/mitali-kakran-slides.cfm | format = PDF | accessdate = 2013-03-23}}</ref> making such a single sheet of graphene possibly effective as a solar sail. However, as of 2015 graphene has not been fabricated in large sheets, and it has a relatively high rate of radiation absorption, about 2.3% (i.e., it would only be 97.7% reflective).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graphene-battery.net/graphene-properties.htm |title=Graphene properties | publisher=www.graphene-battery.net | date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | journal=Arxiv | url=http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1201/1201.3071.pdf | title=High optical absorption in graphene | author=S.

Hägglund}}</ref>   For frequencies in the upper GHz and lower THz range, the absorption rate is as high as 50–100% due to voltage bias and/or doping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graphene-battery.net/graphene-properties.htm |title=Graphene properties | publisher=www.graphene-battery.net | date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | journal=Arxiv | url=http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1201/1201.3071.pdf | title=High optical absorption in graphene | author=S.

Ultra-light [[carbon nanotube]]s meshed through [[molecular manufacturing]] techniques have densities between 1.3 g/m<sup>2</sup> to 1.4 g/m<sup>2</sup>. By the time a civilization is ready to use this technology, the [[carbon nanotube]]'s manufacturing might be optimised enough for them to have a density lower than the necessary 0.7 g/m<sup>2</sup>, and the average sail density with [[rigging]] might be kept to 0.3 g/m<sup>2</sup> (a "[[Solar sail#Investigated sail designs|spin stabilized]]" light sail requires minimal additional mass in [[rigging]]). If such a sail could be constructed at this [[areal density]], a [[space habitat]] the size of the [[L5 Society]]'s proposed [[O'Neill cylinder]]—500&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, with room for over 1 million inhabitants, massing 3{{e|6}} [[ton]]s—could be supported by a circular light sail 3,000&nbsp;km in diameter, with a combined sail/habitat mass of 5.4{{e|9}} kg.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://thespacereview.com/article/317/1| title=The Space Review: The high risk frontier | first=Sam| last=Dinkin| publisher=Thespacereview.com| year=2006| accessdate=2006-03-18}}</ref> For comparison, this is just slightly smaller than the diameter of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (although the sail is a flat disc, not a sphere), or the distance between [[San Francisco]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. Such a structure would, however, have a mass quite a lot less than many asteroids. Although the construction of such a massive inhabitable statite would be a gigantic undertaking, and the required material science behind it is early stage, there are other engineering feats and required materials proposed in other Dyson sphere variants.

In theory, if enough statites were created and deployed around their star, they would compose a non-rigid version of the Dyson shell mentioned below. Such a shell would not suffer from the drawbacks of massive compressive pressure, nor are the mass requirements of such a shell as high as the rigid form. Such a shell would, however, have the same optical and thermal properties as the rigid form, and would be detected by searchers in a similar fashion (see [[#Search for extra-terrestrial intelligence|below]]).

=== Dyson shell ===
[[Image:Dyson Sphere Diagram-en.svg|thumb|A cut-away diagram of an idealized Dyson shell, a variant on Dyson's original concept, with a radius of 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]].]]
The variant of the Dyson sphere most often [[Dyson spheres in fiction|depicted in fiction]] is the "Dyson shell": a uniform solid shell of matter around the star.<ref name="what"/> Such a structure would completely alter the emissions of the central star, and would intercept 100% of the star's energy output. Such a structure would also provide an immense surface that many envision would be used for habitation, if the surface could be made habitable.

A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a radius of one [[astronomical unit]], so that the interior surface would receive the same amount of sunlight as Earth does per unit [[solid angle]], would have a surface area of approximately {{convert|2.8e17|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth. This would intercept the full 384.6 [[yotta]][[watt]]s (3.846 × 10<sup>26</sup> watts)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html|title=NASA Sun Fact Sheet|accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref> of the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun's [[stellar evolution|evolution]].<ref name="what">{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#WHAT| title= Dyson FAQ: What is a Dyson Sphere? | accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> This is approximately 33 [[10^18|trillion]] times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sustainable/oomm.html|title=Order of Magnitude Morality|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref>

There are several serious theoretical difficulties with the solid shell variant of the Dyson sphere:

Such a shell would have no net gravitational interaction with its englobed star (see [[shell theorem]]), and could drift in relation to the central star. If such movements went uncorrected, they could eventually result in a collision between the sphere and the star—most likely with disastrous results. Such structures would need either some form of propulsion to counteract any drift, or some way to repel the surface of the sphere away from the star.<ref name="stable">{{cite web|url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#STABLE|title=Dyson Sphere FAQ: Is a Dyson sphere stable?|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref>

For the same reason, such a shell would have no net gravitational interaction with anything else inside it. The contents of any biosphere placed on the inner surface of a Dyson shell would not be attracted to the sphere's surface and would simply fall into the star. It has been proposed that a biosphere could be contained between two concentric spheres, placed on the interior of a rotating sphere (in which case, the force of artificial "gravity" is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, causing all matter placed on the interior of the sphere to pool around the equator, effectively rendering the sphere a [[Niven ring]] for purposes of habitation, but still fully effective as a radiant-energy collector) or placed on the outside of the sphere where it would be held in place by the star's gravity.<ref>{{cite web|first=Todd|last=Drashner|author2=Steve Bowers |author3=Mike Parisi |author4=M.

If assuming a radius of one [[Astronomical unit|AU]], then the compressive strength of the material forming the sphere would have to be immense to prevent implosion due to the star's gravity. Any arbitrarily selected point on the surface of the sphere can be viewed as being under the pressure of the base of a dome ''1 AU in height'' under the Sun's gravity at that distance. Indeed, it can be viewed as being at the base of an infinite number of arbitrarily selected domes, but because much of the force from any one arbitrary dome is counteracted by those of another, the net force on that point is immense, but finite. No known or theorized material is strong enough to withstand this pressure, and form a rigid, static sphere around a star.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#STRENGTH| title= Dyson FAQ: How strong does a rigid Dyson shell need to be? | accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref> It has been proposed by [[Paul Birch (writer)|Paul Birch]] (in relation to smaller "Supra-Jupiter" constructions around a large planet rather than a star) that it may be possible to support a Dyson shell by dynamic means similar to those used in a [[space fountain]].<ref>Search [http://archive.org/web/web.php WaybackMachine] for the 14th of June 2011 copy of  <nowiki>http://www.paulbirch.net/SupramundanePlanets.zip</nowiki></ref> Masses travelling in circular tracks on the inside of the sphere, at velocities significantly greater than orbital velocity, would press outwards on [[magnetic bearing]]s due to [[centrifugal force]]. For a Dyson shell of 1-AU radius around a star with the same mass as the Sun, a mass travelling ten times the orbital velocity (297.9&nbsp;km/s) would support 99 (a=v<sup>2</sup>/r) times its own mass in additional shell structure.

Also if assuming a radius of one AU, then there may not be sufficient building material in the Solar System to construct a Dyson shell. [[Anders Sandberg]] estimates that there is 1.82{{e|26}} kg of easily usable building material in the Solar System, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>—about 8–20&nbsp;cm thick on average, depending on the density of the material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79{{e|24}} kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of just 42&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="FAQ enough">{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#ENOUGH| title= Is there enough matter in the Solar System to build a Dyson shell?| work=Dyson Sphere FAQ| first=Anders| last= Sandberg| accessdate=2006-08-13}}</ref>

The shell would be vulnerable to impacts from interstellar bodies, such as [[comet]]s, [[meteoroid]]s, and material in [[interstellar space]] that is currently being deflected by the Sun's [[bow shock]]. The [[heliosphere]], and any protection it theoretically provides, would cease to exist.

=== Other types ===
==== Dyson net ====
Another possibility is the "Dyson net", a web of cables strung about the star that could have power or heat collection units strung between the cables. The Dyson net reduces to a special case of Dyson shell or bubble, however, depending on how the cables are supported against the sun's gravity.

==== Bubbleworld ====
A bubbleworld is an artificial construct that consists of a shell of living space around a sphere of hydrogen gas. The shell contains air, people, houses, furniture, etc. It was invented to answer the question, "What is the largest space colony that can be built?"<ref name = "tuwyau">{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#OTHER| title= Other Dyson Sphere-Like Concepts| work=Dyson Sphere FAQ| first=Anders| last= Sandberg| accessdate=2006-08-13}}</ref> However, most of the volume is not habitable and there is no power source.

Theoretically, any [[gas giant]] could be enclosed in a solid shell; at a certain radius the surface gravity would be terrestrial, and energy could be provided by tapping the thermal energy of the planet.<ref name = "tuwyau"/> This concept is explored peripherally in the novel ''[[Accelerando (book)|Accelerando]]'' (and the short story ''Curator'', which is incorporated into the novel as a chapter) by [[Charles Stross]], in which [[Saturn]] is converted into a human-habitable world.

==== Stellar engine ====
[[Stellar engine]]s are a class of hypothetical [[megastructure]]s whose purpose is to extract useful energy from a star, sometimes for specific purposes. For example, [[Matrioshka brain]]s extract energy for purposes of computation; [[Stellar engine#Class A (Shkadov thruster)|Shkadov thrusters]] extract energy for purposes of propulsion. Some of the proposed stellar engine designs are based on the Dyson sphere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/stellar_engine.html|title=Stellar engine|work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science|accessdate=2007-10-08}}</ref>

A [[black hole]] could be the power source instead of a star in order to increase the energy-to-matter conversion efficiency. A black hole would also be smaller than a star. This would decrease communication distances that would be important for computer-based societies as those described above.<ref name = "tuwyau"/>

== Search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ==
In Dyson's original paper, he speculated that sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial civilizations would likely follow a similar power-consumption pattern to that of humans, and would eventually build their own sphere of collectors. Constructing such a system would make such a civilization a Type II [[Kardashev scale|Kardashev civilization]].<ref>[[Nikolai Kardashev|Kardashev, Nikolai]]. "[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1985IAUS..112..497K On the Inevitability and the Possible Structures of Supercivilizations]", The search for extraterrestrial life: Recent developments; Proceedings of the Symposium, Boston, MA, June 18–21, 1984 (A86-38126 17–88). Dordrecht, D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1985, p. 497–504.</ref>

The existence of such a system of collectors would alter the light emitted from the star system. Collectors would absorb and reradiate energy from the star.<ref name="search"/> The wavelength(s) of radiation emitted by the collectors would be determined by the [[emission spectrum|emission spectra]] of the substances making them up, and the temperature of the collectors. Because it seems most likely that these collectors would be made up of heavy elements not normally found in the emission spectra of their central star–or at least not radiating light at such relatively "low" energies compared to what they would be emitting as energetic free nuclei in the [[stellar atmosphere]]–there would be atypical wavelengths of light for the star's [[spectral type]] in the light spectrum emitted by the star system. If the percentage of the star's output thus filtered or transformed by this absorption and reradiation was significant, it could be detected at interstellar distances.<ref name="search"/>

Given the amount of energy available per square meter at a distance of 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the [[Sun]], it is possible to calculate that most known substances would be reradiating energy in the [[infrared]] part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Thus, a Dyson sphere, constructed by life forms not dissimilar to humans, who dwelled in proximity to a [[Solar analog|Sun-like star]], made with materials similar to those available to humans, would most likely cause an increase in the amount of infrared radiation in the star system's emitted spectrum. Hence, Dyson selected the title "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation" for his published paper.<ref name="search"/>

[[SETI]] has adopted these assumptions in their search, looking for such "infrared heavy" spectra from [[solar analog]]s. {{As of|2005}} [[Fermilab]] has an ongoing survey for such spectra by analyzing data from the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| year=2006| accessdate=2006-03-02| first=D.| last=Carrigan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Shostak |first=Seth |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Engineering & Science |title=When Will We Find the Extraterrestrials? |volume=72 |number=1 |pages=12–21 |issn=0013-7812 |url=http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf <!-- permalink to official source with abstract & alternate PDF link: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechES:72.1.Extraterrestrials -->}}</ref> Identifying one of the many infrared sources as a Dyson sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson sphere and natural sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dyson_sphere|title=''Dyson sphere'' at Scholarpedia|publisher=}}</ref> Fermilab discovered 17 potential "ambiguous" candidates, of which four have been named "amusing but still questionable".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| year=2012| accessdate=2012-01-15| first=D.| last=Carrigan}}</ref> Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which are, however, unconfirmed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dick Carrigan |url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/infrared_astronomy/Other_searches.htm |title=Dyson Sphere Searches |publisher=Home.fnal.gov |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref><ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alien-supercivilizations-absent-from-100-000-nearby-galaxies www.scientificamerican.com 2015-04-17 Alien Supercivilizations Absent from 100,000 Nearby Galaxies]</ref><ref name="econ2015">{{Cite web

On 14 October 2015, the realization of a strange pattern of light from star [[KIC 8462852]], observed by the [[Kepler Space Telescope]], raised speculation that a Dyson sphere may have been discovered.<ref name="ATL-20151013">{{cite web| last1=Andersen| first1=Ross| title=The Most Mysterious Star in Our Galaxy| url=http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/the-most-interesting-star-in-our-galaxy/410023/ |date=13 October 2015 |work=[[The Atlantic]]| accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref><ref name="IND-20151015"> {{cite web| last1=Williams| first1=Lee| title=Astronomers may have found giant alien 'megastructures' orbiting star near the Milky Way| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/forget-water-on-mars-astronomers-may-have-just-found-giant-alien-megastructures-orbiting-a-star-near-a6693886.html |date=15 October 2015 |work=[[The Independent]]| accessdate=15 October 2015}}</ref>

As noted above, the Dyson sphere originated in fiction,<ref>[[Olaf Stapledon]]. ''[[Star Maker]]''</ref><ref>[[J. D. Bernal]], "The World, the Flesh, and the Devil"</ref> and it is a concept that has appeared often in [[science fiction]] since then. In fictional accounts, Dyson spheres are most often depicted as a ''Dyson shell'' with the gravitational and engineering difficulties of this variant noted above largely ignored.<ref name="what"/>
