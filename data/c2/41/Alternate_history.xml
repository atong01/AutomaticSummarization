Cross-time, time-splitting, and alternate history themes have become so closely interwoven that it is impossible to discuss them fully apart from one another. &quot;Alternate History&quot; looks at &quot;what if&quot; scenarios from some of history's most pivotal turning points and presents a completely different version, sometimes based on science and fact, but often based on conjecture.

A writer's fictional multiverse may, in fact, preclude some decisions as humanly impossible, as when, in<space/><italics><link><target>Night Watch (Discworld)</target><part>Night Watch</part></link></italics>,<space/><link><target>Terry Pratchett</target></link><space/>depicts a character informing Vimes that while anything that can happen, has happened, nevertheless there is no history whatsoever in which Vimes has ever murdered his wife. When the writer explicitly maintains that<space/><italics>all</italics><space/>possible decisions are made in all possible ways, one possible conclusion is that the characters were neither brave, nor clever, nor skilled, but simply lucky enough to happen on the universe in which they did not choose the cowardly route, take the stupid action, fumble the crucial activity, etc.; few writers focus on this idea, although it has been explored in stories such as<space/><link><target>Larry Niven</target></link>'s story &quot;<link><target>All the Myriad Ways#story</target><part>All the Myriad Ways</part></link>&quot;, where the reality of all possible universes leads to an epidemic of suicide and crime because people conclude their choices have no moral import.</paragraph><paragraph>In any case, even if it is true that every possible outcome occurs in some world, it can still be argued that traits such as bravery and intelligence might still affect the relative frequency of worlds in which better or worse outcomes occurred (even if the total number of worlds with each type of outcome is infinite, it is still possible to assign a different<space/><link><target>Measure (mathematics)</target><part>measure</part></link><space/>to different infinite sets). The physicist<space/><link><target>David Deutsch</target></link>, a strong advocate of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, has argued along these lines, saying that &quot;By making good choices, doing the right thing, we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives.

A famous example of an alternate history game is<space/><italics><link><target>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</target></link></italics>. Released in 1996, the game presents a point of divergence in 1946 where<space/><link><target>Albert Einstein</target></link><space/>goes back in time to prevent World War II from ever taking place by erasing<space/><link><target>Adolf Hitler</target></link><space/>from time after he is released from<space/><link><target>Landsberg Prison</target></link><space/>in 1924. He is successful in his mission, but in the process allows<space/><link><target>Joseph Stalin</target></link><space/>and the<space/><link><target>Soviet Union</target></link><space/>to become powerful enough to launch a massive campaign to conquer Europe.</paragraph><paragraph>In the<space/><italics><link><target>Civilization (series)</target><part>Civilization Series</part></link></italics>, the player guides a civilization from prehistory to the present day, creating radically altered versions of history on a long time-scale. Several scenarios recreate a particular period which becomes the &quot;point of divergence&quot; in an alternate history shaped by the player's actions. Popular examples in<space/><italics><link><target>Civilization IV</target><part>Sid Meier's Civilization IV</part></link></italics><space/>include<space/><italics>Desert War</italics>, set in the Mediterranean theater of<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link><space/>and featuring scripted events tied to possible outcomes of battles;<space/><italics>Broken Star</italics>, set in a hypothetical Russian civil war in 2010; and<space/><italics><link><target>Rhye's and Fall of Civilization</target></link></italics>, an 'Earth simulator' designed to mirror a history as closely as possible but incorporating unpredictable elements to provide realistic alternate settings.</paragraph><paragraph>In some games such as the<space/><italics><link><target>Metal Gear (series)</target><part>Metal Gear</part></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics><link><target>Resident Evil</target></link></italics><space/>series, events that were originally intended to represent the near future at the time the games were originally released later ended up becoming alternative histories in later entries in those franchises. For example,<space/><italics><link><target>Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</target></link></italics><space/>(1990), set in 1999, depicted a near future that ended up becoming an alternative history in<space/><italics><link><target>Metal Gear Solid</target></link></italics><space/>(1998).

With the road and railway system destroyed, commerce took to the skies, which led to the emergence of<space/><link><target>air pirate</target></link><space/>gangs who plunder the aerial commerce.</paragraph><paragraph>The game<space/><italics><link><target>Freedom Fighters (video game)</target><part>Freedom Fighters</part></link></italics><space/>portrays a situation similar to that of the movie<space/><italics><link><target>Red Dawn</target></link></italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Red Alert 2</italics>, though less comically than the latter. The point of divergence is during<space/><link><target>World War II</target></link>, where the<space/><link><target>Soviet Union</target></link><space/>develops an atomic bomb first and uses it on<space/><link><target>Berlin</target></link>. With the balance of power and influence tipped in Russia's favor, history diverges; brief summaries at the beginning of the game inform the player of the Communist bloc's complete takeover of Europe by 1953, a different ending to the<space/><link><target>Cuban Missile Crisis</target></link>, and the spread of Soviet influence into South America and Mexico.</paragraph><paragraph>Similarly, the 2007 video game<space/><italics><link><target>World in Conflict</target></link></italics><space/>is set in 1989, with the<space/><link><target>Soviet Union</target></link><space/>on the verge of collapse. The point of divergence is several months before the opening of the game, when<space/><link><target>Warsaw Pact</target></link><space/>forces staged a desperate invasion of Western Europe. As the game begins, a Soviet invasion force lands in<space/><link><target>Seattle</target></link>, taking advantage of the fact that most of the US military is in Europe.</paragraph><paragraph>The game<space/><italics><link><target>Battlestations: Pacific</target></link></italics>, released in 2008, offered in alternate history campaign for the<space/><link><target>Imperial Japanese Navy</target></link>, wherein Japan destroys all three carriers in the<space/><link><target>Battle of Midway</target></link>, which follows with a successful invasion of the island.

The<space/><link><target>Axis powers</target><part>Axis</part></link><space/>launch a surprise invasion of an isolationist United States in 1953, which forces the country to surrender and submit to a puppet government.</paragraph><paragraph>Another alternate history game involving Nazis is<space/><italics><link><target>War Front: Turning Point</target></link></italics><space/>in which Adolf Hitler died during the early days of World War II and thus, a much more effective leadership rose to power. Under the command of a new Fhrer (who is referred to as &quot;Chancellor&quot;, and his real name is never revealed),<space/><link><target>Operation Sealion</target></link><space/>succeeds and the Nazis successfully conquer Britain, sparking a cold war between the Allied Powers and Germany.</paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Fallout (series)</target><part>Fallout series</part></link><space/>of computer role-playing games is set in a divergent America, where history after World War II diverges from the real world to follow a<space/><link><target>retro-futuristic</target></link><space/>timeline. For example,<space/><link><target>fusion power</target></link><space/>was invented quite soon after the end of the war, but the<space/><link><target>transistor</target></link><space/>was either delayed or never was developed. The result was a future that has a 1950s 'World of Tomorrow' feel to it, with extremely high technology such as<space/><link><target>artificial intelligence</target></link><space/>implemented with<space/><link><target>thermionic valves</target></link><space/>and other technologies now considered obsolete.</paragraph><paragraph>Many game series by Swedish developer<space/><link><target>Paradox Interactive</target></link><space/>start off at a concise point in history, allowing the player to immerse in the role of a contemporary leader and alter the course of in-game history.
