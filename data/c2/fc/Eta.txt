{{Greek Alphabet|letter=eta}}
'''Eta''' (uppercase '''Η''', lowercase '''η'''; {{lang-el|Ήτα}} ''Hēta'') is the seventh letter of the [[Greek alphabet]]. Originally denoting  [[Heta (letter)|a consonant]] /h/, its sound value in the classical [[Attic Greek|Attic dialect]] of [[Ancient Greek]] was a long vowel [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|{{IPA|[ɛː]}}]], raised to {{IPA-el|i|}} in [[medieval Greek]], a process known as [[iotacism]].

In the system of [[Greek numerals]] it has a value of 8. It was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician letter]] [[heth]] [[File:Phoenician heth.svg|20px]]. Letters that arose from Eta include the Latin [[H]] and the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letter [[I (Cyrillic)|И]].

==History==
===Consonant h===

{{main|Heta (letter)}}
The letter shape 'H' was originally used in most Greek dialects to represent the sound /h/, a [[voiceless glottal fricative]]. In this function, it was borrowed in the 8th century BC by the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan and other Old Italic alphabets]], which were based on the [[Cumaean alphabet|Euboean]] form of the Greek alphabet. This also gave rise to the Latin alphabet with its letter [[H]].

Other regional variants of the Greek alphabet ([[epichoric alphabets]]), in dialects that still preserved the sound /h/, employed various glyph shapes for consonantal Heta side by side with the new vocalic Eta for some time. 
In the southern Italian colonies of [[Heraclea Lucania|Heracleia]] and [[Taranto|Tarentum]], the letter shape was reduced to a "half-heta" lacking the right vertical stem (Ͱ). From this sign later developed the sign for [[rough breathing]] or ''spiritus asper'',  which brought back the marking of the  /h/ sound into the standardized post-classical ([[Greek diacritics|polytonic]]) orthography.<ref name="Nicholas">[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/unicode_aitch.html Nick Nicholas (2003), "Greek /h/"]</ref>
[[Dionysius Thrax]] in the second century BC records that the letter name was still pronounced ''heta'' (ἥτα), correctly explaining this irregularity by stating "in the old days the letter Η served to stand for the rough breathing, as it still does with the Romans."<ref>{{lang|grc|παρὰ τοῖς ἀρχαίοις ὁ τύπος τοῦ Η ἐν τύπῳ δασείας ἔκειτο, ὥσπερ καὶ νῦν <παρὰ> τοῖς Ῥωμαίοις}} 
Alfredus Hilgard (ed), "In artis Dionysianae §6" in ''Grammatici Graeci. Scholia in Dionysii Thracis Artem Grammaticam'' (1901), p. 486.</ref>

===Long e===
In the East [[Ionic dialect]], however, the sound /h/ disappeared by the sixth century BC, and the letter was re-used initially to represent a development of a long vowel {{IPA|/aː/}}, which later merged in East Ionic with  {{IPA|/ɛː/}} instead.<ref>

</ref> In 403 BC, [[Athens]] took over the Ionian spelling system and with it the vocalic use of H (even though it still also had the /h/ sound itself at that time). This later became the standard orthography in all of Greece.

===Itacism===
During the time of post-classical [[Koiné Greek]], the {{IPA|/ɛː/}} sound represented by eta was [[Vowel height|raised]] and merged with several other formerly distinct vowels, a phenomenon called ''itacism'' after the new pronunciation of the letter name as ''ita'' instead of ''eta''. 

Itacism is continued into [[Modern Greek]], where the letter name  is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈita]}} and represents the sound /i/ (a [[close front unrounded vowel]]). It shares this function with several other letters ([[Iota|ι]], [[Upsilon|υ]]) and [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] (ει, οι), which are all pronounced alike. This phenomenon at large is called [[iotacism]].

===Cyrillic script===
Eta was also borrowed with the sound value of [i] into the [[Cyrillic script]], where it gave rise to the Cyrillic letter [[I (Cyrillic)|И]].

==Uses==
===Letter===
In [[Modern Greek]] the letter, pronounced {{IPA-el|ˈita|}}, represents a [[close front unrounded vowel]], {{IPA|/i/}}. In [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]], it represented a long [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]], {{IPA|/ɛː/}}.

===Symbol===
====Upper case====
The upper-case letter Η is used as a symbol in [[textual criticism]] for the [[Alexandrian text-type]] (from [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]], its once-supposed editor).

In [[chemistry]], the letter H as symbol of [[enthalpy]] sometimes is said to be a Greek eta, but since enthalpy comes from ἐνθάλπος, which begins in a smooth breathing and epsilon, it is more likely a Latin [[H]] for 'heat'.

====Lower case====
The lower-case letter η is used as a symbol in:
*[[Thermodynamics]], the efficiency of a [[Carnot heat engine]], or [[packing density|packing fraction]].
*[[Chemistry]], the [[hapticity]], or the number of atoms of a ligand attached to one coordination site of the metal in a [[coordination compound]]. For example, an [[allyl group]] can coordinate to [[palladium]] in the η¹ mode (only one atom of an allyl group attached to palladium) or the η³ mode (3 atoms attached to palladium).
*[[Optics]], the [[electromagnetic impedance]] of a medium, or the [[quantum efficiency]] of detectors.
*[[Particle physics]], to represent the [[η meson]]s.
*[[Particle physics|Experimental particle physics]], η stands for [[pseudorapidity]].
*[[Cosmology]], η represents [[conformal time]]; dt = adη.
*[[Theory of relativity|Relativity]] and [[Quantum field theory]] (physics), η (with two subscripts) represents the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of [[Minkowski space]] (flat spacetime).
*[[Statistics]], ''η''<sup>2</sup> is the "partial regression coefficient". ''η'' is the symbol for the linear predictor of a [[generalized linear model]], and can also be used to denote the median of a population, or thresholding parameter in Sparse Partial Least Squares regression.
*[[Economics]], ''η'' is the [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity]].
*[[Astronomy]], the seventh brightest (usually) star in a [[constellation]]. ''See'' [[Bayer designation]].
*Mathematics, η-conversion, see [[lambda calculus#η-conversion|lambda calculus]]
*Mathematics, the [[Dirichlet eta function]], [[Dedekind eta function]], and [[Weierstrass eta function]].
*In [[category theory]], the unit of an [[Adjoint functors#Counit-unit_adjunction|adjunction]] or [[Monad_(category_theory)#Formal_definition|monad]] is usually denoted ''η''.
*[[Biology]], a [[DNA polymerase]] found in higher [[eukaryotes]] and implicated in Translesion Synthesis.
*[[Neural network]] [[backpropagation]], η stands for the learning rate.
*[[Telecommunications]], η stands for efficiency
*[[Electronics]], η stands for the ideality factor of a [[bipolar transistor]], and has a value close to 1.000.  It appears in contexts where the transistor is used as a temperature sensing device, e.g. the thermal "diode" transistor that is embedded within a computer's microprocessor.
*[[Power electronics]], η stands for the efficiency of a [[power supply]], defined as the output power divided by the input power.
*[[Atmospheric science]], η represents [[Vorticity#Atmospheric sciences|absolute atmospheric vorticity]].
*[[Rheology]], η represents [[viscosity]].
*[[Oceanography]], η is the measurement (usually in metres) of sea-level height above or below the mean sea-level at that same location.
