According to Moore, as long as that kind of leadership selection process remains in place, and concentrates power in the hands of the leader, as opposed to backbenchers, then coalition governments will be very difficult to form.

Another stated advantage is that a coalition government better reflects the popular opinion of the<space/><link><target>Constituency</target><part>electorate</part></link><space/>within a country.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Moore-1"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Those who disapprove of coalition governments believe that such governments have a tendency to be fractious and prone to disharmony, as their component parties hold differing beliefs and thus may not always agree on policy. Sometimes the results of an election mean that the coalitions which are mathematically most probable are ideologically infeasible, for example in<space/><link><target>Flanders</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>Northern Ireland</target></link>. A second difficulty might be the ability of minor parties to play &quot;<link><target>kingmaker</target></link>&quot; and, particularly in close elections, gain far more power in exchange for their support than the size of their vote would otherwise justify.</paragraph><paragraph>Coalition governments have also been criticized<template><target>By whom</target><arg name="date">May 2014</arg></template><space/>for sustaining a<space/><link><target>consensus</target></link><space/>on issues when disagreement and the consequent discussion would be more fruitful. To forge a consensus, the leaders of ruling coalition parties can agree to silence their disagreements on an issue to unify the coalition against the opposition. The coalition partners, if they control the parliamentary majority, can collude to make the parliamentary discussion on the issue irrelevant by consistently disregarding the arguments of the opposition and voting against the opposition's proposals even if there is disagreement within the ruling parties about the issue.</paragraph><paragraph>Powerful parties can also act in an<space/><link><target>Oligocracy</target><part>oligocratic</part></link><space/>way to form an alliance to stifle the growth of emerging parties. Of course, such an event is rare in coalition governments when compared to<space/><link><target>two-party system</target><trail>s</trail></link>, which typically exist because of stifling of the growth of emerging parties, often through discriminatory<space/><link><target>nomination rules</target></link><space/>regulations and<space/><link><target>plurality voting system</target><trail>s</trail></link>, and so on.</paragraph><paragraph>A single, more powerful party can shape the policies of the coalition disproportionately. Smaller or less powerful parties can be intimidated to not openly disagree. In order to maintain the coalition, they would have to vote against their own party's platform in the parliament. If they do not, the party has to leave the government and loses executive power.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Cohabitation (government)</target><part>Cohabitation</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Collaborative leadership</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Electoral alliance</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Electoral fusion</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Hung parliament</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of democracy and election-related topics</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>List of countries with coalition governments</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Majority government</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Minority government</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Plurality voting system</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Political coalition</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Political organisation</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>:Category:Political party alliances</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Popular front</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Unholy Alliance (geopolitical)</target><part>Unholy alliance</part></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>United front</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Coalition Spectrum navbox</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Coalition Government</target></template><link><target>Category:Coalition governments</target><part></part></link></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>cs:Koalice#Vldn koalice</target></link></paragraph></article>
