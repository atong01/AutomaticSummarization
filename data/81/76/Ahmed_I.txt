'''Ahmed I''' ({{lang-ota|احمد اول}} ''{{transl|ota|Aḥmed-i evvel}}''; {{lang-tr|I. Ahmed}}; April 18, 1590 – November 22, 1617) was the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire]] from 1603 until his death in 1617.

==Reign==
[[File:Blue Mosque.jpg|thumb|262px|The [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]].]]
In the earlier part of his reign Ahmed I showed decision and vigor, which were belied by his subsequent conduct. The wars which attended his accession both in [[Hungary]] and in [[Iran|Persia]] terminated unfavourably for the empire, and its prestige received its first check in the [[Treaty of Sitvatorok|Treaty of Zsitvatorok]], signed in 1606, whereby the annual tribute paid by [[Austria]] was abolished. Following the crushing defeat in the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–18)]] against the neighbouring rivalling [[Safavid Empire]] led by Shah [[Abbas the Great]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and other vast territories in the Caucasus were ceded back to Persia per the [[Treaty of Nasuh Pasha]] in 1612, territories which had earlier been temporarily conquered per the outcoming result of the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90)]]. The new borders were drawn per the exact same line as confirmed in the [[Peace of Amasya]] of 1555.<ref>Ga ́bor A ́goston,Bruce Alan Masters [https://books.google.nl/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA23&dq=treaty+of+nasuh+pasha+same+border+peace+of+amasya&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=2IJHVY2KH8TuaImmgfAP&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=treaty%20of%20nasuh%20pasha%20same%20border%20peace%20of%20amasya&f=false ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire''] pp 23 Infobase Publishing, 1 jan. 2009 ISBN 1438110251</ref>

==Personal life==
Ahmed I's mother was [[Valide Sultan|Valide]] [[Handan Sultan]], an ethnic [[Greeks|Greek]] who was originally named Helena. He was born at [[Manisa]] Palace. He succeeded his father [[Mehmed III]] (r. 1595&ndash;1603) in 1603 at age 13. He broke with the traditional fratricide and sent his brother Mustafa to live at the old palace at Bayezit along with their grandmother Safiye Sultan. He was known for his skills in fencing, poetry, horseback riding, and fluency in numerous languages. A half-brother of Ahmed, [[Sultan Yahya|Yahya]], resented his accession to the Ottoman throne in 1603, and spent his life scheming to become Sultan.

Ahmed was a poet who wrote a number of political and lyrical works under the name Bahti. But while supportive of poetry, he displayed an aversion to artistry and continued his father's neglect of [[Ottoman miniature|miniature painting]]. {{Citation needed|reason="Works of fiction are not reliable sources, no matter how excellent"|date=December 2013}} This was connected to a devout religiosity that declared depiction of living things in art an immoral rivalry to [[Allah]]'s creation.<ref name="Heilbrunn">{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/figs/hd_figs.htm |title=Figural Representation in Islamic Art &#124; Thematic Essay &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref> Accordingly, Ahmed patronized scholars, calligraphers, and pious men. Hence he commissioned a book entitled ''The Quintessence of Histories'' to be worked upon by calligraphers. He also attempted to enforce conformance to Islamic laws and traditions, restoring the old regulations that prohibited alcohol and he attempted to enforce attendance at [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayers]] and paying alms to the poor in the proper way.

He was responsible for the destruction of the musical clock organ that [[Elizabeth I of England]] sent to the court during the reign of his father.<ref name="Jardine">{{cite web|last=Jardine |first=Lisa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7155903.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; An eye for detail |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref> The reason for this may have been Ahmed's religious objection to figurative art or the fact that the complex organ served as a daily reminder of the waxing influence and power of the West.

Ahmed I died of [[typhus]] in 1617.

===Marriages and Issue===
Sultan Ahmed I was married twice:
#[[Valide Sultan]] [[Mahfiruze Hatice Sultan]], originally named Hatice, a [[Circassians|Circassian]], daughter of Prince Mirza Alkas Bey and mother of [[Osman II]], Şehzade Huseyn, Şehzade Bayezid and Şehzade Mehmed;
#[[Valide Sultan]] [[Kösem Sultan|Mahpeyker Kösem Sultan]], originally named Anastasia, a [[Greeks|Greek]], daughter of a priest on the island of [[Tinos]] and the mother of [[Murad IV]], [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Ibrahim I]], [[Fatma Sultan (daughter of Ahmed I)|Fatma Sultan]], [[Gevherhan Sultan (daughter of Ahmed I)|Gevherhan Sultan]], Ayşe Sultan, Şehzade Suleiman and Şehzade Kasim;

==Legacy==
[[File:Savary Franco Ottoman Capitulations 1615.jpg|thumb|Bilingual Franco-Turkish translation of the 1604 [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman Capitulations]] between Ahmed I and [[Henry IV of France]], published by [[François Savary de Brèves]] in 1615.<ref name="Bosworth">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA799 |title='&#39;The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111-112 : Masrah Mawlid'&#39; by Clifford Edmund Bosworth p.799 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>]]
Today, Ahmed I is remembered mainly for the construction of the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] (also known as the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Blue Mosque]]), one of the masterpieces of [[Islamic architecture]]. The area in [[Fatih]] around the Mosque is today called Sultanahmet. He died at [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Istanbul]] and is buried in a mausoleum right outside the walls of the famous mosque.
