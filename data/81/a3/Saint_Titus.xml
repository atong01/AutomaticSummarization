He is believed to be a Gentile converted to Christianity by Paul and, according to tradition, was consecrated by him as Bishop of the Island of Crete. Titus brought a fundraising letter from Paul to Corinth, to collect for the poor in Jerusalem. Later, on Crete, Titus appointed presbyters (elders) in every city and remained there into his old age, dying in the city of Candia (modern Heraklion).<extension extension_name='ref'>Smith, William.<space/><italics>Smiths Bible Dictionary</italics><space/>11th printing, November 1975.
