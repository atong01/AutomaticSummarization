"Christmas" is a compound word originating in the term "[[Christ]]'s [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]".

According to these accounts, Jesus was born to Mary, assisted by her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], in the city of [[Bethlehem]].
[[File:Nativity (15th c., Annunciation Cathedral in Moscow).jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the birth of Christ by [[Andrei Rublev|St. Andrei Rublev]], 15th century]]

According to popular tradition, the birth took place in a stable, surrounded by farm animals. A [[manger]] (that is, a feeding trough) is mentioned in {{Bibleverse||Luke|2:7|KJV}}, where it states Mary "wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn" ([[King James Version|KJV]]); and "She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them" ([[New International Version|NIV]]).

 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}</ref> Popular tradition also holds that three kings or wise men (named Melchior, [[Casper (name)|Caspar]], and [[Balthazar (given name)|Balthazar]]) visited the infant Jesus in the manger, though this does not strictly follow the biblical account. The Gospel of Matthew instead describes a visit by an unspecified number of [[Biblical magi|magi]], or astrologers, sometime after Jesus was born while the family was living in a house ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|2:11|KJV}}), who brought gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]] to the young child Jesus. The visitors were said to be following a mysterious star, commonly known as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], believing it to announce the birth of a king of the Jews.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|2:2|131}}.</ref> The commemoration of this visit, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Epiphany]] celebrated on January 6, is the formal end of the Christmas season in some churches.

Christians celebrate Christmas in various ways. In addition to this day being one of the most important and popular for the attendance of church services, there are other devotions and popular traditions. In some [[Christian denominations]], children re-enact the events of the Nativity with animals to portray the event with more realism or sing [[carols]] that reference the event. A long artistic tradition has grown of producing painted depictions of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity in art]]. Nativity scenes are traditionally set in a stable with livestock and include Mary, Joseph, the infant Jesus in the manger, the three wise men, the shepherds and their sheep, the angels, and the Star of Bethlehem.<ref>{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}</ref> Some Christians also display a small re-creation of the Nativity, known as a [[Nativity scene]] or crèche, in their homes, using figurines to portray the key characters of the event. Prior to Christmas Day, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] practices the 40-day [[Nativity Fast]] in anticipation of the birth of Jesus, while much of [[Western Christianity]] celebrates four weeks of [[Advent]]. The final preparations for Christmas are made on [[Christmas Eve]], and many families' major observation of Christmas actually falls in the evening of this day.

Many popular customs associated with Christmas developed independently of the commemoration of Jesus' birth, with certain elements having origins in pre-Christian festivals that were celebrated around the winter solstice by pagan populations who were later [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]]. These elements, including the [[Yule log]] from Yule and gift giving from [[Saturnalia]],<ref name="OriginMyth" /> became [[syncretism|syncretized]] into Christmas over the centuries. The prevailing atmosphere of Christmas has also continually evolved since the holiday's inception, ranging from a sometimes raucous, drunken, [[carnival]]-like state in the [[Middle Ages]],<ref name="Murray">Murray, Alexander, [http://www.historytoday.com/alexander-murray/medieval-christmas "Medieval Christmas"], ''History Today'', December 1986, '''36''' (12), pp. 31 – 39.</ref> to a tamer family-oriented and children-centered theme introduced in a 19th-century transformation.<ref name=standiford>Les Standiford.

===Relation to concurrent celebrations===
Prior to and through the [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] centuries, [[List of winter festivals|winter festivals]]—especially those centered on the [[winter solstice]]—were the most popular of the year in many European pagan cultures. Reasons included the fact that less agricultural work needs to be done during the winter, as well as an expectation of better weather as spring approached.<ref name=AncientHoliday>"[http://www.history.com/minisites/christmas/viewPage?pageId=1252 "Christmas – An Ancient Holiday"], ''The [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'', 2007.</ref> Many modern Christmas customs have been directly influenced by such festivals, including gift-giving and merrymaking from the Roman [[Saturnalia]], greenery, lights, and charity from the Roman New Year, and [[Yule log]]s and various foods from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] feasts.<ref>Coffman, Elesha. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/newsletter/2000/dec08.html Why December 25?] ''Christian History & Biography'', ''[[Christianity Today]]'', 2000.</ref>

[[Norse paganism|Pagan Scandinavia]] celebrated a winter festival called [[Yule]], held in the late December to early January period.<ref name="SIMEK379">Simek (2007:379).</ref>  The word was in use in [[Old English]] (as ''geōl(a)'') by 900, to indicate Christmastide.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/yule ''Dictionary.com Unabridged''. Random House, Inc. accessed 16 Jan "uary 2015]</ref> The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' defines the word as "Christmas or the Christmas season, especially as traditionally celebrated in Northern Europe and North America with customs stemming in part from pagan celebrations of the winter solstice".<ref>[https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=yule ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fifth Edition (2014). Accessed 16 January 2015]</ref>

In eastern Europe also, old pagan traditions were incorporated into Christmas celebrations, an example being the [[Koleda]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages%5CK%5CO%5CKoliadaIT.htm |title=Koliada |publisher=Encyclopediaofukraine.com |accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref> which was incorporated into the [[Christmas carol]].

===Choice of December 25 date===
One theory to explain the choice of 25 December for the celebration of the birth of Jesus is that the purpose was to Christianize the pagan festival in Rome of the ''[[Sol Invictus|Dies Natalis Solis Invicti]]'' means "the birthday of the Unconquered Sun", a festival inaugurated by the Roman emperor [[Aurelian]] (270–275) to celebrate the sun god and celebrated at the winter solstice, 25 December.<ref name="Snyder2003">{{cite book|author=Graydon F.

An explicit expression of this theory appears in an annotation of uncertain date added to a manuscript of a work by 12th-century Syrian bishop [[Jacob Bar-Salibi]]. The scribe who added it wrote: "It was a custom of the Pagans to celebrate on the same 25 December the birthday of the Sun, at which they kindled lights in token of festivity. In these solemnities and revelries the Christians also took part. Accordingly when the doctors of the Church perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this festival, they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should be solemnised on that day." <ref>(cited in ''Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries'', [[Ramsay MacMullen]]. Yale:1997, p. 155)</ref> This idea became popular especially in the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref>Michael Alan Anderson, ''Symbols of Saints'' (ProQuest 2008 ISBN 978-0-54956551-2), p. 45</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://melkite.org/tag/feast-of-the-annunciation|title=» Feast of the Annunciation|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724b.htm 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia: Christmas]: ''Natalis Invicti''</ref>

With regard to a December religious feast of the sun as a god (Sol), as distinct from a solstice feast of the (re)birth of the astronomical sun, one scholar has commented that, "while the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas".<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/33490806/Hijmans-Sol-The-Sun-in-the-Art-and-Religions-of-Rome S.E.

The [[Chronography of 354]], an [[illuminated manuscript]] compiled in Rome, is an early reference to the date of the nativity as December 25.<ref>This document was prepared privately for a Roman aristocrat.

Christmas was promoted in the Christian East as part of the revival of [[Catholicism]] following the death of the pro-[[Arianism|Arian]] Emperor [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. The feast was introduced to [[Constantinople]] in 379, and to [[Antioch]] in about 380. The feast disappeared after [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] resigned as [[bishop]] in 381, although it was reintroduced by [[John Chrysostom]] in about 400.<ref name="CathChrit" />

===Middle Ages===
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in [[western Christianity]] focused on the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|magi]]. But the medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the "forty days of St. Martin" (which began on November 11, the feast of [[St. Martin of Tours]]), now known as Advent.<ref name="Murray" /> In Italy, former [[Saturnalia]]n traditions were attached to Advent.<ref name="Murray"/> Around the 12th century, these traditions transferred again to the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] (December 25 – January 5); a time that appears in the liturgical calendars as Christmastide or Twelve Holy Days.<ref name="Murray"/>
[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|The coronation of Charlemagne on Christmas of 800 helped promote the popularity of the holiday]]
The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after [[Charlemagne]] was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day in 800. King [[Edmund the Martyr]] was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King [[William I of England]] was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.

By the [[High Middle Ages]], the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various [[magnate]]s celebrated Christmas. [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at which twenty-eight oxen and three hundred sheep were eaten.<ref name="Murray"/> The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts. [[Christmas carol|Caroling]] also became popular, and was originally a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. Various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have continued in this form.<ref name="Murray"/> "[[Lord of Misrule|Misrule]]"—drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling—was also an important aspect of the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on [[New Year's Day]], and there was special Christmas ale.<ref name="Murray"/>

Christmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival that incorporated [[ivy]], [[holly]], and other evergreens.<ref name=mcgreevy/> Christmas [[gift-giving]] during the Middle Ages was usually between people with legal relationships, such as tenant and landlord.<ref name=mcgreevy>McGreevy, Patrick.

However, in 17th century England, some groups such as the [[Puritan]]s, strongly condemned the celebration of Christmas, considering it a Catholic invention and the "trappings of [[Papist|popery]]" or the "rags of [[The Beast (Bible)|the Beast]]".<ref name="Durston" /> In contrast, the established [[Church of England|Anglican Church]] "pressed for a more elaborate observance of feasts, penitential seasons, and saints' days.

Protests followed as pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities and for weeks [[Canterbury]] was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with [[holly]] and shouted [[Royalism|royalist]] slogans.<ref name="Durston"/> The book, ''The Vindication of Christmas'' (London, 1652), argued against the Puritans, and makes note of Old English Christmas traditions, dinner, roast apples on the fire, card playing, dances with "plow-boys" and "maidservants", and carol singing.

The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1660 ended the ban, but many Calvinist clergymen still disapproved of Christmas celebration. As such, in [[Scotland]], the Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]] discouraged the observance of Christmas, and though [[James VI]] commanded its celebration in 1618, attendance at church was scant.<ref>Chambers, Robert (1885).

In [[Colonial America]], the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Puritans]] of [[New England]] shared radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. Celebration was outlawed in [[Boston]] from 1659 to 1681. The ban by the Pilgrims was revoked in 1681 by English governor [[Sir Edmund Andros]], however it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.<ref name="Bostonban" />

In the early 19th century, writers imagined [[Tudor period|Tudor]] Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration. In 1843, [[Charles Dickens]] wrote the novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' that helped revive the "spirit" of Christmas and seasonal merriment.<ref name=standiford /><ref name=AFP /> Its instant popularity played a major role in portraying Christmas as a holiday emphasizing family, goodwill, and compassion.<ref>Rowell, Geoffrey, ''Dickens and the Construction of Christmas'', [[History Today]], Volume: 43 Issue: 12, December 1993, pp. 17 – 24</ref>

Dickens sought to construct Christmas as a family-centered festival of generosity, in contrast to the community-based and church-centered observations, the observance of which had dwindled during the late 18th century and early 19th century.<ref>[[Ronald Hutton]] ''Stations of the Sun: The Ritual Year in England''. 1996.

In Britain, the [[Christmas tree#18th and 19th centuries|Christmas tree]] was introduced in the early 19th century following the personal union with the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] by [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], wife of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].

In 1822, [[Clement Clarke Moore]] wrote the poem ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' (popularly known by its first line: ''Twas the Night Before Christmas'').<ref>Moore's poem transferred the genuine old Dutch traditions celebrated at New Year in New York, including the exchange of gifts, family feasting, and tales of "sinterklass" (a derivation in Dutch from "Saint Nicholas", from whence comes the modern "Santa Claus") to Christmas.[http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/ch/in_america.htm ''The history of Christmas: Christmas history in America''], 2006

This also started the cultural conflict between the holiday's spiritual significance and its associated [[commercialism]] that some see as corrupting the holiday.

While the celebration of Christmas was not yet customary in some regions in the U.S., [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] detected "a transition state about Christmas here in New England" in 1856.

Up to the 1950s, in the UK, many Christmas customs were restricted to the upper classes and better-off families. The mass of the population had not adopted many of the Christmas rituals that later became general. The [[Christmas tree]] was rare. Christmas dinner might be beef — certainly not turkey. In their stockings children might get an apple, orange and sweets. Full celebration of a family Christmas with all the trimmings only became widespread with increased prosperity from the 1950s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Weightman |first1=Gavin |last2=Humphries |first2=Steve |title=Christmas Past |date=1987 |publisher=Sidgwick and Jackson |location=London |page=31}}</ref> National papers were published on Christmas Day until 1912.

==Traditions==

[[File:Map of Countries that do not recognize Christmas as Public Holiday.png|thumbnail|right|300px|Map of countries where Christmas is not a formal public holiday either on December 24/25 or January 6/7.]]
Christmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and [[public holiday]] in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian. In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. [[Hong Kong]]); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees.

Countries in which Christmas is not a formal public holiday include [[Afghanistan]], [[Algeria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Bhutan]], [[Cambodia]], [[China]] (excepting [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macao]]), [[Comoros]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Laos]], [[Libya]], [[Maldives]], [[Mauritania]], [[Mongolia]], [[Morocco]], [[North Korea]], [[Oman]], [[Pakistan]], [[Qatar]], [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Yemen]]. Christmas celebrations around the world can vary markedly in form, reflecting differing cultural and national traditions.

Among countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures. For Christians, participating in a religious service plays an important part in the recognition of the season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] countries, people hold religious processions or [[parade]]s in the days preceding Christmas. In other countries, secular processions or parades featuring Santa Claus and other seasonal figures are often held. Family reunions and the exchange of gifts are a widespread feature of the season. Gift giving takes place on Christmas Day in most countries. Others practice gift giving on December 6, Saint Nicholas Day, and January 6, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

Since the 19th century, the [[poinsettia]], a native plant from [[Mexico]], has been associated with Christmas. Other popular holiday plants include holly, [[mistletoe]], red [[amaryllis]], and [[Christmas cactus]]. Along with a Christmas tree, the interior of a home may be decorated with these plants, along with [[Garland (decoration)|garlands]] and [[evergreen]] foliage. The display of [[Christmas village]]s has also become a tradition in many homes during this season. The outside of houses may be decorated with lights and sometimes with illuminated [[Sled|sleighs]], [[snowmen]], and other Christmas figures.

Other traditional decorations include [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[candles]], [[candy canes]], [[Christmas stocking|stockings]], [[wreath]]s, and [[angels]]. Both the displaying of wreaths and candles in each window are a more traditional Christmas display. The concentric assortment of leaves, usually from an [[evergreen]], make up Christmas wreaths and are designed to prepare [[Christians]] for the Advent season. Candles in each window are meant to demonstrate the fact that Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the ultimate light of the world.<ref>{{cite web

===Music and carols===
{{Main|Christmas music}}
[[File:Chant'tie d'Cantiques dé Noué Dézembre 2009 Jèrri a.jpg|thumb|Christmas carolers in [[Jersey]]]]
The earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in 4th-century [[Rome]]. Latin hymns such as "[[Veni redemptor gentium]]", written by [[Ambrose]], Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to [[Arianism]]. "Corde natus ex Parentis" ("Of the Father's love begotten") by the Spanish poet [[Prudentius]] (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today.<ref>Miles, Clement, ''Christmas customs and traditions'', Courier Dover Publications, 1976, ISBN 0-486-23354-5, p.32</ref>

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas "Sequence" or "Prose" was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] into a sequence of rhymed [[stanza]]s. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional [[Christmas carol]].

By the 13th century, in France, Germany, and particularly, Italy, under the influence of [[Francis of Asissi]], a strong tradition of popular Christmas songs in the native language developed.<ref>Miles, pp. 31–37</ref> Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of [[John Audelay|John Awdlay]], a [[Shropshire]] chaplain, who lists twenty-five "caroles of Cristemas", probably sung by groups of [[Wassailing|wassailers]], who went from house to house.<ref>Miles, pp. 47–48</ref>

The songs we know specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as "harvest tide" as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on [[medieval]] chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like "[[Personent hodie]]", "[[Good King Wenceslas]]", and "[[The Holly and the Ivy]]" can be traced directly back to the [[Middle Ages]]. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. "[[Adeste Fideles]]" (O Come all ye faithful) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century.

[[File:Steaua, Bucharest, 1842 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Child singers in [[Bucharest]], 1841]]
Singing of carols initially suffered a decline in popularity after the [[Protestant Reformation]] in northern Europe, although some Reformers, like [[Martin Luther]], wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship. Carols largely survived in rural communities until the revival of interest in popular songs in the 19th century. The 18th-century English reformer [[Charles Wesley]] understood the importance of music to worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, which were influential in the [[Great Awakening]] in the United States, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled "Hark! How All the Welkin Rings", later renamed "[[Hark! the Herald Angels Sing]]".<ref>{{cite book

[[Felix Mendelssohn]] wrote a melody adapted to fit Wesley's words. In Austria in 1818 Mohr and Gruber made a major addition to the genre when they composed "[[Silent Night]]" for the St. Nicholas Church, Oberndorf. [[William Sandys (antiquarian)|William Sandys]]' ''Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern'' (1833) contained the first appearance in print of many now-classic English carols, and contributed to the mid-Victorian revival of the festival.<ref>Richard Michael Kelly.

Completely secular Christmas seasonal songs emerged in the late 18th century. "[[Deck the Halls|Deck The Halls]]" dates from 1784, and the American "[[Jingle Bells]]" was copyrighted in 1857. In the 19th and 20th century, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holidays songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music.

===Traditional cuisine===
[[File:Christmas pudding.JPG|thumb|right|[[Christmas pudding]] cooked on [[Stir-up Sunday]], the Sunday before the beginning of the [[Advent]] season]]
A special [[Christmas dinner|Christmas family meal]] is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions, such as [[Sicily]], have special meals for Christmas Eve, when 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as [[Christmas pudding]], [[mince pie]]s, [[fruit cake]] and [[Yule log]].<ref>Broomfield, Andrea (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=fJ_JDp9OgJEC&pg=PA149&dq=christmas+pudding+england&hl=en&ei=xzAVTc3WNoqWhQePsJW3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=christmas%20pudding%20england&f=false Food and cooking in Victorian England: a history] pp.149–150. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007</ref><ref>Muir, Frank (1977) ''Christmas customs & traditions'' p.58. Taplinger Pub. Co., 1977</ref>

In Poland and other parts of eastern Europe and Scandinavia, fish often is used for the traditional main course, but richer meat such as lamb is increasingly served. In Germany, France, and Austria, goose and pork are favored. Beef, ham, and chicken in various recipes are popular throughout the world. The [[Maltese people|Maltese]] traditionally serve ''[[Imbuljuta tal-Qastan]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schoolnet.gov.mt/HelloEurope/activities/recepies/imbuljuta.html |title=Imbuljuta |publisher=Schoolnet.gov.mt |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref> a chocolate and chestnuts beverage, after [[Midnight Mass]] and throughout the Christmas season. Slovaks prepare the traditional Christmas bread [[potica]], ''[[bûche de Noël]]'' in France, ''[[panettone]]'' in Italy, and elaborate tarts and cakes. The eating of sweets and chocolates has become popular worldwide, and sweeter Christmas delicacies include the German ''[[stollen]]'', [[marzipan]] cake or candy, and Jamaican rum fruit cake. As one of the few fruits traditionally available to northern countries in winter, oranges have been long associated with special Christmas foods. [[Eggnog]] is a [[added sugar|sweetened]] [[dairy]]-based [[sweetened beverage|beverage]] traditionally made with milk and/or cream, sugar, and whipped eggs (which gives it a frothy texture). [[Distilled beverage|Spirits]] such as brandy, rum or bourbon are often added. The finished serving is often garnished with a sprinkling of ground cinnamon or nutmeg.

===Cards===
[[File:Chrisrmas postcard 1907.jpg|alt=|thumb|A 1907 Christmas card with [[Santa]] and some of his reindeer]]
{{Main|Christmas card}}

Christmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads "wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year", much like that of the first commercial [[Christmas card#History|Christmas card]], produced by [[Sir Henry Cole]] in London in 1843.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1679110.stm Christmas card sold for record price] BBC News. Retrieved 2011-10-28</ref> The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging [[E-card]]s.

Christmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities, and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season. The content of the design might relate directly to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Christmas narrative]] with [[Nativity of Jesus in art|depictions of the Nativity of Jesus]], or [[Christian symbols]] such as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], or a white [[dove]] which can represent both the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Peace]] on Earth. Other Christmas cards are more [[secular]] and can depict [[Christmas tradition]]s, mythical figures such as [[Santa Claus]], objects directly associated with Christmas such as candles, holly and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as Christmastide activities, snow scenes and the wildlife of the northern winter. There are even humorous cards and genres depicting nostalgic scenes of the past such as [[crinoline]]d shoppers in idealized 19th century streetscapes.

Some prefer cards with a poem, prayer, or [[Bible verse|Biblical verse]]; while others distance themselves from religion with an all-inclusive "Season's greetings".

===Commemorative stamps===
{{Main|Christmas stamp}}
[[File:United States Christmas stamp 1982 Madonna of the Goldfinch, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo c. 1760.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Christmas stamp released in the United States in 1982, featuring a painting by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]]]
A number of nations have issued [[commemorative stamp]]s at Christmastide. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail [[Christmas card]]s, and they are popular with [[philately|philatelists]]. These stamps are regular [[postage stamps]], unlike [[Christmas seal]]s, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale some time between early October and early December, and are printed in considerable quantities.

In 1898 a Canadian stamp was issued to mark the inauguration of the Imperial Penny Postage rate. The stamp features a map of the globe and bears an inscription "XMAS 1898" at the bottom. In 1937, Austria issued two "Christmas greeting stamps" featuring a [[rose]] and the signs of the [[zodiac]]. In 1939, [[Brazil]] issued four [[semi-postal]] stamps with designs featuring the [[three kings]] and a [[star of Bethlehem]], an [[angel]] and child, the [[Southern Cross]] and a child, and a mother and child.

Both the [[US Postal Service]] and the United Kingdom's [[Royal Mail]] regularly issue Christmas-themed stamps each year.

===Gift giving===
[[File:Gifts xmas.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Christmas gifts underneath a Christmas tree.]]
The exchanging of [[gift]]s is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for [[retail]]ers and businesses throughout the world. Gift giving was common in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] celebration of [[Saturnalia]], an ancient festival which took place in late December and may have influenced Christmas customs.<ref name="OriginMyth">{{Wayback |date=20110430004539 |url=http://www.bsu.edu/web/01bkswartz/xmaspub.html |title=The Origin of the American Christmas Myth and Customs }} – ''Ball State University''.

====Gift-bearing figures====
{{Main|Santa Claus|Father Christmas}}
[[File:Sinterklaas 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Sinterklaas]] or [[Saint Nicholas]], considered by many to be the original Santa Claus]]
A number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are [[Father Christmas]], also known as [[Santa Claus]] (derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for Saint Nicholas), Père Noël, and the [[Weihnachtsmann]]; [[Saint Nicholas]] or [[Sinterklaas]]; the [[Christkind]]; Kris Kringle; [[Joulupukki]]; Babbo Natale; [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]]; and [[Ded Moroz|Father Frost]].

The best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus, of diverse origins. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the Dutch ''Sinterklaas'', which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was a 4th-century [[Greeks in Turkey#History|Greek]] [[bishop]] of [[Myra]], a city in the [[Roman province]] of [[Lycia]], whose ruins are {{convert|3|km}} from modern [[Demre]] in southwest Turkey.<ref>{{cite book |author= Domenico, Roy Palmer |title= The regions of Italy: a reference guide to history and culture |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |year= 2002 |page=21 |isbn= 0-313-30733-4 |quote= Saint Nicholas (Bishop of Myra) replaced Sabino as the patron saint of the city...

The son of a businessman named Theophanes and his wife, Nonna, the child's earliest years were spent in Myra... As a port on the Mediterranean Sea, in the middle of the sea lanes that linked Egypt, Greece and Rome, Myra was a destination for traders, fishermen, and merchant sailors. Spawned by the spirit of both the city's Greek heritage and the ruling Roman government, cultural endeavours such as art, drama, and music were mainstays of everyday life. }}</ref> Among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. His feast day, December 6, came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.<ref name=ADS>Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, ISBN 0-520-25104-0, pp. 68–79.</ref>

Saint Nicholas traditionally appeared in bishop's attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th–17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''Christkindl'', corrupted in English to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.<ref name="ADS"/>

The modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including [[Washington Irving]] and the [[German American|German-American]] cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] (1840–1902). Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city's non-English past. New York had originally been established as the Dutch colonial town of [[New Amsterdam]] and the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was reinvented as Saint Nicholas.<ref>{{cite web

In 1809, the [[New-York Historical Society]] convened and retroactively named ''Sancte Claus'' the patron saint of [[New Amsterdam|Nieuw Amsterdam]], the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name for [[New York City]].<ref>John Steele Gordon, ''[[The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653–2000]]'' (Scribner) 1999.</ref> At his first American appearance in 1810, Santa Claus was drawn in bishops' robes.

Father Christmas, a jolly, well nourished, bearded man who typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas, predates the Santa Claus character. He is first recorded in early 17th century England, but was associated with holiday merrymaking and [[drunkenness]] rather than the bringing of gifts.<ref name=Harper/> In [[Victorian Britain]], his image was remade to match that of Santa. The French [[Père Noël]] evolved along similar lines, eventually adopting the Santa image. In Italy, Babbo Natale acts as Santa Claus, while [[La Befana]] is the bringer of gifts and arrives on the eve of the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]]. It is said that La Befana set out to bring the baby Jesus gifts, but got lost along the way. Now, she brings gifts to all children. In some cultures Santa Claus is accompanied by [[Knecht Ruprecht]], or [[Zwarte Piet|Black Peter]]. In other versions, [[elf|elves]] make the toys. His wife is referred to as [[Mrs. Claus]].

Current tradition in several [[Latin American]] countries (such as [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]]) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the Baby Jesus, who is the one who actually delivers them to the children's homes, a reconciliation between traditional [[Religion|religious beliefs]] and the [[iconography]] of Santa Claus imported from the United States.

In [[South Tyrol]] (Italy), Austria, Czech Republic, Southern Germany, Hungary, [[Liechtenstein]], [[Slovakia]], and Switzerland, the [[Christkind]] ([[Ježíšek]] in Czech, Jézuska in Hungarian and Ježiško in Slovak) brings the presents. Greek children get their presents from [[Saint Basil]] on New Year's Eve, the eve of that saint's liturgical feast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skiathosbooks.com/saints_basil.htm |title=St. Basil (330–379) |publisher=Skiathosbooks.com |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref> The German St. Nikolaus is not identical with the Weihnachtsmann (who is the German version of Santa Claus / Father Christmas).

Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus and other gift bringers, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.<ref>Matera, Mariane.

The belief that [[God the Son|God]] came into the world in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|form of man]] to [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for the [[sin]]s of humanity, rather than the exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.<ref name="Joan Chittister, Phyllis Tickle">{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=inhMGc5732kC&pg=PT40&dq=date+of+christmas+important#v=onepage&q=date%20of%20christmas%20important&f=false| title = The Liturgical Year|publisher = [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]]|quote=Christmas is not really about the celebration of a birth date at all. It is about the celebration of a birth. The fact of the date and the fact of the birth are two different things. The calendrical verification of the feast itself is not really that important ... What is important to the understanding of a life-changing moment is that it happened, not necessarily where or when it happened. The message is clear: Christmas is not about marking the actual birth date of Jesus. It is about the Incarnation of the One who became like us in all things but sin (Heb. 4:15) and who humbled Himself "to the point of death-even death on a cross" (Phil. 2:8). Christmas is a pinnacle feast, yes, but it is not the beginning of the liturgical year. It is a memorial, a remembrance, of the birth of Jesus, not really a celebration of the day itself. We remember that because the Jesus of history was born, the Resurrection of the Christ of faith could happen. |accessdate = 2009-04-02| isbn = 9781418580735| date = 2009-11-03}}</ref><ref name="Voice-Christmas">{{cite web|url = http://www.crivoice.org/cyxmas.html| title = The Christmas Season|publisher = CRI / Voice, Institute|accessdate = 2 April 2009|quote=The origins of the celebrations of Christmas and Epiphany, as well as the dates on which they are observed, are rooted deeply in the history of the early church.

The best estimate is that Jesus was probably born in the springtime, somewhere between the years of 6 and 4 BC. The lack of a consistent system of timekeeping in the first century, mistakes in later calendars and calculations, and lack of historical details to cross reference events has led to this imprecision in fixing Jesus' birth.

In the early 4th century, the church calendar in Rome contained Christmas on December 25 and other holidays placed on solar dates. According to Hijmans<ref name="Hijmans">Hijmans, S.E., ''[http://www.scribd.com/doc/33490806/Hijmans-Sol-The-Sun-in-the-Art-and-Religions-of-Rome Sol, the sun in the art and religions of Rome],'' 2009, p. 595.

Usener<ref>[[Hermann Usener]], ''Das Weihnachtsfest'' (Part 1 of ''Religionsgeschichtliche Untersuchungen'', Second edition 1911; Verlag von Max Cohen & Sohn, Bonn.  (Note that the first edition, 1889, doesn't have the discussion of Natalis Solis Invicti); also ''Sol Invictus'' (1905).)</ref> and others<ref name="Christmas"/> proposed that the Christians chose this day because it was the Roman feast celebrating the birthday of Sol Invictus.  Modern scholar S. E. Hijmans, however, states that "While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas."<ref name="Hijmans" />

Around the year 386 [[John Chrysostom]] delivered a sermon in [[Antioch]] in favour of adopting the 25 December celebration also in the East, since, he said, the conception of Jesus ({{bibleverse||Luke|1:26|31}}) had been announced during the sixth month of Elisabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist ({{bibleverse||Luke|1:10–13|31}}), which he dated from the duties Zacharias performed on the [[Day of Atonement]] during the seventh month of the [[Hebrew calendar]] Ethanim or Tishri ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:29|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Kings|8:2|31}}) which falls from late September to early October.<ref name="CathChrit"/> That shepherds watched the flocks by night in the fields in the winter time is supported by the phrase "frost by night" in {{bibleverse||Genesis|31:38–40|31}}. A special group known as the shepherds of [[Migdal Eder (biblical location)|Migdal Eder]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|35:19–21|31}}, {{bibleverse||Micah|4:8|31}}) watched the flocks by night year round pastured for Temple Sacrifice near Bethlehem.<ref name="Gibson">Gibson, David J.

In the early 18th century, some scholars proposed alternative explanations. [[Isaac Newton]] argued that the date of Christmas, celebrating the birth of him whom Christians consider to be the "Sun of righteousness" prophesied in {{bibleverse||Malachi|4:2|31}},<ref name="Newton"/> was selected to correspond with the southern solstice, which the Romans called ''bruma'', celebrated on December 25.<ref name="SolsticeDate">"[http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/SF/WinSol.html Bruma]", ''Seasonal Festivals of the Greeks and Romans''<br />[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137&query=head%3D%231117 18:59]</ref> In 1743, German Protestant Paul Ernst Jablonski argued Christmas was placed on December 25 to correspond with the Roman solar holiday ''[[Dies Natalis Solis Invicti]]'' and was therefore a "paganization" that debased the true church.<ref name="SolInvictus"/> It has been argued that, on the contrary, the Emperor [[Aurelian]], who in 274 instituted the holiday of the ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'', did so partly as an attempt to give a pagan significance to a date already important for Christians in Rome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-10-012-v |title=William J.

===Using the Julian calendar===
Some [[Eastern Orthodox]] national churches, including those of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgia]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church|Ukraine]], [[Macedonian Orthodox Church|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbia]], and the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] mark feasts using the older [[Julian calendar]]. December 25 on the Julian calendar currently corresponds to January 7 on the internationally used [[Gregorian calendar]]. However, other Orthodox Christians, such as the churches of [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgaria]], [[Church of Greece|Greece]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]], [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antioch]], [[Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Albania]], [[Orthodox Church of Finland|Finland]], and the [[Orthodox Church in America]], among others, began using the [[Revised Julian calendar]] in the early 20th century, which at present corresponds exactly to the Gregorian calendar.<ref name=4Dates>
{{cite web
|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/bethlehem-christmas
|title=Christmas in Bethlehem}}
</ref>

The original date of the celebration in [[Eastern Christianity]] was January 6, in connection with [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], and that is still the date of the celebration for the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and in Armenia, where it is a public holiday. As of {{currentyear}}, there is a difference of 13 days between the modern [[Gregorian calendar]] and the older [[Julian calendar]]. Those who continue to use the Julian calendar or its equivalents thus celebrate December 25 and January 6, which on the Gregorian calendar translate as January 7 and January 19. For this reason, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Serbia, Montenegro, the Republic of Macedonia, and the Republic of Moldova celebrate Christmas on what in the Gregorian calendar is January 7. [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches in [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgaria]], [[Church of Greece|Greece]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]], [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antioch]], [[Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Albania]], [[Orthodox Church of Finland|Finland]], and the [[Orthodox Church in America]] celebrate Christmas on December 25 in the [[revised Julian calendar]], corresponding to December 25 also in the Gregorian calendar.

In most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In [[England and Wales]], the [[Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004]] prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. [[Scotland]] is currently planning similar legislation. [[Film studio]]s release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, [[fantasy]] movies or high-tone dramas with high production values to hopes of maximizing the chance of nominations for the [[Academy Awards]].

One [[economist]]'s analysis calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a [[deadweight loss]] under orthodox [[microeconomic theory]], because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone.<ref name="Deadweight">"The Deadweight Loss of Christmas", ''American Economic Review'', December 1993, '''83''' (5)</ref><ref name="econ">[http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=885748 "Is Santa a deadweight loss?"] ''The Economist'' December 20, 2001</ref> Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as [[white elephant]]s, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.<ref>Reuters.
