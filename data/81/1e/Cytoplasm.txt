{{Organelle diagram}}

The '''cytoplasm''' comprises [[cytosol]] (the gel-like substance enclosed within the cell membrane) – and the [[organelle]]s – the [[cell (biology)|cell]]'s internal sub-structures. All of the contents of the cells of [[prokaryote]] organisms (such as [[bacteria]], which lack a [[cell nucleus]]) are contained within the cytoplasm.  Within the cells of [[eukaryote]] organisms the contents of the [[cell nucleus]] are separated from the cytoplasm, and are then called the [[nucleoplasm]]. The cytoplasm is about 80% water and usually colorless.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fi.edu/qa97/biology/cells/cell3.html | title =Cytoplasm | author =''[[Franklin Institute]]'' | publisher =fi.edu | date =November 23, 2013}}</ref>

It is within the cytoplasm that most cellular activities occur, such as many [[metabolic pathway]]s including [[glycolysis]], and processes such as [[cell division]]. The concentrated inner area is called the [[endoplasm]] and the outer layer is called the [[cell cortex]] or the [[ectoplasm (cell biology)|ectoplasm]].

Movement of [[calcium ion]]s in and out of the cytoplasm is thought to be a [[Recognition signal|signaling]] activity for [[metabolic]] processes.<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Calcium?topic=49557 ''Calcium''. eds. A.Jorgensen, C. Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth]. National Council for Science and the Environment.</ref>

In [[plant]]s, movements of the cytoplasm around vacuoles are known as [[cytoplasmic streaming]].

==Physical nature of cytoplasm==
The physical properties of the cytoplasm have been contested in recent years.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It remains uncertain how the varied components of the cytoplasm interact to allow movement of particles{{clarify|reason=what particles?|date September 2015|date=September 2015}} and [[organelles]] while maintaining the cell’s structure. The flow of cytoplasmic components plays an important role in many cellular functions which are dependent on the [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] of the cytoplasm.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3519356/</ref> An obvious example of such function is [[cell signalling]], a process which is dependent on the manner in which signaling molecules are allowed to [[diffuse]] across the cell.<ref>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000634950474312X</ref> While small signaling molecules like [[calcium ions]] are able to diffuse with ease, larger molecules and subcellular structures often require aid in moving through the cytoplasm.<ref name="autogenerated1">http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2813%2901479-7</ref> The irregular dynamics of such particles have given rise to various theories on the nature of the cytoplasm. 

===Cytoplasm as a sol-gel===

There has long been evidence that the cytoplasm behaves like a [[sol-gel]].<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1400370302/abstract</ref> It is thought that the component molecules and structures of the cytoplasm behave at times like a disordered [[colloidal]] solution (sol) and at other times like an integrated network, forming a solid mass (gel). This theory thus proposes that the cytoplasm exists in distinct fluid and solid phases depending on the level of interaction between cytoplasmic components, which may explain the differential dynamics of different particles observed moving through the cytoplasm.

===Cytoplasm as a glass===

Recently it has been proposed that the cytoplasm behaves like a [[glass]]-forming liquid approaching the [[glass transition]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/> In this theory, the greater the concentration of cytoplasmic components, the less the cytoplasm behaves like a liquid and the more it behaves as a solid glass, freezing larger cytoplasmic components in place (it is thought that the cell's metabolic activity is able to fluidize the cytoplasm to allow the movement of such larger cytoplasmic components).<ref name="autogenerated1"/> A cell's ability to vitrifiy in the absence of metabolic activity, as in dormant periods, may be beneficial as a defence strategy. A solid glass cytoplasm would freeze subcellular structures in place, preventing damage, while allowing the transmission of very small proteins and metabolites, helping to kickstart growth upon the cell's revival from [[dormancy]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===Other perspectives===

There has been research examining the motion of cytoplasmic particles independent of the nature of the cytoplasm. In such an alternative approach, the aggregate random forces within the cell caused by [[motor proteins]] explain the non-[[Brownian motion]] of cytoplasmic constituents.<ref>http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2814%2900924-6</ref>

==Constituents==
The three major elements of the cytoplasm are the [[cytosol]], [[organelles]] and [[cytoplasmic inclusions|inclusions]]. 

===Cytosol===
{{main|Cytosol}}

The cytosol is the portion of the cytoplasm not contained within membrane-bound organelles. Cytosol makes up about 70% of the cell volume and is a complex mixture of [[cytoskeleton]] filaments, dissolved molecules, and water. The cytosol's filaments include the [[protein filament]]s such as [[actin filament]]s and [[microtubule]]s that make up the cytoskeleton, as well as soluble [[proteins]] and small structures such as [[ribosome]]s, [[proteasome]]s, and the mysterious [[Vault (organelle)|vault complexes]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Zon A, Mossink MH, Scheper RJ, Sonneveld P, Wiemer EA |title=The vault complex |journal=Cell. Mol. Life Sci. |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=1828–37 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14523546 |doi=10.1007/s00018-003-3030-y}}</ref> The inner, granular and more fluid portion of the cytoplasm is referred to as endoplasm.[[Image:Localisations02eng.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Proteins in different [[cellular compartment]]s and structures tagged with [[green fluorescent protein]]]]

Due to this network of fibres and high concentrations of dissolved [[macromolecule]]s, such as [[protein]]s, an effect called [[macromolecular crowding]] occurs and the cytosol does not act as an [[ideal solution]]. This crowding effect alters how the components of the cytosol interact with each other.

===Organelles===
{{main|Organelles}}
Organelles (literally "little organs"), are usually membrane-bound structures inside the cell that have specific functions. Some major organelles that are suspended in the cytosol are the [[mitochondria]], the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], the [[Golgi apparatus]], [[vacuoles]], [[lysosomes]], and in plant cells [[chloroplast]]s.

===Cytoplasmic inclusions===
{{main|Cytoplasmic inclusion}}
The inclusions are small particles of insoluble substances suspended in the cytosol. A huge range of inclusions exist in different cell types, and range from crystals of [[calcium oxalate]] or [[silicon dioxide]] in plants,<ref name=Prychid1999>{{Cite journal | author = Prychid, Christina J.; Rudall, Paula J. | year = 1999 | title = Calcium Oxalate Crystals in Monocotyledons: A Review of their Structure and Systematics | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 84 | issue = 6 | page = 725 | doi = 10.1006/anbo.1999.0975 | url = http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/6/725}}</ref><ref name=Prychid2003>{{Cite journal | author = Prychid, C.

===Controversy and research===
The cytoplasm, mitochondria and most organelles are contributions to the cell from the maternal gamete. Contrary to the older information that disregards any notion of the cytoplasm being active, new research has shown it to be in control of movement and flow of nutrients in and out of the cell by [[Viscoelasticity|viscoplastic behavior]] and ... a measure of the reciprocal rate of bond breakage within the cytoplasmic network.<ref name=Viscoplasticity>{{cite journal|last=Feneberg|first=Wolfgang |author2=Sackmann, Erich |author3=Westphal, Monika|title=Dictyostelium cells' cytoplasm as an active viscoplastic body|journal=European Biophysics Journal |year=2001|pmid=11548131|doi=10.1007/s002490100135|volume=30|issue=4|pages=284–94 |url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00249/bibs/1030004/10300284.htm}}</ref>

The material properties of the cytoplasm remain an ongoing investigation. Recent measurements using [[force spectrum microscopy]] reveal that the cytoplasm can be likened to an elastic solid, rather than a viscoelastic fluid.
