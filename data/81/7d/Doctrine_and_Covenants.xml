Of these, only section 107 was a revelation. The World Conference of 1990 subsequently removed the entire appendix from the Doctrine and Covenants. Section 108A contained the minutes of a business meeting, which, because of its historical nature, was moved to the Introduction in the 1970s.

The record of these leadership changes are still maintained in the form of published &quot;letters of counsel.&quot; ProphetPresident Stephen M. Veazey has conformed to this pattern. Although these letters are not formally published in the Doctrine and Covenants, they are still deemed to be inspired, and are dealt with in the same manner that revelations are (that is, they must be deliberated and approved by the voting members of a World Conference).</paragraph><paragraph>A modern revelation that resulted in some &quot;disaffection&quot; and &quot;led to intense conflict in scattered areas of the RLDS Church&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Howard, R.P.
