Ethnic Greeks sought the forced &quot;Hellenization&quot; of ethnic Bulgars, who sought &quot;Bulgarization&quot; of Greeks. Both nations sent armed irregulars into Ottoman territory to protect and assist their ethnic kindred. From 1904, there was low intensity warfare in Macedonia between the Greek and Bulgarian bands and the Ottoman army (the<space/><link><target>Struggle for Macedonia</target></link>). After the<space/><link><target>Young Turks</target><part>Young Turk revolution</part></link><space/>of July 1908, the situation changed drastically.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Young Turk Revolution</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Young Turk Revolution</arg></template>The 1908<space/><link><target>Young Turk Revolution</target></link><space/>saw the reinstatement of constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire and the start of the<space/><link><target>Second Constitutional Era</target></link>. When the revolt broke out, it was supported by intellectuals, the army, and almost all the ethnic minorities of the Empire, and forced Sultan<space/><link><target>Abdul Hamid II</target></link><space/>to re-adopt the long defunct<space/><link><target>Ottoman constitution of 1876</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Ottoman parliament</target><part>parliament</part></link>. Hopes were raised among the Balkan ethnicities of reforms and autonomy, and elections were held to form a representative, multi-ethnic, Ottoman parliament. However, following the Sultan's<space/><link><target>Ottoman countercoup of 1909</target><part>attempted counter-coup</part></link>, the liberal element of the Young Turks was sidelined and the nationalist element became dominant.</paragraph><paragraph>At the same time, in October 1908, Austria-Hungary seized the opportunity of the Ottoman political upheaval to annex the<space/><italics>de jure</italics><space/>Ottoman province of<space/><link><target>Bosnia and Herzegovina</target></link>, which it had occupied since 1878 (see<space/><italics><link><target>Bosnian Crisis</target></link></italics>).

Greece accepted in exchange for allowing a Greek unit to enter the city of<space/><link><target>Serres, Greece</target><part>Serres</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>The Bulgarian unit that entered Thessaloniki turned out to be a 18,000-strong division instead of the battalion, something which caused concern among the Greeks, who viewed it as a Bulgarian attempt to establish a<space/><link><target>Condominium (international law)</target><part>condominium</part></link><space/>over the city. In the event, due to the urgently needed reinforcements in the Thracian front, Bulgarian Headquarters was soon forced to remove its troops from the city (while the Greeks agreed by mutual treaty to remove their units based in<space/><link><target>Serres</target></link>) and transport them to Dedeaa (modern<space/><link><target>Alexandroupolis</target></link>), but still it left behind a battalion that started fortifying its positions.</paragraph><paragraph>Greece had also allowed the Bulgarians to control the stretch of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople railroad that lay in Greek-occupied territory, since Bulgaria controlled the largest part of this railroad towards Thrace. After the end of the operations in Thraceand confirming Greek concernsBulgaria was not satisfied with the territory it controlled in Macedonia and immediately asked Greece to relinquish its control over Thessaloniki and the land north of<space/><link><target>Pieria (regional unit)</target><part>Pieria</part></link>, effectively handing over all Aegean Macedonia. These unacceptable demands together with the Bulgarian refusal to demobilize its army after the<space/><link><target>Treaty of London (1913)</target><part>Treaty of London</part></link><space/>had ended the common war against the Ottomans and alarmed Greece, which decided also to maintain its army's mobilization.</paragraph><paragraph>Similarly, in northern Macedonia, the tension between Serbia and Bulgaria due to later aspirations over<space/><link><target>Vardar Macedonia</target></link><space/>generated many incidents between the nearby armies, prompting Serbia to maintain its army's mobilization. Serbia and Greece proposed that each of the three countries reduce its army by one fourth, as a first step to facilitate a peaceful solution, but Bulgaria rejected it.Seeing the omens, Greece and Serbia started a series of negotiations and signed a treaty on 1 June(19 May) 1913. With this treaty, a mutual border was agreed between the two countries, together with an agreement for mutual military and diplomatic support in case of a Bulgarian or/and Austro-Hungarian attack. Tsar<space/><link><target>Nicholas II of Russia</target></link>, being well informed, tried to stop the upcoming conflict on 8 June, by sending an identical personal message to the Kings of Bulgaria and Serbia, offering to act as arbitrator according to the provisions of the 1912 Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. But Bulgaria, by making the acceptance of Russian<space/><link><target>arbitration</target></link><space/>conditional, in effect denied any discussion and caused Russia to repudiate its alliance with Bulgaria (see Russo-Bulgarian military convention signed 31 May 1902).</paragraph><paragraph>The Serbs and the Greeks had a military advantage on the eve of the war because their armies confronted comparatively weak Ottoman forces in the First Balkan War and suffered relatively light casualties<extension extension_name='ref' name="Hall 2000, p. 117"><template><target>harvnb</target><arg>Hall</arg><arg>2000</arg><arg name="p">117</arg></template></extension><space/>while the Bulgarians were involved in heavy fighting in Thrace.

The battle was continued for 11 days, between 29 July and 9 August over 20&amp;nbsp;km of a maze of forests and mountains with no conclusion. The Greek King, seeing that the units he fought were from the Serbian front, tried to convince the Serbs to renew their attack, as the front ahead of them was now thinner, but the Serbs rejected it. By then, news came of the Romanian advance toward Sofia and its imminent fall.

The French however failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the Balkan conflict.</listitem><listitem>The<space/><link><target>British Empire</target></link>, although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire's integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging Greek entry into the League in order to counteract Russian influence. At the same time it encouraged Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace, preferring a Bulgarian Thrace to a Russian one, despite the assurances the British had given to the Russians in regard to their expansion there.</listitem><listitem><link><target>Austria-Hungary</target></link>, struggling for a port on the<space/><link><target>Adriatic</target></link><space/>and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation's expansion in the area. At the same time, the Habsburg empire had its own internal problems with significant Slav populations that campaigned against German-Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of Austrian-held Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria's Slav subjects. But Austria-Hungary failed to secure German backup for a firm reaction. Initially, Emperor<space/><link><target>Wilhelm II</target></link><space/>told the<space/><link><target>Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</target><part>Archduke Franz Ferdinand</part></link><space/>that Germany was ready to support Austria in all circumstanceseven at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the<space/><link><target>German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912</target></link><space/>the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and passed notes to that effect to the Habsburgs. Consequently, no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austrian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania.</listitem><listitem><link><target>German Empire</target><part>Germany</part></link>, already heavily involved in internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Empire. But in her effort to win Bulgaria for the<space/><link><target>Central Powers</target></link>, and seeing the<space/><link><target>Sick man of Europe</target><part>inevitability</part></link><space/>of Ottoman disintegration, was toying with the idea of replacing the Balkan area of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in her<space/><link><target>Treaty of San Stefano</target><part>San Stefano</part></link><space/>bordersan idea that was based on the German origin of the<space/><link><target>Ferdinand of Bulgaria</target><part>Bulgarian King</part></link><space/>and his anti-Russian sentiments.</listitem></list><paragraph>The<space/><bold>Second Balkan war</bold><space/>was a catastrophic blow to Russian policies in the Balkans, where Russia had focused its interests for access to the &quot;warm seas&quot; for centuries. First, it marked the end of the Balkan League, a vital arm of the Russian system of defense against Austria-Hungary. Second, the clearly pro-Serbian position Russia had been forced to take in the conflict, mainly due to Bulgaria's uncompromising aggressiveness, caused a permanent break-up between the two countries. Accordingly, Bulgaria reverted its policy to one closer to the<space/><link><target>Central Powers</target></link>' understanding over an anti-Serbian front, due to its new national aspirations, now expressed mainly against Serbia. As a result, Serbia was isolated militarily against its rival Austria-Hungary, a development that eventually doomed Serbia in the coming war a year later. But most damaging, the new situation effectively trapped Russian foreign policy: After 1913, Russia could not afford losing its last ally in this crucial area and thus had no alternatives but to unconditionally support Serbia when the crisis between Serbia and Austria broke out in 1914. This was a position that inevitably drew her, although unwillingly, into a World War with devastating results for her, since she was less prepared (both militarily and socially) for that event than any other Great Power.</paragraph><paragraph>Austria-Hungary took alarm at the great increase in Serbia's territory at the expense of its national aspirations in the region, as well as Serbia's rising status, especially to Austria-Hungary's Slavic populations. This concern was shared by Germany, which saw Serbia as a satellite of Russia.
