A '''carboxylic acid''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɑr|b|ɒ|k|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|ɪ|k|}} is an [[organic compound]] that contains a carboxyl group (C(O)OH).<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=carboxylic acids|file=C00852}}</ref> The general formula of a carboxylic acid is R−C(O)OH with R referring to the rest of the (possibly quite large) molecule.  Carboxylic acids occur widely and include the [[amino acid]]s and [[acetic acid]] (as [[vinegar]]).

[[Salt (chemistry)|Salts]] and [[ester]]s of carboxylic acids are called [[carboxylate]]s. When a carboxyl group is [[deprotonate]]d, its [[conjugate base]] forms a carboxylate [[anion]]. Carboxylate ions are [[resonance-stabilized]], and this increased stability makes carboxylic acids more acidic than [[alcohol]]s. Carboxylic acids can be seen as reduced or alkylated forms of the [[Lewis acid]] [[carbon dioxide]]; under some circumstances they can be [[decarboxylation|decarboxylated]] to yield carbon dioxide.

==Example carboxylic acids and nomenclature==
Carboxylic acids are commonly named as indicated in the table below. Although rarely used, [[IUPAC]]-recommended names also exist. For example, [[butyric acid]] (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H) is, according to IUPAC guidelines, also known as butanoic acid.<ref>[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_24.htm Recommendations 1979]. Organic Chemistry IUPAC Nomenclature. Rules C-4 Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives.</ref>

To more easily understand much of the below discussion of reactions involving carboxylic acids it can be helpful to notice that the carboxyl group itself is a "hydroxylated carbonyl group" meaning that two of the carbon atom's four bonds are to an oxygen atom, the carbon atom's third bond is to a second oxygen atom (whose other bond is to a hydrogen atom), and the carbon atom's fourth bond attaches to R.  [A carbon atom double bonded to an oxygen atom is a [[carbonyl group]] and two of the carbon atom's bonds remain available for bonding.  A hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom is a [[hydroxyl group]] with the oxygen atom's second bond available for bonding.]

The [[carboxylate|carboxylate anion]] R-COO<sup>−</sup> is usually named with the suffix ''ate'', so acetic acid, for example, becomes acetate ion. In [[IUPAC nomenclature]], carboxylic acids have an ''oic acid'' suffix (e.g., octadecanoic acid). For [[trivial name]]s, the suffix is usually ''ic acid'' (e.g., [[stearic acid]]).

==Physical properties==
===Solubility===
[[Image:Carboxylic acid dimers.png|thumb|right|Carboxylic acid [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]]]]
Carboxylic acids are [[polarity (chemistry)|polar]]. Because they are both hydrogen-bond acceptors (the carbonyl -C=O) and hydrogen-bond donors (the hydroxyl -OH), they also participate in [[hydrogen bond]]ing. Together the hydroxyl and carbonyl group forms the functional group carboxyl. Carboxylic acids usually exist as dimeric pairs in nonpolar media due to their tendency to “self-associate.” Smaller carboxylic acids (1 to 5 carbons) are soluble in water, whereas higher carboxylic acids are less soluble due to the increasing hydrophobic nature of the alkyl chain. These longer chain acids tend to be rather soluble in less-polar solvents such as ethers and alcohols.<ref name=M&B>Morrison, R.T. and Boyd, R.N. (1992) ''Organic Chemistry'', 6th ed. ISBN 0-13-643669-2.</ref>

===Boiling points===
Carboxylic acids tend to have higher boiling points than water, not only because of their increased surface area, but because of their tendency to form stabilised dimers. Carboxylic acids tend to evaporate or boil as these dimers. For boiling to occur, either the dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporised, both of which increase the [[enthalpy of vaporization]] requirements significantly.

===Acidity===
Carboxylic acids are [[Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory|Brønsted-Lowry acids]] because they are proton (H<sup>+</sup>) donors. They are the most common type of [[organic acid]]. 

Carboxylic acids are typically [[weak acid]]s, meaning that they only partially [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into H<sup>+</sup> [[cation]]s and RCOO<sup>−</sup> [[anion]]s in neutral [[Water (molecule)|aqueous]] solution. For example, at room temperature, in a 1-[[molarity|molar]] solution of [[acetic acid]], only 0.4% of the acid molecules are dissociated. Electronegative substituents give stronger acids.

[[Deprotonation]] of carboxylic acids gives carboxylate anions; these are [[resonance stabilized]], because the negative charge is delocalized over the two oxygen atoms, increasing the stability of the anion.  Each of the carbon-oxygen bonds in the carboxylate anion has a partial double-bond character.

===Odor===
Carboxylic acids often have strong odors, especially the volatile derivatives. Most common are acetic acid (vinegar) and butyric acid ([[human vomit]]). Conversely [[esters]] of carboxylic acids tend to have pleasant odors and many are used in [[perfume]].

==Characterization==
Carboxylic acids are readily identified as such by [[infrared spectroscopy]]. They exhibit a sharp band associated with vibration of the C-O vibration bond (ν<sub>C=O</sub>) between 1680 and 1725&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup>. A characteristic ν<sub>O-H</sub> band appears as a broad peak in the 2500 to 3000&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup> region.<ref name=M&B/> By <sup>1</sup>H [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] spectrometry, the [[hydroxyl]] hydrogen appears in the 10–13 ppm region, although it is often either broadened or not observed owing to exchange with traces of water.

==Occurrence and applications==
Many carboxylic acids are produced industrially on a large scale. They are also pervasive in nature. Esters of fatty acids are the main components of lipids and polyamides of aminocarboxylic acids are the main components of proteins.

Carboxylic acids are used in the production of polymers, pharmaceuticals, solvents, and food additives. Industrially important carboxylic acids include acetic acid (component of vinegar, precursor to solvents and coatings), [[acrylic acid|acrylic and methacrylic acids]] (precursors to polymers, adhesives), [[adipic acid]] (polymers), [[citric acid]] (beverages), [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] (chelating agent), [[fatty acid]]s (coatings), [[maleic acid]] (polymers), [[propionic acid]] (food preservative), [[terephthalic acid]] (polymers).

==Synthesis==
===Industrial routes===
In general, industrial routes to carboxylic acids differ from those used on smaller scale because they require specialized equipment.
*Oxidation of [[aldehyde]]s with air using cobalt and manganese catalysts. The required aldehydes are readily obtained from alkenes by [[hydroformylation]].
*Oxidation of hydrocarbons using air. For simple alkanes, the method is nonselective but so inexpensive to be useful. Allylic and benzylic compounds undergo more selective oxidations. Alkyl groups on a benzene ring oxidized to the carboxylic acid, regardless of its chain length. [[Benzoic acid]] from [[toluene]] and [[terephthalic acid]] from para-[[xylene]], and [[phthalic acid]] from ortho-[[xylene]] are illustrative large-scale conversions. [[Acrylic acid]] is generated from propene.<ref>Riemenschneider, Wilhelm (2002) "Carboxylic Acids, Aliphatic" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a05_235}}.</ref>
*Base-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols.
*Carbonylation is versatile method when coupled to the addition of water. This method is effective for alkenes that generate secondary and tertiary [[carbocation]]s, e.g. [[isobutylene]] to [[pivalic acid]]. In the [[Koch reaction]], the addition of water and carbon monoxide to alkenes is catalyzed by strong acids. Acetic acid and formic acid are produced by the [[carbonylation]] of methanol, conducted with [[iodide]] and alkoxide promoters, respectively, and often with high pressures of carbon monoxide, usually involving additional hydrolytic steps. Hydrocarboxylations involve the simultaneous addition of water and CO. Such reactions are sometimes called "[[Walter Reppe|Reppe chemistry]]":
:HCCH + CO + H<sub>2</sub>O  → CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCO<sub>2</sub>H

*Some long-chain carboxylic acids are obtained by the hydrolysis of [[triglyceride]]s obtained from plant or animal oils; these methods are related to [[soap making]].
*[[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of ethanol is used in the production of [[vinegar]].

===Laboratory methods===
Preparative methods for small scale reactions for research or for production of fine chemicals often employ expensive consumable reagents.
*[[Oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids|oxidation of primary alcohols]] or [[aldehyde]]s with strong [[Oxidizing agent|oxidants]] such as [[potassium dichromate]], [[Jones reagent]], [[potassium permanganate]], or [[sodium chlorite]]. The method is amenable to laboratory conditions compared to the industrial use of air, which is "greener," since it yields less inorganic side products such as chromium or manganese oxides.
* Oxidative cleavage of [[olefin]]s by [[ozonolysis]], [[potassium permanganate]], or [[potassium dichromate]].
*Carboxylic acids can also be obtained by the hydrolysis of [[nitrile]]s, [[ester]]s, or [[amide]]s, in general with acid- or base-catalysis.
*Carbonation of a [[Grignard reagent|Grignard]] and [[organolithium]] reagents:
:RLi + CO<sub>2</sub> → RCO<sub>2</sub>Li
:RCO<sub>2</sub>Li + HCl →  RCO<sub>2</sub>H + LiCl
* [[Halogenation]] followed by hydrolysis of [[methyl ketone]]s in the [[haloform reaction]]
*The [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]] provides a route to [[salicylic acid]], precursor to [[aspirin]].

===Less-common reactions===
Many reactions afford carboxylic acids but are used only in specific cases or are mainly of academic interest:
* Disproportionation of an [[aldehyde]] in the [[Cannizzaro reaction]]
* Rearrangement of diketones in the [[benzilic acid rearrangement]] involving the generation of benzoic acids are the [[von Richter reaction]] from nitrobenzenes and the [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]] from [[phenol]]s.

==Reactions==

[[Image:Carboxylic Acid Sunshine Diagram1.svg|thumb|right|400px|Carboxylic acid [[organic reaction|organic reactions]]]]

The most widely practiced reactions convert carboxylic acids into esters, amides, carboxylate salts, acid chlorides, and alcohols. Carboxylic acids react with [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] to form carboxylate salts, in which the hydrogen of the hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced with a metal [[cation]]. Thus, acetic acid found in vinegar reacts with [[sodium bicarbonate]] (baking soda) to form sodium acetate, [[carbon dioxide]], and water:
:CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + NaHCO<sub>3</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O

Carboxylic acids also react with [[alcohol]]s to give [[ester]]s. This process is heavily used in the production of [[polyester]]s. Likewise, carboxylic acids are converted into [[amide]]s, but this conversion typically does not occur by direct reaction of the carboxylic acid and the amine. Instead esters are typical precursors to amides. The conversion of [[amino acid]]s into [[peptide]]s is a major biochemical process that requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

The hydroxyl group on carboxylic acids may be replaced with a chlorine atom using [[thionyl chloride]] to give [[acyl chloride]]s. In nature, carboxylic acids are converted to [[thioester]]s.

Carboxylic acid can be [[carboxylic acid reduction|reduced]] to the alcohol by [[hydrogenation]] or using stoichiometric hydride reducing agents such as [[lithium aluminium hydride]].

''N'',''N''-Dimethylchloromethylenammonium chloride is a highly chemoselective agent for carboxylic acid reduction. It selectively activate the carboxylic acid and is known to tolerate active functionalities such as ketone as well as the moderate ester, olefin, nitrile, and halide moeties.<ref>Fujisawa, Tamotsu and Sato, Toshio ''Organic Syntheses'', Coll. Vol. 8, p. 498 (1993); Vol. 66, p. 121 (1988)</ref>

{{anchor|Barbier-Wieland degradation}}

===Specialized reactions===
* As with all carbonyl compounds, the protons on the [[alpha-carbon|α-carbon]] are labile due to [[keto-enol tautomer]]ization. Thus, the α-carbon is easily halogenated in the [[Hell–Volhard–Zelinsky halogenation]].
* The [[Schmidt reaction]] converts carboxylic acids to [[amine]]s.
* Carboxylic acids are decarboxylated in the [[Hunsdiecker reaction]].
* The [[Dakin–West reaction]] converts an amino acid to the corresponding amino ketone.
* In the [[Barbier–Wieland degradation]], an carboxylic acid on an aliphatic chain having a simple the [[methylene bridge]] at the alpha position can have the chain shortened by one carbon. The inverse procedure is the [[Arndt–Eistert synthesis]], where an acid is converted into acyl halide, which is then reacted with [[diazomethane]] to give one additional methylene in the aliphatic chain.
* Many acids undergo [[oxidative decarboxylation]]. [[Enzyme]]s that catalyze these reactions are known as [[carboxylase]]s ([[Enzyme Commission number|EC]] 6.4.1) and [[decarboxylase]]s (EC 4.1.1).
* Carboxylic acids are reduced to [[aldehyde]]s via the [[ester]] and [[Diisobutylaluminium hydride|DIBAL]], via the acid chloride in the [[Rosenmund reduction]] and via the thioester in the [[Fukuyama reduction]].
* In [[ketonic decarboxylation]] carboxylic acids are converted to ketones.
* The [[Kolbe electrolysis]] is an electrolytic, decarboxylative dimerization reaction. In other words, it gets rid of the carboxyl groups of two acid molecules, and joins the remaining fragments together.
