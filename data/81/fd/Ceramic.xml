Their higher hardness means they are much less susceptible to wear and typically last for triple the lifetime of a steel part. They also deform less under load, meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from<space/><link><target>friction</target></link><space/>during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings, which are reduced by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would rust.

Two drawbacks to ceramic bearings are a significantly higher cost and susceptibility to damage under shock loads.</listitem></list><list type='bullet'><listitem>In the early 1980s,<space/><link><target>Toyota</target></link><space/>researched production of an<space/><link><target>adiabatic</target></link><space/><link><target>internal combustion engine</target><part>engine</part></link><space/>using ceramic components in the hot gas area. The ceramics would have allowed temperatures of over 3000&amp;nbsp;F (1650&amp;nbsp;C). The expected advantages would have been lighter materials and a smaller cooling system (or no need for one at all), leading to a major weight reduction. The expected increase of<space/><link><target>fuel efficiency</target></link><space/>of the engine (caused by the higher temperature, as shown by<space/><link><target>Carnot heat engine</target><part>Carnot's</part></link><space/>theorem) could not be verified experimentally; it was found that the heat transfer on the hot ceramic cylinder walls was higher than the transfer to a cooler metal wall as the cooler gas film on the metal surface works as a<space/><link><target>thermal insulator</target></link>. Thus, despite all of these desirable properties, such engines have not succeeded in production because of costs for the ceramic components and the limited advantages. (Small imperfections in the ceramic material with its low<space/><link><target>fracture toughness</target></link><space/>lead to cracks, which can lead to potentially dangerous equipment failure.)

Some elements, such as<space/><link><target>carbon</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>silicon</target></link>, may be considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, weak in<space/><link><target>shear stress</target><part>shearing</part></link><space/>and tension. They withstand chemical erosion that occurs in other materials subjected to acidic or caustic environments. Ceramics generally can withstand very high temperatures, such as temperatures that range from 1,000&amp;nbsp;C to 1,600&amp;nbsp;C (1,800&amp;nbsp;F to 3,000&amp;nbsp;F). A<space/><link><target>glass</target></link><space/>is often not understood as a ceramic because of its<space/><link><target>amorphous</target></link><space/>(noncrystalline) character. However, glassmaking involves several steps of the ceramic process and its mechanical properties are similar to ceramic materials.</paragraph><paragraph>Traditional ceramic raw materials include clay minerals such as<space/><link><target>kaolinite</target></link>, whereas more recent materials include aluminium oxide, more commonly known as<space/><link><target>alumina</target></link>. The modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced ceramics, include<space/><link><target>silicon carbide</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>tungsten carbide</target></link>. Both are valued for their abrasion resistance, and hence find use in applications such as the wear plates of crushing equipment in mining operations. Advanced ceramics are also used in the medicine, electrical and electronics industries.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Crystalline ceramics</heading><paragraph>Crystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing.

The glass is shaped when either fully molten, by casting, or when in a state of toffee-like viscosity, by methods such as blowing into a mold. If later heat treatments cause this glass to become partly crystalline, the resulting material is known as a glass-ceramic, widely used as cook-top and also as a glass composite material for nuclear waste disposal.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Ceramics in archaeology</heading><paragraph>Ceramic artifacts have an important role in archaeology for understanding the culture, technology and behavior of peoples of the past. They are among the most common artifacts to be found at an archaeological site, generally in the form of small fragments of broken pottery called<space/><link><target>sherd</target><trail>s</trail></link>. Processing of collected sherds can be consistent with two main types of analysis: technical and traditional.</paragraph><paragraph>Traditional analysis involves sorting ceramic artifacts, sherds and larger fragments into specific types based on style, composition, manufacturing and morphology. By creating these typologies it is possible to distinguish between different cultural styles, the purpose of the ceramic and technological state of the people among other conclusions. In addition, by looking at stylistic changes of ceramics over time is it possible to separate (seriate) the ceramics into distinct diagnostic groups (assemblages). A comparison of ceramic artifacts with known dated assemblages allows for a chronological assignment of these pieces.<extension extension_name='ref'>Mississippi Valley Archaeological Center,<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/processarch/processarch/lab_ceramic.html'>Ceramic Analysis</link>, Retrieved 04-11-12</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The technical approach to ceramic analysis involves a finer examination of the composition of ceramic artifacts and sherds to determine the source of the material and through this the possible manufacturing site. Key criteria are the composition of the clay and the temper used in the manufacture of the article under study: temper is a material added to the clay during the initial production stage, and it is used to aid the subsequent drying process. Types of temper include shell pieces, granite fragments and ground sherd pieces called 'grog'. Temper is usually identified by microscopic examination of the temper material. Clay identification is determined by a process of refiring the ceramic, and assigning a color to it using Munsell Soil Color notation. By estimating both the clay and temper compositions, and locating a region where both are known to occur, an assignment of the material source can be made. From the source assignment of the artifact further investigations can be made into the site of manufacture.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Ceramic chemistry</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Ceramic materials</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Ceramic engineering</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Ceramic matrix composite</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Ceramic art</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>reflist</target><arg>30em</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Further reading</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="title">Oriental trade ceramics in South-East Asia, ninth to sixteenth centuries: with a catalogue of Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai wares in Australian collections</arg><arg name="first">John</arg><arg name="last">Guy</arg><arg name="editor-first">John</arg><arg name="editor-last">Guy</arg><arg name="volume"></arg><arg name="edition">illustrated, revised</arg><arg name="year">1986</arg><arg name="publisher">Oxford University Press</arg><arg name="url">http://books.google.com/books?id</arg><arg name="isbn"></arg><arg name="accessdate">24 April 2014</arg><arg name="ref">harv<space/></arg></template></listitem></list><heading level='2'>External links</heading><paragraph><template><target>Commons category</target><arg>Ceramics</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://donsmaps.com/dolnivenus.html'>Dolni Vestonice Venus</link>- Oldest known Ceramic statuette of a nude female figure dated to 29 000 25 000 BP (Gravettian industry.
