'''The Beach Boys''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Hawthorne, California]] in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], and [[Carl Wilson]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and their friend [[Al Jardine]]. Emerging at the vanguard of the "[[California Sound]]", the band's early music gained international popularity for distinct [[vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]] and lyrics that evoked a [[southern California]] [[youth culture]] of [[surfing]], cars, and romance. Influenced by [[jazz]]-based [[vocal music|vocal group]]s, 1950s [[rock and roll]], and [[doo-wop]], Brian led the band to experiment with several [[musical genre|genres]] ranging from [[pop ballad]]s to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[baroque pop|baroque]], while devising novel approaches to [[record producer|music production]] and [[arrangement|arranging]]. While initially managed by the Wilsons' father [[Murry Wilson|Murry]], [[Musicianship of Brian Wilson|Brian's creative ambitions and sophisticated songwriting abilities]] dominated the group's musical direction.

Released in 1966, the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and the "[[Good Vibrations]]" single featured an intricate and multi-layered sound that represented a departure from the simple [[surf rock]] of the Beach Boys' early years. Soon after the dissolution of ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', Brian gradually ceded control to the rest of the band, reducing his input because of [[mental health]] and [[substance abuse]] issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various musical styles that garnered international critical success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, songwriting credits and use of the band's name transpired.

Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and [[Bruce Johnston]] continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects. For the band's 50th anniversary, the surviving co-founders briefly reunited for a [[That's Why God Made the Radio|new studio album]] and [[The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|world tour]].

At the time of his sixteenth birthday on June 20, 1958, Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers, Dennis and Carl – aged thirteen and eleven, respectively – in their family home in Hawthorne. He had watched his father, [[Murry Wilson]], play piano, and had listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups such as [[the Four Freshmen]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 3}} 3]}} After dissecting songs such as "[[Ivory Tower (1956 song)|Ivory Tower]]" and "[[Good News (musical)|Good News]]", Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmonies.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 12}} 12]}} For his birthday that year, Brian received a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]]. He learned how to [[overdub]], using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 3}} 3]}} Brian played piano with Carl and [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]], an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor, playing guitars they had each received as Christmas presents.{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=bnQIAQAAMAAJ|page= 18}} 18]}}

Soon Brian and Carl were avidly listening to [[Johnny Otis]]' [[KFOX (AM)|KFOX radio]] show.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 3}} 3]}} Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the [[rhythm and blues]] songs he heard, Brian changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} His enthusiasm interfered with his music studies at school. Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin [[Mike Love]]. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 3}} 3]}} Later, Brian, Mike Love and two friends performed at [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 5}} 5]}} Brian also knew Al Jardine, a high school classmate who had already played guitar in a folk group called the Islanders.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. At these sessions, held in Brian's bedroom, "the Beach Boys sound" began to form. Love encouraged Brian{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} to write songs, and gave the fledgling band its name: "The Pendletones",{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 21}} 21]}} a portmanteau of "[[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]]", a style of woolen shirt popular at the time and "[[Musical tone|tone]]", the musical term. Though [[surfing]] motifs were prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group.<ref name=pc20/> He suggested that the group compose songs that celebrated the sport and the lifestyle that had developed around it within [[Southern California]].<ref name=RockHallofFame/>{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}}{{refn|group=nb|[[Nick Venet]] has said that none of the members, including Dennis, surfed until after the fact.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=w7oB2UKVxgQC|page= 60}} 60]}} }}

[[File:Beach Boys 1963.jpg|thumb|175px|The Beach Boys, in [[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]] outfits, performing at a local high school]]
Jardine and a singer friend, Gary Winfrey, went to Brian to see if he could help out with a version of a folk song they wanted to record—"[[Sloop John B]]".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In Brian's absence, the two spoke with their father, a music industry veteran of modest success. Murry arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher, Hite Morgan.<ref name=RockHallofFame /> The group performed a slower ballad, "[[Their Hearts Were Full of Spring]]", but failed to impress Morgan. After an awkward pause, Dennis mentioned they had an original song, "[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Brian finished the song, and together with Mike Love, wrote "[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]".{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}} The group rented guitars, drums, amplifiers and microphones, and practiced for three days while the Wilsons' parents were on a short vacation.

In October 1961, the Pendletones recorded the two surfing song demos in twelve takes at Keen Recording Studio.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}}{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}{{refn|group=nb|David Marks was not present at the session as he was in school that day.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-q-a-original-beach-boy-david-marks-on-the-bands-anniversary-tour-20120316 |title=Exclusive QA: Original Beach Boy David Marks on the Band's Anniversary Tour &#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=March 16, 2012 |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}</ref>}} Murry brought the demos to Herb Newman, owner of [[Candix Records]] and [[Era Records]], and he signed the group on December 8, 1961.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}} When the boys eagerly unpacked the first box of singles – released both under the Candix label, and also as a promo issue under X Records (Morgan's label) – they were shocked to see their band had been renamed as the Beach Boys.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Murry Wilson called Morgan{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and learned that Candix wanted to name the group the Surfers to directly associate them with the increasingly popular teen sport. But [[Russ Regan]], a young promoter with Era Records – who later became president of [[20th Century Fox Records]] – noted that there already existed a group by that name, and he suggested calling them the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}}

Released in December 1961, "[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]" soon aired on [[KFWB]] and [[KRLA]], two of Los Angeles' most influential teen radio stations. It was a hit on the West Coast, going to number three in Southern California, and peaked at number 75 on the national pop charts. By the final weeks of 1961 "Surfin'" had sold more than 40,000 copies.<ref name="photobucket13">[http://i351.photobucket.com/albums/q476/marcus1970/hit%20parader%201966/HitParaderp6October1966.jpg "The Beach Boy Empire" Taylor, Derek.

Hit Parader, p13]</ref> By this time, the [[de facto]] manager of the Beach Boys, Murry Wilson landed the group's first paying gig (for which they earned $300) on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the [[Ritchie Valens]] Memorial Dance in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]],{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}} headlined by [[Ike & Tina Turner]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In their earliest public appearances, the band wore heavy wool jacket-like shirts that local surfers favored {{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=FC0_AwAAQBAJ|page= 19}} 19]}} before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=sLEMdjRhDgQC|page= 187}} 187]}}{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=106}} 106]}}

Though Murry effectively seized managerial control of the band, Brian acknowledged that he "...deserves credit for getting us off the ground... he hounded us mercilessly... [but] also worked hard himself." In the first half of February 1962, Jardine left the band and was replaced by Marks. The band recorded two more originals on April 19 at Western Studios, Los Angeles: "Lonely Sea" and "[[409 (song)|409]]". They also re-recorded "[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]". On June 4, the band released their second single "Surfin' Safari" backed with "409". The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]''. The magazine praised Love's lead vocal and said the song had strong hit potential.<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 9, 1962 |title=Reviews of New Singles |journal=Billboard Magazine |volume= 74 |issue= 23 |page=40 |publisher= Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |doi= |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ|page=4}} |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref> On July 16, 1962—after being turned down by [[Dot Records|Dot]] and [[Liberty Records|Liberty]]—the Beach Boys signed a seven-year contract with [[Capitol Records]], based on the strength of the June demo session.<ref name="photobucket13"/> This was at the urging of Capitol exec [[Nik Venet]] who signed the group, seeing them as the "teenage gold" he had been scouting for.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=w7oB2UKVxgQC|page= 62}} 62]}} By November, their first album was ready—''Surfin' Safari'', which reached 32 on the US Billboard charts. Their song output continued along the same commercial line, focusing on California youth lifestyle.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 71}} 71]}}<ref name=pc20>{{Gilliland |url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19770/m1/ |title=Show 20 – Forty Miles of Bad Road: Some of the best from rock 'n' roll's dark ages.

In January 1963, three months after the release of their debut album, the band began recording their sophomore effort, ''Surfin' U.S.A.'', a breakthrough for Brian, who began asserting himself as songwriter and arranger.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 71}} 71]}} The LP was the start of Brian's penchant for [[doubletracking]] vocals,{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=HDrIjd5FQ8QC|page= 126}} 126]}} a pioneering innovation.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=56}} Released on March 25, 1963, ''Surfin' U.S.A.'', met a more enthusiastic reception, reaching number two on the Billboard charts.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This propelled the band into a nationwide spotlight, and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 71}} 71]}} Five days prior to the release of ''Surfin' U.S.A.'', Brian produced "[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]]", a song he had written for [[Jan and Dean]]. "Surf City" hit number one on the ''Billboard'' charts in July 1963, a development that pleased Brian but angered Murry, who felt his son had "given away" what should have been the Beach Boys' first chart-topper.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=103–104}}

At the beginning of a tour of the Mid-West in April 1963, Jardine rejoined the Beach Boys at Brian's request.<ref name="The Beach Boys">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeachboys.com/home.aspx |title=The Beach Boys |publisher=The Beach Boys |accessdate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100327211659/http://thebeachboys.com:80/home.aspx |archivedate=27 March 2010 }}</ref> As he began playing live gigs again, Brian left the road to focus on writing and recording. The result of this arrangement produced the albums ''Surfer Girl'', released on September 16, 1963 and ''Little Deuce Coupe'', released less than a month later on October 7, 1963. This sextet incarnation of the Beach Boys did not extend beyond these two albums, as Marks officially left the band in early October because of conflict with manager Murry, pulling Brian back into touring.<ref>{{cite web |title=GIGS63 |first=Andrew G. |last=Doe |authorlink= |year=2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs63.html}}</ref>

Around this time, Brian began using members of [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]] to augment his increasingly demanding studio arrangements.{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=HDrIjd5FQ8QC|page= 127}} 127]}} Session musicians that participated on Wilson's productions were said to have been awestruck by his musical abilities, as drummer [[Hal Blaine]] explained, "We all studied in conservatories; we were trained musicians. We thought it was a fluke at first, but then we realized Brian was writing these incredible songs. This was not just a young kid writing about high school and surfing."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=46}} For composer [[Frank Zappa]], the most exciting thing to him in "white-person-music" was when the Beach Boys used the progression V–II on "[[Little Deuce Coupe (song)|Little Deuce Coupe]]", calling it "an important step forward by going backward."{{sfn|Zappa|1989|p=187}} The band released a standalone Christmas-themed single, "[[Little Saint Nick]]", in December 1963, backed with an [[a capella]] rendition of the [[Lord's Prayer|scriptural]] song "[[The Lord's Prayer (1935 song)|The Lord's Prayer]]". The A-side peaked at number 3 on the US ''Billboard'' Christmas chart.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=45}}

Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the band returned home to face the [[British Invasion]] through the Beatles appearances on the [[Ed Sullivan Show]]. Also representing the Beatles, Capitol support for the Beach Boys immediately began waning. This caused Murry to fight for the band at the label more than before, often visiting their offices without warning to "twist executive arms."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 50}} 50]}} Brian reacted to the Beatles with pronounced bemusement: "I was flipping out. I couldn't understand how a group could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, '[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but they just screamed at it. ... It got us off our asses in the studio. We started cutting – we said 'look, don't worry about the Beatles, we'll cut our own stuff."<ref>{{cite AV media|people=[[David Espar|Espar, David]], [[Robert Levi|Levi, Robert]] (Directors)|year=1995|title=Rock & Roll|medium=[[Miniseries]]|url=|ref=harv}}</ref> Reportedly,{{by whom|date=December 2014}} Brian wanted more time to complete their next album, yet Capitol insisted they finish recording swiftly to avoid being forgotten in the throes of the impending invasion.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Satisfying these demands, the band hastily finished the sessions on February 20, 1964 and titled the album ''Shut Down Volume 2''. "[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]" was released as a single from the album (backed with "[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (song)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]") and was a major hit. The LP, while containing several [[filler (media)|filler tracks]], was propelled by other songs such as the melancholic "[[The Warmth of the Sun]]" and the advanced production style of "[[Don't Worry Baby]]".{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|pp=71}}

Brian soon wrote his last surf song in April 1964.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 51}} 51]}} That month, during recording of the single "[[I Get Around]]", Murry was relieved of his duties as manager. Brian reflected, "We love the family thing – y'know: three brothers, a cousin and a friend is a really beautiful way to have a group – but the extra generation can become a hang-up."<ref name="photobucket13"/> When the single was released in May of that year, it would climb to number one, their first single to do so. Two months later, the album that the song later appeared on, ''All Summer Long'', reached number four on the Billboard 200 charts. ''All Summer Long'' introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys' sound exemplified by the [[piccolo]]s and [[xylophone]]s of [[All Summer Long (The Beach Boys song)|its title track]].{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=110}} 110]}} The album was a swan-song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon. Later albums took a different stylistic and lyrical path.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|pp=72–73}} Before this, a live album, ''[[Beach Boys Concert]]'', was released in October to a four-week chart stay at number one, containing a setlist of previously recorded hits and [[cover version|covers]] that they hadn't yet recorded.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 72}} 72]}}

In June 1964, Brian began recording the bulk of ''The Beach Boys' Christmas Album'' with a forty-one-piece studio orchestra in collaboration with [[The Four Freshmen|Four Freshmen]] arranger Dick Reynolds. Released in December, it was divided between five new, original Christmas-themed songs, and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=59–60}} One single from the album, "[[The Man with All the Toys]]", was released, peaking at number 6 on the US ''Billboard'' Christmas chart.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=75}} On October 29, the Beach Boys performed for ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]'', a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of hit-making musicians for a one-off performance. The result was released to movie theaters one month later.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=30–31}}

By the end of the year, the stress of road travel, composing, producing and maintaining a high level of creativity became too much for Brian. On December 23, while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, he suffered a [[panic attack]] only hours after performing with the Beach Boys on the [[variety show|musical variety series]] ''[[Shindig!]]''.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=63–64}} In January 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the rest of 1964 and into 1965, [[Glen Campbell]] served as Wilson's temporary replacement in concert, until his own career success pulled him from the group in April 1965.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1543|label=Glen Campbell|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref> Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965, first replacing Brian on the road and later contributing in the studio, beginning with the vocal sessions for "[[California Girls]]" on June 4, 1965.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p18553|label=Bruce Johnston|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs65.html |title=GIGS65 |publisher=Esquarterly.com |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}</ref>

After Brian stopped touring in 1965, he became a full-time studio artist, showcasing a great leap forward with ''The Beach Boys Today!'', an album containing a suite-like structure divided by songs and [[ballad]]s, and portended the [[Album Era]] with its cohesive artistic statement.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=111}} 111]}} During the recording sessions for ''Today!'', Love told [[Melody Maker]] that he and the band wanted to look beyond [[surf rock]] and to avoid living in the past or resting on their laurels.<ref name=Welch1964>{{cite journal|last1=Welch|first1=C|title=Beach Boys Brought their own vegetables - so audiences beware!|journal=Melody Maker|date=November 14, 1964|page=18}}</ref> The resulting LP had largely guitar-oriented pop songs such as "[[Dance, Dance, Dance (song)|Dance, Dance, Dance]]" and "[[Good to My Baby]]" on side A with B-side ballads such as "[[Please Let Me Wonder]]" and "[[She Knows Me Too Well]]".{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 72}} 72]}}<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.allmusic.com/song/dance-dance-dance-t14595755| title =Dance, Dance, Dance| publisher = Allmusic}}</ref>

''Today!'' marked a maturation in the Beach Boys' lyric content by abandoning themes related to surfing, cars, or teenage love. Some love songs remained, but with a marked increase in depth, along with introspective tracks accompanied by adventurous and distinct arrangements.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=111}} 111]}}{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=58}} While the band's contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, Capitol continued to bill them as "America’s Top Surfin' Group!" expecting Brian to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets despite his disinterest.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 62}} 62]}}

In June 1965, the band released ''Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)''. The album included a reworked arrangement of "[[Help Me, Rhonda]]" which became the band's second number one single in the spring of 1965, displacing the Beatles' "[[Ticket to Ride]]". "[[Let Him Run Wild]]" tapped into the youthful angst that later pervaded their music.{{according to|date=August 2014}} In November 1965, the group followed their US number-three-charting "California Girls" from ''Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)'' with another top-twenty single, "[[The Little Girl I Once Knew]]". It was considered the band's most experimental statement thus far,{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 72}} 72]}} using silence as a pre-chorus, clashing keyboards, moody brass and vocal tics.{{according to|date=August 2014}} The single continued Brian's ambitions for daring arrangements, featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=59}} Perhaps too extreme an arrangement{{according to|date=August 2014}}  to go much higher than its number 20 peak, it was the band's second single not to reach the top ten since their 1962 breakthrough.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Capitol demanded a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, and to appease them, Brian conceived ''Beach Boys' Party!'', a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]", and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group's earlier hits.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 71}} 71]}} In December they scored an unexpected number two hit (number three in the UK) with "[[Barbara Ann]]", which Capitol released as a single with no band input.

''Pet Sounds'' is considered by some as a Brian Wilson solo album in all but name, as other members contributed relatively little to the compositions or recordings.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=w7oB2UKVxgQC|page= 106}} 106]}}{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 72}} 72]}}{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=41}} Influenced by [[psychedelic drug]]s, Brian turned inward and probed his deep-seated self-doubts and emotional longings; the piece did not address the problems in the world around them, unlike other [[psychedelic rock]] groups.{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|pp=34–35}} As [[Jim Miller (musician)|Jim Miller]] wrote of the album's tone, "[It] vented Wilson's obsession with isolation cataloging a forlorn quest for security.

|description="[[Good Vibrations]]" was the Beach Boys' third song to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Seeking to expand on ''Pet Sounds''' advances, Wilson began an even more ambitious project: "[[Good Vibrations]]". Like ''Pet Sounds'', Brian opted for an eclectic array of instruments rarely heard in pop music.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=116}} 116]}} Described by Brian as a "pocket symphony",{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=638}} it contains a mixture of classical, rock, and exotic instruments structured around a [[cut-up technique|cut-up mosaic]] of musical sections represented by several discordant key and modal shifts.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=41-46}} It became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date,{{when|date=June 2015}} and a US and UK number one single in 1966. Coming at a time when pop singles were usually made in under two hours, it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken, and the most expensive single ever recorded to that point.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=116}} 116]}}{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 55}} 55]}}{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=41–46}} The production costs were estimated between $50,000 and $75,000  (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1966|r=-4}}}} and ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|75000|1966|r=-4}}}} today) with sessions for the song stretching over several months in at least four major studios.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=41–46}} According to [[Domenic Priore]], the making of "Good Vibrations" was unlike anything previous in the realms of classical, jazz, international, soundtrack, or any other kind of recording.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p={{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 55}} 55]}}

The group established a short-lived film [[production company]], called Home Movies, during this time. It was supposed to have created live action film and television properties starring the Beach Boys.

Parks has stated: he and Brian were conscious of the counterculture, and the two had felt estranged from it, but it was necessary to adhere to because of a willingness to "get out of the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] mindset."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 39}} 39]}} Parks stresses, "At the same time, he didn't want to lose that kind of gauche sensibility that he had. He was doing stuff that nobody would dream of doing," citing an instance when Brian instructed a banjo player to play only one string, a "gauche" style of playing that "just wasn't done."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 39}} 39]}}

It was a collaboration that led to some incredible music, which, if it had been completed as an album and delivered to the public in 1966, might have had an incredible impact."{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=FC0_AwAAQBAJ|page= 112}} 112]}}

Many factors combined to put intense pressure on Brian Wilson as ''Smile'' neared completion: his mental instability, the pressure to create despite fierce internal opposition to his new music, the relatively unenthusiastic response to ''Pet Sounds'' in the United States, Carl Wilson's [[military draft|draft]] resistance, and a major dispute with [[Capitol Records]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Furthermore, Wilson's reliance on both prescription drugs and [[amphetamine]]s exacerbated his underlying mental health problems. Comparable to [[Brian Jones]] and [[Syd Barrett]], Brian Wilson's use of psychedelic drugs—especially [[LSD]]—led to a nervous breakdown in the late-1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} As his legend grew, the ''Smile'' period came to be seen as the pivotal episode in his decline, and he became tagged as one of the most notorious celebrity drug casualties of the rock era.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 72}} 72]}}{{failed verification|date=August 2014}}

Compounding the group's recent setbacks, their public image took a cataclysmic hit following their withdrawal from the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]]{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=130}} for the reason that they had no new material to play while their forthcoming single and album lay in limbo.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 122}} 122]}} Their cancellation was seen as "...a damning admission that they were washed up [and] unable to compete with the new music."{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=179}} This notion was exacerbated by ''Rolling Stone'' writer [[Jann Wenner]], who in contemporary publications criticized Brian Wilson for his oft-repeated "genius" label, which he called a "promotional shuck" and an attempt to compare him with the Beatles.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=179}} However, Wenner later responded to their ''Wild Honey'' album with more optimism, remarking two months later that "[i]n any case it's good to see that the Beach Boys are getting their heads straight once again".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/wild-honey-19680224|accessdate=June 22, 2013|title=Wild Honey|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|location=New York|date=February 24, 1968}}</ref>

While being interviewed in August 1967 for the failed live album ''[[Lei'd in Hawaii]]'', Brian admitted: "I think rock n' roll–the pop scene–is happening. It’s great.

In support of the ''Friends'' album, Love had arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the US, which has been called "one of the more bizarre entertainments of the era."{{sfn|Frontani|2009|p=198}} Starting on May 3, 1968, the tour lasted five shows and was cancelled when the Maharishi had to withdraw to fulfill film contracts. Because of disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi's withdrawal, twenty-four tour dates were subsequently cancelled at a cost estimated at US$250,000 (approximately US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250000|1969|r=-4}}}} today) for the band.<ref name="Doe 2012"/>{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=196}} This tour was followed by the release of "[[Do It Again (The Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]", a single that critics described as an update of the Beach Boys' surf rock past in a late 1960s style.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.allmusic.com/song/do-it-again-t995511|title =Do It Again | publisher=Allmusic| accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> The single went to the top of the Australian and UK single charts in 1968 and was moderately successful in the US, peaking at number 20.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 330}} 330]}}

For a short time in mid-1968, Brian Wilson sought psychological treatment in hospital.{{sfn|Carlin|2006}} During his absence, other members began writing and producing material themselves. To complete their contract with Capitol, they produced one more album. ''20/20'' (1969) was one of the group's most stylistically diverse albums, including [[hard rock]] songs such as "[[All I Want to Do (The Beach Boys song)|All I Want to Do]]", the [[waltz]]-based "[[Time to Get Alone]]", and a cover of [[the Ronettes]]' "[[I Can Hear Music]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/bluebirds-over-the-mountain-t995513|title =Bluebirds over the Mountain | publisher=Allmusic| accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/risque/tattled/alliwant.asp|title =All I Want to Do| publisher=Barbra and David P.

In the US, the album reached a modest 68.

In spring 1968, Dennis began a strained [[Charles Manson#Involvement with Wilson, Melcher, et al.|relationship with musician]] [[Charles Manson]], which persisted for several months afterward. Dennis bought him time at Brian's home studio where recording sessions were attempted while Brian stayed in his room.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|pp=168–70, 340}} Dennis then proposed that Manson be signed to Brother Records. Brian reportedly disliked Charlie, and so a deal was never made.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=168}} Without Manson's involvement, the Beach Boys did record one song penned by Manson: "Cease to Exist", rewritten as "[[Never Learn Not To Love]]". The idea of the Beach Boys recording one of his songs reportedly thrilled Manson, and it was released as a Beach Boys single. After accruing a large monetary debt to the group, Dennis deliberately omitted Manson's credit on its release while also altering the song's arrangement and lyrics.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=186}} This greatly angered Manson.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=137–48}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=221–23}} Growing fearful, Dennis gradually distanced himself from Manson, [[Manson family|whose family]] had taken over his home.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=224}} He was eventually convicted for [[Conspiracy (criminal)|murder conspiracy]]; from there on, Dennis was too afraid of the Manson family to ever speak publicly on his relationship, let alone testify against him.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|pp=322–23}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=257}}

On April 12, 1969, the band revisited their 1967 lawsuit against Capitol Records after they alleged an audit undertaken revealed the band were owed over US$2,000,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1969|r=-4}}}} today) for unpaid royalties and production duties.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=221}} The band's contract with Capitol Records expired on June 30, 1969, after which Capitol Records deleted the Beach Boys' catalog from print, effectively cutting off their royalty flow.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=221}}<ref>{{cite web |title=BBTIMELINE 1969|first=Andrew G. |last=Doe |authorlink=|year=2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2013 |url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/1969.html}}</ref> In November 1969, Murry Wilson sold [[Sea of Tunes]], the Beach Boys' catalog, to Irving Almo Music, a decision that, according to [[Marilyn Wilson]], devastated Brian.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=224–5}} In late 1969, the Beach Boys reactivated their Brother label and signed with [[Reprise Records|Reprise]].

In 1970, armed with the new Reprise contract, the band appeared rejuvenated, releasing the album ''Sunflower'' to critical acclaim in the UK but indifference in the US.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 73}} 73]}} The album features a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 73}} 73]}} Brian was active during this period, writing or co-writing seven of the twelve songs on ''Sunflower'' and performing at half of the band's domestic concerts in 1970. ''Sunflower'' reached number 29 in the UK and number 151 in the US, the band's lowest domestic chart showing to that point.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=153–154}} A version of "[[Cottonfields]]" arranged by Al Jardine appeared on European releases of ''Sunflower'' and as a single, reached number one in Australia, Norway, South Africa and Sweden and the top-five in six other countries, including the UK.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

After ''Sunflower'', the band hired [[Jack Rieley]] as their manager. Under Rieley's management, the group's music began emphasizing political and social awareness.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 155}} 155]}} During this time, Carl Wilson gradually assumed leadership of the band and Rieley contributed lyrics. On August 30, 1971 the band released ''Surf's Up'', named after the Brian Wilson/Van Dyke Parks composition "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]". The album was moderately successful, reaching the US top 30, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at [[Carnegie Hall]], followed by an appearance with the [[Grateful Dead]] at [[Fillmore East]] on April 27, 1971. The live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of the band's previous songs.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=155–8}} A large portion of their [[set list]]s culled from ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile'', as author Domenic Priore observes, "They basically played what they could have played at the Monterey Pop Festival in the summer of 1967."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 140}} 140]}}

Johnston ended his first stint with the band shortly after ''Surf's Up'''s release, reportedly{{by whom|date=May 2014}} because of friction with Rieley. At Carl's suggestion, the addition of [[Ricky Fataar]] and [[Blondie Chaplin]] in February 1972 led to a dramatic restructuring in the band's sound. The album ''Carl and the Passions – "So Tough"'' was an uncharacteristic mix{{according to whom|date=January 2015}} that included two songs written by Fataar and Chaplin.

For their next project the band, their families, assorted associates and technicians moved to the Netherlands for the summer of 1972. They rented a farmhouse to convert into a makeshift studio where recording sessions for the new project would take place. By the end of their sessions, the band felt they had produced one of their strongest efforts yet.{{according to|date=May 2014}} Reprise, however, felt that the album required a strong single. This resulted in the song "[[Sail On, Sailor]]", a collaboration between Brian Wilson, [[Tandyn Almer]], [[Raymond Louis Kennedy|Ray Kennedy]], Jack Rieley and Van Dyke Parks featuring a soulful lead vocal by Chaplin.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=184, 305}} Reprise subsequently approved and the resulting album, ''[[Holland (album)|Holland]]'', was released early in 1973, peaking at number 37. Brian's musical children story, ''Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale)'', narrated by Rieley and strongly influenced by [[Randy Newman]]'s ''[[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|Sail Away]]'' (1972), was included as a bonus [[extended play|EP]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=181–2}} Despite indifference from Reprise, the band's concert audience started to grow.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

''[[The Beach Boys in Concert]]'', a double album documenting the 1972 and 1973 US tours, was another top-30 album and became the band's first [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] under Reprise. During this period the band established itself as one of America's most popular live acts. Chaplin and Fataar helped organize the concerts to obtain a high quality live performance, playing material off ''Surf's Up'', ''Carl and the Passions'' and ''Holland'' and adding songs from their older catalog. This concert arrangement lifted them back into American public prominence. In late 1973, [[41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti|the 41-song soundtrack]] to ''[[American Graffiti]]'' was released including the band's early songs "Surfin' Safari" and "All Summer Long". The album was a catalyst in creating a wave of nostalgia that reintroduced the Beach Boys into contemporary American consciousness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-10-greatest-summer-songs-20130522/6-the-beach-boys-all-summer-long-0368776 |title=Readers' Poll: The 10 Greatest Summer Songs Pictures - 6.

The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=364}} During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=358}} Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted, "[Undoubtedly] the new album is nothing too deep", but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's "Good Vibrations".{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=364}}

For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album ''Love You'' (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian.

After ''Love You'' was released, Brian began to record and assemble ''Adult/Child'', an unreleased effort largely consisting of songs written by Wilson from 1976 and 1977 with select [[big band]] arrangements by Dick Reynolds.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 222}} 222]}} Though publicized as the Beach Boys' next release, ''Adult/Child'' caused tension within the group and was ultimately shelved.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 222}} 222]}} Following this period, his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and their performances were occasionally erratic.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 226}} 226]}}

The internal wrangling came to a head after a show at [[Central Park]] on September 1, 1977, when the band effectively split into two camps; Dennis and Carl Wilson on one side, Mike Love and Al Jardine on the other with Brian remaining neutral.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=216–217}} Following a confrontation on an airport tarmac, Dennis declared to ''Rolling Stone'' on September 3 that he had left the band: "It was Al Jardine who really knifed me in the heart when he said they didn't need me. That was the clincher. And all I told him was that he couldn't play more than four chords. They kept telling me I had my solo album now [''[[Pacific Ocean Blue]]''], like I should go off in a corner and leave the Beach Boys to them. The album really bothers them.

The band broke up for two and a half weeks, until a meeting on September 17 at Brian's house. In light of a potential new Caribou Records contract the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Love gaining control of Brian's vote in the group, allowing Love and Jardine to outvote Carl and Dennis Wilson on any matter.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBTIMELINE |first=Andrew G. |last=Doe |authorlink=|year=2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/1977.html}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Love denied that the group had ever broken up, explaining that, "It was just the end of the tour, Dennis had a lot on his mind, Carl had a lot on his mind.

===Intergroup struggles===
{{Main|M.I.U. Album|L.A. (Light Album)|Keepin' the Summer Alive}}
The Beach Boys' last album for Reprise, ''M.I.U. Album'' (1978), was recorded at [[Maharishi International University]] in Iowa at the suggestion of Love.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 224}} 224]}} Dennis and Carl made limited contributions; the album was mostly produced by Jardine and Ron Altbach, with Brian credited as "executive producer".{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 225}} 225]}} ''M.I.U.'' was largely a contractual obligation to finish out their association with Reprise, who likewise did not promote the result.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 224}} 224]}} The record cemented the divisions in the group. Love and Jardine focused on rock and roll-oriented material while Carl and Dennis chose the progressive focus they had established with the albums ''Carl and the Passions'' and ''Holland''.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Dennis withdrew from the group to focus on his second solo album entitled ''[[Dennis Wilson#Bambu|Bambu]]''. The album was shelved just as alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=124}} 124]}} Carl appeared intoxicated during concerts (especially at appearances for their 1978 Australia tour) and Brian gradually slid back into addiction and an unhealthy lifestyle.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=226–7}}

After departing Reprise, the Beach Boys signed with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]]. They received a substantial advance and were paid $1 million per album even as CBS deemed their preliminary review of the band's first product, ''L.A. (Light Album)'' as unsatisfactory. Faced with the realization that Brian was unable to contribute, the band recruited Johnston as producer. The result paid off, as "[[Good Timin' (The Beach Boys song)|Good Timin']]" became a top 40 single. The group enjoyed moderate success with a disco reworking of the ''Wild Honey'' song "[[Here Comes the Night]]", followed by their highest charting UK single in nine years: Jardine's "[[Lady Lynda]]" peaked at number 6 in the UK Singles Chart.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The album was followed in 1980 by ''Keepin' the Summer Alive'', with Johnston once again producing. Barring an appearance on percussion on the closing track, "Endless Harmony", Dennis was absent from this album.

In 1981, Carl quit the group because of unhappiness with the band's nostalgia format and lackluster live performances, subsequently pursuing a solo career.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=124}} 124]}} He returned in May 1982 – after approximately 14 months of being away—on the condition that the group reconsider their rehearsal and touring policies and refrain from "[[Las Vegas]]-type" engagements.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=373}}

===Deaths of Dennis and Carl===
{{Main|The Beach Boys (album)|Still Cruisin'|Kokomo (song)|Summer in Paradise|Andy Paley sessions|Stars and Stripes Vol. 1}}
Founding drummer Dennis Wilson's alcoholism continued to escalate, and on December 28, 1983, he drowned in [[Marina del Rey]] while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 247}} 247]}} Despite his death, the Beach Boys continued as a successful touring act.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 248}} 248]}}

On July 4, 1985, the Beach Boys played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington. They also appeared nine days later at the [[Live Aid]] concert. That year, they released the eponymous album ''The Beach Boys'' and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as [[David Lee Roth]]'s hit version of "California Girls".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} "[[Getcha Back]]", released from the album, gave the group a number 26 single in the US. Following this, the group put out "[[Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue]]" (US, number 68) and a cover of [[the Mamas & the Papas]]' "[[California Dreamin']]" (US, number 57).{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 330}} 330]}} {{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 330}} 330]}} In 1987, they played with the [[Hip hop music|rap]] group [[The Fat Boys]], performing the song "[[Wipe Out (song)|Wipe Out]]" and filming a [[music video]]. It was a number 12 single in the US.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 330}} 330]}} and a number two rank in the UK.<ref>"Beach Boys." Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. February 23, 2015.</ref>

By 1988, Brian had drifted from the Beach Boys and released his first solo album, ''[[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson]]'', which received critical acclaim.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} During this period the band unexpectedly claimed their first US number one hit single in 22 years with "[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]", which had appeared in the movie ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'', and soon became the band's largest selling single of all time.<ref>"Beach Boys." Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. February 20, 2015.</ref> Inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] earlier in the year, the group became the second artist after [[Aretha Franklin]] to hit number one in the US after their induction.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} They released the album ''Still Cruisin''', which went gold in the US and gave them their best chart showing since 1976.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]''. The album ''[[Summer in Paradise]]'', having no new contributions from Brian because of interference from caretaker [[Eugene Landy]], was released two years later to a poor critical reception, and was a commercial disaster.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

A lawsuit was filed by Brian in 1989 to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, [[Sea of Tunes]], which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded $25&nbsp;million for unpaid royalties.<ref>[http://www.beachboys.com/history.html "The Beach Boys – The complete Guide"], ''beachboys.com''</ref> Soon after Wilson won his case, Love discovered that Murry Wilson had not properly credited him as co-writer on 79 Beach Boys songs.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, [[Love v. Wilson|Love sued Brian in 1992]], winning $13&nbsp;million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group's songs were then amended to credit Love.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-13/business/fi-8511_1_beach-boys-lead-singer "Company Town : Beach Boys' Mike Love Wins His Case..."] ''Los Angeles Times'' December 13, 1994</ref>

In 1993, the band appeared in [[Michael Feeney Callan]]'s film ''The Beach Boys Today'', which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian. Carl confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future.{{quotation needed|date=May 2014}} A few [[Andy Paley sessions|Beach Boys sessions devoted to new Brian Wilson compositions]] occurred during the mid-1990s, but they remain largely unreleased, and the album was quickly aborted because of tenuous relations.<ref name=mojo2004 /><ref>{{cite news|title=Back To The Beach|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,296612,00.html|accessdate=June 30, 2013 |newspaper=Entertainment|date=March 31, 1995}}</ref> In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] on a re-recording of "[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]", which became a British Top-30 hit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In June, the group worked with comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]] on the recording ''Howdy From Maui'', and eventually released ''Stars and Stripes Vol. 1'' in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as [[Toby Keith]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. Brian, who was in a better mental state at the time, acted as co-producer.

In early 1997, Carl was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl continued to perform with the band on its 1997 summer tour while undergoing chemotherapy. During performances, he sat on a stool and needed oxygen after every song.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=286–287}} However, Carl was able to stand when he played on "[[God Only Knows]]".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Carl died on February 6, 1998, two months after the death of the Wilsons' mother, Audree.

===Band split and name conflicts===
[[File:The Beach Boys concierto.jpg|thumb|left|The touring line-up of Mike Love and Bruce Johnston's "The Beach Boys Band", plus guest member David Marks, in 2008]]
Following Carl's death, the remaining members splintered. Love, Johnston and former guitarist Marks continued to tour without Jardine, initially as "America's Band", but following several cancelled bookings under that name, they sought authorization through Brother Records Inc. (BRI) to tour as "The Beach Boys" and secured the necessary license.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In turn, Jardine began to tour regularly with his band dubbed "Beach Boys: Family & Friends" until he ran into legal issues for using the name without license. Meanwhile, Jardine sued Love and Brian, claiming that he had been excluded from their concerts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jardine Loses "Beach Boys"|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jardine-loses-beach-boys-20010803|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=August 3, 2001}}</ref> BRI, through its longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, sued Jardine in Federal Court. Jardine, in turn, counter-claimed against BRI for wrongful termination. BRI ultimately prevailed after several years. Love was allowed to continue to tour as The Beach Boys, while Jardine was prohibited from touring using any form of the name.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Released from Landy's control, Brian Wilson sought different treatments for his illnesses that aided him in his solo career. He toured regularly with his backing band consisting of members of [[Wondermints]] and other LA/Chicago musicians. Marks also maintained a solo career. Their tours remained reliable draws, with Wilson and Jardine both remaining legal members of the Beach Boys organization and BRI.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The surviving group members appeared as themselves for the 1998 documentary film ''[[Endless Harmony: The Beach Boys Story]]'', directed by [[Alan Boyd]]. Following the success of 1997's ''[[The Pet Sounds Sessions]]'', many compilations were then issued by Capitol containing new archival material: ''[[Endless Harmony Soundtrack]]'' (1998), ''[[Ultimate Christmas]]'' (1998), and ''[[Hawthorne, CA (album)|Hawthorne, CA]]'' (2001).

In 2004, Wilson recorded and released his solo album ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]'', a reinterpretation of the ''Smile'' project that he initiated with the Beach Boys thirty-six years earlier. That September, Wilson issued a free CD through the ''[[Daily Mail|Mail On Sunday]]'' that included Beach Boys songs he'd recently rerecorded, five of which he'd co-authored with Love. The 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit in November 2005; he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/04/entertainment/et-quick4.4 |title=Mike Love sues Brian Wilson |last1=Lewis |first1=Randy |date=November 4, 2005 |website=http://www.latimes.com/ |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref> Love's suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were no triable issues.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/16/entertainment/et-quick16.1 |title=Beach Boys lawsuit dismissed |last1=Lewis |first1=Randy |date=May 16, 2007 |website=http://www.latimes.com/ |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref>

On June 13, 2006, the five surviving Beach Boys (Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston, and Marks) appeared together for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of ''Pet Sounds'' and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, ''[[Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys]]'', in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts, with Wilson accepting on behalf of Dennis and Carl. Throughout the year, it was rumored that the band would reform to perform the ''Pet Sounds'' album live in its entirety in November. Ultimately, Wilson began a brief ''Pet Sounds'' tour with Jardine and no other group members.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Doe|first1=Andrew Grayham|title=BBTIMELINE 2006|url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/2006.html|publisher=Endless Summer Quarterly}}</ref>

[[File:Beachboys smile cover.jpg|thumb|right|The cover for ''The Smile Sessions'' uses the artwork [[Frank J. Holmes|Frank Holmes]] prepared in 1966 for ''Smile'']]

On October 31, 2011, the Beach Boys released surviving 1960s recordings from ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' in the form of ''[[The Smile Sessions]]''. The album—even in its incomplete form—garnered universal critical acclaim and experienced popular success, charting in both the Billboard US and UK Top 30. The band was rewarded with glowing reviews, including inclusion in Rolling Stone's Top 500 album list at number 381. ''The Smile Sessions'' went on to win Best Historical Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards. Brian Wilson personally accepted the award stating "I guess Van Dyke and I were on to something after all."{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In February 2011, the Beach Boys released "[[Don't Fight the Sea]]", a charity single to aid the victims of the 2011 Japan earthquake. The single, released on Jardine's 2011 album ''A Postcard From California'' featured Jardine, Wilson, Love and Johnston, with prerecorded vocals by Carl Wilson.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Rumors then circulated regarding a potential 50th anniversary band reunion.

On December 16, 2011, it was announced that Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston and Marks would reunite for a new album and [[Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|50th anniversary tour in 2012]] to include a performance at the [[New Orleans Jazz Festival]] in April 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Beach_Boys/2011/12/16/19133156.html|title=Beach Boys gear up for reunion |accessdate=December 16, 2011 | work=Sun Media|first=Darryl|last=Sterdan|date=December 16, 2011}}</ref> On February 12, 2012, the Beach Boys performed at the 2012 Grammy Awards, in what was billed as a "special performance" by organizers.

==Musical style and development==

{{See also|The Beach Boys lineups}}

In ''Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis'', [[music theory|music theorist]] [[Daniel Harrison (music theorist)|Daniel Harrison]] summarizes:

{{quote|Even from their inception, the Beach Boys were an [[experimental music|experimental]] group. They combined, as [[Jim Miller (musician)|Jim Miller]] has put it, "the instrumental sleekness of [[the Ventures]], the lyric sophistication of Chuck Berry, and the vocal expertise of some weird cross between [[the Lettermen]] and [[Frankie Lymon]] and [[the Teenagers]]" with lyrics whos images, idioms, and concerns were drawn from the rarefied world of the middle-class white male southern California teenager. … [But] it was the profound vocal virtuosity of the group, coupled with the obsessional drive and compositional ambitions of their leader, Brian Wilson, that promised their survival after the eventual breaking of fad fever. … Comparison to other vocally oriented rock groups, such as [[the Association]], shows the Beach Boys' technique to be far superior, almost embarrassingly so. They were so confident of their ability, and of Brian's skill as a producer to enhance it, that they were unafraid of doing sophisticated, [[a cappella]] glee-club arrangements containing multiple [[suspension (music)|suspension]]s, passing [[musical form|formations]], complex chords, and both [[chromatic]] and [[enharmonic]] [[modulation (music)|modulations]].{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}}}}

[[File:The Beach Boys TV.jpg|thumb|The Beach Boys performing in 1964]]

Influenced by [[doo-wop]] and [[rhythm and blues]], they began as a [[garage band]] playing 1950s style [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 15}} 15]}} During their early years, the Beach Boys released music that displayed an increasing level of sophistication, a period where Brian Wilson consistently acted as the group's primary bandleader, songwriter, producer, and arranger for the group's most commercially and critically successful work.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=105–7}}<ref name="Davis1990"/> Together, the band reassembled styles of music such as [[surf music|surf]] to include [[vocal jazz]] [[jazz harmony|harmony]], creating their unique sound.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=36}}{{sfn|Zager|2011|p=216}} In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the [[pop ballad]] by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=35}} Miller observed, "On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead  … on ballads, Brian played his [[falsetto]] off against lush, [[jazz]]-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures."{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=194}} Harrison adds, "But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone."{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}} This new sound was quickly associated with the [[modernism (music)|Modernism]] movement blooming in the Los Angeles music scene.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 16}} 16]}} The band later went on to incorporate many [[genres]], from [[baroque pop]] to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]] and [[synthpop]].<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|title=The Beach Boys Biography on All Music.com|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3640|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|last=Bush|first=John|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}</ref>

Brian is quoted saying: "Everyone contributed something.

Carl responded that every member of the group contributes ideas, but admitted that Brian was majorly responsible for their music.{{sfn|Priore|2005}} In 1967, Dennis was cited as "the closest to brother Brian's own musical ideals ...

===Influences===
{{Further|List of songs covered by the Beach Boys}}

The band's earliest influences came primarily from the work of [[Chuck Berry]]{{refn|group=nb|"[[Surfin' U.S.A.

====Spiritual beliefs====
[[File:Manuscript of Lyrics for God Only Knows - Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Cleveland (by Adam Jones).jpg|150px|thumb|An original handwritten manuscript of the lyrics to "[[God Only Knows]]"]]

Even though the Wilson family did not grow up in "a particularly religious household,"{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=35}} Carl was described as "the most truly religious person I know" by Brian, and Carl was forthcoming about the group's spiritual beliefs stating: "We believe in God as a kind of [[universal consciousness]]. God is love. God is you. God is me. God is everything right here in this room. It's a spiritual concept which inspires a great deal of our music."{{sfn|Priore|2005}} Carl told ''Rave'' magazine in 1967 that the group's influences are of a "religious nature", but not any religion in specific, only "an idea based upon that of Universal Consciousness. ... The spiritual concept of happiness and doing good to others is extremely important to the lyric of our songs, and the religious element of some of the better [[church music]] is also contained within some of our new work."<ref name=Rave1967>{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Mike|title='Our influences are of a religious nature': the Beach Boys on Smile|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/11/beach-boys-smile-brian-wilson|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

Brian identified each member individually for their [[vocal range]], once detailing the ranges for Carl, Dennis, Jardine ("[they] progress upwards through G, A, and B") Love ("can go from bass to the E above middle C"), and himself ("I can take the second D in the [[treble clef]]").<ref name="PopGenius"/>{{refn|group=nb|Starting with the 1970 sessions for the ''Surf's Up'' album, Stephen Desper remembers the emerging corrosive effects of Brian's incessant [[chain smoking]] and [[cocaine]] use: "He could still do falsettos and stuff, but he'd need Carl to help him. Either that or I'd modify the tape speed-wise to make it artificially higher, so it sounded like the old days."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 160}} 160]}} }} He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a "groovy sectional sound."<ref name="PopGenius">{{cite journal|title=Brian Pop Genius!|journal=Melody Maker|date=May 21, 1966|url=http://i1218.photobucket.com/albums/dd420/kwan_dk/MMMay211966.jpg}}</ref> He added, "The harmonies that we are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got.

===As instrumentalists===

The group's instrumental combo initially involved Brian on bass guitar and keyboards, Carl on guitar, and Dennis on drums.{{sfn|Zager|2011|pp=215–16}} From an early age, Brian demonstrated an extraordinary skill for [[learning music by ear]] on keyboard.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=2, 8}} Using major Hollywood [[recording studio]]s, he arranged many of his compositions for a conglomerate of [[session musician]]s informally known as [[the Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]]. Their assistance was needed because of the increasingly complicated nature of the material.{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=HDrIjd5FQ8QC|page= 127}} 127]}}{{refn|group=nb|Many of the musicians and studios Brian used happened to overlap with those used by Phil Spector.{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=88}} }} As a result, a number of songs do not credit the Beach Boys as instrumentalists, but nearly invariably as lead, harmony, or backing vocalists.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It's the belief of [[Richie Unterberger]] that, "Before session musicians took over most of the parts, the Beach Boys could play respectably gutsy surf rock as a self-contained unit."{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 71}} 71]}}

In spite of this, Carl Wilson continued to play beside these musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 114}} 114]}} In archivist Craig Slowinski's view, "One should not sell short Carl's own contributions; the youngest Wilson had developed as a musician sufficiently to play alongside the horde of high-dollar session pros that big brother was now bringing into the studio.

===Songwriting and production===
{{See also|Brian Wilson's home studio|Brother Studios}}

Brian's experiments with his Wollensak tape recorder provide early examples of his flair for [[exotica]] and unusual percussive patterns and arranging ideas that he would recycle in later prominent work.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 23}} 23]}} Through attending Phil Spector's sessions sporadically, Brian learned how to act as a producer for records while being educated on the [[Wall of Sound]] process.{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=17}} From then on, Brian received some production advice from [[Jan Berry]]. As they collaborated on several hit singles written and produced for other artists, they recorded what would later be regarded the [[California Sound]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 24}} 24]}}{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=57}} The positive commercial response to Brian's structurally irregular and harmonically varied pop compositions gave him the prestige, resources, and courage to further his creative aspirations.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=36–37}} He proceeded to explore many unusual combinations of instruments while emphasizing inventive percussion{{refn|group=nb|[[Hi-hat]]s were hardly used on Beach Boys records.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Deevoy|first1=Adrian|title=Beach Boy Brian Wilson: ‘Punk rock?

Although he was often dubbed a perfectionist, Brian was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding was mostly self-taught.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=105, 114}} He handled most stages of the group's recording process from the beginning, despite [[Nik Venet]] being credited for producing their early recordings.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=105}} 105]}}{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=FC0_AwAAQBAJ|page= 26}} 26]}} At the lyric stage, Brian usually worked with bandmate [[Mike Love]],{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 73}} 73]}} whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Brian's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=108}} 108]}} Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band's circle, in the examples "[[Lonely Sea]]" and "[[In My Room]]".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=FC0_AwAAQBAJ|page= 27}} 27]}}

====After 1967====

Foreshadowed by ''Beach Boys' Party!'' (1965), much of the group's recordings from 1967 to 1970 displayed sparse instrumentation, a more relaxed ensemble, and a seeming inattention to production quality.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=41, 46}} Brian briefly experimented with ''[[musique concrete]]''{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 70}} 70]}} and [[minimalist music|minimalist rock]] approaches to music{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=47}} before retreating to [[Brian Wilson's home studio|his home recording studio]] to record "manic" material in the 1970s, enacting [[syncopation|syncopated exercises]] and [[counterpoint]]s layered on jittery [[eighth note]] [[tone cluster]]s and loping [[Swing (jazz performance style)|shuffle grooves]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Chidester|first=Brian|title=Brian Wilson's Secret Bedroom Tapes|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2014-01-30/music/brian-wilsons-secret-bedroom-tapes/|accessdate=February 1, 2014|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=January 30, 2014}}</ref> During the infancy of Brian's home studio, the group was forced to improvise many technical aspects of recording. In one instance, they used an empty swimming pool as an [[echo chamber]].{{sfn|Preiss|1979}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}

When Brian abdicated from the group, the other members were forced to take a more active production role.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=46}} This is believed to have faltered the quality of their music.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=130}} [[Richie Unterberger]] believes that after the December 1967 release of ''Wild Honey'', "The Beach Boys were revealed as a group that, although capable of producing some fine and interesting music, were no longer innovators on the level of the Beatles and other figureheads."{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 72}} 72]}} The album marked the beginning of Carl's increased role as producer, who described it as "music for Brian to cool out by",{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=184}} signaling a mellower approach that pervaded into the 1970s.<ref name="Davis1990"/> In 1968, Dennis contributed original songs to ''Friends'', revealing himself as a broodingly soulful songwriter and singer, while Bruce Johnston devised a moody instrumental, "The Nearest Faraway Place",  for ''20/20'' the following year.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=120–21}}

''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'' (1970) marked an end to the experimental songwriting and production phase initiated by ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' (1967).{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}} Of the albums between ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'' (1971) and ''Holland'' (1973), Daniel Harrison wrote that they "contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead."{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}} While Harrison adamantly states "1974 is the year in which the Beach Boys ceased to be a rock 'n' roll act and became an oldies act,"{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}} ''[[Love You (album)|Love You]]'' (1977) is perceived by some as an oddity that sounds like no other record in their catalog<ref name="Kempke">{{cite web|last=Kempke|first=D.
