The '''Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol''' ('''DHCP''') is a standardized [[network protocol]] used on [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) networks for dynamically distributing network configuration parameters, such as [[IP address]]es for interfaces and services. With DHCP, computers request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from a DHCP server, reducing the need for a [[network administrator]] or a user to configure these settings manually.

=={{Anchor|LEASE}}Overview==
Computers use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol to request Internet Protocol parameters from a network server, such as an [[IP address]]. The protocol operates based on the [[client–server model]]. {{As of|2011}}, modern networks ranging in size from [[home network]]s to large [[campus network]]s and regional [[Internet service provider]] networks commonly use DHCP.<ref>Peterson LL, Davie BS. (2011). [http://books.google.com/books?id=BvaFreun1W8C&pg=PA372&lpg=PA372 Computer Networks: A Systems Approach].</ref> Most residential network routers receive a globally unique IP address within the provider network. Within a local network, DHCP assigns a local IP address to devices connected to the local network.

When a computer or other networked device connects to a network, the DHCP client software sends a [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] query requesting necessary information. Any DHCP server on the network may service the request. The DHCP server manages a pool of IP addresses and information about client configuration parameters such as [[default gateway]], [[domain name]], the [[name server]]s, and [[time server]]s. On receiving a request, the server may respond with specific information for each client, as previously configured by an administrator, or with a specific address and any other information valid for the entire network and for the time period for which the allocation (''lease'') is valid. A client typically queries for this information immediately after [[booting]], and periodically thereafter before the expiration of the information. When a DHCP client refreshes an assignment, it initially requests the same parameter values, but the DHCP server may assign a new address based on the assignment policies set by administrators.

On large networks that consist of multiple links, a single DHCP server may service the entire network when aided by DHCP relay agents located on the interconnecting routers. Such agents relay messages between DHCP clients and DHCP servers located on different subnets.

Depending on implementation, the DHCP server may have three methods of allocating IP addresses:
* ''Dynamic allocation'': a [[network administrator]] reserves a range of IP addresses for DHCP, and each DHCP client on the LAN is configured to request an IP address from the DHCP [[Server (computing)|server]] during network initialization. The request-and-grant process uses a lease concept with a controllable time period, allowing the DHCP server to reclaim (and then reallocate) IP addresses that are not renewed.
* ''Automatic allocation'': the DHCP server permanently assigns an IP address to a requesting client from the range defined by the administrator. This is like dynamic allocation, but the DHCP server keeps a table of past IP address assignments, so that it can preferentially assign to a client the same IP address that the client previously had.
* ''Manual allocation'': commonly called ''Static allocation'', the DHCP server allocates an IP address based on a preconfigured mapping to each client's [[MAC address]]. This feature is variously called ''static DHCP assignment'' by [[DD-WRT]], ''fixed-address'' by the dhcpd documentation, ''address reservation'' by Netgear, ''DHCP reservation'' or ''static DHCP'' by [[Cisco]] and [[Linksys]], and ''IP address reservation'' or ''MAC/IP address binding'' by various other router manufacturers.

DHCP is used for [[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4), as well as for [[IPv6]]. While both versions serve the same purpose, the details of the protocol for IPv4 and IPv6 differ sufficiently that they may be considered separate protocols.<ref>{{cite book

==History==
In 1984, the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol ([[RARP]]), defined in RFC 903, was introduced to allow simple devices such as [[diskless workstation]]s to dynamically obtain a suitable IP address. However, because it acted at the [[data link layer]] it made implementation difficult on many server platforms, and also required that a server be present on each individual network link. Soon afterwards it was superseded by the "Bootstrap Protocol" ([[BOOTP]]) defined in RFC 951. This introduced the concept of a ''relay agent'', which allowed the forwarding of BOOTP packets across networks, allowing one central BOOTP server to serve hosts on many IP subnets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc951#section-6 |title=RFC 951 - Bootstrap Protocol |author=Bill Croft|author2=John Gilmore|date=September 1985|work=Network Working Group }}</ref>

DHCP is based on BOOTP but can dynamically allocate IP addresses from a pool and reclaim them when they are no longer in use. It can also be used to deliver a wide range of extra configuration parameters to IP clients, including platform-specific parameters.<ref name="Network+ certification">[,Network+ Certification 2006 Published By Microsoft Press.</ref> It was first defined in RFC 1531 in October 1993; but due to errors in the editorial process was almost immediately reissued as RFC 1541.

Four years later the DHCPINFORM message type<ref>used for the Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol [[Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol|WPAD]]</ref> and other small changes were added by RFC 2131; which {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}} remains the standard for IPv4 networks.

[[DHCPv6]] was initially described by RFC 3315 in 2003, but this has been updated by many subsequent RFCs.<ref>RFC 4361, RFC 5494, RFC 6221, RFC 6422, RFC 6644, RFC 7083, RFC 7227, RFC 7283</ref> RFC 3633 added a DHCPv6 mechanism for [[prefix delegation]], and [[stateless address autoconfiguration]]  was added by RFC 3736.

==Operation==
[[File:DHCP session.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|An illustration of a typical non-renewing DHCP session; each message may be either a broadcast or a unicast, depending on the DHCP client capabilities.<ref>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131#section-4.1 RFC 2131, Section 4.1 Constructing and sending DHCP messages]</ref>]]

The DHCP employs a [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]] service model, using the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP). It is implemented with two UDP port numbers for its operations which are the same as for the [[BOOTP]] protocol. UDP port number 67 is the destination port of a server, and UDP port number 68 is used by the client.

DHCP operations fall into four phases: server discovery, IP lease offer, IP request, and IP lease acknowledgment. These stages are often abbreviated as DORA for discovery, offer, request, and acknowledgment.

The DHCP operation begins with clients [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcasting]] a request. If the client and server are on different subnets, a [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol#DHCP relaying|DHCP Helper or DHCP Relay Agent]] may be used. Clients requesting renewal of an existing lease may communicate directly via UDP [[unicast]], since the client already has an established IP address at that point.

===DHCP discovery===
The client broadcasts messages on the network subnet using the destination address 255.255.255.255 or the specific subnet broadcast address.  A DHCP client may also request its last-known IP address. If the client remains connected to the same network, the server may grant the request. Otherwise, it depends whether the server is set up as authoritative or not. An authoritative server denies the request, causing the client to issue a new request. A non-authoritative server simply ignores the request, leading to an implementation-dependent timeout for the client to expire the request and ask for a new IP address.

===DHCP offer===
When a DHCP server receives a DHCPDISCOVER message from a client, which is an IP address lease request, the server reserves an IP address for the client and makes a lease offer by sending a DHCPOFFER message to the client. This message contains the client's MAC address, the IP address that the server is offering, the subnet mask, the lease duration, and the IP address of the DHCP server making the offer.

The server determines the configuration based on the client's hardware address as specified in the CHADDR (client hardware address) field. Here the server, 192.168.1.1, specifies the client's IP address in the YIADDR (your IP address) field.

===DHCP request===
In response to the DHCP offer, the client replies with a DHCP request, broadcast to the server,{{Efn|name="optional-unicasts"|As an optional client behavior, some broadcasts, such as those carrying DHCP discovery and request messages, may be replaced with unicasts in case the DHCP client already knows the DHCP server's IP address.<ref>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131#section-4.4.4 RFC 2131, Section 4.4.4: Use of broadcast and unicast]</ref>}} requesting the offered address. A client can receive DHCP offers from multiple servers, but it will accept only one DHCP offer. Based on required ''server identification'' option in the request and broadcast messaging, servers are informed whose offer the client has accepted.<ref name=rfc2131>{{cite IETF

===DHCP acknowledgement===
When the DHCP server receives the DHCPREQUEST message from the client, the configuration process enters its final phase. The acknowledgement phase involves sending a DHCPACK packet to the client. This packet includes the lease duration and any other configuration information that the client might have requested. At this point, the IP configuration process is completed.

The protocol expects the DHCP client to configure its network interface with the negotiated parameters.

After the client obtains an IP address, it should probe the newly received address<ref>RFC2131 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol: Dynamic allocation of network addresses http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131#section-2.2</ref> (e.g. with ARP [[Address Resolution Protocol]]) to prevent address conflicts caused by overlapping address pools of DHCP servers.

===DHCP information===
A DHCP client may request more information than the server sent with the original DHCPOFFER. The client may also request repeat data for a particular application. For example, browsers use ''DHCP Inform'' to obtain web proxy settings via [[Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol|WPAD]].

===DHCP releasing===
The client sends a request to the DHCP server to release the DHCP information and the client deactivates its IP address. As client devices usually do not know when users may unplug them from the network, the protocol does not mandate the sending of ''DHCP Release''.

==Client configuration parameters==
A DHCP server can provide optional configuration parameters to the client. RFC 2132 describes the available DHCP options defined by [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) -  DHCP and BOOTP PARAMETERS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters |title=Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) Parameters |publisher=Iana.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref>

A DHCP client can select, manipulate and overwrite parameters provided by a DHCP server.<ref>In Unix-like systems this client-level refinement typically takes place according to the values in a <code>/etc/dhclient.conf</code> configuration file.
</ref>

==DHCP options==
Options are variable length octet strings. The first octet is the option code, the second octet is the number of following octets and the remaining octets are code dependent.
For example, the DHCP Message type option for an Offer would appear as 0x35,0x01,0x02, where 0x35 is code 53 for "DHCP Message Type", 0x01 means one octet follows and 0x02 is the value of "Offer".

The following tables list the available DHCP options, as stated in RFC2132.<ref name=rfc2132>{{cite IETF

An option exists to identify the vendor and functionality of a DHCP client. The information is a variable-length string of characters or octets which has a meaning specified by the vendor of the DHCP client. One method that a DHCP client can utilize to communicate to the server that it is using a certain type of hardware or firmware is to set a value in its DHCP requests called the Vendor Class Identifier (VCI) (Option 60).

This method allows a DHCP server to differentiate between the two kinds of client machines and process the requests from the two types of modems appropriately. Some types of set-top boxes also set the VCI (Option 60) to inform the DHCP server about the hardware type and functionality of the device. The value this option is set to gives the DHCP server a hint about any required extra information that this client needs in a DHCP response.

==DHCP relaying==
In small networks, where only one IP subnet is being managed, DHCP clients communicate directly with DHCP servers.  However, DHCP servers can also provide IP addresses for multiple subnets.  In this case, a DHCP client that has not yet acquired an IP address cannot communicate directly with the DHCP server using IP routing, because it does not have a routable IP address, nor does it know the IP address of a router.

In order to allow DHCP clients on subnets not directly served by DHCP servers to communicate with DHCP servers, DHCP relay agents can be installed on these subnets.  The DHCP client broadcasts on the local link; the relay agent receives the broadcast and transmits it to one or more DHCP servers using [[unicast]].  The relay agent stores its own IP address in the GIADDR field of the DHCP packet.  The DHCP server uses the GIADDR to determine the subnet on which the relay agent received the broadcast, and allocates an IP address on that subnet.  When the DHCP server replies to the client, it sends the reply to the GIADDR address, again using unicast.  The relay agent then retransmits the response on the local network.

==Reliability==
The DHCP protocol ensures reliability in several ways: periodic renewal, rebinding,<ref name=rfc2131/>{{rp|Section 4.4.5}} and failover.   DHCP clients are allocated leases that last for some period of time.   Clients begin to attempt to renew their leases once half the lease interval has expired.<ref name=rfc2131/>{{rp|Section 4.4.5 Paragraph 3}}   They do this by sending a unicast DHCPREQUEST message to the DHCP server that granted the original lease.   If that server is down or unreachable, it will fail to respond to the DHCPREQUEST.   However, in that case the client repeats the DHCPREQUEST from time to time,<ref name=rfc2131/>{{rp|Section 4.4.5 Paragraph 8}}{{Efn|The RFC calls for the client to wait one half of the remaining time until T2 before it retransmits the DHCPREQUEST packet}} so if the DHCP server comes back up or becomes reachable again, the DHCP client will succeed in contacting it and renew the lease.

If the DHCP server is unreachable for an extended period of time,<ref name=rfc2131/>{{rp|Section 4.4.5 Paragraph 5}} the DHCP client will attempt to rebind, by broadcasting its DHCPREQUEST rather than unicasting it.   Because it is broadcast, the DHCPREQUEST message will reach all available DHCP servers.   If some other DHCP server is able to renew the lease, it will do so at this time.

In order for rebinding to work, when the client successfully contacts a backup DHCP server, that server must have accurate information about the client's binding.   Maintaining accurate binding information between two servers is a complicated problem; if both servers are able to update the same lease database, there must be a mechanism to avoid conflicts between updates on the independent servers.   A proposal for implementing [[Fault-tolerant design|fault-tolerant]] DHCP servers was submitted{{by whom?|date=July 2015}} to the Internet Engineering Task Force, but never formalized<ref>{{cite IETF

Due to the length and complexity of the specification, it was never published as a standard; however, the techniques described in the specification are in wide use, with one open-source implementation in the ISC DHCP server, as well as several commercial implementations.}}

If rebinding fails, the lease will eventually expire.   When the lease expires, the client must stop using the IP address granted to it in its lease.<ref name=rfc2131/>{{rp|Section 4.4.5 Paragraph 9}}   At that time it will restart the DHCP process from the beginning by broadcasting a DHCPDISCOVER message.   Since its lease has expired, it will accept any IP address offered to it.   Once it has a new IP address (presumably from a different DHCP server) it will once again be able to use the network.   However, since its IP address has changed, any ongoing connections will be broken.

==Security==
{{see also|DHCP snooping}}
The base DHCP protocol does not include any mechanism for authentication.<ref name="RAIOSec">{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3046#section-7|title=RFC 3046 - DHCP Relay Agent Information Option|author=Michael Patrick|date=January 2001|work=Network Working Group }}</ref>  Because of this, it is vulnerable to a variety of attacks.   These attacks fall into three main categories:
* Unauthorized DHCP servers providing false information to clients.<ref name="DHCPv4Sec">{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131#section-7|title=RFC 2131 - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol |author=Ralph Droms|date=March 1997|work=Network Working Group }}</ref>
* Unauthorized clients gaining access to resources.<ref name="DHCPv4Sec"/>
* Resource exhaustion attacks from malicious DHCP clients.<ref name="DHCPv4Sec"/>

Because the client has no way to validate the identity of a DHCP server, [[Rogue DHCP|unauthorized DHCP servers]] (commonly called "rogue DHCP") can be operated on networks, providing incorrect information to DHCP clients.<ref name="Stapko2011"/>  This can serve either as a denial-of-service attack, preventing the client from gaining access to network connectivity,<ref name="Rountree2013">{{cite book|author=Derrick Rountree|title=Windows 2012 Server Network Security: Securing Your Windows Network Systems and Infrastructure|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NFzou_d4MGUC&pg=SA2-PA13|year=2013|publisher=Newnes|isbn=978-1-59749-965-1|page=22}}</ref> or as a [[man-in-the-middle attack]].<ref name="Rooney2011">{{cite book|author=Timothy Rooney|title=Introduction to IP Address Management|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QgRDxkuI1MkC&pg=PA180|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-07380-3|page=180}}</ref>  Because the DHCP server provides the DHCP client with server IP addresses, such as the IP address of one or more DNS servers,<ref name="DHCPv4Sec"/> an attacker can convince a DHCP client to do its DNS lookups through its own DNS server, and can therefore provide its own answers to DNS queries from the client.<ref name="DNSRedirect">{{cite web|url=http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208188095/TDSS_loader_now_got_legs|title=TDSS loader now got "legs"|author=Sergey Golovanov (Kaspersky Labs)|date=June 2011}}</ref> This in turn allows the attacker to redirect network traffic through itself, allowing it to eavesdrop on connections between the client and network servers it contacts, or to simply replace those network servers with its own.<ref name="DNSRedirect" />

Because the DHCP server has no secure mechanism for authenticating the client, clients can gain unauthorized access to IP addresses by presenting credentials, such as client identifiers, that belong to other DHCP clients.<ref name="Stapko2011"/> This also allows DHCP clients to exhaust the DHCP server's store of IP addresses—by presenting new credentials each time it asks for an address, the client can consume all the available IP addresses on a particular network link, preventing other DHCP clients from getting service.<ref name="Stapko2011">{{cite book|author=Timothy Stapko|title=Practical Embedded Security: Building Secure Resource-Constrained Systems|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mly55VntuYMC&pg=PA39|year=2011|publisher=Newnes|isbn=978-0-08-055131-9|page=39}}</ref>

DHCP does provide some mechanisms for mitigating these problems.   The Relay Agent Information Option protocol extension (RFC 3046, usually referred to in the industry by its actual number as Option 82<ref name="HensCaballero2008">{{cite book|author1=Francisco J. Hens|author2=José M. Caballero|title=Triple Play: Building the converged network for IP, VoIP and IPTV|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aS1ZngveBIkC&pg=PA239|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-75439-9|page=239}}</ref><ref name="Ramirez2008">{{cite book|author=David H.

This tag is then used as an authorization token to control the client's access to network resources.   Because the client has no access to the network upstream of the relay agent, the lack of authentication does not prevent the DHCP server operator from relying on the authorization token.<ref name="RAIOSec"/>

Another extension, Authentication for DHCP Messages (RFC 3118), provides a mechanism for authenticating DHCP messages.   Unfortunately RFC 3118 has not seen (as of 2002) widespread adoption because of the problems of managing keys for large numbers of DHCP clients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dhcwg/current/msg00876.html|title=Implementation of RFC 3118|author=Ted Lemon|date=April 2002}}</ref> A 2007 book about DSL technologies remarked that "there were numerous security vulnerabilities identified against the security measures proposed by RFC 3118. This fact, combined with the introduction of [[802.1x]], slowed the deployment and take-rate of authenticated DHCP, and it has never been widely deployed."<ref name="GoldenDedieu2007">{{cite book|author1=Philip Golden|author2=Hervé Dedieu|author3=Krista S.

More recent (2008) architectural proposals involve authenticating DHCP requests using 802.1x or [[Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access|PANA]] (both of which transport [[Extensible Authentication Protocol|EAP]]).<ref name="Copeland2008">{{cite book|author=Rebecca Copeland|title=Converging NGN Wireline and Mobile 3G Networks with IMS|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ruWv8RGkBGgC&pg=PA142|year=2008|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-4200-1378-8|pages=142–143}}</ref> An IETF proposal was made for including EAP in DHCP itself, the so-called EAPoDHCP;<ref name="PrasadMihovska2009">{{cite book|author1=Ramjee Prasad|author2=Albena Mihovska|title=New Horizons in Mobile and Wireless Communications: Networks, services, and applications|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w9bEwBwd33MC&pg=PA339|year=2009|publisher=Artech House|isbn=978-1-60783-970-5|page=339|volume=2}}</ref> this does not appear to have progressed beyond IETF draft level, the last of which dates to 2010.<ref>http://tools.ietf.org/search/draft-pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl-07</ref>
