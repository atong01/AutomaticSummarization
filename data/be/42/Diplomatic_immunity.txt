'''Diplomatic immunity''' is a form of [[Immunity from prosecution|legal immunity]] that ensures [[diplomat]]s are given safe passage and are considered not susceptible to [[lawsuit]] or [[prosecution]] under the host country's laws, although they can still be  [[deportation|expelled]]. It was agreed as [[international law]] in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] (1961), though the concept and custom have a much longer history. Many principles of diplomatic immunity are now considered to be [[customary law]]. Diplomatic immunity as an institution developed to allow for the maintenance of government relations, including during periods of difficulties and [[War|armed conflict]]. When receiving diplomats—who formally represent the sovereign—the receiving head of state grants certain privileges and immunities to ensure they may effectively carry out their duties, on the understanding that these are provided on a reciprocal basis.

Originally, these privileges and immunities were granted on a [[bilateralism|bilateral]], [[ad hoc]] basis, which led to misunderstandings and conflict, pressure on weaker states, and an inability for other states to judge which party was at fault. An international agreement known as the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations|Vienna Conventions]] codified the rules and agreements, providing standards and privileges to all states.

It is possible for the official's home country to waive immunity; this tends to happen only when the individual has committed a serious [[crime]], unconnected with their diplomatic role (as opposed to, say, allegations of [[espionage|spying]]), or has witnessed such a crime. However, many countries refuse to waive immunity as a matter of course; individuals have no authority to waive their own immunity (except perhaps in cases of [[defection]]). Alternatively, the home country may prosecute the individual. If immunity is waived by a government so that a diplomat (or their family members) can be prosecuted, it must be because there is a case to answer and it is in the public interest to prosecute them. For instance, in 2002, a Colombian diplomat in London was prosecuted for manslaughter, once diplomatic immunity was waived by the Colombian government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2284320.stm |title=An example where diplomatic immunity was waived in the public interest |publisher=BBC News |date=27 September 2002 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2133055.stm |title=Representations on behalf of the victim's family led to the prosecution of a military attache for manslaughter |publisher=BBC News |date=17 July 2002 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>

==History==

===Ancient times===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
[[File:Krishna Mediating between the Pandavas and Kauravas.jpeg|thumb|right|x216px|text|[[Krishna]], an avatar of [[Vishnu]], [[Kurukshetra War#Krishna's peace mission|mediating for peace]] to avert the [[Kurukshetra War]] of [[Mahabharata]]]]
The concept of diplomatic immunity can be found in ancient Indian epics like ''[[Ramayana]]'' (between 3000 and 2000 BC) (traditional Hindu dating: over 100,000 years ago) and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (around 4th century BC; traditional Hindu dating: 3000 BC), where messengers and diplomats were given immunity from capital punishment. In [[Ramayana]], when the demon king [[Ravana]] ordered the killing of [[Hanuman]], [[Ravana]]'s younger brother [[Vibhishana]] pointed out that messengers or diplomats should not be killed or arrested, as per ancient practices.

During the evolution of international justice, many wars were considered rebellions or unlawful by one or more combatant sides. In such cases, the servants of the "criminal" sovereign were often considered accomplices and their persons violated. In other circumstances, harbingers of inconsiderable demands were killed as a declaration of war. [[Herodotus]] records that when heralds of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian king]] [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] demanded "earth and water" (i.e., symbols of submission) of Greek cities, the [[Athens|Athenians]] threw them into a pit and the [[Sparta]]ns threw them down a well for the purpose of suggesting they would find both earth and water at the bottom, these often being mentioned by the messenger as a threat of siege. However, even for Herodotus, this maltreatment of envoys is a crime, and he immediately recounts a story of divine vengeance befalling Sparta for this deed.<ref>Herodotos. ''Histories''. Book VII, Ch. 133-134. (pp. 558–559 in the cited version.) Transl. Rawlinson, G. Wordsworth. Ware, Herefordshire. 1996. ISBN 1-85326-466-0.</ref>

A [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] envoy was urinated on as he was leaving the city of [[Taranto|Tarentum]]. The oath of the envoy, "This stain will be washed away with blood!", was fulfilled during the [[Second Punic War]]. The arrest and ill-treatment of the envoy of [[Raja Raja Chola]] by the king of [[Kulasekhara dynasty (Second Cheras)]], which is now part of [[modern India]], led to the naval [[Kandalur War]] in AD 994.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Pope Gelasius I]] was the first pope recorded as enjoying diplomatic immunity, as it is noted in his letter ''Duo sunt'' to emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

As diplomats by definition enter the country under safe-conduct, violating them is normally viewed as a great breach of honour, although there have been numerous cases in which diplomats have been killed. [[Genghis Khan]] and the [[Mongols]] were well known for strongly insisting on the rights of diplomats, and they would often take terrifying vengeance against any state that violated these rights. The Mongols would often raze entire cities in retaliation for the execution of their ambassadors, and [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|invaded and destroyed the Khwarezmid Empire]] after their ambassadors had been mistreated.<ref name=Prawdin>[[Michael Prawdin|Prawdin, Michael]]. ''The Mongol Empire''.</ref>

===The beginnings of modern immunity===

The [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] first guaranteed diplomatic immunity to foreign ambassadors in 1709, after Count [[Andrey Matveyev]], a Russian resident in London, had been subjected to verbal and physical abuse by [[Bailiff#British Isles|British bailiffs]].

Modern diplomatic immunity evolved parallel to the development of modern diplomacy. In the 17th century, European diplomats realized that protection from prosecution was essential to doing their jobs and a set of rules evolved guaranteeing the rights of diplomats. These were still confined to Western Europe and were closely tied to the prerogatives of nobility. Thus, an emissary to the Ottoman Empire could expect to be arrested and imprisoned upon the outbreak of hostilities between his state and the empire. The French Revolution also disrupted this system, as the revolutionary state and Napoleon imprisoned numerous diplomats who were accused of working against France. More recently, the [[Iran hostage crisis]] is universally considered a violation of diplomatic immunity. Although the hostage takers did not officially represent the state, host countries are obligated to protect diplomatic property and personnel. On the other hand, during [[World War II]], diplomatic immunity was upheld and the embassies of the belligerents evacuated through neutral countries.

For the upper class of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, diplomatic immunity was an easy concept to understand. The first embassies were not permanent establishments but actual visits by high-ranking representatives, often close relatives, of the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] or the sovereign in person. As permanent representations evolved, usually on a treaty basis between two powers, they were frequently staffed by relatives of the sovereign or high-ranking nobles.

[[War]]fare was not between individuals but between their sovereigns, and the officers and officials of European governments and armies often changed employers. Truces and ceasefires were commonplace, along with fraternization between officers of enemy armies during them. When prisoners, the officers usually gave their [[wikt:parole|parole]] and were only restricted to a city away from the theatre of war. Almost always, they were given leave to carry their personal sidearms. Even during French revolutionary wars, British scientists visited the French Academy. In such an atmosphere, it was easy to accept that some persons were immune to the laws. After all, they were still bound by strict requirements of honour and customs.

In the 19th century, the [[Congress of Vienna]] reasserted the rights of diplomats; and they have been largely respected since then, as the European model has spread throughout the world. Currently, diplomatic relations, including diplomatic immunity, are governed internationally by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], which has been ratified by almost every country in the world.

In modern times, diplomatic immunity continues to provide a means, albeit imperfect, to safeguard diplomatic personnel from any animosity that might arise between nations. As one article put it: "So why do we agree to a system in which we're dependent on a foreign country's whim before we can prosecute a criminal inside our own borders? The practical answer is: because we depend on other countries to honor our own diplomats' immunity just as scrupulously as we honor theirs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jinnah-institute.org/issues/252-raymond-davis-and-the-vienna-convention- |title=Raymond Davis and the Vienna Convention |publisher=Jinnah-institute.org |date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>

In the United States, the Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978 ({{UnitedStatesCode|22|254a}} et seq.) follows the principles introduced by the Vienna Conventions. The United States has had a tendency to be generous when granting diplomatic immunity to visiting diplomats, because a large number of U.S. diplomats work in host countries less protective of individual rights. If the United States were to punish a visiting diplomat without sufficient grounds, U.S. representatives in other countries could receive harsher treatment. If a person with immunity is alleged to have committed a crime or faces a civil lawsuit, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] asks the home country to waive immunity of the alleged offender so that the complaint can be moved to the courts. If immunity is not waived, prosecution cannot be undertaken. However, the State Department still has the discretion to ask the diplomat to withdraw from her or his duties. Often, the diplomat's visas are canceled; and the diplomat and her or his family may be barred from returning to the United States. Crimes committed by members of a diplomat's family can also result in dismissal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/diplomatic-immunity |title=diplomatic immunity: West's Encyclopedia of American Law (Full Article) from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>

==Exceptions to the Vienna Convention==
Some countries have made reservations to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, but they are minor. A number of countries limit the diplomatic immunity of persons who are citizens of the receiving country. As nations keep faith to their treaties with differing zeal, other rules may also apply, though in most cases this summary is a reasonably accurate approximation.<ref>{{Cite journal | title =List of Party States, Declarations and Reservations to Chapter III of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961  | url = http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=III-3&chapter=3&lang=en | date =16 April 2011 | publisher =UNITED NATIONS TREATY COLLECTION | id = | postscript = <!--None-->  }}</ref> The Convention does not cover the personnel of [[international organization]]s, whose privileges are decided upon on a case-by-case basis, usually in the [[Treaty|treaties]] founding such organizations. The United Nations system (including its agencies, which comprise the most recognizable international bodies such as the World Bank and many others) has a relatively standardized form of limited immunities for staff traveling on [[United Nations laissez-passer|U.N. laissez-passer]]; diplomatic immunity is often granted to the highest-ranking officials of these agencies. Consular officials (that do not have concurrent diplomatic accreditation) formally have a more limited form of immunity, generally limited to their official duties. Diplomatic technical and administrative staff also have more limited immunity under the Vienna Convention; for this reason, some countries may accredit technical and administrative staff as [[attaché]].

Other categories of government officials that may travel frequently to other countries may not have diplomatic passports or diplomatic immunity, such as members of the military, high-ranking government officials, ministers, and others. Many countries provide non-diplomatic official passports to such personnel, and there may be different classes of such travel documents such as official passports, service passports, and others. De facto recognition of some form of immunity may be conveyed by states accepting officials traveling on such documents, or there may exist bilateral agreements to govern such cases (as in, for example, the case of military personnel conducting or observing exercises on the territory of the receiving country).

Formally, diplomatic immunity may be limited to officials accredited to a host country, or traveling to or from their host country. In practice, many countries may effectively recognize diplomatic immunity for those traveling on diplomatic passports, with admittance to the country constituting acceptance of the diplomatic status.

==Abuse==
In reality, most diplomats are representatives of nations with a tradition of professional [[civil service]], and are expected to obey regulations governing their behaviour and they suffer strict internal consequences (disciplinary action) if they flout local laws. In many nations, a professional diplomat's career may be compromised if they (or members of their family) disobey the local authorities or cause serious embarrassment, and such cases are, at any rate, a violation of the spirit of the Vienna Conventions.

The Vienna Convention is explicit that "without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State." Nevertheless, on some occasions, diplomatic immunity leads to some unfortunate results; protected diplomats have violated laws (including those that would be violations at home as well) of the host country and that country has been essentially limited to informing the diplomat's nation that the diplomat is no longer welcome (''[[persona non grata]]''). Diplomatic agents are not, however, exempt from the jurisdiction of their home state, and hence prosecution may be undertaken by the sending state; for minor violations of the law, the sending state may impose administrative procedures specific to the foreign service or diplomatic mission.

Violation of the law by diplomats has included [[espionage]], smuggling, [[child custody]] law violations, tax evasion, making terrorist threats,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2010/04/cant_touch_this.html|title=Can't Touch This: How far does diplomatic immunity go?|author=Christopher Beam|date=Apr 2010|publisher=Slate.com}}</ref> slavery, preying on children over the Internet for sex,<ref name="Reader's Digest">{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/advice/diplomatic-immunity-going-too-far/|title=The Untouchables: Is Diplomatic Immunity Going Too Far?|publisher=Reader's Digest}}</ref> and [[murder]]: In [[London]] in 1984, policewoman [[Yvonne Fletcher]] was killed on the street by a person shooting from inside the [[Libyan Embassy in London|Libyan embassy]].

===Drug smuggling===
Diplomats and officials involved in drug smuggling have benefited from diplomatic immunity. For example, a Venezuelan general wanted in the United States on drugs charges and arrested in Aruba was released after the Venezuelan government protested his diplomatic immunity and threatened sanctions if Aruba did not release him.<ref>{{cite news|title=Netherlands Says Venezuelan Detained in Aruba Has Immunity |url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/netherlands-rules-venezuelan-detained-in-aruba-has-diplomatic-immunity-1406505987 |accessdate=14 December 2014 |agency=WSJ |date=27 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20150710115148/http://www.wsj.com/articles/netherlands-rules-venezuelan-detained-in-aruba-has-diplomatic-immunity-1406505987 |archivedate=10 July 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-plans-sanctions-on-some-venezuelan-officials-1406697081|title=U.S. Plans Sanctions on Some Venezuelan Officials|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=30 July 2014|agency=WSJ<!-- confirms that he is wanted in the U.S. -->}}</ref>

===Employer abuse and slavery===
Diplomatic immunity from local employment and labor law when employing staff from the host country has precipitated abuse. Local staff are employed where local knowledge is needed (such as an administrative assistant, press/PR officer), or as menial staff like a cleaner, maid or mechanic. When the employer is a diplomat, the employees are in a legal limbo where the laws of neither the host country nor the diplomat's country are enforceable, so that an abusive diplomat employer can act with virtual impunity. Diplomats have ignored local laws concerning [[minimum wage]]s, maximum working hours, vacation and holidays. The worst abusers have imprisoned the employees in their homes, deprived them of their earned wages, [[passport]]s, and communication with the outside world, abused them physically and emotionally, deprived them of food and invaded their privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/newsprint.cgi?file=/news2007/1115-01.htm |title=ACLU: Abused Domestic Workers of Diplomats Seek Justice From International Commission |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aclu.org/womensrights/humanrights/28030prs20070117.html |title=American Civil Liberties Union: ACLU Charges Kuwait Government and Diplomats With Abusing Domestic Workers |publisher=Aclu.org |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref> Reported incidents include the following:

The envoy and his wife claimed diplomatic immunity, and Begum later reached a civil settlement with her employers. By some estimates, "hundreds of women have been exploited by their diplomat employers over the past 20 years."<ref name="Reader's Digest"/>
*In 2003 in Finland, a Filipino maid escaped from an embassy of an unidentified Asian country, and reported being held in conditions approaching slavery: she was forced to work from 7 am. to 10 pm., 7 days a week, and the ambassador's children were permitted to hit her.

===Vehicular===

====Parking violations====
A particular problem is the difficulty in enforcing ordinary laws, such as prohibitions on [[double parking]]. For example, the [[Autobahn 555]] in [[Cologne]], Germany was nicknamed the "Diplomatenrennbahn" (Diplomatic Raceway), back when Bonn was the capital of [[West Germany]], because of the numerous diplomats that used to speed through the highway under diplomatic immunity. Certain cities, e.g., [[The Hague]], have taken to impounding such cars rather than fining their owners. Diplomats' status does not guarantee the release of impounded cars.

Diplomatic missions have their own regulations, but many require their staff to pay any fines due for parking violations. A 2006 economic study found that there was a significant correlation between home-country [[Political corruption|corruption]] (as measured by [[Transparency International]]) and unpaid parking fines: six countries had in excess of 100 violations per diplomat: [[Kuwait]], [[Egypt]], [[Chad]], [[Sudan]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Mozambique]].<ref>{{Cite journal | first = Ray  | last = Fisman | first2 = Edward | last2 =Miguel | title =Cultures of Corruption: Evidence from Diplomatic Parking tickets | url = http://www.usc.edu/schools/business/FBE/seminars/papers/AE_4-28-06_FISMAN-parking.pdf | date =28 April 2006 | publisher =USC FBE APPLIED ECONOMICS WORKSHOP | id = | postscript = <!--None-->  }}</ref> In particular, [[New York City]], the home of the [[United Nations]] Headquarters, regularly protests to the [[United States Department of State]] about non-payment of parking tickets because of diplomatic status. As of 2001, the city had more than 200,000 outstanding parking tickets from diplomats, totaling more than $21.3 million, of which only $160,682 had been collected.<ref name="JOHN J. GOLDMAN">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/03/news/mn-18122|title=NYC's Diplomatic Take on Tickets|date=2001-07-03|author=JOHN J.

GOLDMAN"/>

In cities that impose a [[Congestion pricing|congestion charge]], the decision of some diplomatic missions not to furnish payment has proved controversial. In London, embassies have amassed approximately £58 million in unpaid charges as of 2012, with the American embassy comprising approximately £6 million and the Russian, German and Japanese missions around £2 million each.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18725937 | location=London | work=BBC News | title=Diplomats 'owe £58m in London congestion charges' | date=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_mayoral/new-york-times-urges-us-embassy-pay-congestion-charge |title=New York Times urges US Embassy to pay congestion charge &#124; Greater London Authority |publisher=London.gov.uk |date=31 March 2006 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>

====Drunk driving and vehicular assault====
In January 1997, Gueorgui Makharadze, a high-ranking [[Republic of Georgia]] diplomat, caused a five-car pileup on [[Dupont Circle]] near [[Embassy Row]] that killed a 16-year-old [[Maryland]] girl. Makharadze's claim of diplomatic immunity created a national outrage in the United States, particularly given Makharadze's previous record of driving offenses: in April 1996, Makharadze had been charged with speeding in Virginia, and four months later, he was detained by District of Columbia police on suspicion of drunk driving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/09/us/georgian-diplomat-pleads-guilty-in-death-of-teen-age-girl.html|title=Georgian Diplomat Pleads Guilty in Death of Teenage Girl|author=MICHAEL JANOFSKY|date=1997-10-09|publisher=New York Times}}</ref> In both prior cases, charges were dismissed based on his immunity. On the basis of the media coverage, Georgia revoked Makharadze's immunity, and he was ultimately sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to one count of involuntary manslaughter and four counts of aggravated assault.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/20/news/mn-531|title=Ex-Diplomat Gets 7 Years for Death of Teen in Crash|author=Associated Press|date=1997-12-20|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

In 2001, a Russian diplomat, Andrei Knyazev, hit and killed a woman while driving drunk in Ottawa. Knyazev refused to take a breathalyzer at the scene of the crash, citing diplomatic immunity.<ref name="CBC News">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/former-russian-diplomat-guilty-of-involuntary-manslaughter-1.313443|title=Former Russian diplomat guilty of involuntary manslaughter|date=2002-03-19|publisher=CBC News}}</ref> Russia refused Canadian requests to waive his immunity, and Knyazev was expelled from Canada.  Though the Russian Foreign Ministry fired him and charged him with involuntary manslaughter, and Russian and Canadian authorities cooperated in the investigation, the case caused a political storm in Canada. Many accused the Foreign Ministry of incompetence after it emerged that Knyazev had twice been previously investigated for drunk driving. The Canadian Foreign Minister had fought unsuccessfully to have Knyazev tried in Ottawa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/17/news/mn-26623|title=Russia Says Diplomat Will Be Tried in Drunk-Driving Case|author=|date=2001-02-17|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> In 2002, Knyazev was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in Russia.<ref name="CBC News"/>

===Financial abuse===
Historically, the problem of large debts run up by diplomats has also caused many problems. Some financial institutions do not extend credit to diplomats because they have no legal means of ensuring the money be repaid. Local citizens and businesses are often at a disadvantage when filing civil claims against a diplomat, especially in cases of unpaid rent, alimony, and child support.

====Rents====
The bulk of diplomatic debt lies in the rental of office space and living quarters. Individual debts can range from a few thousand dollars to $1 million in back rent. A group of diplomats and the office space in which they work are referred to as a [[diplomatic mission]]. Creditors cannot sue missions individually to collect money they owe. Landlords and creditors have found that the only thing they can do is contact a city agency to see if they can try to get some money back. They cannot enter the offices or apartments of diplomats to evict them because the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]] says that "the property in the United States of a foreign state shall be immune from attachment, arrest and execution" ({{UnitedStatesCode|28|1609}}). This has led creditors who are owed money by diplomats to become more cautious about their renters and to change their rental or payment policies.

In one case, for example, officials from Zaire stopped paying rent to their private landlord and ran up $400,000 in debt. When the landlord sued, the U.S. State Department defended the Zaireans on the basis of diplomatic immunity, and a circuit court agreed. When the landlord finally cut off the utilities, the officials fled without paying their back rent. The landlords reportedly later reached an "amicable agreement" with the Zaire government.<ref name="Reader's Digest"/>

====Alimony and child support====
The issue of abusing diplomatic immunity in family relations, especially [[alimony]] and [[child support]], has become so widespread that it prompted discussion at the 1995 U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing. Historically, the United Nations has not become involved with family disputes and has refused to garnish the wages of diplomats who owe money for child support, citing Sovereign Immunity. However, in September 1995, the incumbent head of Legal Affairs for the United Nations acknowledged there was a moral and legal obligation to take at least a partial responsibility in family disputes. Fathers working as diplomats who refused to fulfil their family-related financial duties were increasing in numbers in the United Nations: several men who had left their wives and children were still claiming U.N. dependency, travel, and education allowances for their families, though they are no longer supporting those families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Diplomatic+Immunity |title=Diplomatic Immunity legal definition of Diplomatic Immunity.

====Taxes and fees====
Diplomats are exempt from most taxes, but not from "charges levied for specific services rendered". In certain cases, whether a payment is or is not considered a tax may be disputed, such as [[central London]]'s [[congestion charge]]. In August 2009, it was reported that the Government of the UK believed the United States owed £3,500,000<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/aug/17/obama-ambassador-london-congestion-charge | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Obama's ambassador to London will not pay congestion charge backlog | first=Hélène | last=Mulholland | date=17 August 2009 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> in unpaid congestion charge fees.<ref>{{cite news | title = The Information: Diplomats Who Skip The Congestion Charge | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e933c746-70ad-11dd-b514-0000779fd18c.html | publisher = Financial Times | date = 23 August 2008 | accessdate = 13 March 2009 }}</ref> It was reported in 2006 that the UAE embassy had agreed to pay their own accumulated charges of nearly £100,000.<ref>{{cite news  | title = Embassy to pay congestion charge | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4881442.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 6 April 2006 | accessdate = 28 March 2007 }}</ref>

There is an obligation for the receiving State not to "discriminate as between states"; in other words, any such fees should be payable by all accredited diplomats equally. This may allow the [[diplomatic corps]] to negotiate as a group with the authorities of the receiving country.

Diplomats are exempt from [[import duty]] and [[tariffs]] for items for their personal use. In some countries, this has led to charges that diplomatic agents are profiting personally from resale of "tax free" goods. The receiving state may choose to impose restrictions on what may reasonably constitute personal use (for example, only a certain quantity of [[cigarette]]s per day). When enacted, such restrictions are generally quite generous so as to avoid [[Tit for tat|tit-for-tat]] responses.

==Other incidents concerning diplomatic immunity==

* In 1967, the [[Burma|Burmese]] Ambassador to Sri Lanka shot his wife as she got out of the car after seeing a nightclub bandmember of whom she was enamoured. The next morning, neighbours saw the Ambassador building a [[pyre]] on the back lawn. When the police were called, the Ambassador opened the metal front gates just enough to say that there was no trouble and to remind them that his house was Burmese territory. He later emerged with the body of his wife, placed it on the pyre and set it alight. He was "well connected at home but after an awkward interval he was recalled" from his position.<ref>{{cite news|title=Police probe death of Burma envoy's wife|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19671017-1.2.19.8.aspx|work=Mrs.Shirley Boonwaat murder case|agency=The Straits Times|issue=The Straits Times, 17 December 1967, Page 3|publisher=National Library Board Singapore|date=17 October 1967}}</ref>

* In 1984, Libyan dissidents protested outside the Libyan embassy in [[London]]. British policewoman [[Murder of Yvonne Fletcher|Yvonne Fletcher]] was killed by gunshots originating from the embassy. To date, the identity of the gunman has never been confirmed and the Libyan authorities made no effort to identify the culprit nor reveal whether the culprit was ever punished. Two years later, the incident became a major factor in Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s decision to allow [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] to launch the [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|U.S. bombing of Libya in 1986]] from American bases in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106363 | first = Margaret | last = Thatcher | title = Statement on US bombing of Libya}}.</ref>
* In 1987, in New York City, 9-year-old Terrence Karamba was placed by the Human Resources Administration in a foster home after his elementary school teachers noticed suspicious scars and injuries. He and his 7-year-old sister, who was also placed in City custody, told officials the wounds had been inflicted by their father, Floyd Karamba, an Administrative Attache at the Zimbabwean Mission to the U.N. No charges were filed, as Mr. Karamba had diplomatic immunity.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/01/nyregion/court-won-t-bar-return-of-boy-in-abuse-case-to-zimbabwe.html?pagewanted=print&src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Mark A. | last=Uhlig | title=Court Won't Bar Return of Boy In Abuse Case to Zimbabwe | date=1 January 1988}}</ref>
* On 27 October 1998, in [[Vladivostok]], [[Russia]], Douglas Kent, the American [[Consul (representative)#Consul general|Consul General]] to Russia, was involved in a car accident that left a young man, Alexander Kashin, disabled. Kent was not prosecuted in a U.S. court. Under the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations|Vienna Convention]], diplomatic immunity does not apply to civil actions relating to vehicular accidents, but in 2006, the [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]] ruled that, since he was using his vehicle for consular purposes, Kent could not be sued civilly.<ref>{{cite news  | title = Immunity shelters former US Consul from Russian invalid | url = http://vn.vladnews.ru/issue531/Crime_watch/Immunity_shelters_former_US_Consul_from_Russian_invalid | publisher = Vladivostok News | date = 17 August 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Russia student in diplomatic controversy | url = http://media.www.dailylobo.com/media/storage/paper344/news/2002/09/16/News/Russia.Student.In.Diplomatic.Controversy-274101.shtml | publisher = New Mexico daily Lobo, From AP | date = 16 September 2002}}</ref>
* On February 1999 in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]], Kazuko Shimokoji, wife of the Japanese Consul-General, showed up at the ER of a city hospital with two black eyes and a bruised neck. She told doctors that her husband had beaten her. When local police questioned her husband, Mr. Shimokoji said, "Yes, I punched her out and she deserved it", and described the incident as "a cultural thing and not a big deal." Although an arrest warrant was issued, Mr. Shimokoji could not be arrested due to his diplomatic immunity. However, his statement to the police found wide echo in both the local and Japanese press. The subsequent public uproar prompted the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to waive Mr. Shimokoji's immunity. Though he pled guilty in Canadian court, he was given an absolute discharge. Nonetheless, he was recalled to Japan where he was reassigned to office duty and had his pay cut.<ref>{{cite news | title = Wife-beating diplomat ordered home | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/03/04/japan990304.html | publisher = CBC News | date = 4 March 1999}}</ref>

* On 24 April 2008, in [[New Orleans]], Mexican [[press attaché]] Rafael Quintero Curiel was seen stealing [[BlackBerry]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] units from a [[White House]] press meeting room. Quintero made it all the way to the airport before members of the [[United States Secret Service]] caught up with him. He initially denied taking the devices, but after being confronted with security video, Quintero claimed it was purely accidental, gave the devices back, claimed diplomatic immunity and left New Orleans with the Mexican delegation. He was eventually fired for the incident.<ref>[[Fox News Channel|FoxNews.com]] [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352378,00.html Mexican Embassy: Official Fired After Getting Caught With White House BlackBerries]</ref>

The Indian Supreme Court opined that the Italian ambassador had waived his diplomatic immunity and could be charged for contempt.

* In October 2013, Russian diplomat Dmitri Borodin was arrested in The Hague, The Netherlands, after neighbours alerted the police.

*On September 12, 2015, Sheikh Khalid bin Hamad Al Thani tried to claim diplomatic immunity when his [[Ferrari LaFerrari]] and a  [[Porsche 911 GT3]] were caught on camera [[drag racing]] through a residential neighborhood in [[Beverly Hills]]. He owns the cars and a drag racing team, and is a member of [[Qatar]]'s ruling family. The Beverly Hills Police Department contacted the [[U.S. State Department]] to clarify if he had diplomatic immunity. They stated he did not. However, his face was not shown on camera, and no officer witnessed the crime, so the state of California has not yet pressed charges. He has since fled the country.

The following chart outlines the immunities afforded to foreign diplomatic personnel residing in the United States.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.state.gov/m/ds/immunities/c9127.htm | title = Legal Aspects of Diplomatic Immunity and Privileges | accessdate = 28 March 2007 | publisher = [[United States Department of State]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070315084126/http://www.state.gov/m/ds/immunities/c9127.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 15 March 2007}}</ref>
In general, these rules follow the Vienna Convention (or the New York Convention for UN officials) and apply in other countries as well (with the exceptions of immunities for United Nations officials, which can vary widely across countries based on the 'Host Country Agreement' signed between the UN and the host country, whereby additional immunities beyond those granted by the New York Convention may be established).
