'''Bayezid I''' ({{lang-ota|بايزيد اول}}; {{lang-tr|1. Beyazıt}}; nicknamed ''Yıldırım'' (Ottoman Turkish: ییلدیرم), "'''The Lightning'''"; 1360 – 8 March 1403) was the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire]] from 1389 to 1402. He was the son of [[Murad I]]<ref name=Lowry>Lowry, Heath W. (2003) ''The Nature of the Early Ottoman State''.

==Biography==
[[File:Miniature depicting Bayezid I.jpg|thumb|200px|Turkish Miniature depicting Bayezid]]

The first major role of Bayezid was as governor of Kütahya, city that was conquered from the [[Germiyanids]]. He was an impetuous soldier, earning the nickname of Lightning in a battle against the [[Karamanids]].
 
Bayezid ascended to the throne following the death of his father Murad I, who was killed by Serbian knight [[Miloš Obilić]] during (15 June), or immediately after (16 June), the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, by which Serbia became a vassal of the Ottoman Empire. Immediately after obtaining the throne, he had his younger brother strangled to avoid a plot. In 1390, Bayezid took as a wife Princess [[Olivera Despina]], the daughter of Prince [[Lazar of Serbia]],<ref>Halil Inalcik, "Bayezid I", ''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', Vol. I, Ed. H.A.R.Gibb, J.H.Kramers, E. Levi-Provencal and J.Schacht, (Brill, 1986), 1118.</ref> who also lost his life in Kosovo. Bayezid recognized [[Stefan Lazarević]], the son of Lazar, as the new Serbian leader (later despot), with considerable autonomy.

The upper Serbia resisted the Ottomans until general Pashayigit captured the city of Skopje in 1391, converting he city in an important base of operations.

Meanwhile, the sultan began unifying Anatolia under his rule. Forcible expansion into Muslim territories could endanger the Ottoman relationship with the [[gazi]]s, who were an important source of warriors for this ruling house on the European frontier. So Bayezid began the practice to first secure ''fatwa''s, or legal rulings from Islamic scholars, justifying their wars against these Muslim states. However he suspected the loyalty of his Muslim Turkoman followers, for Bayezid relied heavily on his Serbian and Byzantine vassal troops to perform these conquests.<ref>Stanford Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'' (Cambridge: University Press, 1976), vol. 1 p. 30</ref>

In a single campaign over the summer and fall of 1390, Bayezid conquered the beyliks of [[Beylik of Aydın|Aydin]], [[Sarukhanids|Saruhan]] and [[Menteşe (beylik)|Menteşe]]. His major rival Sulayman, the emir of [[Karaman]], responded by allying himself with the ruler of [[Sivas]], [[Kadi Burhan al-Din]] and the remaining Turkish beyliks. Nevertheless, Bayezid pushed on and in the fall and winter of 1390 overwhelmed the remaining beyliks -- [[Hamidids|Hamid]], [[Beylik of Teke|Teke]], and [[Germiyan]]—as well as taking the cities of [[Akşehir]] and [[Niğde]], as well as their capital [[Konya]] from the Karaman. At this point, Bayezid accepted peace proposals from Karaman (1391), concerned that further advances would antagonize his Turkoman followers and lead them to ally with Kadi Burhan al-Din. Once peace had been made with Karaman, Bayezid moved north against [[Kastamonu]] which had given refuge to many fleeing from his forces, and conquered both that city as well as [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]].<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire'', vol. 1 pp. 30f</ref>

From 1389 to 1395 he conquered [[Bulgaria]] and northern [[Greece]]. In 1394 Bayezid crossed the River [[Danube]] to attack [[Wallachia]], ruled at that time by [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea the Elder]]. The Ottomans were superior in number, but on 10 October 1394 (or 17 May 1395), in the [[Battle of Rovine]], on forested and swampy terrain, the [[Wallachians|Wallachian]]s won the fierce battle and prevented Bayezid's army from advancing beyond the Danube.<ref>John V.A. Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', (The University of Michigan Press, 1994), 424.</ref>

In 1394, Bayezid laid siege to [[Constantinople]],<ref>Mango, Cyril. ''The Oxford History of Byzantium''. 1st ed. New York: Oxford UP, 2002. p. 273-4</ref> the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Anadoluhisarı]] fortress was built between 1393 and 1394 as part of preparations for the Second Ottoman Siege of Constantinople, which took place in 1395. On the urgings of the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel II Palaeologus]] a new [[crusade]] was organized to defeat him. This proved unsuccessful: in 1396 the [[Christianity|Christian]] allies, under the leadership of the King of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and future [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (in 1433) [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], were defeated in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]. Bayezid built the magnificent [[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Cami]] in Bursa, to celebrate this victory.

Thus, the siege of Constantinople continued, lasting until 1402.<ref>Nancy Bisaha, ''Creating East And West: Renaissance Humanists And the Ottoman Turks'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), 98.</ref> The beleaguered Byzantines had their reprieve when Bayezid fought the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid Empire]] in the East.<ref>Dimitris J. Kastritsis, ''The Sons of Bayezid: Empire Building and Representation in the Ottoman Civil War of 1402-13'', (Brill, 2007), 5.</ref> At this time, the empire of Bayezid included [[Thrace]] (except [[Constantinople]]), [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], and parts of [[Serbia]] in Europe. In Asia, his domains extended to the [[Taurus Mountains]]. His army was considered one of the best in the Islamic world. In 1400, the [[Central Asia]]n warlord [[Timur]] succeeded in rousing the local Turkic [[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]] that had been vassals of the Ottomans to join him in his attack on Bayezid, who was also considered one of the most powerful rulers in the Muslim world during that period. In the fateful [[Battle of Ankara]], on 20 July 1402, Bayezid was captured by Timur and the Ottoman army was defeated. Many writers claim that Bayezid was mistreated by the Timurids. However, writers and historians from Timur's own court reported that Bayezid was treated well, and that Timur even mourned his death. One of Bayezid's sons, [[Mustafa Çelebi]], was captured with him and held captive in [[Samarkand]] until 1405.

Four of Bayezid's sons, specifically [[Süleyman Çelebi]], [[İsa Çelebi]], [[Mehmed Çelebi]], and [[Musa Çelebi]], however, escaped from the battlefield and later started a civil war for the Ottoman throne known as the [[Ottoman Interregnum]].<ref>Dimitris J. Kastritsis,1-3.</ref> After Mehmed's victory, his coronation as [[Mehmed I]], and the death of all four but Mehmed, Bayezid's other son [[Mustafa Çelebi]] emerged from hiding and began two failed rebellions against his brother Mehmed and, after Mehmed's death, his nephew [[Murat II]].

==In fiction==
[[File:1396-Battle of Nicopolis-Hunername-2.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Nicopolis]], as depicted by Turkish miniaturist in 1588.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lokman |url=http://warfare.atwebpages.com/Ottoman/Ottoman.htm |title=Battle of Nicopolis (1396) |year=1588 |work=Hünernâme}}</ref>]]

The defeat of Bayezid became a popular subject for later Western writers, composers, and painters. They embellished the legend that he was taken by Timur to [[Samarkand]] with a cast of characters to create an oriental fantasy that has maintained its appeal. [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]'' was first performed in [[London]] in 1587, three years after the formal opening of English-Ottoman trade relations when [[William Harborne]] sailed for Constantinople as an agent of the [[Levant Company]].

In 1648, the play ''Le Gran Tamerlan et Bejezet'' by [[Jean Magnon]] appeared in London, and in 1725, [[Handel]]'s ''[[Tamerlano]]'' was first performed and published in London;<ref>London: Printed & sold by J. Cluer, [1725]</ref> [[Vivaldi]]'s version of the story, ''[[Bajazet (opera)|Bajazet]]'', was written in 1735. Magnon had given Bayezid an intriguing wife and daughter; the Handel and Vivaldi renditions included, as well as Tamerlane and Bayezid and his daughter, a prince of Byzantium and a princess of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] ([[Trabzon]]) in a passionate love story. A cycle of paintings in [[Schloss Eggenberg]], near [[Graz]] in [[Austria]], translated the theme to a different medium; this was completed in the 1670s shortly before the Ottoman army attacked the [[Habsburgs]] in central [[Europe]].<ref>Finkel, C. (2006) ''The History of the Ottoman Empire: Osman's Dream''. New York: Basic Books; p. 30</ref>

Bayezid (spelled Bayazid) is a central character in the [[Robert E. Howard]] story ''Lord of Samarcand.''<ref>Howard, Robert E. (1973) ''Sowers of the Thunder,'' Ace Science Fiction</ref>
