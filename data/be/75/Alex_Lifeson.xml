The last few years, he said in 2011, he has &quot;used Gibson almost exclusively. There's nothing like having a low-slung Les Paul over my shoulder&quot; In early 2011, Gibson introduced the &quot;Alex Lifeson Axcess&quot;, a guitar specially designed for him. These are custom made Les Pauls with Floyd Rose systems on both of them. He mentioned the process taking two years to design a perfect guitar. He used these two custom Les Pauls on the Time Machine Tour. These guitars are also available through Gibson, in a viceroy Brown or Crimson color. Lifeson used these two guitars heavily on the tour.<extension extension_name='ref' name="cohen"></extension><space/>For the Clockwork Angels tour, Gibson built an Alex Lifeson Axcess model in black which became Lifeson's primary guitar for much of the show. For all acoustic work, he played one of his Axcess guitars using the piezo pick-ups; no acoustic guitars were used at all in the Clockwork Angels show.</paragraph><paragraph>In 2005, Hughes &amp; Kettner introduced an Alex Lifeson signature series amplifier; Lifeson donates his royalties from the sale of these signature models to<space/><link><target>UNICEF</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="title">TriAmp MKII Alex Lifeson</arg><arg name="url">http://www.hughes-and-kettner.com/products.php5?id</arg><arg name="publisher">Hughes-and-kettner.com</arg><arg name="accessdate">14 June 2012</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 2012, Lifeson abandoned his signature Triamps in favor for custom-built Lerxst Omega<space/><link><target>Marshall Amplification</target><part>Silver Jubilee</part></link><space/>clones, handmade by Mojotone in Burgaw, NC and<space/><link><target>Mesa Boogie Mark Series</target><part>Mesa/Boogie Mark V</part></link><space/>heads.

Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments,<space/><link><target>accompaniment</target><trail>s</trail></link>, vocal<space/><link><target>harmonies</target></link>, and other sound &quot;events&quot; that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).<extension extension_name='ref' name="onstagemag.com"></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Awards</heading><paragraph><template><target>Portal</target><arg>Rush</arg></template></paragraph><list type='bullet'><listitem>&quot;Best Rock Talent&quot; by<space/><italics><link><target>Guitar for the Practicing Musician</target></link></italics><space/>in 1983</listitem><listitem>&quot;Best Rock Guitarist&quot; by<space/><italics>Guitar Player Magazine</italics><space/>in 1984 and May 2008</listitem><listitem>Runner-up for &quot;Best Rock Guitarist&quot; in<space/><italics>Guitar Player</italics><space/>in 1982, 1983, 1985, 1986</listitem><listitem>Inducted into the Guitar for the Practicing Musician Hall of Fame, 1991</listitem><listitem>1996 Officer of the<space/><link><target>Order of Canada</target></link>, along with bandmates<space/><link><target>Geddy Lee</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Neil Peart</target></link></listitem><listitem>&quot;Best Article&quot; for &quot;Different Strings&quot; in<space/><italics>Guitar Player</italics><space/>(September issue).</listitem><listitem>Most Ferociously Brilliant Guitar Album (<italics>Snakes &amp; Arrows</italics>)<space/><italics>Guitar Player Magazine</italics>, May 2008</listitem><listitem>2013 - With Rush,<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/rush/'>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee</link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg name="colwidth">30em</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/happenings/ae60b79aa073a3be/index.html'>Audio-Technica interview with Alex</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/05/27/lifeson.transcript/index.html'>Read 2002 CNN interview with Alex</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://www.musictoyz.com/articles/chopalex.php'>Alex Lifeson gear, by songs</link></listitem><listitem><template><target>YouTube</target><arg>B5T46iU1Evs</arg><arg>Alex Lifeson interview at home, Drink Bravely TV</arg></template></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://archive.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?lang=e&amp;amp;TypeID=orc&amp;amp;id=3595'>Order of Canada citation</link></listitem><listitem><link type='external' href='http://Lerxstamps.com'>Lerxst Amplification</link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Rush</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>commons category</target><arg>Alex Lifeson</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Authority control</target></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>Persondata</target><arg name="NAME"><space/>Lifeson, Alex
