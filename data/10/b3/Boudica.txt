'''Boudica''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|uː|d|ɨ|k|ə}}; alternative spelling: '''Boudicca''', also known as '''Boadicea''' {{IPAc-en|b|oʊ|d|ɨ|ˈ|s|iː|ə}} and in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] as '''{{lang|cy|Buddug}}''' {{IPA-cy|ˈbɨ̞ðɨ̞ɡ|}})<ref>{{Cite book |author=[[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]] |title=A History of Wales |publisher=Penguin |year=1993 |location=London |pages=28 |isbn=0-14-014581-8 }}</ref> (d. AD 60 or 61) was a queen of the [[Britons (historical)|British]] [[Iceni]] tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the [[Roman Empire]].

Boudica's husband [[Prasutagus]] ruled as a nominally independent ally of Rome and left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the [[Roman emperor]] in his will. However, when he died, his will was ignored and the kingdom was annexed. Boudica was flogged, her daughters [[wartime sexual violence|raped]], and Roman financiers called in their loans.

In AD 60 or 61, when the [[Governors of Roman Britain|Roman governor]] [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]] was campaigning on the island of [[Anglesey]] off the northwest coast of [[Wales]], Boudica led the Iceni, the [[Trinovantes]] and others in revolt.<ref name="hingleyunwin">{{cite book |authors=Richard Hingley and Christina Unwin |title=Boudica: Iron Age Warrior Queen |publisher=Hambledon Continuum |edition=New Edition |date=15 June 2006 |isbn=978-1-85285-516-1 |pages=44 and 61 }}</ref> They destroyed {{lang|la|[[Camulodunum]]}} (modern [[Colchester]]), earlier the capital of the [[Trinovantes]] but at that time a ''{{lang|la|[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]}}'', a settlement for discharged Roman soldiers, and site of a temple to the former Emperor [[Claudius]]. Upon hearing of the revolt, Suetonius hurried to {{lang|la|[[Londinium]]}} (modern [[London]]), the twenty-year-old commercial settlement that was the rebels' next target.

The Romans, having concluded that they did not have the numbers to defend the settlement, evacuated and abandoned {{lang|la|Londinium}}.

The crisis caused the Emperor [[Nero]] to consider withdrawing all Roman forces from Britain, but Suetonius's eventual victory over Boudica confirmed Roman control of the province. Boudica then either killed herself so she would not be captured, or fell ill and died.

However, the absence of native British literature during the early part of the first millennium means that knowledge of Boudica's rebellion comes solely from the writings of the Romans.

==History==

===Boudica's name===
Boudica has been known by several versions of her name. [[Raphael Holinshed]] calls her '''Voadicia''', while [[Edmund Spenser]] calls her '''Bunduca''', a version of the name that was used in the popular Jacobean play ''[[Bonduca]]'', in 1612.<ref name="Bonduca">[[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], ''[http://www.bibliomania.com/0/6/1/1975/frameset.html Bonduca]''</ref> [[William Cowper]]'s poem, ''Boadicea, an ode'' (1782) popularised an alternative version of the name.<ref name="Boadicea, an ode">[[William Cowper]], ''[http://www.bartleby.com/41/320.html Boadicea, an ode]''</ref> From the 19th century and much of the late 20th century, '''Boadicea''' was the most common version of the name, which is probably derived from a mistranscription when a manuscript of [[Tacitus]] was copied in the [[Middle Ages]].

Her name was clearly spelled '''Boudicca''' in the best manuscripts of Tacitus, but also {{lang|grc|Βουδουικα}}, {{lang|grc|Βουνδουικα}}, and {{lang|grc|Βοδουικα}} in the (later and probably secondary) [[epitome]] of [[Cassius Dio]]. The name is attested in inscriptions as '''Boudica''' in [[Lusitania]], '''Boudiga''' in [[Bordeaux]], and '''Bodicca''' in [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Graham Webster |title=Boudica: The British Revolt against Rome AD 60 |year=1978 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Guy de la Bédoyère]] |url=http://www.romanbritain.freeserve.co.uk/Legions.htm |title=The Roman Army in Britain |accessdate=5 July 2005 }}</ref>

[[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]] concludes, based on later development of Welsh and Irish, that the name derives from the [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] feminine adjective ''*boudīkā'', "victorious", that in turn is derived from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word ''*boudā'', "victory" (cf. [[Irish language|Irish]] ''{{lang|ga|bua}}'' (Classical Irish ''{{lang|ghc|buadh}}''), ''Buaidheach'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''{{lang|cy|buddugoliaeth}}''), and that the correct spelling of the name in [[Common Brittonic]] (the British Celtic language) is ''Boudica'', pronounced {{IPA-cel|bɒʊˈdiːkaː|}}.

The closest English equivalent to the vowel in the first syllable is the ''ow'' in "bow-and-arrow".<ref>{{cite journal| author=[[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]] |title=Queen Boudica? |journal=Britannia |volume=10 |year=1979 |page=255 |doi=10.2307/526060 }}</ref> The modern English pronunciation is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|uː|d|ɪ|k|ə}},<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Boudicca Boudicca]. Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. (Retrieved 20 December 2007).</ref> and it has been suggested that the most comparable English name, in meaning only, would be "Victoria".<ref>{{cite book |author=Sir John Rhys |year=1908 |publisher=General Literature Committee: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (Great Britain) |title=Early Britain, Celtic Britain |page=284 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VLpCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA284&dq=Boudica&hl=en&ei=AAteTIuGMcG78gaQp-i9DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Boudica&f=false }}</ref>

===Background===
[[File:Map of the Territory of the Iceni.svg|thumb|Location of [[Iceni|Iceni territory]] within England, Wales and Man; modern county borders for England and pre-1996 borders for Wales are shown for context.]]

Tacitus and Dio agree that Boudica was of [[royal family|royal]] descent. Dio describes her as "possessed of greater intelligence than often belongs to women." He also describes her as tall, with [[tawny (color)|tawny]] hair hanging down to below her waist, a harsh voice and a piercing glare. He notes that she habitually wore a large golden necklace (perhaps a [[torc]]), a colourful tunic, and a thick cloak fastened by a [[brooch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.academia.edu/548341/Boudica_Cartimandua_Messalina_and_Agrippina_the_Younger._Independent_Women_of_Power_and_the_Gendered_Rhetoric_of_Roman_History |title=Boudica, Cartimandua, Messalina and Agrippina the Younger. Independent Women of Power and the Gendered Rhetoric of Roman History |author=Peter Keegan |work=academia.edu }}</ref><ref>The term ''{{lang|grc-Latn|xanthotrichos}}'' translated in this passage as red–brown or tawny can also mean auburn, or a shade ''short'' of brown, but most translators now agree a colour in between light and browny red — '''tawny''' — {{cite book |title=Boudica and her stories: narrative transformations of a warrior queen |author=Carolyn D. Williams |publisher=University of Delaware Press |year=2009 |page=62 }}</ref>

Her husband [[Prasutagus]] was the king of the [[Iceni]], the people who inhabited roughly what is now [[Norfolk]]. They initially were not part of the territory under direct Roman control, having voluntarily allied themselves to Rome following [[Claudius]]'s [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest]] of AD 43. They were proud of their independence, and had revolted in AD 47 when the then-governor [[Publius Ostorius Scapula]] threatened to disarm them.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+12.31 12:31-32]</ref> Prasutagus had lived a long life of conspicuous wealth and, hoping to preserve his line, made the [[Roman emperor]] co-heir to his kingdom, along with his wife and two daughters.

It was normal Roman practice to allow allied kingdoms their independence only for the lifetime of their [[client king]], who would then agree to leave his kingdom to Rome in his will. For example, the provinces of [[Bithynia]]<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Howard Hayes Scullard]] |title=From the Gracchi to Nero |year=1982 |page=90 }}</ref> and [[Galatia]]<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Morris |title=Londinium: London in the Roman Empire |year=1982 |pages=107–108 }}</ref> were incorporated into the Empire in just this way. [[Roman law]] also allowed [[inheritance]] only through the male line, so when Prasutagus died, his attempts to preserve his line were ignored and his kingdom was annexed as if it had been conquered. His lands and property were confiscated and nobles treated like slaves. According to [[Tacitus]], Boudica was flogged and her daughters were raped. Cassius Dio says that Roman financiers, including [[Seneca the Younger]], chose this time to call in their loans. Tacitus does not mention this, but does single out the Roman [[promagistrate|procurator]] [[Catus Decianus]] for criticism for his "avarice".

===Boudica's uprising===
In AD 60 or 61, while the current governor, [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], was leading a campaign against the island of {{lang|la|Mona}} (modern [[Anglesey]]) in the north of Wales, which was a refuge for British rebels and a stronghold of the [[druid]]s, the Iceni conspired with their neighbours the Trinovantes, amongst others, to revolt. Boudica was chosen as their leader. According to Tacitus, they drew inspiration from the example of [[Arminius]], the prince of the [[Cherusci]] who had driven the Romans out of Germany in AD 9, and their own ancestors who had driven [[Julius Caesar]] from Britain.<ref>Tacitus, ''{{lang|la|Agricola}}'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#15|15]]</ref> Dio says that at the outset Boudica employed a form of [[divination]], releasing a [[hare]] from the folds of her dress and interpreting the direction in which it ran, and invoked [[Andraste]], a British [[goddess]] of [[Victoria (mythology)|victory]].

The rebels' first target was {{lang|la|[[Camulodunum#Iceni Revolt|Camulodunum]]}} ([[Colchester]]), the former Trinovantian capital and, at that time, a Roman ''{{lang|la|[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]}}''. The Roman veterans who had been settled there mistreated the locals and a temple to the former emperor [[Claudius]] had been erected there at local expense, making the city a focus for resentment. The Roman inhabitants sought reinforcements from the procurator, Catus Decianus, but he sent only two hundred [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]]. Boudica's army fell on the poorly defended city and destroyed it, besieging the last defenders in the temple for two days before it fell. [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] have shown that the city was methodically demolished.<ref>{{cite news |author=Jason Burke |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,406152,00.html |title=Dig uncovers Boudicca's brutal streak |work=[[The Observer]] |date=3 December 2000 }}</ref> The future governor [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]], then commanding the [[Legio IX Hispana|Legio IX ''Hispana'']], attempted to relieve the city, but suffered an [[Massacre of the Ninth Legion|overwhelming defeat]]. His infantry was wiped out—only the commander and some of his cavalry escaped. The location of this famous destruction of the {{lang|la|Legio IX}} is now claimed by some to be the village of [[Great Wratting]], in Suffolk, which lies in the Stour Valley on the Icknield Way West of Colchester, and by a village in Essex.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Haverhill From the Iron Age to 1899 |url=http://www.stedmundsbury.gov.uk/sebc/visit/hh-to-1899.cfm |publisher=St. Edmundsbury Borough Council }}</ref> After this defeat, Catus Decianus fled to [[Gaul]].

When news of the rebellion reached him, Suetonius hurried along [[Watling Street]] through hostile territory to {{lang|la|Londinium}}. {{lang|la|Londinium}} was a relatively new settlement, founded after the conquest of AD 43, but it had grown to be a thriving commercial centre with a population of travellers, traders, and, probably, Roman officials. Suetonius considered giving battle there, but considering his lack of numbers and chastened by Petillius's defeat, decided to sacrifice the city to save the province.

<blockquote>Alarmed by this disaster and by the fury of the province which he had goaded into war by his rapacity, the procurator Catus crossed over into Gaul. Suetonius, however, with wonderful resolution, marched amidst a hostile population to Londinium, which, though undistinguished by the name of a colony, was much frequented by a number of merchants and trading vessels. Uncertain whether he should choose it as a seat of war, as he looked round on his scanty force of soldiers, and remembered with what a serious warning the rashness of Petilius had been punished, he resolved to save the province at the cost of a single town. Nor did the tears and weeping of the people, as they implored his aid, deter him from giving the signal of departure and receiving into his army all who would go with him. Those who were chained to the spot by the weakness of their sex, or the infirmity of age, or the attractions of the place, were cut off by the enemy. <small>— Tacitus</small><ref name="TAnn14.33" /></blockquote>

Londinium was abandoned to the rebels who burnt it down, slaughtering anyone who had not evacuated with Suetonius. Archaeology shows a thick red layer of burnt debris covering coins and pottery dating before AD 60 within the bounds of Roman Londinium;<ref>{{cite book |author=George Patrick Welch |title=Britannia: The Roman Conquest & Occupation of Britain |year=1963 |page=107 }}</ref> whilst Roman-era skulls found in the [[Walbrook]] in 2013 were potentially linked to victims of the rebels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/02/roman-skulls-crossrail-london-boudicca|title=Roman skulls found during Crossrail dig in London may be Boudicca victims |author=Maev Kennedy |work=[[The Guardian]] }}</ref> {{lang|la|[[Verulamium]]}} ([[St Albans]]) was next to be destroyed.

In the three settlements destroyed, between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed. Tacitus says that the Britons had no interest in taking or selling prisoners, only in slaughter by [[gibbet]], fire, or cross. Dio's account gives more detail; that the noblest women were impaled on spikes and had their breasts cut off and sewn to their mouths, "to the accompaniment of sacrifices, banquets, and wanton behaviour" in sacred places, particularly the groves of Andraste.

{{See also|Battle of Watling Street}}

While Boudica's army continued their assault in Verulamium (St. Albans), Suetonius regrouped his forces. According to Tacitus, he amassed a force including his own [[Legio XIV Gemina|Legio XIV ''Gemina'']], some ''vexillationes'' (detachments) of the [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX ''Valeria Victrix'']], and any available auxiliaries.<ref name="TacAnn14.34">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.34 14.34]</ref> The [[prefect]] of {{lang|la|[[Legio II Augusta|Legio II ''Augusta'']]}}, [[Poenius Postumus]], stationed near [[Exeter]], ignored the call,<ref name="TacAnn14.37">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.37 14.37]</ref> and a fourth legion, {{lang|la|[[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Hispana'']]}}, had been routed trying to relieve {{lang|la|Camulodunum}},<ref name="TacAnn14.32">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.32 14.32]</ref> but nonetheless the governor was able to call on almost ten thousand men.

Suetonius took a stand at an unidentified location, probably in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] somewhere along the [[Roman road]] now known as [[Watling Street]], in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] with a wood behind him&nbsp;— but his men were heavily outnumbered. Dio says that, even if they were lined up one deep, they would not have extended the length of Boudica's line. By now the rebel forces were said to have numbered 230,000, however, this number should be treated with scepticism&nbsp;— Dio's account is known only from a late [[epitome]], and ancient sources commonly exaggerate enemy numbers.

Boudica exhorted her troops from her [[chariot]], her daughters beside her. Tacitus gives her a short speech in which she presents herself not as an [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] avenging her lost wealth, but as an ordinary person, avenging her lost freedom, her battered body, and the abused chastity of her daughters. She said their cause was just, and the deities were on their side; the one legion that had dared to face them had been destroyed. She, a woman, was resolved to win or die; if the men wanted to live in slavery, that was their choice.

However, the lack of manoeuvrability of the British forces, combined with lack of open-field tactics to command these numbers, put them at a disadvantage to the Romans, who were skilled at open combat due to their superior equipment and discipline. Also, the narrowness of the field meant that Boudica could put forth only as many troops as the Romans could at a given time.

First, the Romans stood their ground and used volleys of ''{{lang|la|[[pilum|pila]]}}'' (heavy javelins) to kill thousands of Britons who were rushing toward the Roman lines. The Roman soldiers, who had now used up their ''{{lang|la|pila}}'', were then able to engage Boudica's second wave in the open. As the Romans advanced in a [[flying wedge|wedge]] formation, the Britons attempted to flee, but were impeded by the presence of their own families, whom they had stationed in a ring of wagons at the edge of the battlefield, and were slaughtered. This is not the first instance of this tactic — the women of the [[Cimbri]], in the [[Battle of Vercellae]] against [[Gaius Marius]], were stationed in a line of wagons and acted as a last line of defence.<ref>[[Florus]], ''Epitome of Roman History'' [[Wikisource:Epitome of Roman History/Book 1#38|1.38]]</ref> [[Ariovistus]] of the [[Suebi]] is reported to have done the same thing in his battle against [[Julius Caesar]].<ref>[[Julius Caesar]], ''{{lang|la|[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]}}'' [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book1#51|1.51]]</ref> Tacitus reports that "according to one report almost eighty thousand Britons fell" compared with only four hundred Romans.

[[File:Boudicca Statue.png|thumb||<center>''Boadicea'', front view [[Thomas Thornycroft]]</center>]]
According to Tacitus in his ''Annals'', Boudica poisoned herself, though in the ''{{lang|la|Agricola}}'' which was written almost twenty years prior he mentions nothing of suicide and attributes the end of the revolt to ''{{lang|la|socordia}}'' ("indolence"); Dio says she fell sick and died and then was given a lavish burial; though this may be a convenient way to remove her from the story. Considering Dio must have read Tacitus, it is worth noting he mentions nothing about suicide (which was also how Postumus and Nero ended their lives).

Postumus, on hearing of the Roman victory, fell on his sword. [[Catus Decianus]], who had fled to Gaul, was replaced by [[Gaius Julius Alpinus Classicianus]]. Suetonius conducted punitive operations, but criticism by Classicianus led to an investigation headed by [[Nero]]'s [[freedman]] [[Polyclitus (freedman)|Polyclitus]]. Fearing Suetonius's actions would provoke further rebellion, Nero replaced the governor with the more conciliatory [[Publius Petronius Turpilianus]].<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#39|14.39]]</ref> The historian  [[Suetonius|Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus]] tells us the crisis had almost persuaded Nero to abandon Britain.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''Nero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#18 18], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#39 39-40]</ref>

===Location of her defeat===
The location of Boudica's defeat is unknown. Most historians{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} favour a site in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], somewhere along the Roman road now known as [[Watling Street]]. Kevin K. Carroll suggests a site close to [[High Cross, Leicestershire|High Cross]] in [[Leicestershire]], on the junction of Watling Street and the [[Fosse Way]], which would have allowed the {{lang|la|[[Legio II Augusta|Legio II ''Augusta'']]}}, based at [[Exeter]], to rendezvous with the rest of Suetonius's forces, had they not failed to do so.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kevin K.

===Historical sources===
Tacitus, the most important Roman historian of this period, took a particular interest in Britain as his father-in-law [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] served there three times (and was the subject of his first book). Agricola was a military tribune under Suetonius Paulinus, which almost certainly gave Tacitus an eyewitness source for Boudica's revolt. Cassius Dio's account is only known from an [[epitome]], and his sources are uncertain. He is generally agreed to have based his account on that of Tacitus, but he simplifies the sequence of events and adds details, such as the calling in of loans, that Tacitus does not mention.

[[Gildas]], in his 6th century ''{{lang|la|[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]}}'', may have been alluding to Boudica when he wrote "A treacherous lioness butchered the governors who had been left to give fuller voice and strength to the endeavours of Roman rule".<ref name="hingleyunwin"/>

==Cultural depictions==

===History and literature===
By the [[Middle Ages]] Boudica was forgotten. She makes no appearance in [[Bede]]'s work, the ''{{lang|la|[[Historia Brittonum]]}}'', the ''{{lang|cy|[[Mabinogion]]}}'' or [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]''. But the rediscovery of the works of Tacitus during the Renaissance allowed [[Polydore Vergil]] to reintroduce her into British history as "Voadicea" in 1534.<ref>{{cite book |title=Polydore Vergil's English History, Book 2 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hSAIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA59 |pages=69–72 }}</ref> Raphael Holinshed also included her story in his ''Chronicles'' (1577), based on Tacitus and Dio,<ref>[[Raphael Holinshed]], ''Chronicles'': History of England [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16536/16536-h/16536-h.htm#page494 4.9-13]</ref> and inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] younger contemporaries [[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] to write a play, ''[[Bonduca]]'', in 1610.<ref name="Bonduca"/> [[William Cowper]] wrote a popular poem, "Boadicea, an ode", in 1782.<ref name="Boadicea, an ode"/>

It was in the [[Victorian era]] that Boudica's fame took on legendary proportions as [[Queen Victoria]] came to be seen as Boudica's "namesake", their names being identical in meaning. Victoria's [[Poet Laureate]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], wrote a poem, "Boadicea", and several ships were named [[HMS Boadicea|after her]].<ref>[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], ''[http://oldpoetry.com/opoem/8721-Alfred-Lord-Tennyson-Boadicea Boadicea]''</ref>

A statue of [[Boadicea and Her Daughters|Boudica with her daughters]] in her [[war chariot]] (ahistorically furnished with [[scythed chariot|scythes]] after the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] fashion) was executed by [[Thomas Thornycroft]] over the 1850s and 1860s with the encouragement of [[Prince Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], who lent his horses for the model.<ref>{{cite book |title=Images of Women in Peace & War: Cross-Cultural & Historical Perspectives |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SCUbpgTPeOgC&pg=PA53 |p=53 |publisher=Macmillan Press |date=1987 |location=London |chapter=Boadicea: Warrior, Mother, and Myth |last=Macdonald |first=Sharon| isbn=0-299-11764-2 }}</ref> Thornycroft exhibited the head separately in 1864. It was cast in bronze in 1902, 17 years after Thornycroft's death, by his son [[John Isaac Thornycroft|Sir John]], who presented it to the [[London County Council]]. They erected it on a plinth on the [[Victoria Embankment]] next to [[Westminster Bridge]] and the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]], inscribed with the following lines from Cowper's poem:

<blockquote><poem>
Regions Caesar never knew
Thy posterity shall sway.

===Boudica and King's Cross===
The area of [[King's Cross, London]] was previously a village known as Battle Bridge which was an ancient crossing of the [[River Fleet]]. The original name of the bridge was Broad Ford Bridge.

The name "Battle Bridge" led to a tradition that this was the site of a major battle between the Romans and the Iceni tribe led by Boudica.<ref name="thornbury">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45097 |title=Highbury, Upper Holloway and King's Cross |work=Old and New London: Volume 2 |author=Walter Thornbury |authorlink=George Walter Thornbury |year=1878 |pages=273–279 |accessdate=11 November 2010 |publisher=British History Online }}</ref> The tradition is not supported by any historical evidence and is rejected by modern historians. However, [[Lewis Spence]]'s 1937 book ''Boadicea — warrior queen of the Britons'' went so far as to include a map showing the positions of the opposing armies. There is a belief that she was buried between platforms 9 and 10 in [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] in London, England. There is no evidence for this and it is probably a post-[[World War II]] invention.<ref>{{cite web |title=The "Warrior Queen" under Platform 9 |url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Learning/Learningonline/features/roman/roman_london_7.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090301192533/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Learning/Learningonline/features/roman/roman_london_7.htm |publisher= Museum of London |archivedate=1 March 2009 |accessdate=13 August 2011 }}</ref>
