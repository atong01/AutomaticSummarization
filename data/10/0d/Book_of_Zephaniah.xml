King<space/><link><target>Josiah</target></link><space/>ruled over<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Judah</target><part>Judah</part></link><space/>from approximately 640609 BC. Some scholars believe that the picture of<space/><link><target>Jerusalem</target></link><space/>which Zephaniah gives indicates that he was active prior to the religious reforms of King Josiah which are described in 2<space/><link><target>Books of Kings</target><part>Kings</part></link><space/>23. These reforms took place in 622 BC. Scholars<template><target>Who</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template><space/>also cite the reference to &quot;the officials and the kings sons . . .&quot; in 1:8 as evidence that the kingdom was still ruled by a regent for Josiah.

Either way, the primary purpose of the books composition was to alter the behaviour (particularly religious behaviour) of the authors contemporary Jerusalemites.<template><target>OR</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>If the book of Zephaniah was largely composed during the monarchic period, the author of the book of Zephaniah attempts to accomplish this change in behaviour through the threat of future calamity for &quot;those who have turned back from following the Lord, / who have not sought the Lord or inquired of him&quot; (1:6). The author conceives of a date in the future the great day of the Lord when<space/><link><target>Tetragrammaton</target><part>the Lord</part></link><space/>will judge all the people of the earth. This coming judgment will affect all of the nations, including the authors own nation of<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Judah</target><part>Judah</part></link><space/>where God is understood to reside. The threats made against<space/><link><target>Jerusalem</target></link>, however, are much more specific than the oracles concerning foreign nations. This strengthened the belief that the Israelites, who understood themselves to be Gods chosen people, were even more culpable than other peoples for not living up to Gods statutes because they were to be a light unto the nations. The book concludes by extending a promise of deliverance to the remnant of<space/><link><target>Israel</target></link><space/>which remains. The fulfilment of this prophecy is commonly understood to have taken place when Judah was captured by the nation of<space/><link><target>Babylon</target></link><space/>and many of its inhabitants were exiled in an event known as the<space/><link><target>Babylonian captivity</target></link>.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>If the book gained most of its present form in post-monarchic period, then the author likely intended to draw upon an understanding of the<space/><link><target>Babylonian captivity</target></link><space/>as a punishment from the Lord, urging his own contemporaries not to repeat the mistakes of the past. It is not known whether the religious syncretism, alluded to in chapter one (as in verse 5), was a significant issue in post-exilic<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Judah</target><part>Judah</part></link>.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Themes</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Sophonie s'adressant au peuple.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part>Zephaniah addressing people (French bible, 16th century).</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The book of Zephaniah consists of three chapters in the<space/><link><target>Hebrew language</target><part>Hebrew</part></link><space/><link><target>Masoretic Text</target></link>.

Zephaniah includes one of the most vivid descriptions in the prophetic literature of Gods wrath. Yet, it is also unequivocal in its proclamation of a restoration for those who survive the<space/><link><target>Last Judgement</target><part>Great Day of the Lord'</part></link>.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The book of Zephaniah incorporates a good deal of phrases and terminology which are found in other books of the Bible. This suggests that the author of Zephaniah was familiar with and drew upon earlier Israelite religious tradition and also that later biblical writers regarded the book of Zephaniah as an authoritative (or at least respectable) work in the prophetic corpus.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The book of Zephaniah draws upon several themes from the<space/><link><target>Book of Genesis</target></link><space/>and reverses them. The opening verses of the book of Zephaniah are reminiscent both of the creation and of<space/><link><target>Noah</target></link>s flood. Chapter 1:23 declare that &quot;I will sweep away everything / from the face of the earth says the Lord. / I will sweep away humans and animals; I will sweep away the birds of the air / and the fish of the sea.&quot; The order of the creatures to be destroyed in Zephaniah is the opposite of the order in which they are created in Genesis 1:2027. It is also worth noting that in both Noahs flood and Zephaniahs<space/><link><target>Last Judgement</target><part>Day of the Lord</part></link>, a remnant survives Gods wrath.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>It is also not surprising that the book of Zephaniah bears marked similarities to the book of<space/><link><target>Deuteronomy</target></link><space/>and the Deuteronomistic history. Similarities might be expected to each of these works because the Deuteronomistic history covers an overlapping period of time and because the issues which are dealt with in the book of Zephaniah go straight to the heart of the covenant which is reaffirmed in the book of Deuteronomy before Israel enters into the<space/><link><target>Promised Land</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Canaan</target></link>. The first 34 of the<space/><link><target>Ten Commandments</target></link><space/>(or Ten Words, Decalogue) contained in Exodus 20:117 and Deuteronomy 5:122 directly concern Israels relationship with<space/><link><target>Yahweh</target></link>. It is this integral component of the covenant between<space/><link><target>Tetragrammaton</target><part>Yahweh</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Israel</target></link><space/>which is threatened by the practices to which the author of the book of Zephaniah refers in 1:46. In this manner, Zephaniah invokes one of the most common themes, not only in prophetic literature, but in the whole of the<space/><link><target>Hebrew Bible</target><part>Hebrew Scriptures</part></link>.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Zephaniah also draws upon the emerging idea that<space/><link><target>Tetragrammaton</target><part>Yahweh</part></link><space/>is quite different from the regional or tribal gods of the surrounding nations. Rather,<space/><link><target>Tetragrammaton</target><part>Yahweh</part></link><space/>is beginning to be understood as the only God and the God who rules over all nations. It was an apparently unique belief in the ancient<space/><link><target>Middle East</target></link><space/>that a god could send a foreign nation to execute that gods judgment (as the Israelites believed<space/><link><target>Tetragrammaton</target><part>Yahweh</part></link><space/>did with<space/><link><target>Babylon</target></link>). In the book of Zephaniah, all nations are portrayed as being subject to<space/><link><target>Tetragrammaton</target><part>Yahweh</part></link>s divine judgment.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The book of Zephaniah also interacts with the prophetic tradition both borrowing from and contributing to the corpus in terms of language and images.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>refimprove</target><arg name="date">September 2015</arg></template><template><target>reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Further reading</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem>Berlin, Adele.<space/><italics>Zephaniah: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary</italics>.
