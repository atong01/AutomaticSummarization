'''Erasmus Alberus''' (c. 1500&ndash;1553), [[Humanism in Germany|German humanist]], [[reform movement|reformer]], and [[poet]].

==Life==
He was born in the village of [[Bruchenbr√ºcken]] (now part of [[Friedberg, Hesse]]) about the year 1500. Although his father Tilemann Alber was a schoolmaster, his early education was neglected. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Ultimately in 1518 he found his way to the [[University of Wittenberg]], where he studied theology. He had the good fortune to attract the attention of [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philipp Melanchthon]], and subsequently became one of Luther's most active helpers in the [[Protestant Reformation]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Not only did he fight for the Protestant cause as a preacher and theologian, but he was almost the only member of Luther's party who was able to confront the [[Roman Catholics]] with the weapon of literary [[satire]]. In 1542 he published a prose satire to which Luther wrote the preface, ''Der Barfusser Monche Eulenspiegel und Alkoran,'' a parodic adaptation of the ''Liber conformitatum'' of the Franciscan [[Bartolommeo Rinonico]] of [[Pisa]], in which the [[Franciscan]] order is held up to ridicule.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Of higher literary value is the didactic and satirical ''Buch von der Tugend und Weisheit'' (1550), a collection of forty-nine fables in which Alberus embodies his views on the relations of [[Church and state in medieval Europe|Church and State]]. His satire is incisive, but in a scholarly and humanistic way; it does not appeal to popular passions with the fierce directness which enabled the master of [[Catholic]] satire, [[Thomas Murner]], to inflict such telling blows.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Several of Alberus's hymns, all of which show the influence of his master Luther, have been retained in the German Protestant hymnal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After Luther's death, Alberus was for a time a deacon in [[Wittenberg]]; he became involved, however, in the political conflicts of the time, and was in [[Magdeburg]] in 1550-1551, while that town was besieged by [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony]]. In 1552 he was appointed Generalsuperintendent at [[Neubrandenburg]] in [[Mecklenburg]],<ref name=H.E.J>Henry Eyster Jacobs, [http://books.google.com/books?id=93ErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA6&vq Lutheran Cyclopedia] p. 6, Alberus, Erasmus</ref> where he died on the 5 May 1553.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
