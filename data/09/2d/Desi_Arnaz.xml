His co-star was his real-life wife,<space/><link><target>Lucille Ball</target></link>, who played Ricky's wife, Lucy. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series<space/><italics><link><target>My Favorite Husband</target></link></italics><space/>for television.

Much of the material from their vaudeville act, including Lucy's memorable seal routine, was used in the pilot episode of<space/><italics>I Love Lucy</italics>.

The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show.

Arnaz convinced them to allow Desilu to cover all additional costs associated with filming, under the stipulation that Desilu owned and controlled all rights to the film.</paragraph><paragraph>Arnaz also pushed the network to allow them to show Lucille Ball while she was pregnant. According to Arnaz,<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">March 2015</arg></template><space/>the<space/><link><target>CBS</target></link><space/>network told him, &quot;You cannot show a pregnant woman on television&quot;.

The network finally relented and let Arnaz and Ball weave the pregnancy into the story line, but remained adamant about eschewing use of<space/><italics>pregnant</italics>, so Arnaz substituted<space/><italics>expecting</italics>, pronouncing it<space/><italics><space/>'spectin'<space/></italics><space/>in his Cuban accent. Oddly, the official titles of two of the series' episodes employed the word<space/><italics>pregnant</italics>: &quot;Lucy Is<space/><italics>Enceinte</italics>&quot;, employing the French word for pregnant, and &quot;Pregnant Women Are Unpredictable&quot;, although the episode titles never appeared on the show itself.<template><target>Citation needed</target><arg name="date">February 2014</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In addition to<space/><italics>I Love Lucy</italics>, he executive produced<space/><italics><link><target>The Ann Sothern Show</target></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Those Whiting Girls</target></link></italics><space/>(starring<space/><link><target>Margaret Whiting</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Barbara Whiting Smith</target></link>) and was also involved in several other series such as<space/><italics><link><target>The Untouchables (1959 TV series)</target><part>The Untouchables</part></link></italics>,<space/><italics><link><target>Whirlybirds</target></link></italics>, and<space/><italics><link><target>Sheriff of Cochise</target></link></italics>/<italics>United States Marshal</italics>.
