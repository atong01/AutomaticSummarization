</arg></template><bold>Charles Mingus Jr.</bold><space/>(April 22, 1922 January 5, 1979) was a highly influential American<space/><link><target>jazz</target></link><space/><link><target>double bassist</target></link>, composer and bandleader. His compositions retained the hot and soulful feel of<space/><link><target>hard bop</target></link><space/>and drew heavily from black<space/><link><target>gospel music</target></link><space/>and blues while sometimes drawing on elements of<space/><link><target>Third Stream</target></link>,<space/><link><target>free jazz</target></link>, and classical music. Yet Mingus avoided categorization, forging his own brand of music that fused tradition with unique and unexplored realms of jazz. He once cited<space/><link><target>Duke Ellington</target></link><space/>and church as his main influences.</paragraph><paragraph>Mingus focused on collective improvisation, similar to the old New Orleans jazz parades, paying particular attention to how each band member interacted with the group as a whole. In creating his bands, he looked not only at the skills of the available musicians, but also their personalities. Many musicians passed through his bands and later went on to impressive careers. He recruited talented and sometimes little-known artists, whom he utilized to assemble unconventional instrumental configurations. As a performer, Mingus was a pioneer in double bass technique, widely recognized as one of the instrument's most proficient players.</paragraph><paragraph>Nearly as well known as his ambitious music was Mingus's often fearsome temperament, which earned him the nickname &quot;The Angry Man of Jazz&quot;. His refusal to compromise his musical integrity led to many onstage eruptions, exhortations to musicians, and dismissals.<extension extension_name='ref'>Jon Pareles,<space/><link type='external' href='http://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/23/arts/an-irrepressible-65-mingus-concert.html?&amp;amp;pagewanted=all'>&quot;An irrepressible '65 Mingus concert&quot;</link>,<space/><italics>The New York Times</italics>, September 23, 1984.</extension><space/>Because of his brilliant writing for midsize ensembles, and his catering to and emphasizing the strengths of the musicians in his groups, Mingus is often considered the heir of<space/><link><target>Duke Ellington</target></link>, for whom he expressed great admiration.

Charles Mingus Sr. claims to have been raised by his mother and her husband as a white person until he was fourteen, when his mother revealed to her family that the child's true father was a black slave, after which he had to run away from his family and live on his own. The autobiography doesn't confirm whether Charles Mingus Sr. or Mingus himself believed this story was true, or whether it was merely an embellished version of the Mingus family's lineage.<extension extension_name='ref' name="autogenerated1991">Mingus, Charles:<space/><italics>Beneath the Underdog: His Life as Composed by Mingus</italics>.

He studied trombone, and later cello, although he was unable to follow the cello professionally because, at the time, it was nearly impossible for a black musician to make a career of classical music, and the cello was not yet accepted as a jazz instrument. Despite this, Mingus was still attached to the cello; as he studied bass with Red Callender in the late 1930s, Callender even commented that the cello was still Mingus's main instrument. In<space/><italics>Beneath the Underdog</italics>, Mingus states that he did not actually start learning bass until Buddy Collette accepted him into his swing band under the stipulation that he be the band's bass player.<extension extension_name='ref' name="autogenerated1991"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Due to a poor education, the young Mingus could not read musical notation quickly enough to join the local youth orchestra. This had a serious impact on his early musical experiences, leaving him feeling ostracized from the classical music world. These early experiences, in addition to his lifelong confrontations with racism, were reflected in his music, which often focused on themes of racism, discrimination and justice.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Horton"><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="author">Horton, Ernest Aaron</arg><arg name="title">Charles Mingus and the Paradoxical Aspects of Race as Reflected in His Life and Music</arg><arg name="date">2007</arg><arg name="url">http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-04072007-140228/unrestricted/ERonHortonDissertation.pdf</arg><arg name="publisher">Doctoral dissertation, University of Pittsburgh</arg><arg name="accessdate">October 11, 2011</arg></template></extension><space/>Much of the cello technique he learned was applicable to<space/><link><target>double bass</target></link><space/>when he took up the instrument in high school.

A popular trio of Mingus,<space/><link><target>Red Norvo</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Tal Farlow</target></link><space/>in 1950 and 1951 received considerable acclaim, but Mingus's race caused problems with club owners and he left the group. Mingus was briefly a member of Ellington's band in 1953, as a substitute for bassist<space/><link><target>Wendell Marshall</target></link>.

Mingus considered Parker the greatest genius and innovator in jazz history, but he had a love-hate relationship with Parker's legacy. Mingus blamed the Parker mythology for a derivative crop of pretenders to Parker's throne. He was also conflicted and sometimes disgusted by Parker's self-destructive habits and the romanticized lure of drug addiction they offered to other jazz musicians. In response to the many sax players who imitated Parker, Mingus titled a song, &quot;If<space/><link><target>Charlie Parker</target></link><space/>were a Gunslinger, There'd be a Whole Lot of Dead Copycats&quot; (released on<space/><italics><link><target>Mingus Dynasty</target></link></italics><space/>as &quot;Gunslinging Bird&quot;).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Based in New York</heading><paragraph>In 1952 Mingus co-founded<space/><link><target>Debut Records</target></link><space/>with<space/><link><target>Max Roach</target></link><space/>so he could conduct his recording career as he saw fit. The name originated from his desire to document unrecorded young musicians. Despite this, the best-known recording the company issued was of the most prominent figures in bebop. On May 15, 1953, Mingus joined<space/><link><target>Dizzy Gillespie</target></link>, Parker,<space/><link><target>Bud Powell</target></link>, and Roach for a concert at<space/><link><target>Massey Hall</target></link><space/>in Toronto, which is the<space/><link><target>Jazz at Massey Hall</target><part>last recorded documentation</part></link><space/>of the two lead instrumentalists playing together. After the event, Mingus chose to overdub his barely audible bass part back in New York; the original version was issued later. The two 10&quot; albums of the Massey Hall concert (one featured the trio of Powell, Mingus and Roach) were among Debut Records' earliest releases. Mingus may have objected to the way the major record companies treated musicians, but Gillespie once commented that he did not receive any royalties &quot;for years and years&quot; for his Massey Hall appearance. The records though, are often regarded as among the finest live jazz recordings.</paragraph><paragraph>One story has it that Mingus was involved in a notorious incident while playing a 1955 club date billed as a &quot;reunion&quot; with Parker, Powell, and Roach. Powell, who suffered from alcoholism and mental illness (possibly exacerbated by a severe police beating and electroshock treatments), had to be helped from the stage, unable to play or speak coherently. As Powell's incapacitation became apparent, Parker stood in one spot at a microphone, chanting &quot;Bud Powell...Bud Powell...&quot; as if beseeching Powell's return. Allegedly, Parker continued this incantation for several minutes after Powell's departure, to his own amusement and Mingus's exasperation. Mingus took another microphone and announced to the crowd, &quot;Ladies and Gentleman, please don't associate me with any of this. This is not jazz. These are sick people.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Santoro, Gene. Myself When I Am Real: The Life and Music of Charles Mingus. New York: Oxford UP, 2000.

He claims to have had more than 31 affairs in the course of his life (including 26 prostitutes in one sitting). This does not include any of his five wives (he claims to have been married to two of them simultaneously). In addition, he asserts that he held a brief career as a pimp.
