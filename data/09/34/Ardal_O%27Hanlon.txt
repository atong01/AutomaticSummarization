'''Ardal O'Hanlon''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|h|æ|n|l|ə|n}}; born 8 October 1965) is an Irish comedian and actor.  He played [[Father Dougal McGuire]] in ''[[Father Ted]]'' and George Sunday in ''[[My Hero (UK TV series)|My Hero]]''.

==Biography==

===Early life===
O'Hanlon was born in 1965 in [[Carrickmacross]], [[County Monaghan]], Ireland, the son of [[Rory O'Hanlon]], an Irish politician and doctor, and has five siblings. RTÉ's ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (Irish TV series)|Who do you think you are?]]'' programme on Monday 6 October 2008 examined Ardal's family tree. He discovered that his paternal grandfather, Michael O'Hanlon, a [[University College Dublin|UCD]] medicine student, had joined the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]] and was a member of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]'s squad which assassinated British secret service agents on the morning of [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]]. Details of his grandfather's activities survive in [[University College Dublin|UCD]] Archives, as well as [[Blackrock College]]. It also transpired that on his mother's side he was a close relative of [[Peter Fenelon Collier]], the founder of ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' and ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]''.

O'Hanlon was schooled in [[Blackrock College]] in Dublin and graduated, in 1987, from the [[National Institute for Higher Education]], [[Dublin]] (now [[Dublin City University]]) with a degree in Communications Studies.

===Career===
Together with Kevin Gildea and Barry Murphy, Ardal O'Hanlon founded the International Comedy Cellar, upstairs in the International Bar on Dublin's South Wicklow Street. Dublin had no comedy scene at the time. As a stand up, O'Hanlon won the [[Hackney Empire New Act of the Year]] competition in 1994. For a time he was the presenter of ''The Stand Up Show''.

He was spotted by [[Graham Linehan]], who was to cast him as Father Dougal McGuire in ''[[Father Ted]]'' (1995–98). In 1995 he received the Top TV Comedy Newcomer at the British Comedy Awards for this role. In 1995, he appeared (as Father Dougal) in a [[Channel 4]] [[Television ident|ident]] ("Hello, you're watching.... television"), and during [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] on BBC1. This was followed by the award-winning short comedy film ''[[Flying Saucer Rock'n'Roll]]''.

O'Hanlon moved into straight acting alongside [[Emma Fielding]] and [[Beth Goddard]] in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] comedy-drama ''Big Bad World'', which aired for two series in summer 1999 and winter 2001. He also played a minor role in ''[[The Butcher Boy (1997 film)|The Butcher Boy]]'' as Joe's (Francie's best friend) father, and appeared in an episode of the original ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line is it Anyway?]]''.

In 2000, O'Hanlon starred in the comedy series ''[[My Hero (UK TV series)|My Hero]]'', in which he played a very naive superhero from the planet Ultron. His character juggled world-saving heroics with life in suburbia. He stayed in the role until early 2005 and was replaced by [[James Dreyfus]] for series 6 in 2006.

He also provided the voice of the lead character in the three Christmas television cartoon specials of ''[[Robbie the Reindeer]]''. He appeared in the 2005 [[BBC One]] sitcom ''[[Blessed (television)|Blessed]]'', written by [[Ben Elton]]; at the 2005 British Comedy Awards, it was publicly slated by [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]], albeit in jest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Towards the end of 2005, he played an eccentric Scottish character, Coconut Tam, in the family-based film, ''[[The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby]]''. Although more commonly on television, he has appeared on radio  - on 18 July 2011, he appeared on ''[[Quote... Unquote]]''. Appropriately, one of his questions concerned a quotation from ''Father Ted''.

In 2006, O'Hanlon wrote and presented an [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTE]] television series called ''Leagues Apart'', which saw him investigate the biggest and most passionate football rivalries in a number of European countries. Included were Roma vs Lazio in [[Italy]], Barcelona vs Real Madrid in [[Spain]], and Galatasaray vs Fenerbahce in [[Turkey]]. He followed this with another RTÉ show, ''So You Want To Be Taoiseach?'' in 2007. It was a political series where O'Hanlon gave tongue-in-cheek advice on how to go about becoming [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland. Both programmes went some way towards freeing O'Hanlon from his association with the character of Dougal in the minds of Irish audiences.

He appeared in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]", broadcast on 14 April 2007, in which he played a cat-like creature named Thomas Kincade Brannigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6478495.stm|title=Fans mad for Doctor's new companion|date=22 March 2007|accessdate=3 April 2007|publisher=BBC News|author=Masters, Tim| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070328182935/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6478495.stm| archivedate= 28 March 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> O'Hanlon appears in Series 3 of the TV show ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'', playing Naomi Campbell ([[Lily Loveless]])'s Politics teacher named Kieran, who attempted to kiss her. He then went on to form a relationship with Naomi's mother ([[Olivia Colman]]). O'Hanlon plays the lead role in [[Ireland|Irish]] comedy television programme ''Val Falvey, TD'' on [[RTE One]]. He has recently{{When|date=March 2012}} performed in the [[Edinburgh Fringe]].

In February 2011, O'Hanlon returned to the [[Gate Theatre]], Dublin starring in the Irish premiere of Christopher Hampton's ''[[God of Carnage]]'', alongside [[Maura Tierney]].

In 2011, he appeared in the comedy panel show ''[[Argumental]]''.

O'Hanlon has written a novel, ''[[The Talk of the Town (novel)|The Talk of the Town]]'' (known in the United States as ''Knick Knack Paddy Whack''), which was published in 1998. The novel is about a teenage boy, Patrick Scully, and his friends.

in February 2015 he officially launched the 2015 Sky [[Cat Laughs]] Comedy Festival which takes place in Kilkenny from 28 May- 1 June.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.evoke.ie/events/ardal-ohanlan-launches-this-years-cats-laughs-as-the-festival-comes-of-age/|work=evoke.ie | title= Ardal O’Hanlan launches this year’s Cats Laughs as the festival comes of age| date= 26 February  2015}}</ref>
