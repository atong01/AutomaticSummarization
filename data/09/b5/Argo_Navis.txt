'''Argo Navis''' (the Ship Argo), or simply '''Argo''', was a large [[constellation]] in the southern sky that has since been divided into three constellations. It represented the ''[[Argo]]'', the ship used by [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in [[Greek mythology]].  The genitive was "Argus Navis", abbreviated "Arg".  [[John Flamsteed|Flamsteed]] and other early modern astronomers called the constellation just '''Navis''' (the Ship), genitive "Navis", abbreviated "Nav".

Due to [[precession]], the stars of Argo have been shifted farther south since Classical times, and far fewer of its stars are visible today from the latitude of the Mediterranean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/ArgoNavis.html |title=Pam Eastlick.

The original constellation was found low near the southern horizon of the Mediterranean sky. The ship became visible in springtime and sailed westward, skimming along the southern horizon. The ancient Greeks identified it with the ship sailed by Jason and the Argonauts in search of the Golden Fleece.

Argo Navis is the only one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]] that is no longer officially recognized as a constellation. It was unwieldy due to its enormous size. In 1752, the French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] subdivided it into [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] (the [[keel]], or the hull, of the ship), [[Puppis]] (the [[poop deck]], or [[stern]]), and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] (the [[sail]]s). Lacaille replaced Bayer's [[Bayer designation|designations]] with new ones; but like Bayer, he used a single Greek-letter sequence for the three parts: Carina has α, β and ε, Vela has γ and δ, Puppis has ζ, and so on.<ref name="Wagman">Morton Wagman, ''Lost Stars'', McDonald and Woodward, 2003, ISBN 0-939923-78-5.</ref>{{rp|82}} (For the dimmer stars, however, Lacaille used a separate Latin-letter sequence for each part.)<ref name="Wagman" />{{rp|82}} The duplication of omicron in Vela and Puppis appears to contradict this, but "omicron Puppis" is an error for Lacaille's o Puppis (Latin oh).<ref name="Wagman" />{{rp|85, 259}}

The constellation [[Pyxis]] (the [[mariner's compass]]) occupies an area which in antiquity was considered part of Argo's mast. Some authors state that Pyxis was part of the Greek conception of Argo Navis,<ref>John Scalzi (2008) Rough Guide to the Universe, p. 240 (ISBN 9781405383707)</ref><ref>David H. Kelley, et al. (2011) Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy, p. 12 (9781441976246)</ref><ref>Emily Winterburn (2009) The Stargazer's Guide, p. 124 (ISBN 9780061976377)</ref> but magnetic compasses were unknown in ancient Greek times. Lacaille considered it a separate constellation, representing one of the modern scientific instruments he placed among the constellations (like [[Microscopium]] and [[Telescopium]]); he assigned it Bayer designations separate from those of Carina, Puppis and Vela, and his illustration shows an isolated instrument not related to the figure of Argo.<ref name="Wagman" />{{rp|262}}  In 1844 John Herschel suggested formalizing the mast as a new constellation, [[Malus (constellation)|Malus]], to replace Lacaille's Pyxis, but the idea did not catch on.<ref>{{cite web

The [[Māori people|Māori]] had several names for what was the constellation Argo, including ''Te Waka-o-Tamarereti'', ''Te Kohi-a-Autahi'', and ''Te Kohi''.<ref>{{cite book
