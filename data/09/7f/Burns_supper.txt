{{Culture of Scotland}}

A '''Burns supper''' is a celebration of the life and poetry of the poet [[Robert Burns]], author of many [[Scots language|Scots]] poems. The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, 25 January, sometimes also known as '''Robert Burns Day''' (or '''Robbie Burns Day'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://life.nationalpost.com/2013/01/25/forks-amp-the-road-hurling-haggis-for-robbie-burns-day/ |title=Robbie Burns Day is all about hurling haggis, singing songs, and Scotch &#124; National Post |publisher=Life.nationalpost.com |date=25 January 2013 |accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref> or '''Rabbie Burns Day''') or '''Burns Night''' ({{lang-sco|Burns Nicht}}), although they may in principle be held at any time of the year.

Burns suppers are most common in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], however, there has been a surge in Burns' Night celebrations in the UK events industry seeing the evening being celebrated outside their traditional confines of [[Robert Burns|Burns]] Clubs, Scottish Societies, expatriate Scots, or aficionados of Burns' poetry. There is a particularly strong tradition of them in southern [[New Zealand]]'s main city [[Dunedin]], of which Burns' nephew [[Thomas Burns (New Zealand)|Thomas Burns]] was a founding father.

==History==
The first suppers were held ''in memoriam'' at [[Ayrshire]] at the end of the 18th century by Robert Burns' friends on 21 July, the anniversary of his death, and have been a regular occurrence ever since. The first Burns club was founded in [[Greenock]] in 1801 by merchants born in [[Ayrshire]], some of whom had known Burns. They held the first Burns supper on what they thought was his birthday, 29 January 1802, but in 1803 they discovered in [[Ayr]] parish records that his date of birth was 25 January 1759.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldburnsclub.com/newsletter/0107/greenock_burns_club.htm |title=Congratulation Greenock Burns Club |date= |work= |publisher=The Robert Burns World Federation Limited |accessdate=18 January 2010}}</ref> Since then, suppers have been held on 25 January.

Burns suppers may be formal or informal. Both typically include [[haggis]] (a traditional Scottish dish celebrated by Burns in ''Address to a Haggis''), [[Scotch whisky]], and the recitation of Burns's poetry. Formal dinners are hosted by organisations such as Burns clubs, the [[Freemason]]s, or [[St. Andrew|St Andrews]] Societies and occasionally end with dancing when ladies are present. Formal suppers follow a standard format.

== Order of the supper ==

===Piping in the guests===
A piper generally greets the guests, who gather and mix as at any informal party.<ref name=bbc/> At less formal gatherings traditional Scottish music is played.<ref name=vs>[http://www.visitscotland.com/en-us/about/robert-burns/supper-whats-involved "Burns Supper - what's involved?", ''VisitScotland.com'', Buidheann Turasachd Nàiseanta na h-Alba]</ref>

=== Host's welcoming speech ===
<div id="The Selkirk Grace"></div>
The host says a few words welcoming everyone to the supper and perhaps stating the reason for it.<ref name=bbc>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/robertburns/burns_night_running_order.shtml "Burns Night", BBC]</ref>

All of the guests are seated and [[Grace (prayer)|grace]] is said, usually using the ''Selkirk Grace'', a well-known thanksgiving said before meals, using the [[Modern Scots|Scots]] language. Although attributed to Burns, the Selkirk Grace was already known in the 17th century, as the "[[Galloway]] Grace" or the "[[Covenanters]]' Grace". It came to be called the Selkirk Grace because Burns was said to have delivered it at a dinner given by the [[Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk|Earl of Selkirk]].

==== The Selkirk Grace ====
:Some hae meat an
: canna eat,
:And some wad eat that want it;
:But we hae meat, and we can eat,
:And sae let the Lord be thankit.<ref name=bbc/>

The supper starts with the soup course.  Normally a Scottish soup such as [[Scotch Broth]], Potato Soup or [[Cock-a-leekie soup|Cock-a-Leekie]] is served.

==== "Piping" of the haggis ====
Everyone stands as the main course is brought in. This is always a [[haggis]] on a large dish.  It is usually brought in by the cook, generally while a piper plays [[Great Highland Bagpipe|bagpipes]] and leads the way to the host's table, where the haggis is laid down. They might play "[[A Man's A Man for A' That]]", "Robbie Burns Medley" or "The Star O' Robbie Burns".<ref>Archie Cairns – Book 1 Pipe Music 1995</ref> The host, or perhaps a guest, then recites the ''

At the line ''His knife see rustic Labour dicht'' the speaker normally draws and sharpens a knife, and at the line ''An' cut you up wi' ready slicht'', plunges it into the haggis and cuts it open from end to end.  When done properly this "ceremony" is a highlight of the evening.

=== Supper ===
[[File:Haggis.JPG|thumb|Haggis platter at a Burns supper in the US]]
[[File:A haggis serving.JPG|thumb|Haggis served wi tatties an neeps (with potatoes and turnips)]]
At the end of the poem, a Scotch whisky toast will be proposed to the haggis, then the company will sit down to the meal. The haggis is traditionally served with mashed potatoes (tatties) and mashed turnips (A Scottish 'turnip' is an English 'swede') ([[rutabaga|neeps]]).<ref name=vs/> A dessert course, cheese courses, coffee, etc. may also be part of the meal. The courses normally use traditional Scottish recipes. For instance, dessert may be [[cranachan]] or Tipsy Laird (whisky trifle) followed by oatcakes and cheese, all washed down with the "water of life" (uisge beatha) – [[Scotch whisky]].
When the meal reaches the coffee stage various speeches and toasts are given. In order, the core speeches and toasts are as follows.

=== Immortal memory ===
The main speaker gives a speech, remembering some aspect of Burns' life or poetry. This may be light-hearted or serious and may include the recitation of a poem or song by Burns. A toast to the Immortal Memory of Robert Burns then follows.<ref name=vs/>

===Address to the Lassies ===
This was originally a short speech given by a male guest in thanks to the women who had prepared the meal. However, nowadays it is much more wide-ranging and generally covers the male speaker's view on women. It is normally amusing but not offensive, particularly bearing in mind that it will be followed by a reply from the "lassies" concerned. The men drink a toast to the women's health.

=== Reply to the Laddies ===
This is occasionally (and humorously) called the "Toast to the Laddies" and, like the previous toast, it is generally quite wide-ranging nowadays. A female guest will give her views on men and reply to any specific points raised by the previous speaker. Like the previous speech, this should be amusing, but not offensive. Quite often the speakers giving this toast and the previous one will collaborate so that the two toasts complement each other.

=== Works by Burns ===
After the speeches there may be singing of songs by Burns – ''Ae Fond Kiss'', ''Parcel o' Rogues'', ''A Man's a Man'', etc. – and more poetry – ''[[To a Mouse]]'', ''[[To a Louse]]'', ''[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]'', ''The Twa Dugs'', ''Holy Willie's Prayer'', etc. This may be done by the individual guests or by invited experts, and it goes on for as long as the guests wish and may include other works by poets influenced by Burns, particularly poets writing in Scots. Foreign guests can also be invited to sing or say works from their land.

=== Closing ===
Finally the host will call on one of the guests to give the vote of thanks, after which everyone is asked to stand, join hands, and sing '' [[Auld Lang Syne]] '' bringing the evening to an end.
