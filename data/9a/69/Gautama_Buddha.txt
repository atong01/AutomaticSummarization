The word ''Buddha'' means "awakened one" or "the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]] one". "Buddha" is also used as a title for the first awakened being in a [[Yuga]] era.

Gautama is the primary figure in Buddhism and accounts of his life, discourses, and [[Monasticism|monastic]] rules are believed by Buddhists to have been summarized after his death and memorized by his followers. Various collections of teachings attributed to him were passed down by [[oral tradition]] and [[Pāli Canon|first committed to writing]] about 400 years later.

==Historical Siddhārtha Gautama==
[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|right|thumb|250px|Ancient kingdoms and cities of India during the time of the Buddha.]]
Scholars are hesitant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life. Most accept that he lived, taught and founded a monastic order during the [[Mahajanapada]] era during the reign of [[Bimbisara]], the ruler of the [[Magadha]] empire, and died during the early years of the reign of [[Ajatasatru|Ajasattu]], who was the successor of Bimbisara, thus making him a younger contemporary of [[Mahavira]], the Jain [[tirthankara]].{{sfn | Smith | 1924 | pp = 34, 48}} Apart from the [[Vedas|Vedic]] [[Brahmin]]s, the Buddha's lifetime coincided with the flourishing of other influential śramaṇa schools of thoughts like [[Ājīvika]], [[Cārvāka]], [[Jainism]], and Ajñana. It was also the age of influential thinkers like [[Mahavira]], [[Purana Kassapa|Pūraṇa Kassapa]], [[Makkhali Gosala|Makkhali Gosāla]], [[Ajita Kesakambali|Ajita Kesakambalī]], [[Pakudha Kaccayana|Pakudha Kaccāyana]], and [[Sanjaya Belatthaputta|Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta]], whose viewpoints the Buddha most certainly must have been acquainted with and influenced by.{{sfn |Walshe|1995|p = 268}}{{sfn |Collins|2009|pp = 199–200}}{{refn | group = note|According to Alexander Berzin, "Buddhism developed as a shramana school that accepted rebirth under the force of karma, while rejecting the existence of the type of soul that other schools asserted.

In this way, Buddhism avoided the extremes of the previous four shramana schools."<ref group=web>{{cite web|url = http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/study/history_buddhism/buddhism_india/indian_society_thought_time_buddha_.html |title = Indian Society and Thought before and at the Time of Buddha|first = Alexander |last= Berzin| publisher = Berzin archives |date = April 2007 | accessdate= 22 December 2014}}</ref>}} Indeed, [[Sariputta]] and [[Maudgalyayana|Moggallāna]], two of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, were formerly the foremost disciples of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta, the skeptic.{{sfn|Nakamura|1980|p=20}} There is also evidence to suggest that the two masters, [[Alara Kalama]] and [[Uddaka Ramaputta]], were indeed historical figures and they most probably taught Buddha two different forms of meditative techniques.{{sfn | Wynne |2007|pp=8–23|loc=ch. 2}} While the general sequence of "birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death" is widely accepted,{{sfn|Carrithers | 2001}} there is less consensus on the veracity of many details contained in traditional biographies.{{sfn |Buswell|2003|p = 352}}{{sfn |Lopez|1995|p= 16}}

The evidence of the early texts suggests that Siddhārtha Gautama was born into the [[Shakya]] clan, a community that was on the periphery, both geographically and culturally, of the northeastern Indian subcontinent in the 5th century BCE.{{sfn |Gombrich|1988|p= 49}} It was either a small republic, in which case his father was an elected chieftain, or an [[oligarchy]], in which case his father was an oligarch.{{sfn |Gombrich|1988|p=49}} According to the Buddhist tradition, Gautama was born in [[Lumbini]], nowadays in modern-day [[Nepal]], and raised in the Shakya capital of Kapilvastu, which may have been in either present day [[Tilaurakot]], Nepal or [[Piprahwa]], India.{{refn|group=note|name = "birthplace" |According to the Buddhist tradition, following the ''Nidanakatha'',<ref group = web>{{Citation | url = http://archive.org/details/buddhistbirth00daviuoft | title = Buddhist birth-stories; Jataka tales.

==Traditional biographies==
[[File:Buddha-painting.jpg|thumb|Buddha by [[Otgonbayar Ershuu]]]]

===Biographical sources===
The sources for the life of Siddhārtha Gautama are a variety of different, and sometimes conflicting, traditional biographies. These include the ''[[Buddhacarita]]'', ''[[Lalitavistara Sūtra]]'', ''[[Mahāvastu]]'', and the ''Nidānakathā''.{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=32}} Of these, the ''Buddhacarita''{{sfn|Beal|1883|p=}}{{sfn|Cowell|1894|p=}}{{sfn|Willemen|2009|p=}} is the earliest full biography, an epic poem written by the poet [[Aśvaghoṣa]], and dating around the beginning of the 2nd century CE.{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=32}} The ''Lalitavistara Sūtra'' is the next oldest biography, a [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]]/[[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] biography dating to the 3rd century CE.{{sfn|Karetzky|2000|p=xxi}} The ''Mahāvastu'' from the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] [[Lokottaravāda]] tradition is another major biography, composed incrementally until perhaps the 4th century CE.{{sfn|Karetzky|2000|p=xxi}} The [[Dharmaguptaka]] biography of the Buddha is the most exhaustive, and is entitled the ''Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra'',{{sfn|Beal|1875|p=}} and various Chinese translations of this date between the 3rd and 6th century CE. The ''Nidānakathā'' is from the [[Theravada]] tradition in [[Sri Lanka]] and was composed in the 5th century by [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhaghoṣa]].{{sfn|Swearer|2004|p=177}}

From canonical sources, the [[Jataka tales]], the ''Mahapadana Sutta'' (DN 14), and the ''Achariyabhuta Sutta'' (MN 123) which include selective accounts that may be older, but are not full biographies. The Jātakas retell previous lives of Gautama as a [[bodhisattva]], and the first collection of these can be dated among the earliest Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Schober|2002|p=20}} The ''Mahāpadāna Sutta'' and ''Achariyabhuta Sutta'' both recount miraculous events surrounding Gautama's birth, such as the bodhisattva's descent from the [[Tushita|Tuṣita Heaven]] into his mother's womb.

===Nature of traditional depictions===

In the earliest Buddhists texts, the [[nikāya]]s and [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]], the Buddha is not depicted as possessing [[omniscience]] (''sabbaññu'') <ref name="autogenerated1">Anålayo, The Buddha and Omniscience,  Indian International Journal of Buddhist Studies, 2006, vol. 7 pp. 1–20.</ref> nor is he depicted as being an eternal transcendent (''lokottara'') being. According to [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], ideas of the Buddha's omniscience (along with an increasing tendency to deify him and his biography) are found only later, in the [[Mahayana sutras]] and later [[Pali]] commentaries or texts such as the ''Mahāvastu''.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> In the ''Sandaka Sutta'', the Buddha's disciple Ananda outlines an argument against the claims of teachers who say they are all knowing <ref group=web>{{cite web|author1=Tan, Piya (trans)|authorlink1=Piya Tan|title=The Discourse to Sandaka (trans. of Sandaka Sutta, Majjhima Nikāya 2, Majjhima Paṇṇāsaka 3, Paribbājaka Vagga 6)|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/35.7-Sandaka-S-m76-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|publisher=The Minding Centre|accessdate=24 September 2015|pages=17–18|format=PDF|date=2010}}</ref> while in the ''Tevijjavacchagotta Sutta'' the Buddha himself states that he has never made a claim to being omniscient, instead he claimed to have the "higher knowledges" ([[abhijñā]]).<ref>MN 71 Tevijjavacchagotta [Tevijjavaccha]</ref> The earliest biographical material from the Pali Nikayas focuses on the Buddha's life as a [[śramaṇa]], his search for enlightenment under various teachers such as [[Alara Kalama]] and his forty five year career as a teacher.<ref group=web>{{cite web|editor1=Access to Insight|editorlink1=Access to Insight|title=A Sketch of the Buddha's Life: Readings from the Pali Canon|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/buddha.html|website=Access to Insight: Readings in Theravāda Buddhism|publisher=Access to Insight (Legacy Edition)|accessdate=24 September 2015|date=2005}}</ref>

Traditional biographies of Gautama generally include numerous miracles, omens, and supernatural events. The character of the Buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent (Skt. ''lokottara'') and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world. In the ''Mahāvastu'', over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supra-mundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such "in conformity with the world"; omniscience, and the ability to "suppress karma".{{sfn|Jones|1956|p=}} Nevertheless, some of the more ordinary details of his life have been gathered from these traditional sources. In modern times there has been an attempt to form a [[secularity|secular understanding]] of Siddhārtha Gautama's life by omitting the traditional supernatural elements of his early biographies.

Andrew Skilton writes that the Buddha was never historically regarded by Buddhist traditions as being merely human:
{{quote|It is important to stress that, despite modern Theravada teachings to the contrary (often a sop to skeptical Western pupils), he was never seen as being merely human. For instance, he is often described as having the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks or signs of a ''mahāpuruṣa'', "superman"; the Buddha himself denied that he was either a man or a [[Deva (Buddhism)|god]]; and in the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta|Mahāparinibbāna Sutta]]'' he states that he could live for an [[Kalpa (aeon)|aeon]] were he asked to do so.{{sfn|Skilton|2004|p=64-65}}}}
The ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the [[Jain Agamas|Jain scriptures]], and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in [[History of India|Indian history]] for which significant accounts exist.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=15}} British author [[Karen Armstrong]] writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddhārtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure.{{sfn|Armstrong|2000|p=xii}} Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of "birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death" must be true.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=}}

Gautama was born as a [[Kshatriya]],{{sfn|Samuel| 2010}}{{refn |group =note |According to Geoffrey Samuel, the Buddha was born as a Kshatriya,{{sfn|Samuel|2010}} in a moderate Vedic culture at the central Ganges Plain area, where the shramana-traditions developed.

Gautama was the [[family name]]. His mother, [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]] (Māyādevī), Suddhodana's wife, was a [[Koli people|Koliyan]] princess. Legend has it that, on the night Siddhartha was conceived, Queen Maya dreamt that a [[white elephant (animal)|white elephant]] with six white tusks entered her right side,{{sfn|Beal|1875|p = 37}}{{sfn |Jones|1952|p=11}} and ten [[lunar month|months]] later{{sfn | Beal|1875|p=41}} Siddhartha was born. As was the Shakya tradition, when his mother Queen Maya became pregnant, she left Kapilvastu for her father's kingdom to give birth.  However, her son is said to have been born on the way, at Lumbini, in a garden beneath a [[Shorea robusta|sal tree]].

The day of the Buddha's birth is widely celebrated in Theravada countries as [[Vesak]].{{sfn|Turpie|2001|p=3}} [[Buddha's Birthday]] is called ''Buddha [[Purnima]]'' in Nepal and India as he is believed to have been born on a full moon day. Various sources hold that the Buddha's mother died at his birth, a few days or seven days later. The infant was given the name Siddhartha (Pāli: Siddhattha), meaning "he who achieves his aim". During the birth celebrations, the hermit seer [[Asita]] journeyed from his mountain abode and announced that the child would either become a great king ([[chakravartin]]) or a great [[sadhu]].{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=9–12}} By traditional account,{{Which|date=November 2010}} this occurred after Siddhartha placed his feet in Asita's hair and Asita examined the birthmarks. Suddhodana held a naming ceremony on the fifth day, and invited eight [[Brahmin]] scholars to read the future. All gave a dual prediction that the baby would either become a great king or a great holy man.{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=9–12}} [[Kaundinya|Kondañña]], the youngest, and later to be the first [[arhat]] other than the Buddha, was reputed to be the only one who unequivocally predicted that Siddhartha would become a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=11-12}}

While later tradition and legend characterized Śuddhodana as a [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarch]], the [[Kinship|descendant]] of the [[Suryavansha]] (Solar dynasty) of {{IAST|Ikṣvāku}} (Pāli: Okkāka), many scholars think that Śuddhodana was the elected chief of a tribal confederacy.

Early texts suggest that Gautama was not familiar with the dominant religious teachings of his time until he left on his religious quest, which is said to have been motivated by existential concern for the human condition.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=47}} The state of the Shakya clan was not a monarchy, and seems to have been structured either as an [[oligarchy]], or as a form of republic.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|pages=49-50}} The more egalitarian gana-sangha form of government, as a political alternative to the strongly hierarchical kingdoms, may have influenced the development of the śramanic [[Jain monasticism|Jain]] and Buddhist [[sangha]]s, where monarchies tended toward [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic Brahmanism]].{{sfn|Thapar|2002|p=146}}

===Early life and marriage===
[[File:Departure of Siddhartha.jpg|thumb|upright|Departure of Prince Siddhartha]]
Siddhartha was brought up by his mother's younger sister, [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Maha Pajapati]].{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=14}} By tradition, he is said to have been destined by birth to the life of a prince, and had three palaces (for seasonal occupation) built for him. Although more recent scholarship doubts this status, his father, said to be King Śuddhodana, wishing for his son to be a great king, is said to have shielded him from religious teachings and from knowledge of human [[dukkha|suffering]].

When he reached the age of 16, his father reputedly arranged his marriage to a cousin of the same age named [[Yashodhara|Yaśodharā]] (Pāli: Yasodharā). According to the traditional account,{{Which|date=November 2010}} she gave birth to a son, named [[Rāhula]]. Siddhartha is said to have spent 29 years as a prince in [[Kapilavastu (Shakya capital)|Kapilavastu]]. Although his father ensured that Siddhartha was provided with everything he could want or need, Buddhist scriptures say that the future Buddha felt that material wealth was not life's ultimate goal.{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=14}}

===Renunciation and ascetic life===
[[File:The Victory of Buddha.jpg|thumb|The Victory of Buddha]]
[[File:Great Departure.JPG|thumb|The "Great Departure" of Siddhartha Gautama, surrounded by a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], he is accompanied by numerous guards, [[maithuna]] loving couples, and [[devata]] who have come to pay homage; [[Gandhara]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]]]]
[[File:Siddharta Gautama Borobudur.jpg|thumb|Prince Siddhartha shaves his hair and becomes an [[ascetic]]. [[Borobudur]], 8th century]]

At the age of 29, the popular biography{{which|date=June 2013}} continues, Siddhartha left his palace to meet his subjects. Despite his father's efforts to hide from him the sick, aged and suffering, Siddhartha was said to have seen an old man. When his charioteer [[Channa (Buddhist)|Channa]] explained to him that all people grew old, the prince went on further trips beyond the palace. On these he encountered a [[disease]]d man, a decaying [[Cadaver|corpse]], and an [[Asceticism|ascetic]]. These depressed him, and he initially strove to overcome aging, sickness, and death by living the life of an ascetic.{{sfn|Conze|1959|p=39-40}}

Accompanied by Channa and riding his horse [[Kanthaka]], Gautama quit his palace for the life of a [[mendicant]]. It's said that, "the horse's hooves were muffled by the gods"{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=15-16}} to prevent guards from knowing of his departure.

Gautama initially went to [[Rajgir|Rajagaha]] and began his ascetic life by begging for alms in the street. After King Bimbisara's men recognised Siddhartha and the king learned of his quest, Bimbisara offered Siddhartha the throne. Siddhartha rejected the offer, but promised to visit his kingdom of [[Magadha]] first, upon attaining enlightenment.

He left Rajagaha and practised under two hermit teachers of [[yogic]] meditation.{{sfn|Upadhyaya|1971|p=95}}{{sfn|Laumakis|2008|p=8}}{{sfn|Grubin|2010|p=}} After mastering the teachings of [[Alara Kalama]] (Skr. Ārāḍa Kālāma), he was asked by Kalama to succeed him. However, Gautama felt unsatisfied by the practice, and moved on to become a student of [[yoga]] with [[Udaka Ramaputta]] (Skr. Udraka Rāmaputra).{{sfn|Armstrong|2004|p=77}} With him he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness, and was again asked to succeed his teacher. But, once more, he was not satisfied, and again moved on.{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=19-20}}

Siddhartha and a group of five companions led by [[Kaundinya]] are then said to have set out to take their austerities even further. They tried to find enlightenment through deprivation of worldly goods, including food, practising [[Mortification of the flesh|self-mortification]]. After nearly starving himself to death by restricting his food intake to around a leaf or nut per day, he collapsed in a river while bathing and almost drowned. Siddhartha was rescued by a village girl named Sujata and she gave him some [[payasam]] (a pudding made from milk and [[jaggery]]) after which Siddhartha got back some energy. Siddhartha began to reconsider his path. Then, he remembered a moment in childhood in which he had been watching his father start the season's ploughing. He attained a concentrated and focused state that was blissful and refreshing, the [[jhāna]].

===Awakening===

According to the early Buddhist texts,<ref group=web name = "sn56">{{cite web|url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html |title=Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion|publisher=Access to insight |date= 2012-02-12 |accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref> after realizing that meditative [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]] was the right path to awakening, but that extreme asceticism didn't work, Gautama discovered what Buddhists call the [[Middle Way]]<ref group= web name= "sn56" />—a path of moderation away from the extremes of [[hedonism|self-indulgence]] and self-mortification, or the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], as was identified and described by the Buddha in his first discourse, the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.<ref group=web name="sn56"/> In a famous incident, after becoming starved and weakened, he is said to have accepted milk and [[rice pudding]] from a village girl named Sujata.<ref group=web name="goldenbowl">{{cite web|url= http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/lifebuddha/15lbud.htm |title = The Golden Bowl|publisher= Buddha net |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}</ref> Such was his emaciated appearance that she wrongly believed him to be a spirit that had granted her a wish.<ref group = web name="goldenbowl" />

Following this incident, Gautama was famously seated under a [[Sacred fig|pipal]] tree—now known as the [[Bodhi tree]]—in [[Bodh Gaya]], [[India]], when he vowed never to arise until he had found the truth.{{sfn |Gyatso|2007|pp =8–9}} [[Kaundinya]] and four other companions, believing that he had abandoned his search and become undisciplined, left.  After a reputed 49 days of meditation, at the age of 35, he is said to have attained [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]].{{sfn | Gyatso |2007| pp = 8–9}}<ref group= web name = "basicteaching">{{cite web | url = http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/footsteps.htm | title = The Basic Teaching of Buddha | publisher = SFSU |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}</ref> According to some traditions, this occurred in approximately the fifth lunar month, while, according to others, it was in the twelfth month. From that time, Gautama was known to his followers as the ''Buddha'' or "Awakened One" ("Buddha" is also sometimes translated as "The Enlightened One").

According to Buddhism, at the time of his awakening he realized complete insight into the cause of suffering, and the steps necessary to eliminate it. These discoveries became known as the "[[Four Noble Truths]]",<ref group= web name="basicteaching"/> which are at the heart of Buddhist teaching. Through mastery of these truths, a state of supreme liberation, or [[Nirvana]], is believed to be possible for any being.  The Buddha described Nirvāna as the perfect peace of a mind that's free from ignorance, greed, hatred and other afflictive states,<ref group=web name="basicteaching"/> or "defilements" (kilesas).  Nirvana is also regarded as the "end of the world", in that no personal identity or boundaries of the mind remain. In such a state, a being is said to possess the [[Buddhahood#Ten characteristics of a Buddha|Ten Characteristics]], belonging to every Buddha.

According to a story in the ''Āyācana Sutta'' (Samyutta Nikaya VI.1)&nbsp;— a scripture found in the [[Pāli]] and other [[wiktionary:canon|canons]]&nbsp;— immediately after his awakening, the Buddha debated whether or not he should teach the ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]'' to others. He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is subtle, deep and hard to grasp. However, in the story, [[Brahma (Buddhism)#Brahmā Sahampati|Brahmā Sahampati]] convinced him, arguing that at least some will understand it. The Buddha relented, and agreed to teach.

===Formation of the sangha===
[[File:Sarnath1.jpg|thumb|[[Dhamek Stupa]] in Sârnâth, India, site of the first teaching of the Buddha in which he taught the [[Four Noble Truths]] to his first five disciples]]

After his awakening, the Buddha met [[Trapusa and Bahalika|Taphussa and Bhallika]]&nbsp;— two merchant brothers from the city of [[Balkh]] in what is currently Afghanistan&nbsp;— who became his first lay disciples. It is said that each was given hairs from his head, which are now claimed to be enshrined as [[Śarīra|relics]] in the [[Shwe Dagon]] Temple in [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]]. The Buddha intended to visit [[Asita]], and his former teachers, [[Alara Kalama]] and [[Udaka Ramaputta]], to explain his findings, but they had already died.

He then travelled to the [[Sarnath|Deer Park]] near [[Varanasi]] (Benares) in northern India, where he set in motion what Buddhists call the [[Dharmacakra|Wheel of Dharma]] by delivering his first sermon to the five companions with whom he had sought enlightenment. Together with him, they formed the first [[Sangha|{{IAST|saṅgha}}]]: the company of Buddhist monks.

All five become [[arahants]], and within the first two months, with the conversion of [[Yasa]] and fifty four of his friends, the number of such arahants is said to have grown to 60. The conversion of three brothers named Kassapa followed, with their reputed 200, 300 and 500 disciples, respectively. This swelled the sangha to more than 1,000.

===Travels and teaching===
[[File:TheBuddhaAndVajrapaniGandhara2ndCentury.jpg|thumb|upright|Buddha with his protector [[Vajrapani]], [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]], 2nd century CE, Ostasiatische Kunst Museum]]

For the remaining 45 years of his life, the Buddha is said to have traveled in the [[Gangetic Plain]], in what is now [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]] and southern [[Nepal]], teaching a diverse range of people: from nobles to servants, murderers such as [[Angulimala]], and cannibals such as Alavaka.{{sfn | Malalasekera|1960| pp = 291-292}} Although the Buddha's language remains unknown, it's likely that he taught in one or more of a variety of closely related Middle Indo-Aryan dialects, of which [[Pali]] may be a standardization.

The sangha traveled through the subcontinent, expounding the dharma. This continued throughout the year, except during the four months of the [[Vāsanā]] rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. One reason was that it was more difficult to do so without causing harm to animal life. At this time of year, the sangha would retreat to monasteries, public parks or forests, where people would come to them.

[[Image:Vulturepeak1.jpg|thumb|left|A view of [[Griddhraj Parvat|Vulture Peak]], where the [[Atanatiya Sutta]] was held]]
The first vassana was spent at [[Varanasi]] when the sangha was formed. After this, the Buddha kept a promise to travel to [[Rajgir|Rajagaha]], capital of [[Magadha]], to visit King [[Bimbisara]]. During this visit, [[Sariputta]] and [[Maudgalyayana]] were converted by [[Assaji]], one of the first five disciples, after which they were to become the Buddha's two foremost followers. The Buddha spent the next three seasons at Veluvana Bamboo Grove monastery in Rajagaha, capital of Magadha.

Upon hearing of his son's awakening, Suddhodana sent, over a period, ten delegations to ask him to return to Kapilavastu. On the first nine occasions, the delegates failed to deliver the message, and instead joined the sangha to become arahants. The tenth delegation, led by Kaludayi, a childhood friend of Gautama's (who also became an arahant), however, delivered the message.

Now two years after his awakening, the Buddha agreed to return, and made a two-month journey by foot to Kapilavastu, teaching the dharma as he went. At his return, the royal palace prepared a midday meal, but the sangha was making an alms round in Kapilavastu. Hearing this, Suddhodana approached his son, the Buddha, saying:
{{quote|"Ours is the warrior lineage of Mahamassata, and not a single warrior has gone seeking alms."}}

The Buddha is said to have replied:
{{quote|"That is not the custom of your royal lineage. But it is the custom of my Buddha lineage. Several thousands of Buddhas have gone by seeking alms."}}

Buddhist texts say that Suddhodana invited the sangha into the palace for the meal, followed by a dharma talk. After this he is said to have become a [[sotapanna]]. During the visit, many members of the royal family joined the [[sangha]]. The Buddha's cousins [[Ananda]] and [[Anuruddha]] became two of his five chief disciples. At the age of seven, his son [[Rahula]] also joined, and became one of his ten chief disciples. His half-brother [[Nanda (Buddhist)|Nanda]] also joined and became an arahant.

Of the Buddha's disciples, Sariputta, [[Maudgalyayana]], [[Mahakasyapa]], Ananda and Anuruddha are believed to have been the five closest to him. His ten foremost disciples were reputedly completed by the quintet of [[Upali]], [[Subhoti]], Rahula, [[Mahakaccana]] and [[Punna]].

In the fifth vassana, the Buddha was staying at Mahavana near [[Vesali]] when he heard news of the impending death of his father. He is said to have gone to Suddhodana and taught the dharma, after which his father became an arahant.

[[File:The last days of buddha teachings.jpg|thumb|The last days of buddha teachings]]The king's death and cremation was to inspire the creation of an order of nuns. Buddhist texts record that the Buddha was reluctant to ordain women. His foster mother [[Maha Pajapati]], for example, approached him, asking to join the sangha, but he refused. Maha Pajapati, however, was so intent on the path of awakening that she led a group of royal Sakyan and Koliyan ladies, which followed the sangha on a long journey to Rajagaha. In time, after Ananda championed their cause, the Buddha is said to have reconsidered and, five years after the formation of the sangha, agreed to the ordination of women as nuns. He reasoned that males and females had an equal capacity for awakening. But he gave women additional rules ([[Vinaya]]) to follow.

===Mahaparinirvana===
[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Buddha Parinirvana.jpeg|thumb|The Buddha's entry into [[Parinirvana]]. [[Sanskrit]] [[palm leaf manuscript]]. [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], [[Bihar]], [[India]]. [[Pala Empire|Pāla period]]]]

According to the ''Mahaparinibbana Sutta'' of the Pali canon, at the age of 80, the Buddha announced that he would soon reach Parinirvana, or the final deathless state, and abandon his earthly body. After this, the Buddha ate his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named [[Cunda (Buddhism)|Cunda]]. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant [[Ananda|Ānanda]] to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his place had nothing to do with his passing and that his meal would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the last meal for a Buddha.<ref group = web>{{Citation | publisher = Access insight | chapter-url = http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html | chapter = Maha-parinibbana Sutta | title = [[Digha Nikaya]] | number = 16 | at = verse 56}}</ref> Mettanando and [[Oskar von Hinüber|Von Hinüber]] argue that the Buddha died of [[Superior mesenteric artery syndrome|mesenteric]] [[infarction]], a symptom of old age, rather than food poisoning.{{sfn|Mettanando| 2000}}<ref group=web>{{cite web|last=Mettanando |url=http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha192.htm |title=Buddha net |date=2001-05-15 |accessdate=25 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121114032016/http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha192.htm |archivedate=14 November 2012 }}</ref>

The precise contents of the Buddha's final meal are not clear, due to variant scriptural traditions and ambiguity over the translation of certain significant terms; the [[Theravada]] tradition generally believes that the Buddha was offered some kind of pork, while the [[Mahayana]] tradition believes that the Buddha consumed some sort of truffle or other mushroom.  These may reflect the different traditional views on [[Buddhist vegetarianism]] and the precepts for monks and nuns.

[[Arthur Waley|Waley]] suggests that Theravadin's would take ''suukaramaddava'' (the contents of the Buddha's last meal), which can translate literally as ''pig-soft'', to mean "soft flesh of a pig". However, he also states that ''pig-soft'' could mean "pig's soft-food", that is, after [[Karl Eugen Neumann|Neumann]], a soft food favoured by pigs, assumed to be a [[truffle]]. He argues (also after Neumann) that as "(p)lant names tend to be local and dialectical", as there are several plants known to have ''suukara-'' (pig) as part of their names,<ref group = note name= "Wayley1932">Waley notes: ''suukara-kanda'', "pig-bulb"; ''suukara-paadika'', "pig's foot" and  ''sukaresh.ta''  "sought-out by pigs".  He cites Neumann's suggestion that if a plant called "sought-out by pigs" exists then ''suukaramaddava'' can mean "pig's delight".</ref> and as Pali Buddhism developed in an area remote from the Buddha's death, ''suukaramaddava'' could easily have been a type of plant whose local name was unknown to those in Pali regions. Specifically, local writers writing soon after the Buddha's death knew more about their flora than Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] who lived hundreds of years and hundreds of kilometres remote in time and space from the events described. Unaware that it may have been a local plant name and with no Theravadin prohibition against eating animal flesh, Theravadins would not have questioned the Buddha eating meat and interpreted the term accordingly.{{sfn|Waley|1932|pp= 343–54}}

Ananda protested the Buddha's decision to enter Parinirvana in the abandoned jungles of [[Kushinagar|Kuśināra]] (present-day Kushinagar, [[India]]) of the [[Malla (India)|Malla]] kingdom. The Buddha, however, is said to have reminded Ananda how Kushinara was a land once ruled by a righteous wheel-turning king that resounded with joy:
{{quote | ''44.'' Kusavati, Ananda, resounded unceasingly day and night with ten sounds—the trumpeting of elephants, the neighing of horses, the rattling of chariots, the beating of drums and tabours, music and song, cheers, the clapping of hands, and cries of "Eat, drink, and be merry!"}}

The Buddha then asked all the attendant [[Bhikkhu]]s to clarify any doubts or questions they had and cleared them all in a way which others could not do. They had none. According to Buddhist scriptures, he then finally entered Parinirvana. The Buddha's final words are reported to have been: "All composite things ([[Saṅkhāra]]) are perishable. Strive for your own liberation with diligence" (Pali: 'vayadhammā saṅkhārā appamādena sampādethā'). His body was cremated and the [[relic]]s were placed in monuments or stupas, some of which are believed to have survived until the present. For example, The [[Temple of the Tooth]] or "Dalada Maligawa" in [[Sri Lanka]] is the place where what some believe to be the [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|relic of the right tooth of Buddha]] is kept at present.

According to the Pāli historical chronicles of Sri Lanka, the [[Dipavamsa|{{IAST|Dīpavaṃsa}}]] and [[Mahavamsa|{{IAST | Mahāvaṃsa}}]], the coronation of [[Ashoka|Emperor Aśoka]] (Pāli: Asoka) is 218 years after the death of the Buddha. According to two textual records in Chinese ({{lang|zh|十八部論}} and {{lang |zh|部執異論}}), the coronation of Emperor Aśoka is 116 years after the death of the Buddha. Therefore, the time of Buddha's passing is either 486 BCE according to Theravāda record or 383 BCE according to Mahayana record. However, the actual date traditionally accepted as the date of the Buddha's death in Theravāda countries is 544 or 545 BCE, because the reign of Emperor Aśoka was traditionally reckoned to be about 60 years earlier than current estimates. In Burmese Buddhist tradition, the date of the Buddha's death is 13 May 544 BCE.{{sfn |Kala |1724|p = 39}} whereas in Thai tradition it is 11 March 545 BCE.{{sfn|Eade | 1995 |pp = 15–16}}

At his death, the Buddha is famously believed to have told his disciples to follow no leader. [[Mahakasyapa]] was chosen by the sangha to be the chairman of the [[First Buddhist Council]], with the two chief disciples [[Maudgalyayana]] and [[Sariputta]] having died before the Buddha.

While in the Buddha's days he was addressed by the very respected titles Buddha, Shākyamuni, Shākyasimha, Bhante and Bho, he was known after his parinirvana as Arihant, Bhagavā/Bhagavat/Bhagwān, Mahāvira,{{sfn | Katz | 1982 | p = 22}} Jina/Jinendra, Sāstr, Sugata, and most popularly in scriptures as Tathāgata.

==Relics==

==Physical characteristics==
{{Main |Physical characteristics of the Buddha}}
[[File:Buddha Victoria & Albert.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Gandhara|Gandhāran]] depiction of the Buddha from [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], [[Afghanistan]]; Victoria and Albert Museum, [[London]].]]
An extensive and colorful physical description of the Buddha has been laid down in scriptures. A [[kshatriya]] by birth, he had military training in his upbringing, and by Shakyan tradition was required to pass tests to demonstrate his worthiness as a warrior in order to marry. He had a strong enough body to be noticed by one of the kings and was asked to join his army as a general. He is also believed by Buddhists to have "the 32 Signs of the Great Man".

The Brahmin Sonadanda described him as "handsome, good-looking, and pleasing to the eye, with a most beautiful complexion. He has a godlike form and countenance, he is by no means unattractive." (D, I:115)

"It is wonderful, truly marvellous, how serene is the good Gotama's appearance, how clear and radiant his complexion, just as the golden jujube in autumn is clear and radiant, just as a palm-tree fruit just loosened from the stalk is clear and radiant, just as an adornment of red gold wrought in a crucible by a skilled goldsmith, deftly beaten and laid on a yellow-cloth shines, blazes and glitters, even so, the good Gotama's senses are calmed, his complexion is clear and radiant." (A, I:181)

A disciple named Vakkali, who later became an arahant, was so obsessed by the Buddha's physical presence that the Buddha is said to have felt impelled to tell him to desist, and to have reminded him that he should know the Buddha through the Dhamma and not through physical appearances.

Although there are no extant representations of the Buddha in human form until around the 1st century CE (see [[Buddhist art]]), descriptions of the physical characteristics of fully enlightened buddhas are attributed to the Buddha in the [[Digha Nikaya]]'s ''{{IAST |Lakkhaṇa Sutta}}'' (D, I:142).{{sfn|Walshe|1995|pp = 441–60}}  In addition, the Buddha's physical appearance is described by [[Yasodhara]] to their son [[Rahula]] upon the Buddha's first post-Enlightenment return to his former princely palace in the non-canonical Pali devotional hymn, ''Narasīha Gāthā'' ("The Lion of Men").<ref group=web>{{cite web|url= http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/vandana02.pdf | publisher = Buddha net | first = Ven.

Among the 32 main characteristics it is mentioned that Buddha has [[blue eyes]].{{sfn|Epstein|2003|p= 200}}

==Nine virtues==
Recollection of nine virtues attributed to the Buddha is a common Buddhist meditation and devotional practice called [[Buddhānusmṛti]]. The nine virtues are also among the [[Kammaṭṭhāna|40 Buddhist meditation subjects]]. The nine virtues of the Buddha appear throughout the [[Tipitaka]],<ref group = web>{{Citation | url = http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books6/Bhante_Dhammananda_Great_Virtues_of_the_Buddha.pdf | first = Ven. Dr. K. Sri | last = Dhammananda | title = Great Virtues of the Buddha | publisher = Dhamma talks | format = PDF}}</ref> and include:
: ''Buddho''&nbsp;– [[Bodhi|Awakened]]
: ''Sammasambuddho''&nbsp;– [[Buddhahood#Samyaksambuddha|Perfectly self-awakened]]
: ''Vijja-carana-sampano''&nbsp;– Endowed with higher knowledge and ideal conduct.
: ''Sugato''&nbsp;– Well-gone or Well-spoken.
: ''Lokavidu''&nbsp;– Wise in the knowledge of the [[Buddhist cosmology|many worlds]].
: ''Anuttaro Purisa-damma-sarathi''&nbsp;– Unexcelled trainer of untrained people.
: ''Satthadeva-Manussanam''&nbsp;– Teacher of [[Deva (Buddhism)|gods]] and humans.
: ''Bhagavathi''&nbsp;– [[Bhagavan|The Blessed one]]
: ''Araham''&nbsp;– Worthy of homage. An [[Arahant]] is "one with taints destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is completely liberated through final knowledge."

===Tracing the oldest teachings===
Information of the oldest teachings may be obtained by analysis of the oldest texts. One method to obtain information on the oldest core of Buddhism is to compare the oldest extant versions of the Theravadin [[Pali Canon]] and other texts.{{refn|group=note|The surviving portions of the scriptures of [[Sarvastivada]], [[Mulasarvastivada]], [[Mahisasaka]], [[Dharmaguptaka]] and other schools,{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=ix}}{{sfn|Warder|1999}} and the Chinese [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]] and other surviving portions of other early canons.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}}} The reliability of these sources, and the possibility to draw out a core of oldest teachings, is a matter of dispute.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Schmithausen|1990}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} According to Vetter, inconsistencies remain, and other methods must be applied to resolve those inconsistencies.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|ix}}{{refn|group=note|Exemplary studies are the study on descriptions of "liberating insight" by Lambert Schmithausen,{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}} the overview of early Buddhism by Tilmann Vetter,{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} the philological work on the four truths by K.R. Norman,{{sfn|Norman|1992}} the textual studies by Richard Gombrich,{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} and the research on early meditation methods by Johannes Bronkhorst.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1997}}}}

According to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished:{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=vii}}
# "Stress on the fundamental homogeneity and substantial authenticity of at least a considerable part of the Nikayic materials;"{{refn|group=note|Well-known proponents of the first position are [[A.K. Warder]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|According to A.K. Warder, in his 1970 publication "Indian Buddhism", from the oldest extant texts a common kernel can be drawn out.{{sfn|Warder|1999|inside flap}} According to Warder, c.q. his publisher: "This kernel of doctrine is presumably common Buddhism of the period before the great schisms of the fourth and third centuries BC. It may be substantially the Buddhism of the Buddha himself, although this cannot be proved: at any rate it is a Buddhism presupposed by the schools as existing about a hundred years after the parinirvana of the Buddha, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was formulated by anyone else than the Buddha and his immediate followers."{{sfn|Warder||1999|inside flap}}}} and [[Richard Gombrich]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1997|p=viii}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Richard Gombrich: "I have the greatest difficulty in accepting that the main edifice is not the work of a single genius. By "the main edifice" I mean the collections of the main body of sermons, the four Nikāyas, and of the main body of monastic rules."{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}}}}}
# "Scepticism with regard to the possibility of retrieving the doctrine of earliest Buddhism;"{{refn|group=note|A proponent of the second position is Ronald Davidson.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Ronald Davidson: "While most scholars agree that there was a rough body of sacred literature (disputed)(sic) that a relatively early community (disputed)(sic) maintained and transmitted, we have little confidence that much, if any, of surviving Buddhist scripture is actually the word of the historic Buddha."{{sfn|Davidson|2003|p=147}}}}}}
# "Cautious optimism in this respect."{{refn|group=note|Well-known proponent of the third position are J.W. de Jong,{{sfn|Jong|1993|p=25}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name="Jong"|J.W. De Jong: "It would be hypocritical to assert that nothing can be said about the doctrine of earliest Buddhism [...] the basic ideas of Buddhism found in the canonical writings could very well have been proclaimed by him [the Buddha], transmitted and developed by his disciples and, finally, codified in fixed formulas."{{sfn|Jong|1993|p=25}}}} Johannes Bronkhorst{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Bronkhorst: "This position is to be preferred to (ii) for purely methodological reasons: only those who seek may find, even if no success is guaranteed."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1997|p=vii}}}} and Donald Lopez.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Lopez: "The original teachings of the historical Buddha are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to recover or reconstruct."{{sfn|Lopez|1995p=4}}}}}}

===''Dhyana'' and insight===
A core problem in the study of early Buddhism is the relation between ''dhyana'' and insight.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} Schmithausen, in his often-cited article ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism'' notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

===Core teachings===
According to Tilmann Vetter, the core of earliest Buddhism is the practice of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Bronkhorst agrees that ''dhyana'' was a Buddhist invention,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} whereas Norman notes that "the Buddha's way to release [...] was by means of meditative practices."{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}} Discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiv-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=131}}

According to the Mahāsaccakasutta,{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 36}} from the fourth ''[[Dhyana in Buddhism|jhana]]'' the Buddha gained ''[[bodhi]]''. Yet, it is not clear what he was awakened to.{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} "Liberating insight" is a later addition to this text, and reflects a later development and understanding in early Buddhism.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} The mentioning of the four truths as constituting "liberating insight" introduces a logical problem, since the four truths depict a linear path of practice, the knowledge of which is in itself not depicted as being liberating:{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5}}
{{quote|[T]hey do not teach that one is released by knowing the four noble truths, but by practicing the fourth noble truth, the eightfold path, which culminates in right samadhi.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5}}}}

Although ''[[Nibbana|"Nibbāna"]]'' (Sanskrit: ''Nirvāna'') is the common term for the desired goal of this practice, many other terms can be found throughout the Nikayas, which are not specified.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xv}}{{refn|group=note|Vetter: "I am especially thinking here of MN 26 (I p.163,32; 165,15;166,35) ''kimkusalagavesi anuttaram santivarapadam pariyesamano'' (searching for that which is beneficial, seeking the unsurpassable, best place of peace) and again MN 26 (passim), ''anuttaramyagakkhemam nibbiinam pariyesati'' (he seeks the unsurpassable safe place, the nirvana). ''Anuppatta-sadattho'' (one who has reached the right goal) is also a vague positive expression in the Arhatformula in MN 35 (I p, 235), see chapter 2, footnote 3, Furthermore, ''satthi'' (welfare) is important in e.g. SN 2.12 or 2.17 or Sn 269; and ''sukha'' and ''rati'' (happiness), in contrast to other places, as used in Sn 439 and 956. The oldest term was perhaps ''amata'' (immortal, immortality) [...] but one could say here that it is a negative term."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xv}}}}

According to Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term "the middle way".{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

According to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the [[Four Noble Truths|four truths]] became a substitution for prajna, or "liberating insight", in the suttas{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhanas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}} According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of "liberating insight".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Gotama's teachings may have been personal, "adjusted to the need of each person."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}}

The ''[[three marks of existence]]''{{refn|group=note|Understanding of these marks helps in the development of detachment:
* [[Anicca]]'' (Sanskrit: ''anitya''): That all things that come to be have an end;
* ''[[Dukkha]]'' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}''): That nothing which comes to be is ultimately satisfying;
* ''[[Anatta|Anattā]]'' (Sanskrit: ''anātman''): That nothing in the realm of experience can really be said to be "I" or "mine".}} may reflect Upanishadic or other influences. K.R. Norman supposes that these terms were already in use at the Buddha's time, and were familiar to his listeners.{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=26}}

The [[Brahmavihara|Brahma-vihara]] was in origin probably a brahmanic term;{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=28}} but its usage may have been common to the Sramana traditions.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}

===Later developments===
In time, "liberating insight" became an essential feature of the Buddhist tradition. The following teachings, which are commonly seen as essential to Buddhism, are later formulations which form part of the explanatory framework of this "liberating insight":{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}
* The [[Four Noble Truths]]: that suffering is an ingrained part of existence; that the origin of suffering is craving for sensuality, acquisition of identity, and fear of annihilation; that suffering can be ended; and that following the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] is the means to accomplish this;
* The Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration;
* [[Pratitya-samutpada|Dependent origination]]: the mind creates suffering as a natural product of a complex process.
