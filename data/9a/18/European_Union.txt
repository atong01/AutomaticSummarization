===Treaty of Rome and growth===
[[File:EC-EU-enlargement animation.gif|thumb|left|280px|The continental territories of the member states of the European Union (European Communities pre-1993), coloured in order of accession.]]

In 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany signed the [[Treaty of Rome]], which created the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and established a [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]]. They also signed another pact creating the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) for co-operation in developing nuclear energy. Both treaties came into force in 1958.<ref name="Europa History 45-59"/>

The EEC and Euratom were created separately from ECSC, although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly.  The EEC was headed by [[Walter Hallstein]] ([[Hallstein Commission]]) and Euratom was headed by [[Louis Armand]] ([[Armand Commission]]) and then [[Étienne Hirsch]]. Euratom was to integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union among members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/a_european_atomic_energy_community-en-19bc7f11-bea1-49c7-b534-18327c303f41.html |title=A European Atomic Energy Community |publisher=Cvce.eu |date=13 October 1997 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/a_european_customs_union-en-a11a5f17-d744-479e-ba75-2c70b6058608.html|title=A European Customs Union|work=cvce.eu}}</ref>

Through the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached and on 1 July 1967 the [[Merger Treaty]] created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the ''[[European Communities]]''.<ref name="ENA Merge">{{cite web|title=Merging the executives|publisher=CVCE&nbsp;– Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/merging_the_executives-en-575850b6-f472-406a-936d-8c08a9e0db32.html|accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/merging_the_executives-en-575850b6-f472-406a-936d-8c08a9e0db32.html Merging the executives] CVCE.eu</ref> [[Jean Rey (politician)|Jean Rey]] [[President of the European Commission|presided over]] the first merged Commission ([[Rey Commission]]).<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/archives/commission_2004-2009/index_en.htm Discover the former Presidents: The Rey Commission], Europa (web portal).

In 2004, the EU saw [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|its biggest enlargement to date]] when [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Hungary]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]] joined the Union.<ref name="Europa History 00">{{cite web|title=A decade of further expansion|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm|accessdate=25 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615031714/http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=15 June 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|left|2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] entered into force.]]

On 1 January 2007, [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] became EU members. In the same year, [[Slovenian euro coins|Slovenia]] adopted the euro,<ref name="Europa History 00"/> followed in 2008 by [[Cypriot euro coins|Cyprus]] and [[Maltese euro coins|Malta]], by [[Slovak euro coins|Slovakia]] in 2009, by [[Estonian euro coins|Estonia]] in 2011, by [[Latvian euro coins|Latvia]] in 2014 and by [[Lithuania euro coins|Lithuania]] in 2015. In June 2009, the [[European Parliament election, 2009|European Parliament elections]] were held, leading to the [[Barroso Commission#Second college|second Barroso Commission]], and by July, Iceland formally applied for EU membership, but has since [[Accession of Iceland to the European Union#2013 election and parliamentary debate|suspended negotiations]].

On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the European Union, merging the [[Three pillars of the European Union|EU three pillars]] system into a single legal entity provisioned with a [[legal personality]], created a permanent [[President of the European Council]], the first of which was [[Herman Van Rompuy]], and strengthened the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]], [[Catherine Ashton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://government.zdnet.com/?p=6266|title=European Parliament announces new President and Foreign Affairs Minister|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref>

The landscape, climate, and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline, which is {{convert|65993|km|mi|0}} long.

Including the overseas territories of France which are located outside the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Arctic]] (North-East Europe) to tropical (French Guyana), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. The majority of the population lives in areas with a temperate [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]] (North-Western Europe and Central Europe), a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Southern Europe), or a warm summer continental or [[hemiboreal]] climate (Northern [[Balkans]] and Central Europe).<ref name="Humid Continental climate">{{cite web|title=Humid Continental Climate |work=The physical environment |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point |year=2007 |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_continental.html |accessdate=29 June 2007}}</ref>

The EU's population is highly urbanised, with some 75% of inhabitants (and growing, projected to be 90% in seven member states by 2020) living in urban areas. Cities are largely spread out across the EU, although with a [[Blue Banana|large grouping]] in and around the [[Benelux]]. An increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas. In some cases, this urban growth has been due to the influx of [[Trans-European Networks|EU funds]] into a region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/eea_report_2006_10/eea_report_10_2006.pdf |title=Urban sprawl in Europe: The ignored challenge, European Environmental Agency |format=PDF |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>

Through successive [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargements]], the Union has grown from the [[Inner Six|six founding states]]—Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands—to the current {{EUnum}}. Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]], thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as "pooling of sovereignty".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/pooled-sovereignty|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|work=Answers.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=EU institutions and other bodies|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/index_en.htm|publisher=Europa|accessdate=4 September 2009}}</ref>

To become a member, a country must meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]], defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the [[rule of law]]; a functioning [[market economy]]; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.<ref name="Accession Criteria">{{cite web|title=Accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria)|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague_en.htm|accessdate=26 June 2007}}</ref>  No member state has ever left the Union, although [[Greenland]] (an [[autonomous area|autonomous province]] of Denmark) withdrew in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Greenland Treaty of 1985 |work=The European Union and Greenland |publisher=Greenland Home Rule Government |url=http://eu.nanoq.gl/Emner/EuGl/The%20Greenland%20Treaty.aspx |accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] now contains a clause providing for a member to leave the EU.<ref>Article 50 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union.</ref>

There are six countries which are recognized as candidates for membership: [[Albania]], [[Iceland]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]],<ref group="lower-alpha">Referred to by the EU as the "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".</ref> [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], and [[Turkey]].<ref name="Europa Enlargement"/> However, on 13 June 2013, Iceland's Foreign Minister, [[Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson]], informed the European Commission that the newly elected government intended to "put negotiations on hold".<ref name="icelandover">{{cite web |url=http://euobserver.com/political/120501 |title=Iceland's EU bid is over, commission told |last=Fox |first=Benjamin |publisher=Reuters |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo]] are officially recognised as potential candidates,<ref name="Europa Enlargement">{{cite web|title=European Commission – Enlargement – Candidate and Potential Candidate Countries|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/countries/index_en.htm |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> but have not submitted membership applications.  Due to the lack of [[International recognition of Kosovo|recognition]] by five of the 28 EU member states, the European Commission refers only to "Kosovo*", with an asterisked footnote containing the text agreed to by the [[Belgrade–Pristina negotiations]]: "This designation is without prejudice to [[Kosovo status process|positions on status]], and is in line with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UNSCR 1244]] and the [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence|ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence]]."

Four countries forming the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) (that are not EU members) have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland, [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Norway]], which are a part of the [[single market]] through the [[European Economic Area]], and [[Switzerland]], which has similar ties through [[Switzerland–European Union relations|bilateral treaties]].<ref name="EEA"/><ref name="CH">{{cite web|title=The EU's relations with Switzerland|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/switzerland/index_en.htm|accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref> The relationships of the [[Microstates and the European Union|European microstates]], [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation.<ref name="euro use world">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/world/outside_euro_area/index_en.htm|title=Use of the euro in the world|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|work=The euro outside the euro area|accessdate=27 February 2008}}</ref>

The environmental policy of the EU has therefore developed in remarkable fashion in the past four decades. An increasingly dense network of legislation has emerged, which now extends to all areas of environmental protection, including: air pollution control, water protection, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, biotechnology and other industrial risks.<ref>Knill, C. and Liefferink, D.(2012) The establishment of EU environmental policy, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e).

Such dynamic developments are surprising in light of the legal and institutional conditions which existed in the late 1950s and 60s.<ref>Knill, C. and Liefferink, D.(2012) The etsbalishment of EU environmental policy, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C.

Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.</ref> Acting without any legislative authority, European policy-makers initially increased the EU's capacity to act by defining environmental policy as a trade problem. The most important reason for the introduction of a common environmental policy was the fear that trade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards.<ref>Johnson, S.P. and Corcelle, G. (1989) The Environmental Policy of the European Communities, Graham & Trotman, London</ref> However, in the course of time, EU environmental policy emerged as a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, policy principles and procedures. The legal basis of EU environmental policy was not more explicitly established until the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.<ref name="European Environmental Policy 2012"/>

Initially, EU environmental policy was rather introspective. More recently, however, the Union has demonstrated a growing leadership in global environmental governance. The role of the EU in securing the ratification and entry into force of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in the face of US opposition is an example in this regard. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which recognises that its strategic objectives can only be achieved if a series of key international environmental agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at an EU level and worldwide. The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty further strengthens the EU's global environmental leadership ambitions.<ref>Benson, D. and Adelle, C. (2012) European Union environmental policy after the Lisbon Treaty, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.</ref> The vast body of EU environmental law which now exists has played a vital role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe as well as contributed to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.<ref name="European Environmental Policy 2012"/> However, significant challenges remain, both to meet existing EU targets and aspirations and to agree new targets and actions that will further improve the environment and the quality of life in Europe and beyond.

One of the top priorities of EU environmental policy is combatting climate change. In 2007, member states agreed that the EU is to use 20% [[renewable energy]] in the future and that it has to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels.<ref name="EUO energy">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jan/23/climatechange.eu1|title=EU sets 20% target for carbon cuts|accessdate=29 February 2008|work=The Guardian |first=Jessica|last=Aldred|location=London|date=23 January 2008}}</ref> This includes measures that in 2020, 10% of the overall fuel quantity used by cars and trucks in [[Treaty of Accession 2005|EU 27]] should be running on renewable energy such as [[biofuel]]s.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of the European Union}}
[[File:Political System of the European Union.svg|thumb|400px|Political system of the European Union]]

The EU operates within those competencies conferred on it by the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]] and according to the principle of [[Subsidiarity#European Union law|subsidiarity]] (which dictates that action by the EU should only be taken where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states alone). [[European Union law|Laws made by the EU institutions]] are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures and those which specifically require national implementation measures.<ref>These groups refer to regulations and directives respectively. These legislative instruments are dealt with in more detail [[#Acts|below]].</ref>

===Constitutional nature===
{{Further|Treaties of the European Union}}
The classification of the European Union in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated, often in the light of the degree of integration that is perceived, desired, or expected. Historically, at least, the EU is an international organisation, and by some criteria, it could be classified as a [[confederation]]; but it also has many attributes of a [[federation]], so some would classify it as a (''de facto'') federation of states.<ref>{{cite book| editor1-last = Wiener| editor1-first = Antje| editor2-last = Diez| editor2-first = Thomas| title = European Integration Theory|chapter=Federalism|first=Michael|last=Burgess| pages =25–42| year = 2009| origyear = 2004|edition=2nd| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-922609-2}}</ref><ref>

It is becoming like a national state, but we differ from many of the critics (or enthusiasts) of the White Paper in one major way. Rather than seeing the EU becoming a state-like object, taking on the trappings of a 19th—or more correctly 20th—century state, we see national states moving towards the EU, adopting many of the governing practices advocated by the White Paper. }}</ref>

The organisation itself has traditionally used the terms "community", and later "union". The difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law (where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations) and international law (where the subjects include sovereign states and international organisations); they can also be seen in the light of differing European and American constitutional traditions.<ref name="Schütze, 2012">{{cite book| last = Schütze| first = Robert| title = European Constitutional Law| year = 2012| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-0-521-73275-8| pages = 47–79

Especially in terms of the European constitutional tradition, the term ''federation'' is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law; so the EU cannot be called a ''federal state'' or ''federation''—at least, not without qualification. Though not, strictly, a federation, it is more than a free-trade association.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ee.html| title = European Union| work = CIA World Factbook| accessdate = 18 November 2012|quote=Although the EU is not a federation in the strict sense, it is far more than a free-trade association such as ASEAN, NAFTA, or Mercosur, and it has certain attributes associated with independent nations: its own flag, currency (for some members), and law-making abilities, as well as diplomatic representation and a common foreign and security policy in its dealings with external partners. }}</ref> It is, however, described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature. Walter Hallstein, in the original German edition of ''Europe in the Making'' called it "an unfinished federal state".<ref>{{cite book| others=translated by Charles Roetter| title = Europe in the Making | trans_title = translation of ''Der unvollendete Bundesstaat''|first1=Walter|last1=Hallstein| year = 1972| origyear = 1969|edition=English| publisher = George Allen & Unwin| isbn = 978-0-19-922609-2}}</ref>
The German Constitutional Court refers to the European Union as an ''association of sovereign states'' and affirms that making the EU a federation would require replacement of the German constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/press/bvg09-072en.html |title= Federal Constitutional Court Press Release No. 72/2009 of 30 June 2009.

The Basic Law does not permit the special bodies of the legislative, executive and judicial power to dispose of the essential elements of the constitution, i.e. of the constitutional identity (Article 23.1 sentence 3, Article 79.3 GG). The constitutional identity is an inalienable element of the democratic self-determination of a people.}} <br />The original German uses the word ''Staatenverbund'', which they translate as "association of sovereign states", rather than the word ''Staatenbund'' (confederation) or ''Bundesstaat'' (federation).</ref>

===Governance===
{{Main|Institutions of the European Union|Legislature of the European Union}}
{{Politics of the European Union}}

The European Union has seven institutions: the [[European Parliament]], the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], the [[European Council]], the [[European Central Bank]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] and the [[European Court of Auditors]]. Competencies in scrutinising and amending legislation are divided between the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union while executive tasks are carried out by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The [[monetary policy]] of the [[eurozone]] is governed by the [[European Central Bank]]. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.

====European Council====
[[File:Donald Tusk 2013-12-19.jpg|thumb|upright|125px|left|The [[President of the European Council]], [[Donald Tusk]]]]

The European Council gives direction to the EU, and convenes at least four times a year. It comprises the [[President of the European Council]], the [[President of the European Commission]] and one representative per [[member state of the European Union|member state]]; either its [[head of state]] or [[head of government]]. The European Council has been described by some as the Union's "supreme political authority".<ref name="How work">{{cite web|title=How does the EU work|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://europa.eu/abc/12lessons/lesson_4/index_en.htm|accessdate=12 July 2007}}</ref> It is actively involved in the negotiation of the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaty changes]] and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies.

The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts externally as a "collective [[head of state]]" and [[ratification|ratifies]] important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aMsWxEnaqrUC&pg=PA146 ''With US or against US?: European trends in American perspective''] Parsons, Jabko. European Union Studies Association, p.146:<br>''Fourth, the European Council acts a "collective head of state" for the EU.''</ref>

On 19 November 2009, [[Herman Van Rompuy]] was chosen as the first permanent [[President of the European Council]]. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force and he assumed office. Ensuring the external representation of the EU,<ref name="Council Press Release">{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/111298.pdf|title=President of the European Council|accessdate=24 November 2009|date=24 November 2009|format=PDF|publisher=General Secretariat of the Council of the EU}}</ref> driving consensus and settling divergences among members are tasks for the President both during the convocations of the European Council and in the time periods between them. The European Council should not be mistaken for the [[Council of Europe]], an international organisation independent from the EU.

====European Commission====
[[File:Ioannes Claudius Juncker die 7 Martis 2014.jpg|135px|left|thumb|The [[President of the European Commission|Commission President]], [[Jean-Claude Juncker]]]]

The [[European Commission]] acts as the EU's [[executive (government)|executive arm]] and is responsible for [[Right of initiative (legislative)|initiating legislation]] and the day-to-day running of the EU. The Commission is also seen as the motor of [[European integration]]. It operates as a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet government]], with 28 [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]] for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.

One of the 28 is the [[President of the European Commission|Commission President]] (currently [[Jean-Claude Juncker]]) appointed by the [[European Council]]. After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] who is ''ex-officio'' [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice-President of the Commission]] and is chosen by the European Council too.<ref>[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title III: Provisions on the Institutions#Article 17|Treaty on European Union: Article 17:7]]</ref> The other 26 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the [[Council of the European Union]] (also known as the Council of Ministers) in agreement with the nominated President. The 28 Commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the [[European Parliament]].

====European Parliament====
[[File:European Parliament Strasbourg Hemicycle - Diliff.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[hemicycle]] of the [[European Parliament]] in Strasbourg]]

The [[European Parliament]] forms one half of the [[Legislature of the European Union|EU's legislature]] (the other half is the Council of the European Union).
The 751 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) are directly [[Elections in the European Union|elected]] by [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] every five years on the basis of [[proportional representation]]. Although MEPs are elected on a national basis, they sit according to [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into [[European Parliament constituency|sub-national constituencies]] where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wellfire Interactive |url=http://www.fairvote.org/european-parliament-to-be-elected-with-proportional-representation-systems |title=MEPs must be elected on the basis of proportional representation, the threshold must not exceed 5%, and the electoral area may be subdivided in constituencies if this will not generally affect the proportional nature of the voting system |publisher=Fairvote.org |accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref>

The Parliament and the Council of the European Union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the [[ordinary legislative procedure]]. This also applies to the [[budget of the European Union|EU budget]]. Finally, the Commission is accountable to Parliament, requiring its approval to take office, having to report back to it and subject to motions of censure from it. The [[President of the European Parliament]] carries out the role of speaker in parliament and represents it externally. The EP President and [[Vice President of the European Parliament|Vice-Presidents]] are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.<ref name="Europa Institutions Parliament">{{cite web|title=Institutions: The European Parliament|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/parliament/index_en.htm|accessdate=25 June 2007}}</ref>

====Council of the European Union====
The [[Council of the European Union]] (also called the "Council"<ref>The Latin word ''consilium'' is occasionally used when a single identifier is required, as on [http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ the Council Web site]</ref> and sometimes referred to as the "Council of Ministers")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/pol/inst/index_en.htm |title=Institutional affairs: Council of the European Union |date=6 January 2010 |work=Europa |publisher=European Commission |quote=It is commonly called the Council of Ministers}}</ref> forms the other half of the EU's legislature. It consists of a [[minister (government)|government minister]] from each member state and meets in [[Council of the European Union#Configurations|different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed]]. Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body.<ref name="Europa Institutions Council">{{cite web|title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm|accessdate=25 June 2007}}</ref> In addition to its legislative functions, the Council also exercises [[executive functions]] in relations to the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]].

The [[Court of Auditors]] aims to ensure that the [[budget of the European Union]] has been properly accounted for. The court provides an audit report for each financial year to the Council and the European Parliament. The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission's handling of the budget. The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.<ref name="Europa Institutions Auditors">{{cite web|title=Institutions: Court of Auditors|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref>

===Competences===
EU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/events/2009/index.html|title=Competences and consumers|accessdate=25 November 2010}}</ref>

That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what [[Legislature of the European Union|legislative procedure]] is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area.

The distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories:

Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF |title=Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union |publisher=eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>

The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and [[Preliminary ruling|cases referred to it]] by the courts of member states.<ref>{{cite web |title=Court of Justice: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/#competences |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref> The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts,<ref>{{cite web |title=General Court: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7033/#compet |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref> and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and [[European Civil Service|its civil service]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Civil Service Tribunal: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/T5_5230/#compétence |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref> Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.<ref>Article 256(1) (ex article 225(1)) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]</ref>

===Fundamental rights===
[[File:Remise du Prix Sakharov à Aung San Suu Kyi Strasbourg 22 octobre 2013-14.jpg|right|thumb|The awarding ceremony of the 1990 [[Sakharov Prize]] awarded to [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] (here by [[Martin Schulz]]) inside the Parliament's Strasbourg hemicycle, in 2013.]]
The treaties declare that the EU itself is "founded on the values of respect for [[human dignity]], [[liberty|freedom]], democracy, [[equality before the law|equality]], the [[rule of law]] and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to [[minority group|minorities]]&nbsp;... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail."<ref>[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 2|Article 2, Treaty on European Union (consolidated 1 December 2009)]]</ref>

In 2009 the [[Lisbon Treaty]] gave legal effect to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. The charter is a codified catalogue of [[fundamental right]]s against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the "constitutional traditions common to the member states."<ref>Case 11/70, Internationale Handelsgesellschaft v. Einfuhr und Vorratstelle für Getreide und Futtermittel; Article 6(2) of the Maastricht Treaty (as amended).</ref> The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights.<ref name="europarl-rights">{{cite web |title=Respect for fundamental rights in the EU – general development |publisher=The [[European Parliament]] |work=European Parliament Fact Sheets |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/2_1_1_en.htm |accessdate=6 September 2008}}</ref> The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] was drawn up in 2000. Although originally not legally binding the Charter was frequently cited by the EU's courts as encapsulating rights which the courts had long recognised as the fundamental principles of EU law.
Although signing the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership,<ref group="lower-alpha">It is effectively treated as one of the Copenhagen criteria, [http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta08/ERES1610.htm Assembly.coe.int.] It should be noted that this is a political and not a legal requirement for membership.</ref> previously, the EU itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a state<ref group="lower-alpha">The European Convention on Human Rights was previously only open to members of the [[Council of Europe]] ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm Article 59.1 of the Convention]), and even now only states may become member of the Council of Europe ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/001.htm Article 4 of the Statute of the Council of Europe]).</ref> nor had the competence to accede.<ref group="lower-alpha">Opinion (2/92) of the European Court of Justice on "Accession by the Community to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms" [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61994V0002:FR:NOT 1996 E.C.R. I-1759] (in French), ruled that the European Community did not have the competence to accede to the ECHR.</ref> The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it.

Although, the EU is independent from Council of Europe, they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law, human rights and democracy. Further [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and [[European Social Charter]], the [[source of law]] of [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] are created by Council of Europe. The EU also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.<ref>{{cite web|title=EU Policy on Death Penalty|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/human_rights/adp/index_en.htm|work=Europa|publisher=European Union External Action Service|accessdate=4 June 2013}}</ref>

===Acts===
The main legal acts of the EU come in three forms: [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]], [[Directive (European Union)|directives]], and [[Decision (European Union)|decisions]]. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,<ref group="lower-alpha">See: Case 34/73, ''Variola v. Amministrazione delle Finanze'' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61973J0034:EN:NOT <nowiki>[1973]</nowiki> ECR 981].</ref> and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions.<ref group="lower-alpha" name="art249"/> Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.<ref group="lower-alpha">To do otherwise would require the drafting of legislation which would have to cope with the frequently divergent legal systems and administrative systems of all of the now 28 member states. See Craig and de Búrca, p. 115</ref> When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have [[direct effect]] in national law against member states.

Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in [[competition law]], or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|title=How EU takes decisions|accessdate=November 2010}}</ref>

{{Further|Area of freedom, security and justice}}
[[File:OffeneGrenzeNiederndorf-Oberaudorf.jpg|thumb|right|The borders inside the [[Schengen Area]] between Germany and Austria]]

Since the creation of the EU in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of freedom, security and justice, initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: [[Europol]] for co-operation of police forces,<ref>{{cite web|title=European police office now in full swing|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/police/europol/fsj_police_europol_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}</ref> [[Eurojust]] for co-operation between prosecutors,<ref>{{cite web|title=Eurojust coordinating cross-border prosecutions at EU level|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/eurojust/fsj_criminal_eurojust_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}</ref> and [[Frontex]] for co-operation between border control authorities.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Frontex?|url=http://www.frontex.europa.eu/|author=Frontex|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}</ref> The EU also operates the [[Schengen Information System]]<ref name="Internal borders"/> which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the [[Schengen Agreement]] and the associated cross border crime.

Furthermore, the Union has legislated in areas such as [[European Arrest Warrant|extradition]],<ref>{{cite web|title=European arrest warrant replaces extradition between EU Member States|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}</ref> family law,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33194_en.htm|title=Jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility (Brussels II)|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> asylum law,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33150_en.htm|title=Minimum standards on the reception of applicants for asylum in Member States|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> and criminal justice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_criminal_matters/l10110_en.htm|title=Specific Programme: 'Criminal Justice'|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.<ref group="lower-alpha" name="art39/141 Rome">See Articles 157 (ex Article 141) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]</ref> In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.<ref group="lower-alpha" name="art2(7) Amsterdam">See Article 2(7) of the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0001010001 eur-lex.europa.eu]</ref> By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on [[sexism|sexual discrimination]] in the work-place, [[ageism|age discrimination]], and [[racism|racial discrimination]].<ref group="lower-alpha">Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19 July 2000, p. 22–26); Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (OJ L 303, 2 December 2000, p. 16–22).</ref>

[[File:Federica Mogherini Official.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|The [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]], [[Federica Mogherini]].]]
Foreign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the Common [[Commercial policy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Qualified-Majority Voting: Common commercial policy|url=http://ec.europa.eu/archives/igc2000/geninfo/fact-sheets/fact-sheet6/index_en.htm|accessdate=3 September 2007|publisher=Europa web portal}}</ref> Steps for a more wide ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of [[European Political Cooperation]] which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. It was not, however, until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the [[Single European Act]]. EPC was renamed as the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP) by the [[Maastricht Treaty]].<ref name="EPC">{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm|title=European political co-operation (EPC)|accessdate=3 September 2007|publisher=Europa web portal|author=The European commission|work=Europa Glossary}}</ref>

The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the [[international community]] as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.<ref name="art11 Union">Article 21 of the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] (as inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon), on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]</ref> The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue.

The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] (currently [[Federica Mogherini]]) who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment.

Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]].

Following the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, the [[European Council]] agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the [[Helsinki Headline Goal]] process.

===Internal market===
{{Main|Internal market}}

Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the [[single market]], and a [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]] between its member states. The single market involves [[Internal market|the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU]],<ref name="Europa Single Market">{{cite web|title=The Single Market|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm|accessdate=27 June 2007}}</ref> and the customs union involves the application of a [[common external tariff]] on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or [[import quota]]s, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]] participate in the single market but not in the customs union.<ref name="EEA">{{cite web |url=http://eeas.europa.eu/eea/ |title=The European Economic Area (EEA) |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |accessdate=10 February 2010}}</ref> Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.<ref name="Europa Single Market G">{{cite web|title=A Single Market for goods|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_18_en.htm|accessdate=27 June 2007}}</ref>

Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.<ref name="Europa Single Market C">{{cite web|title=A Single Market for Capital|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_42_en.htm|accessdate=27 June 2007}}</ref> Until the drive towards [[economic and monetary union]] the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.

The free movement of persons means that [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.<ref name="Europa Single Market P">{{cite web|title=Living and working in the Single Market|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_15_en.htm|author=European Commission|accessdate=27 June 2007}}</ref>

The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60–70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed [[Directive on services in the internal market]] which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.<ref name="Europa Single Market S">{{cite web |title=A Single Market for Services |publisher=Europa |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_19_en.htm |author=European Commission |accessdate=27 June 2007}}</ref> According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.

===Competition===

The EU operates a [[European Union competition law|competition policy]] intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.<ref group="lower-alpha">Article 3(1)(g) of the Treaty of Rome</ref> The Commission as the competition regulator for the single market is responsible for antitrust issues, approving [[mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], breaking up cartels, working for [[economic liberalism|economic liberalisation]] and preventing [[subsidy|state aid]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Europa web portal|title=Competition: making markets work better|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/index_en.html|accessdate=12 November 2007}}</ref>

===Monetary union===
{{Main|Eurozone|Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union}}
[[File:European Central Bank - building under construction - Frankfurt - Germany - 13.jpg|thumb|170px|The [[Seat of the European Central Bank|seat]] of the [[European Central Bank|Central Bank]] in [[Frankfurt]]. [[Eurozone|19]] of the 28 member states of the union have adopted the [[euro]] as their [[legal tender]].]]

The creation of a [[European Currency Unit|European single currency]] became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. In 1992, after having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and were legally bound to fulfill the agreed-on rules including the [[Euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]] if they wanted to join the [[Currency union|monetary union]]. The states wanting to participate had first to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]].

In 1999 the currency union started, first as an accounting currency with [[History of the euro|eleven member states]] joining. In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when [[euro banknotes|euro notes]] and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 19 countries, the most recent being Lithuania which joined on 1 January 2015. Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Sweden decided not to join the euro.<ref>{{cite news |title=Almunia says 'undesirable' to act on Sweden's euro refusal |first1=Teresa |last1=Kuchler |publisher=EUobserver.com |date=25 October 2006 |url=http://euobserver.com/9/22733 |accessdate=26 December 2006}}</ref><ref group="lower-alpha">In order to meet the euro convergence criteria it is necessary first to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], something Sweden has declined to do: {{cite web |title=ERM II |publisher=Danish Finance Ministry |date=20 March 2009 |url=http://uk.fm.dk/Portfolio/International%20cooperation/EU%20economic%20and%20political%20coordination/ERM2.aspx |accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref>

Since its launch the euro has become the second [[reserve currency]] in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_DE-PROD/PROD0000000000209994.PDF|title=Euro riding high as an international reserve currency|date=4 May 2007|publisher=Deutsche Bank AG|format=PDF|author=DB Research|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html|title=ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem|publisher=European Central Bank|accessdate=15 September 2007}}</ref>

The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls [[monetary policy]] in that area with an agenda to maintain [[price stability]]. It is at the centre of the [[European System of Central Banks]], which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council, consisting of the [[President of the European Central Bank|President of the ECB]], who is appointed by the European Council, the Vice-President of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 28 EU member states.<ref name="ECB org">{{cite web|title=ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem|publisher=European Central Bank|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html|accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

The [[European System of Financial Supervision]] is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the [[European Banking Authority]], the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and the [[European Securities and Markets Authority]]. To complement this framework, there is also a [[European Systemic Risk Board]] under the responsibility of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]. The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/?aid=30866|title=Europe seals deal on financial supervision|work=euobserver.com}}</ref>

To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfill important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level.

Some states joined the euro but violated these rules and contracts to an extent that they slid into a [[European debt crisis|debt crisis]] and had to be financially supported with emergency rescue funds. These states were Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and Spain.

Even though the Maastricht treaty forbids eurozone states to assume the debts of other states ("bailout"), various emergency rescue funds had been created by the members to support the debt crisis states to meet their financial obligations and buy time for reforms that those states can gain back their competitiveness.

To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the [[Third World|developing world]].<ref name="Guardian CAP">{{cite news|last=Jeffery|first=Simon|title=The EU common agricultural policy|work=The Guardian  |date=26 June 2007|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/26/eu.politics1|accessdate=30 August 2007|location=London}}</ref>

The overproduction has also been criticised for encouraging environmentally unfriendly intensive farming methods.<ref name="Guardian CAP"/> Supporters of CAP say that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living, in what would otherwise be an economically unviable way of life. However, the EU's small farmers receive only 8% of CAP's available subsidies.<ref name="Guardian CAP"/>

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of [[set-aside]] in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas (by the McSharry reforms in 1992) and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels, while maintaining agricultural income levels.<ref name="stead"/> One of these reforms entailed the abolition of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.<ref name="EC CAP">{{cite web|title=Sugar: Commission proposes more market-, consumer- and trade-friendly regime|publisher=Europa|date=14 April 2007|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/04/915&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en|accessdate=30 August 2007}}</ref>

Basic education is an area where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the [[Erasmus Programme]], a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20&nbsp;years, it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5&nbsp;million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Erasmus programme celebrates its 20th anniversary|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html|accessdate=21 July 2007}}; {{cite web|last=Jean-Sébastien|first=Lefebvre|title=Erasmus turns 20 – time to grow up?|date=22 January 2007|publisher=Café Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/19702/erasmus-turns-20-time-to-grow-up.html|accessdate=10 August 2007}}</ref>

There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in [[vocational education|vocational education and training]], and for adult learners in the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]]. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.<ref>{{cite web|author=EACEA|title=About the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index.htm|accessdate=21 July 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lifelong Learning Programme|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/national_en.html|accessdate=21 July 2007}}</ref> Through its support of the [[Bologna Process]], the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.

Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programmes]], the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent [[European Research Council]] allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the ERC?|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Research Council|url=http://erc.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&topicID=12|accessdate=21 July 2007}}</ref> EU [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|research and technological framework programmes]] deal in a number of areas, for example energy where it aims to develop a diverse mix of [[renewable energy]] for the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Energy|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm?pg=energy|accessdate=12 November 2007}}</ref>

===Health care===
{{further|Healthcare in Europe}}
[[File:Carte Européenne d'Assurance Maladie France.jpg|thumb|left|[[European Health Insurance Card]].<br> (French version pictured)]]

Although the EU has no major competences in the field of health care, Article 35 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms that "A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities". All the member states have either publicly sponsored and regulated [[universal health care]] or publicly provided universal health care. The [[European Commission]]'s [[Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Health and Consumers]] seeks to align national laws on the protection of people's health, on the consumers' rights, on the safety of food and other products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/about_us/our_vision_en.htm |title=Europa web portal |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/index_en.htm |title=Europa web portal |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health-eu/index_en.htm |title=Europa web portal |work=Europa (web portal) |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref>

Health care in the EU is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level. The systems are primarily [[Publicly funded health care|publicly funded]] through taxation (universal health care). Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private (non-subsidised) health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

All EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free [[European Health Insurance Card]] which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/Healthcareabroad/pages/Healthcareabroad.aspx |title=info about health care and EHIC |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref> A directive on cross-border healthcare aims at promoting co-operation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare for European patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/lsa/119514.pdf |title=Consilium.europa.eu |format=PDF |accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:088:0045:0065:EN:PDF |title=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsconfed.org/Publications/Factsheets/Pages/Cross-border-healthcare-commissioners.aspx |title=NHSconfed.org |publisher=NHSconfed.org |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref>

{{Main|Sport policies of the European Union|Sport in Europe}}

Sport is mainly the responsibility of an individual member states or other international organisations rather than that of the EU. However, there are some EU policies that have had an impact on sport, such as the free movement of workers which was at the core of the [[Bosman ruling]], which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship.<ref name="BBC Boseman">{{cite news |last=Fordyce |first=Tom |title=10&nbsp;years since Bosman|publisher=BBC News |date=11 July 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4528732.stm|accessdate=13 July 2007}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity.<ref>Cases C-403/08 and C-429/08, Opinon of Advocate General Kokott, para 207</ref> This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the [[International Olympic Committee]] and [[FIFA]], due to objections over the applications of free market principles to sport which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs.<ref name="IHT RT">{{cite news|title=IOC, FIFA presidents welcomes new EU treaty, call it breakthrough to give sports more power|work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=19 October 2007 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/19/sports/EU-SPT-OLY-EU-Treaty.php |accessdate=21 October 2007}}</ref> The EU does fund a programme for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/israel/press_corner/all_news/news/2011/20110329_01_en.htm |title=Sports coaches from Israel travel to UK for training |publisher=Eeas.europa.eu |date=29 March 2011 |accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref>

The [[Flag of Europe|flag of the union]] consists of a [[Circle of stars|circle of]] 12 golden stars on a blue field. The blue represents the west, while the number and position of the stars represent completeness and unity, respectively.<ref name="36th">{{Citation|title=Thirty-sixth meeting of the ministers' deputies: resolution (55) 32|publisher=Council of Europe|date=9 December 1955|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/fonds/themes/flags/Res(55)32_en.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2008}}</ref> Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe, the flag was adopted by the [[European Communities]], the predecessors of the present union, in 1986. ''[[Motto of the European Union|United in Diversity]]'' was adopted as the motto of the union in the year 2000, having been selected from [[A motto for Europe|proposals]] submitted by school pupils.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zg8qsGtZgZsC&pg=PA110&dq=in+varietate+concordia&cd=2#v=onepage&q=in%20varietate%20concordia&f=false |title=In varietate concordia is the Latin motto chosen by European citizens in 2000.

The [[Anthem of Europe|anthem of the union]] is an instrumental version of the prelude to the ''[[Ode to Joy]]'', the 4th movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|ninth symphony]]. The anthem was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985 and has since been played on official occasions.<ref>[http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp Emblemes] {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp |date=20091219175535 }}</ref>

Besides naming the continent, the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] has frequently been employed as a [[National personification|personification]] of Europe. Known from the myth in which [[Zeus]] seduces her in the guise of a white bull, Europa has also been referred to in relation to the present union. Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the Union's institutions, and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of [[Euro banknotes]]. The bull is for its part depicted on all residence permit cards.<ref>{{cite book|last= Demey |first= Thierry |others= S.

[[Charlemagne|Charles the Great]], also known as Charlemagne ({{lang-la|Carolus Magnus}}), established [[Carolingian Empire|an empire]] that represented the most expansive European unification since the Roman era, and thereby founded what became the [[List of French monarchs|French]] and [[List of German monarchs|German]] monarchies.<ref name="ReferenceA">Riché, Preface xviii, Pierre Riché reflects: "[H]e enjoyed an exceptional destiny, and by the length of his reign, by his conquests, legislation and legendary stature, he also profoundly marked the history of Western Europe."</ref><ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>[http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/santiago/histchrl.html humnet.ucla.edu]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karlspreis.de/preistraeger/seine_heiligkeit_papst_johannes_paul_ii/ansprache_von_seiner_heiligkeit_papst_johannes_paul_ii.html |title=karlspreis.de |publisher=karlspreis.de |accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref><ref>Chamberlin, Russell, ''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. ???</ref> Known as ''Pater Europae'' («Father of Europe»),<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karlspreis.de/preistraeger/seine_heiligkeit_papst_johannes_paul_ii/ansprache_von_seiner_heiligkeit_papst_johannes_paul_ii.html |title=Der Karlspreisträger Seine Heiligkeit Papst Johannes Paul II. außerordentlicher Karlspreis 2004 |publisher=Karlspreis.de |accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref> he enjoyed an important afterlife in European culture. The present symbolic relevance of Charlemagne pertains to his embodiment of Franco-German relations, on which European integration relies. The Commission has named [[Charlemagne building|one of its central buildings]] in Brussels after Charlemagne, and the German city of [[Aachen]] has since 1949 awarded the [[Charlemagne Prize]] to champions of European unification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karlspreis.de/en/laureates|title=Laureates|work=karlspreis.de}}</ref> Since 2008, the organisers of this prize, in conjunction with the European Parliament, have awarded the [[European Charlemagne Youth Prize|Charlemagne Youth Prize]] in recognition of similar efforts by young people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlemagneyouthprize.eu/|title=Winners 2015|work=charlemagneyouthprize.eu}}</ref>

Religious symbols of Europe and its integration include [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]], who in 1964 was named patron saint of Europe by [[Pope Paul VI]], and [[Jadwiga of Poland|Saint Hedwig]], who in 1997 was canonised as [[patron saint]] of European unification by [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=57724|title=News Features|work=catholicculture.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talismancoins.com/servlet/Detail?no=416 |title=talismancoins.com |publisher=talismancoins.com |date=1 September 1939 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref>
