==Etymology==
The origin of the word ''cocktail'' is disputed.

The first recorded use of the word ''cocktail'' not referring to a horse is found in ''The Morning Post and Gazetteer in London, England'' on March 20, 1798:<ref>{{cite book

The [[Oxford English dictionary]] cites the word as originating in the U.S. The first recorded use of the word ''cocktail'' as a beverage (possibly non-alcoholic) in the United States appears in ''The Farmer's Cabinet'' on April 28, 1803:<ref>{{cite book

The first definition of ''cocktail'' known to be an alcoholic beverage appeared in the May 13, 1806, edition of  ''The Balance and Columbian Repository'', a publication in [[Hudson, New York]], in which an answer was provided to the question, "What is a cocktail?". The editor [[Harry Croswell]] replied:

{{quote|''Cock-tail'' is a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and [[bitters]]—it is vulgarly called ''bittered sling'', and is supposed to be an excellent electioneering potion, in as much as it renders the heart stout and bold, at the same time that it fuddles the head. It is said, also to be of great use to a [[United States Democratic-Republican Party|democratic]] candidate: because a person, having swallowed a glass of it, is ready to swallow any thing else.<ref>[http://www.imbibemagazine.com/images/Balance_5-13-1806.pdf ''The Balance and Columbian Repository''], May 13, 1806, No. 19, Vol. V, page 146</ref>}}

In New Orleans, the [[Sazarac]] was prepared using an eggcup measure as a [[shot glass|jigger]]. The French for eggcup is "coquetier" (pron. cock-a-tshay) and it is likely that the English word cocktail is simply a gastronomic loan-word from the French.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Several authors have theorised that the word ''cocktail'' may be a corruption of ''[[cock ale]]''.<ref>{{Citation | title = cocktail, n. and adj. | url = http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/35499 | publisher = oed.com | edition = Third | date = June 2011 | origyear = 2005 | subscription = yes}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Chrysti | title = Verbivore's feast: a banquet of word & phrase origins | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=neH-xQQWbowC | publisher = Farcountry Press | location = Helena, MT | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-56037-265-6 |p=68}}</ref><ref>* {{Citation | last = Powers | first = Madelon | title = Faces along the bar: lore and order in the workingman's saloon, 1870-1920 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=99IDuIGxckcC | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | pp=272–273}}</ref>

The first publication of a [[bartender]]s' guide which included cocktail recipes was in 1862 — ''How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion'', by "Professor" [[Jerry Thomas (bartender)|Jerry Thomas]]. In addition to listings of recipes for punches, sours, slings, cobblers, shrubs, toddies, flips, and a variety of other types of mixed drinks were 10 recipes for drinks referred to as "cocktails". A key ingredient which differentiated cocktails from other drinks in this compendium was the use of [[bitters]] as an ingredient. Mixed drinks popular today that conform to this original meaning of "cocktail" include the [[Old Fashioned]] whiskey cocktail, the [[Sazerac]] cocktail, and the [[Manhattan (cocktail)|Manhattan]] cocktail.

The first "cocktail party" ever thrown was allegedly by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], in May 1917.  Mrs. Walsh invited 50 guests to her home at noon on a Sunday. The party lasted an hour, until lunch was served at 1 pm. The site of this first cocktail party still stands. In 1924, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis]] bought the Walsh mansion at 4510 Lindell Boulevard, and it has served as the local archbishop's residence ever since.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119161653517750477.html | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | title=St. Louis -- Party Central | first=Eric | last=Felten | date=October 6, 2007}}</ref>

During [[Prohibition in the United States]] (1919–1933), when alcoholic beverages were illegal, cocktails were still consumed illegally in establishments known as [[speakeasy|speakeasies]]. The quality of liquor available during Prohibition was much worse than previously.<ref name=Regan>{{cite book

Sweet cocktails were easier to drink quickly, an important consideration when the establishment might be raided at any moment.

Cocktails became less popular in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, until resurging in the 1980s with [[vodka]] often substituting the original gin in drinks such as the [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]]. Traditional cocktails began to make a comeback in the 2000s<ref>{{cite book
