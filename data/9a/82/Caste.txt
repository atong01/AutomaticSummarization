The English word "caste" derives from the Spanish and Portuguese ''[[casta]]'', which the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' quotes [[John Minsheu]]'s Spanish dictionary (1599) to mean, "race, lineage, or breed".<ref name=oed-caste>{{cite web|publisher = Oxford English Dictionary|year = 1989|title=Caste, n|url=http://www.oed.com}}</ref>  When the Spanish colonized the New World, they used the word to mean a "clan or lineage."

Historically, the caste system in India has consisted of thousands of [[endogamous group]]s called ''Jatis'' or ''Quoms'' (among Muslims).

===Nepal===
{{Main|Caste system in Nepal}}
The [[Nepal]]ese caste system resembles that of the Indian [[Jāti]] system with numerous Jāti divisions with a Varna system superimposed for a rough equivalence. But since the culture and the society is different some of the things are different. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the Lichchhavi period.  Jayasthiti Malla (1382–95) categorized Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506–75). The Hindu social code was later set up in Gorkha by Ram Shah (1603–36).

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Caste system among South Asian Muslims}}

Religious, historical and sociocultural factors have helped define the bounds of endogamy for Muslims in some parts of [[Pakistan]]. There is a preference for endogamous marriages based on the clan-oriented nature of the society, which values and actively seeks similarities in social group identity based on several factors, including religious, sectarian, ethnic, and tribal/clan affiliation. Religious affiliation is itself multilayered and includes religious considerations other than being Muslim, such as sectarian identity (e.g. Shia or Sunni, etc.) and religious orientation within the sect (Isnashari, [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]], [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmedi]], etc.).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Both ethnic affiliation (e.g. [[Pashtuns|Pathan]], [[Sindhis|Sindhi]], [[Baloch_people|Baloch]], [[Punjabis|Punjabi]], etc.) and membership of specific biraderis or zaat/quoms are additional integral components of social identity.<ref name="barth">{{cite book | last = Barth | first = Fredrik | editor = E.

===Sri Lanka===
{{Main|Caste system in Sri Lanka}}
The caste system in Sri Lanka is a division of society into strata,<ref name="John Rogers 51–77"/> influenced by the textbook Varnas and Jāti system found in India. Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the British/Kandyan period Kadayimpoth - Boundary books as well, indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka's monarchy.

[[Bali]]nese caste structure has been described in early 20th-century European literature to be based on three categories – triwangsa (thrice born) or the nobility, dwijati (twice born) in contrast to ekajati (once born) the low folks. Four statuses were identified in these sociological studies, spelled a bit differently from the caste categories for India:<ref name=boon>{{cite book|title=The Anthropological Romance of Bali 1597-1972: Dynamic Perspectives in Marriage and Caste, Politics and Religion|author=James Boon|year=1977|isbn=0-521-21398-3}}</ref>

*Satrias - knighthood
*Wesias - commerce
*Sudras - servitude

The Brahmana caste was further subdivided by these Dutch ethnographers into two: Siwa and Buda. The Siwa caste was subdivided into five &ndash; Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher caste Brahmana men with lower caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to ''castas'' in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.<ref name=boon/>

====China and Mongolia====

During the period of [[Yuan Dynasty]], ruler [[Kublai Khan]] enforced a ''Four Class System'', which was a legal caste system. The order of four classes of people was maintained by the information of the descending order were:-
* [[Mongols|Mongolian]]
* [[Semu]] people
* [[Han Chinese|Han]] people (in the northern areas of China)
* Southerners (people of the former Southern [[Song dynasty]])

Some scholars notes that it was a kind of psychological indication that the earlier they submitted to Mongolian people, the higher social status they would have. The 'Four Class System' and its people received different treatment in political, legal, and military affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/history/yuan/four-class-system.htm |title='Four-Class System' of Yuan Dynasty |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref><ref>"The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States, 710-1368", by Denis C.

====Japan====
{{Main|Edo society}}
[[File:Samurai and servant.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[samurai]] of importance and servant.]]

In Japan's history, social strata based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles ([[kuge]]), together with the Shogun and daimyo. Below them the population was divided into [[Four occupations|four classes]] in a system known as ''mibunsei'' (身分制). These were: [[samurai]], peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only the samurai class was allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants and other craftsmen and merchants whom he felt were disrespectful. Craftsmen produced products, being the third, and the last merchants were thought to be as the meanest class because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, the peasant caste were labelled as ''furiuri'', ''tanagari'', ''mizunomi-byakusho'' amongst others. The castes and sub-classes, as in Europe, were from the same race, religion and culture.

Howell, in his review of [[Japan]]ese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan|author=David L. Howell|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24085-5|year=2005}}</ref>

De Vos and Wagatsuma observe that a systematic and extensive caste system was part of the Japanese society. They also discuss how alleged caste impurity and alleged racial inferiority, concepts often quickly assumed to be slightly different, are superficial terms, two faces of identical inner psychological processes, which expressed themselves in Japan and other countries of the world.<ref name=gdvhw>{{cite book|title=Japan's invisible race: caste in culture and personality|author=George De Vos and Hiroshi Wagatsuma|publisher=University of California Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0-520-00306-4}}</ref>

[[Japan]] had its own untouchable caste, shunned and ostracized, historically referred to by the insulting term ''Eta'', now called ''[[Burakumin]]''.

The [[baekjeong]] (백정) were an “untouchable” outcaste group of Korea. The meaning today is that of butcher. They originate from the [[Goryeo-Khitan Wars|Khitan invasion of Korea]] in the 11th century. The defeated [[Khitans]] who had surrendered were settled in isolated communities throughout Goryeo to forestall rebellion.  They were valued for their skills in hunting, herding, butchering, and making of leather, common skill sets among nomads.  Over time their ethnic origin was forgotten, and they formed the bottom layer of Korean society. It was legally abolished in Korea in 1894 but remained extant in reality until 1930.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 Encyclopædia Britannica - Slavery]</ref><ref>[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/03.22/35-mm.html Edward Willett Wagner - The Harvard University Gazette]</ref><ref>[http://ideas.repec.org/p/snu/ioerwp/no26.html Korean Nobi]</ref>

In 1392, with the foundation of the Confucian [[Joseon dynasty]], Korea systemised its own native class system. At the top were the two official classes, the [[Yangban]], which literally means "two classes." It was composed of scholars (Munban) and warriors (Muban). Within the Yangban class, the Scholars (Munban) enjoyed a significant social advantage over the warrior (Muban) class.

Beneath the Yangban class were the ''Jung-in'' (중인-中人: literally "middle people"). They were the technicians. This class was small and specialized in fields such as medicine, accounting, translators, regional bureaucrats, etc.

Beneath the Jung-in were the ''Sangmin'' (상민-常民: literally 'commoner'). These were independent farmers working their own fields.

Korea had a very large [[serf]] population, ''nobi'', ranging from a third to half of the entire population for most of the millennium between the [[Silla]] period and the [[Joseon Dynasty]].

The opening of Korea to foreign Christian missionary activity in the late 19th century saw some improvement in the status of the ''baekjeong''; however, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and protests erupted when missionaries attempted to integrate them into worship services, with non-''baekjeong'' finding such an attempt insensitive to traditional notions of hierarchical advantage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Also around the same time, the baekjeong began to resist the open social discrimination that existed against them.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=In Search of Human Rights: The Paekchŏng Movement in Colonial Korea|title=Colonial Modernity in Korea|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|editor=Gi-Wook Shin and Michael Robinson|year=1999|pages=326|isbn=0-674-00594-5}}</ref> They focused on social and economic injustices affecting the baekjeong, hoping to create an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] Korean society. Their efforts included attacking social discrimination by the upper class, authorities, and "commoners," and the use of degrading language against children in public schools.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Korean Paekjŏng under Japanese rule: the quest for equality and human rights|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|year=2003|pages=147}}</ref>

With the [[Gabo reform]] of 1896, the class system of Korea was officially abolished. Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]], the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists’ cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.<ref name="proper">Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California. ''Citizenship, Social Equality and Government Reform: Changes in the Household Registration System in Korea, 1894-1910''</ref>

While most Koreans by that time had surnames and even [[bongwan]], although still substantial number of [[cheonmin]], mostly consisted of [[serfs]] and slaves, and [[Untouchability|untouchables]] did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters’ surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term ''Inmin''(people) and later, ''Kungmin''(citizen).<ref name="proper"/>

====Tibet====

Heidi Fjeld has put forth the argument that pre-1950s Tibetan society was functionally a caste system, in contrast to previous scholars who defined the Tibetan social class system as similar to European feudal serfdom, as well as non-scholarly western accounts which seek to romanticize a supposedly 'egalitarian' ancient Tibetan society.

Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.<ref name=Obinna1/>

The ''osu'' class systems of eastern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the "Osus" people as "owned by deities" and outcasts.

The Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders.<ref>[http://www.africankingdoms.com African Kingdoms Songhai Class System]</ref>

In a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Ivory Coast]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo|author=Dolores Richter|journal=Africa|date= January 1980|volume=50|pages=37–54|doi=10.2307/1158641}}</ref>

Similarly, the [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.

Tamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the ''Malinke'' people no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.

As West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.<ref name=tamari1>{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1991|volume=32|pages=221–250|doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718|title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa|author=Tal Tamari}}</ref>

====Central Africa====
Ethel M. Albert in 1960 claimed that the societies in [[Central Africa]] were caste-like social stratification systems.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Socio-Political Organization and Receptivity to Change: Some Differences between Ruanda and Urundi|author=Ethel M. Albert|journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology|volume=16|number= 1|date= Spring 1960|pages=46–74}}</ref> Similarly, in 1961, Maquet notes that the society in [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] can be best described as castes.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Premise of Inequality in Ruanda: A Study of Political Relations in a Central African Kingdom|author= Jacques J. Maquet|year=1962|pages=135–171|publisher=Oxford University Press, London|isbn=978-0-19-823168-4}}</ref> The [[Tutsi]], noted Maquet, considered themselves as superior, with the more numerous [[Hutu]] and the least numerous [[Twa]] regarded, by birth, as respectively, second and third in the hierarchy of Rwandese society. These groups were largely endogamous, exclusionary and with limited mobility.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Power in Ruanda|author=Helen Codere|journal=Anthropologica|volume=4|number=1|year=1962|pages=45–85|jstor=25604523}}</ref> Maquet's theories have been controversial.

====Horn of Africa====
[[File:NSRW Africa Midgan.png|thumb|upright|The [[Madhiban]] (Midgan) specialize in leather occupation. Along with the Tumal and Yibir, they are collectively known as ''sab''.<ref name="Lewis"/>]]
In a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Ethiopia in communities such as the [[Gurage people|Gurage]] and [[Konso people|Konso]]. He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.<ref>{{cite journal|title=LA CASTE EN AFRIQUE? (Caste in Africa?)|author=D. M. Todd|journal=Africa|date=October 1977|volume=47 |pages= 398–412|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7903506|doi=10.2307/1158345}}</ref> [[Alula Pankhurst]] has published a study of caste groups in SW Ethiopia.<ref>Pankhurst, Alula. 1999. ‘“Caste” in Africa: the evidence from south-western Ethiopia reconsidered’. ''Africa'' 69(4), pp.485-509.</ref>

Among the [[Kingdom of Kafa|Kafa]], there were also traditionally groups labeled as castes. "Based on research done before the Derg regime, these studies generally presume the existence of a social hierarchy similar to the caste system. At the top of this hierarchy were the Kafa, followed by occupational groups including blacksmiths (Qemmo), weavers (Shammano), bards (Shatto), potters, and tanners (Manno). In this hierarchy, the Manjo were commonly referred to as hunters, given the lowest status equal only to slaves."<ref>p. 299. Sayuri Yoshida. Why did the Manjo convert to Protestant?

Aspen, Birhanu Teferra and Shiferaw Bekele, Trondheim 2009. p. 299-309.</ref>

The [[Borana Oromo]] of southern [[Ethiopia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] also have a class system, wherein the Wata, an acculturated hunter-gatherer group, represent the lowest class. Though the Wata today speak the [[Oromo language]], they have traditions of having previously spoken another language before adopting Oromo.<ref name="Westermann">{{cite book|last=Diedrich Westermann|first=Edwin William Smith, Cyril Daryll Forde|title=Africa|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=853}}</ref>

The traditionally nomadic [[Somali people]] are divided into clans, wherein the [[Rahanweyn]] agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the [[Madhiban]] were traditionally sometimes treated as outcasts.<ref>I. M. Lewis, ''A pastoral democracy: a study of pastoralism and politics among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa'', (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster: 1999), pp.13-14</ref> As Gabboye, the Madhiban along with the [[Yibir]] and Tumaal (collectively referred to as ''sab'') have since obtained political representation within [[Somalia]], and their general social status has improved with the expansion of urban centers.<ref name="Lewis">{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.M.|title=Understanding Somalia and Somaliland: Culture, History, Society|year=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231700849|pages=8}}</ref>

===Europe===

====France and Spain====
For centuries, through the modern times, the majority regarded [[Cagot]]s of western [[France]] and northern [[Spain]] as an inferior caste, the untouchables. While they had the same skin color and religion as the majority, in the churches they had to use segregated doors, drink from segregated fonts, and receive communion on the end of long wooden spoons. It was a closed social system. The socially isolated Cagots were endogamous, and chances of social mobility non-existent.<ref>{{cite news|title=The last untouchable in Europe|author=Sean Thomas|date=28 July 2008|publisher=The Independent, United Kingdom|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-last-untouchable-in-europe-878705.html|location=London}}</ref><ref name="Hansson1996">{{cite book|author=Anders Hansson|title=Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&pg=PA15|year=1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10596-6|pages=15–16}}</ref>
