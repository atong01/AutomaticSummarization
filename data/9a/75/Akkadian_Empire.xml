Flood levels, that had been stable from about 3,000 to 2,600 BC, had started falling, and by the Akkadian period were a half-meter to a meter lower than recorded previously. Even so, the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the Nile; serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems.

Nomadic Amorites from the northwest would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, they would have to pay a tax in wool, meat, milk, and cheese to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem,<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last1">Bourke</arg><arg name="first1">Stephen</arg><arg name="title">The Middle East: the cradle of civilization revealed</arg><arg name="date">2008</arg><arg name="publisher">Thames & Hudson</arg><arg name="isbn">9780500251478</arg><arg name="page">89</arg></template></extension><space/>and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.</paragraph><paragraph>As a result, Sumer and Akkad had a surplus of agricultural products but was short of almost everything else, particularly metal ores, timber and building stone, all of which had to be imported.

She likens Inanna to a great storm bird who swoops down on the lesser gods and sends them fluttering off like surprised bats. Then, in probably the most interesting part of the hymn, Enheduanna herself steps forward in the first person to recite her own past glories, establishing her credibility, and explaining her present plight. She has been banished as high priestess from the temple in the city of Ur and from Uruk and exiled to the steppe. She begs the moon god Nanna to intercede for her because the city of Uruk, under the ruler Lugalanne, has rebelled against Sargon. The rebel, Lugalanne, has even destroyed the temple Eanna, one of the greatest temples in the ancient world, and then made advances on his sister-in-law.<extension extension_name='ref'>Binkley, Roberta, &quot;The Importance of Enheduanna&quot;</extension></listitem></list><heading level='3'>The Curse</heading><paragraph>Later material described how the fall of Akkad was due to Naram-Sin's attack upon the city of Nippur.
