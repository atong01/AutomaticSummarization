His younger sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (18751890), died at the age of fifteen, probably of appendicitis, when Coolidge was eighteen.

The only hope of perfecting human relationships is in accordance with the law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give. Yet people are entitled to the rewards of their industry. What they earn is theirs, no matter how small or how great. But the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service...&quot;<template><target>sfn</target><arg>White</arg><arg name="pp">23–44</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>At his father's urging after graduation, Coolidge moved to<space/><link><target>Northampton, Massachusetts</target></link><space/>to become a lawyer.

He practiced commercial law, believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.<template><target>sfnm</target><arg>Fuess</arg><arg></arg><arg name="1pp">74–81</arg><arg>McCoy</arg><arg></arg><arg name="2pp">22–26</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Marriage and family</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Grace Coolidge.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>upright</part><part><link><target>Grace Coolidge</target></link></part></link>In 1905 Coolidge met<space/><link><target>Grace Coolidge</target><part>Grace Anna Goodhue</part></link>, a University of Vermont graduate and teacher at the<space/><link><target>Clarke School for the Deaf</target></link>, they were in the same crowd boating, picnicking and dancing the younger ones of the Congregational Church. That year they were engaged in early summer and married in October after an attempt in vain by Grace's mother to postpone the vows she was never enamored with him nor he with her. The newlyweds went on honeymoon to Montreal, originally planned for two weeks but cut short by a week at Coolidge's request. After 25 years he wrote of Grace, &quot;...for almost a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities and I have rejoiced in her graces&quot;.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>White</arg><arg name="p">61</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Being consistently loyal, he was a devoted husband, but also could be self-centered, undemonstrative and reserved, and often grumpy; and there was the ubiquitous mistress of politics. But Grace knew all of this when she married him, in addition to recognizing in him a man of solid character. She was amiable, tolerant and possessed of an understanding heart. She could mimic her husband's peculiarities and did so to the amusement of family and friends, but without mocking him meanly. She knew his great strengths and understood his minor weaknesses. Socially, she was as quick witted as he and of greater maturity; she supplemented his natural shyness with a graceful candor, and offset his occasional lapses into taciturnity with a gay loquacity that could keep a dinner table conversation going.</paragraph><paragraph>Coolidge was quite frugal when it came to securing a home. They rented. Coolidge did not like to be beholden to bankers or anyone else, for that matter. Independence was his way of protecting his freedom to do what was right. The same impulse caused him to hesitate before joining clubs. Henry Field had a pew in Edwards Church, and Grace was a member, but Coolidge only went along. His decision infuriated his colleagues in politics; after all, the more clubs one joined, the more friends one had at election time. But Coolidge found another way to connect with fellow citizens: he deposited savings with a variety of institutions. Each additional banker who held some of his money was an additional pair of eyes that would follow him, and likely be an additional vote.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Shlaes</arg><arg name="p">91</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The Coolidges had two sons:<space/><link><target>John Coolidge</target><part>John</part></link><space/>(September 7, 1906 May 31, 2000) and Calvin (April 13, 1908 July 7, 1924).

[As president, I am] one who feels a responsibility for living up to the traditions and maintaining the principles of the Republican Party. Our Constitution guarantees equal rights to all our citizens, without discrimination on account of race or color. I have taken my oath to support that Constitution. It is the source of your rights and my rights. I propose to regard it, and administer it, as the source of the rights of all the people, whatever their belief or race. A colored man is precisely as much entitled to submit his candidacy in a party primary, as is any other citizen. The decision must be made by the constituents to whom he offers himself, and by nobody else.{{sfn|Coolidge|1926|pages">71-72}}</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Speaking before a group of naturalized Americans at the White House in October 1924, Coolidge stressed tolerance of differences as an American value and thanked immigrants for their contributions to U.S. society, saying that they have &quot;contributed much to making our country what it is.&quot; He stated that although the diversity of peoples was a detrimental source of conflict and tension in Europe, it was peculiar for the United States that it was a &quot;harmonious&quot; benefit for the country. Coolidge further stated the United States should assist and help immigrants who come to the country, and urged immigrants to reject &quot;<link><target>Racism</target><part>race hatreds</part></link>&quot; and &quot;<link><target>Bigotry</target><part>prejudices</part></link>&quot;:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg name="Among these I should place, first, the broadly tolerant attitude that has been a characteristic of this country.

As a Nation, our first duty must be to those who are already our inhabitants, whether native or immigrants. To them we owe an especial and a weighty obligation. They came to us with stout hearts and high hopes of bettering their estate. They have contributed much to making our country what it is. ... They cannot help other nations by bringing old world race prejudices and race hatreds into action here. In fact, they can best help other countries by scrupulously avoiding any such motives.{{sfn|Coolidge|1926|pages">159-156}}</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>In December 1924, Coolidge delivered his second State of the Union address, in which he commended African-Americans for their advances, and stressed that their constitutional rights should be respected and protected:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>These developments have brought about a very remarkable improvement in the condition of the negro race. Gradually, but surely, with the almost universal sympathy of those among whom they live, the colored people are working out their own destiny.
