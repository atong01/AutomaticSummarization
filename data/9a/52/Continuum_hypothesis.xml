However, this intuitive analysis does not take account of the fact that all three sets are<space/><link><target>infinite set</target><part>infinite</part></link>.

The continuum hypothesis and the<space/><link><target>axiom of choice</target></link><space/>were among the first mathematical statements shown to be independent of ZF set theory.

Gdel was a<space/><link><target>Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism</target><part>platonist</part></link><space/>and therefore had no problems with asserting the truth and falsehood of statements independent of their provability. Cohen, though a<space/><link><target>Formalism (mathematics)</target><part>formalist</part></link><space/><template><target>harv</target><arg>Goodman</arg><arg>1979</arg></template>, also tended towards rejecting CH.</paragraph><paragraph>Historically, mathematicians who favored a &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;large&quot;<space/><link><target>universe (mathematics)</target><part>universe</part></link><space/>of sets were against CH, while those favoring a &quot;neat&quot; and &quot;controllable&quot; universe favored CH. Parallel arguments were made for and against the<space/><link><target>axiom of constructibility</target></link>, which implies CH. More recently,<space/><link><target>Matthew Foreman</target></link><space/>has pointed out that<space/><link><target>ontological maximalism</target></link><space/>can actually be used to argue in favor of CH, because among models that have the same reals, models with &quot;more&quot; sets of reals have a better chance of satisfying CH (Maddy 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;500).</paragraph><paragraph>Another viewpoint is that the conception of set is not specific enough to determine whether CH is true or false. This viewpoint was advanced as early as 1923 by<space/><link><target>Skolem</target></link>, even before Gdel's first incompleteness theorem. Skolem argued on the basis of what is now known as<space/><link><target>Skolem's paradox</target></link>, and it was later supported by the independence of CH from the axioms of ZFC, since these axioms are enough to establish the elementary properties of sets and cardinalities. In order to argue against this viewpoint, it would be sufficient to demonstrate new axioms that are supported by intuition and resolve CH in one direction or another. Although the<space/><link><target>axiom of constructibility</target></link><space/>does resolve CH, it is not generally considered to be intuitively true any more than CH is generally considered to be false (Kunen 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;171).</paragraph><paragraph>At least two other axioms have been proposed that have implications for the continuum hypothesis, although these axioms have not currently found wide acceptance in the mathematical community. In 1986, Chris Freiling presented an argument against CH by showing that the negation of CH is equivalent to<space/><link><target>Freiling's axiom of symmetry</target></link>, a statement about<space/><link><target>probability</target><part>probabilities</part></link>. Freiling believes this axiom is &quot;intuitively true&quot; but others have disagreed. A difficult argument against CH developed by<space/><link><target>W. Hugh Woodin</target></link><space/>has attracted considerable attention since the year 2000 (Woodin 2001a, 2001b). Foreman (2003) does not reject Woodin's argument outright but urges caution.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Solomon Feferman</target></link><space/>(2011) has made a complex philosophical argument that CH is not a definite mathematical problem. He proposes a theory of &quot;definiteness&quot; using a semi-intuitionistic subsystem of ZF that accepts<space/><link><target>classical logic</target></link><space/>for bounded quantifiers but uses<space/><link><target>intuitionistic logic</target></link><space/>for unbounded ones, and suggests that a proposition<space/><extension extension_name='math'>\phi</extension><space/>is mathematically &quot;definite&quot; if the semi-intuitionistic theory can prove<space/><extension extension_name='math'>(\phi \or \neg\phi)</extension>. He conjectures that CH is not definite according to this notion, and proposes that CH should therefore be considered not to have a truth value.<space/><link><target>Peter Koellner</target></link><space/>(2011b) wrote a critical commentary on Feferman's article.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Joel David Hamkins</target></link><space/>proposes a multiverse approach to set theory and argues that &quot;the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and as a result it can no longer be settled in the manner formerly hoped for.&quot; (Hamkins 2012). In a related vein,<space/><link><target>Saharon Shelah</target></link><space/>wrote that he does &quot;not agree with the pure Platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be decided, that we just have to discover the additional axiom. My mental picture is that we have many possible set theories, all conforming to ZFC.&quot; (Shelah 2003).</paragraph><heading level='2'>The generalized continuum hypothesis</heading><paragraph>The<space/><italics>generalized continuum hypothesis</italics><space/>(GCH) states that if an infinite set's cardinality lies between that of an infinite set<space/><italics>S</italics><space/>and that of the<space/><link><target>power set</target></link><space/>of<space/><italics>S</italics>, then it either has the same cardinality as the set<space/><italics>S</italics><space/>or the same cardinality as the power set of<space/><italics>S</italics>. That is, for any<space/><link><target>infinite set</target><part>infinite</part></link><space/><link><target>cardinal number</target><part>cardinal</part></link><space/><extension extension_name='math'>\lambda\,</extension><space/>there is no cardinal<space/><extension extension_name='math'>\kappa\,</extension><space/>such that<space/><extension extension_name='math'>\lambda &lt;\kappa &lt;2^{\lambda}.\,&lt;/math&gt; GCH is equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha+1}=2^{\aleph_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; for every [[ordinal number|ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha.\,&lt;/math&gt; (occasionally called '''Cantor's aleph hypothesis''')
The [[beth number]]s provide an alternate notation for this condition: &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha=\beth_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for every ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is a generalization of the continuum hypothesis since the continuum has the same cardinality as the [[power set]] of the integers. It was first suggested by {{harvs|txt|last=Jourdain|authorlink=Philip Jourdain|year=1905}}.

Like CH, GCH is also independent of ZFC, but [[Wacław Sierpiński|Sierpiński]] proved that ZF + GCH implies the [[axiom of choice]] (AC), so choice and GCH are not independent in ZF; there are no models of ZF in which GCH holds and AC fails. To prove this, Sierpiński showed GCH implies that every cardinality n is smaller than some [[Aleph number]], and thus can be ordered. This is done by showing that n is smaller than &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0+n}\,&lt;/math&gt; which is smaller than its own [[Hartogs number]] — this uses the equality &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0+n}\, = \,2\cdot\,2^{\aleph_0+n} &lt;/math&gt;; for the full proof, see Gillman (2002).

[[Kurt Gödel]] showed that GCH is a consequence of ZF + [[Axiom of constructibility|V=L]] (the axiom that every set is constructible relative to the ordinals), and is therefore consistent with ZFC. As GCH implies CH, Cohen's model in which CH fails is a model in which GCH fails, and thus GCH is not provable from ZFC. W.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Easton used the method of forcing developed by Cohen to prove [[Easton's theorem]], which shows it is consistent with ZFC for arbitrarily large cardinals &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to fail to satisfy &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_\alpha} = \aleph_{\alpha + 1}.&lt;/math&gt; Much later, [[Matthew Foreman|Foreman]] and [[W. Hugh Woodin|Woodin]] proved that (assuming the consistency of very large cardinals) it is consistent that &lt;math&gt;2^\kappa&gt;\kappa^+\,&lt;/math&gt; holds for every infinite cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa.\,&lt;/math&gt; Later Woodin extended this by showing the consistency of &lt;math&gt;2^\kappa=\kappa^{++}\,&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt;. A recent result of Carmi Merimovich shows that, for each ''n''≥1, it is consistent with ZFC that for each κ, 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''n''th successor of κ. On the other hand, {{harvs|first=László |last=Patai|year=1930|txt}} proved, that if γ is an ordinal and for each infinite cardinal κ, 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; is the γth successor of κ, then γ is finite.

For any infinite sets A and B, if there is an injection from A to B then there is an injection from subsets of A to subsets of B. Thus for any infinite cardinals A and B,
:&lt;math&gt;A &lt; B \to 2^A \le 2^B.&lt;/math&gt;
If A and B are finite, the stronger inequality
:&lt;math&gt;A &lt; B \to 2^A &lt; 2^B \!&lt;/math&gt;
holds. GCH implies that this strict, stronger inequality holds for infinite cardinals as well as finite cardinals.

===Implications of GCH for cardinal exponentiation===
Although the generalized continuum hypothesis refers directly only to cardinal exponentiation with 2 as the base, one can deduce from it the values of cardinal exponentiation in all cases. It implies that &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}^{\aleph_{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; is (see: Hayden &amp; Kennison (1968), page 147, exercise 76):
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\beta+1}&lt;/math&gt; when α ≤ β+1;
