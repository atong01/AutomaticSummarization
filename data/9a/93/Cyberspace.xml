Under this name the two made a series of installations and images entitled sensory spaces that were based on the principle of open systems adaptable to various influences, such as human movement and the behaviour of new materials.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.kunstkritikk.com/kommentar/the-reinvention-of-cyberspace/</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Atelier Cyberspace worked at a time when the Internet did not exist and computers were more or less off-limit to artists and creative engagement. In a 2015-interview with Scandinavian art magazine Kunstkritikk, Carsten Hoff recollects, that although Atelier Cyberspace did try to implement computers, they had no interest in the virtual space as such:<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.kunstkritikk.com/kommentar/the-reinvention-of-cyberspace/</extension></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>To us, ‘cyberspace’ was simply about managing spaces. There was nothing esoteric about it. Nothing digital, either. It was just a tool. The space was concrete, physical.</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>And in the same interview Hoff continues:</paragraph><paragraph><template><target>quote</target><arg>Our shared point of departure was that we were working with physical settings, and we were both frustrated and displeased with the architecture from the period, particularly when it came to spaces for living. We felt that there was a need to loosen up the rigid confines of urban planning, giving back the gift of creativity to individual human beings and allowing them to shape and design their houses or dwellings themselves – instead of having some clever architect pop up, telling you how you should live. We were thinking in terms of open-ended systems where things could grow and evolve as required.

For instance, we imagined a kind of mobile production unit, but unfortunately the drawings have been lost. It was a kind of truck with a nozzle at the back. Like a bee building its hive. The nozzle would emit and apply material that grew to form amorphous mushrooms or whatever you might imagine. It was supposed to be computer-controlled, allowing you to create interesting shapes and sequences of spaces. It was a merging of organic and technological systems, a new way of structuring the world. And a response that counteracted industrial uniformity. We had this idea that sophisticated software might enable us to mimic the way in which nature creates products – where things that belong to the same family can take different forms. All oak trees are oak trees, but no two oak trees are exactly alike. And then a whole new material – polystyrene foam – arrived on the scene. It behaved like nature in the sense that it grew when its two component parts were mixed. Almost like a fungal growth. This made it an obvious choice for our work in Atelier Cyberspace.</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>The works of Atelier Cyberspace were originally shown at a number of Copenhagen venues and have later been exhibited at The National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen as part of the exhibition Whats Happening?<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.smk.dk/en/visit-the-museum/exhibitions/whats-happening/introduction-to-the-exhibition/</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The term &quot;cyberspace&quot; first appeared in fiction in the 1980s in the work of<space/><link><target>cyberpunk</target></link><space/>science fiction author<space/><link><target>William Gibson</target></link>, first in his 1982 short story &quot;<link><target>Burning Chrome</target></link>&quot; and later in his 1984 novel<space/><italics><link><target>Neuromancer</target></link>.</italics><extension extension_name='ref' name="wired"><template><target>cite news</target><arg name="work">WIRED<space/></arg><arg name="title">March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace<space/></arg><arg name="author">Scott Thil<space/></arg><arg name="date">03.17.09<space/></arg><arg name="url">http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317</arg></template></extension><space/>In the next few years, the word became prominently identified with online computer networks.
