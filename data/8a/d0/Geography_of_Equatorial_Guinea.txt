The Republic of '''[[Equatorial Guinea]]''' is located in west central [[Africa]]. [[Bioko|Bioko Island]] lies about {{convert|40|km|mi|1|sp=us}} from [[Cameroon]]. [[Annobón]] Island lies about {{convert|595|km|mi|0}} southwest of Bioko Island. The larger continental region of [[Rio Muni]] lies between Cameroon and [[Gabon]] on the mainland; it includes the islands of [[Corisco]], [[Elobey Grande]], [[Elobey Chico]], and adjacent islets.

Bioko Island, called Fernando Po until the 1970s, is the largest island in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] - {{convert|2017|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}. It is shaped like a boot, with two large volcanic formations separated by a valley that bisects the island at its narrowest point. The {{convert|195|km|mi|0|adj=on|sp=us}} coastline is steep and rugged in the south but lower and more accessible in the north, with excellent harbors at [[Malabo]] and [[Luba, Equatorial Guinea|Luba]], and several scenic beaches between those towns.

On the continent, Rio Muni covers {{convert|26003|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}. The coastal plain gives way to a succession of valleys separated by low hills and spurs of the [[Crystal Mountains (Africa)|Crystal Mountains]]. The [[Rio Benito]] (Mbini) which divides Rio Muni in half, is unnavigable except for a 20-kilometer stretch at its estuary. Temperatures and humidity in Rio Muni are generally lower than on Bioko Island.

Annobon Island, named for its discovery on New Year's Day 1472, is a small volcanic island covering {{convert|18|km2|sqmi|1|sp=us}}. The coastline is abrupt except in the north; the principal volcanic cone contains a small lake. Most of the estimated 1,900 inhabitants are fisherman specializing in traditional, smallscale tuna fishing and whaling. The climate is tropical—heavy rainfall, high humidity, and frequent seasonal changes with violent windstorms. 

'''Location:'''
Western [[Africa]], bordering the [[Bight of Biafra]], between [[Cameroon]] and [[Gabon]].

== Boundaries ==
Equatorial Guinea's land boundaries total 528&nbsp;km. It borders [[Cameroon]] (183&nbsp;km) in the north and [[Gabon]] (345&nbsp;km) in the east and south.

'''Maritime claims:'''
territorial sea:
{{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}}

exclusive economic zone:
{{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}}


== Climate ==
The climate of both the continental region and the islands is typically equatorial, with high temperatures, heavy rainfall, and much cloud cover most of the year. Local variations are due to differences in altitude and proximity to the sea. The wet seasons in the continental region are from February to June and from September to December. Rainfall is higher on the coast than inland. In Bata the rainiest months are September, October, and November, with rainfall averaging more than {{convert|94|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} a year. At Calatrava, farther south on the coast, it sometimes reaches {{convert|180|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Inland, however, rainfall diminishes; [[Micomeseng|Mikomeseng]], for example, receives only about {{convert|58|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The average annual temperature is about {{convert|79|F|C|1}} and is fairly constant throughout the year. The temperature maxima are somewhat lower than in Bioko. The relative humidity, however, is higher than in Bioko. Bioko has a rather debilitating climate. The so-called dry season lasts from November to March, and the rest of the year is rainy. The average annual temperature of about {{convert|77|F|C}} varies little throughout the year. Afternoon temperatures reach the high 80s °F (low 30s °C) and drop to only about {{convert|70|F|C|1}} at night. Most of the time the sky is cloudy and overcast. Extreme rainfall occurs in the south, with rain brought by monsoon winds amounting to about {{convert|450|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} a year around San Antonio de Ureca.

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Equatorial Guinea]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point - [[Punta Europa]], [[Bioko Island]]
* Easternmost point - the eastern section of the border with [[Gabon]]*
* Southernmost point - [[A Dyibó]], [[Annobón]] Island
* Westernmost point - [[Punta Dyiscoj]], [[Annobón]] Island

* ''Note: technically Equatorial Guinea does not have an eastern-most point as its eastern border is formed by a straight line between the 11° and 12° of latitude''
