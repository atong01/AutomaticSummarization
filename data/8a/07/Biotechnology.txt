'''Biotechnology''' is the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or "any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use" (UN Convention on Biological Diversity, Art. 2).<ref>[http://www.cbd.int/convention/text/ Text of the CBD]. CBD.int. Retrieved on 2013-03-20.</ref>  Depending on the tools and applications, it often overlaps with the (related) fields of [[bioengineering]], [[biomedical engineering]], etc.

For thousands of years, humankind has used biotechnology in [[agriculture]], [[food production]], and [[medicine]].<ref name = BioREACH>[http://www.public.asu.edu/~langland/biotech-intro.html "Incorporating Biotechnology into the Classroom What is Biotechnology?", from the curricula of the 'Incorporating Biotechnology into the High School Classroom through Arizona State University's BioREACH program', accessed on October 16, 2012)].

==Definitions==

The wide concept of "biotech" or "biotechnology" encompasses a wide range of procedures for modifying living organisms according to human purposes, going back to [[domestication]] of animals, cultivation of plants, and "improvements" to these through breeding programs that employ [[artificial selection]] and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]]. Modern usage also includes [[genetic engineering]] as well as [[cell culture|cell]] and [[tissue culture]] technologies.  The [[American Chemical Society]] defines biotechnology as the application of biological organisms, systems, or processes by various industries to learning about the science of life and the improvement of the value of materials and organisms such as pharmaceuticals, crops, and livestock.<ref>[http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&node_id=1188&content_id=CTP_003377&use_sec=true&sec_url_var=region1&__uuid=5a1c54a6-ff5a-4f69-84c1-763835d11162 Biotechnology].

As per [[European Federation of Biotechnology]], Biotechnology is the integration of natural science and organisms, cells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues for products and services.<ref>[http://nvsrochd.gov.in/s_club/biology/ch11_bilas.pdf]</ref>
Biotechnology also writes on the pure biological sciences ([[animal cell culture]], [[biochemistry]], [[cell biology]], [[embryology]], [[genetics]], [[microbiology]], and [[molecular biology]]).  In many instances, it is also dependent on knowledge and methods from outside the sphere of biology including:

* [[bioinformatics]], a new brand of [[computer science]]
* [[bioprocess engineering]]
* [[biorobotics]]
* [[chemical engineering]]

Conversely, modern biological sciences (including even concepts such as [[molecular ecology]]) are intimately entwined and heavily dependent on the methods developed through biotechnology and what is commonly thought of as the [[life sciences]] industry.  Biotechnology is the [[research and development]] in the [[laboratory]] using [[bioinformatics]] for exploration, extraction, exploitation and production from any [[living organisms]] and any source of [[biomass]] by means of [[biochemical engineering]] where high value-added products could be planned (reproduced by [[biosynthesis]], for example), forecasted, formulated, developed, manufactured and marketed for the purpose of sustainable operations (for the return from bottomless initial investment on R & D) and gaining durable patents rights (for exclusives rights for sales, and prior to this to receive national and international approval from the results on animal experiment and human experiment, especially on the [[pharmaceutical]] branch of biotechnology to prevent any undetected side-effects or safety concerns by using the products).<ref>[http://www.europabio.org/what-biotechnology What is biotechnology?].

By contrast, [[bioengineering]] is generally thought of as a related field that more heavily emphasizes higher systems approaches (not necessarily the altering or using of biological materials ''directly'') for interfacing with and utilizing living things. Bioengineering is the application of the principles of engineering and natural sciences to tissues, cells and molecules. This can be considered as the use of knowledge from working with and manipulating biology to achieve a result that can improve functions in plants and animals.<ref>[http://www.bionewsonline.com/k/what_is_bioengineering.htm What Is Bioengineering?].

==History==
[[File:The Brewer designed and engraved in the Sixteenth. Century by J Amman.png|right|thumb|[[Brewing]] was an early application of biotechnology]]

{{Main|History of biotechnology}}

Although not normally what first comes to mind, many forms of human-derived [[agriculture]] clearly fit the broad definition of "'utilizing a biotechnological system to make products".  Indeed, the cultivation of plants may be viewed as the earliest biotechnological enterprise.

[[Agriculture]] has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the [[Neolithic Revolution]].  Through early biotechnology, the earliest farmers selected and bred the best suited crops, having the highest yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population.  As crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain, it was discovered that specific organisms and their by-products could effectively [[fertilize]], [[nitrogen fixation|restore nitrogen]], and [[pesticide|control pests]]. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and [[plant breeding|breeding]] them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology.

These processes also were included in early [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[beer]].<ref>See Arnold, John P. (2005) [1911]. Origin and History of Beer and Brewing: From Prehistoric Times to the Beginning of Brewing Science and Technology. Cleveland, Ohio: BeerBooks. p. 34. ISBN 978-0-9662084-1-2. OCLC 71834130.</ref> These processes were introduced in early [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], [[China]] and [[India]], and still use the same basic biological methods.  In [[brewing]], malted grains (containing [[enzymes]]) convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific [[yeasts]] to produce beer. In this process, [[carbohydrates]] in the grains were broken down into alcohols such as ethanol. Later other cultures produced the process of [[lactic acid fermentation]] which allowed the fermentation and preservation of other forms of food, such as [[soy sauce]]. Fermentation was also used in this time period to produce [[leavened bread]]. Although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until [[Louis Pasteur]]'s work in 1857, it is still the first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form.

Before the time of [[Charles Darwin]]'s work and life, animal and plant scientists had already used selective breeding. Darwin added to that body of work with his scientific observations about the ability of science to change species. These accounts contributed to Darwin's theory of natural selection.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404200058.html|title = Biotechnology|last = Cole-Turner|first = Ronald|date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of Science and Religion|accessdate = 7 December 2014|doi = |pmid = }}</ref>

For thousands of years, humans have used selective breeding to improve production of crops and livestock to use them for food. In selective breeding, organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with the same characteristics. For example, this technique was used with corn to produce the largest and sweetest crops.<ref name=Thieman>{{cite book |author=Thieman, W.J.; Palladino, M.A. |title=Introduction to Biotechnology |publisher=Pearson/Benjamin Cummings |year=2008 |isbn=0-321-49145-9 }}</ref>

In the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of [[microbiology]] and explored ways of manufacturing specific products. In 1917, [[Chaim Weizmann]] first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial process, that of manufacturing [[corn starch]] using ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]],'' to produce [[acetone]], which the [[United Kingdom]] desperately needed to manufacture [[explosive]]s during [[World War I]].<ref name="Springham_biotechnology">{{cite book |author=Springham, D.; Springham, G.; Moses, V.; Cape, R.E. |title=Biotechnology: The Science and the Business |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GY5DCr6LD4C |date=24 August 1999 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-90-5702-407-8 |page=1}}</ref>

Biotechnology has also led to the development of antibiotics. In 1928, [[Alexander Fleming]] discovered the mold ''[[Penicillium]]''. His work led to the purification of the antibiotic compound formed by the mold by Howard Florey, Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley - to form what we today know as [[penicillin]]. In 1940, penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans.<ref name=Thieman/>

The field of modern biotechnology is generally thought of as having been born in 1971 when Paul Berg's (Stanford) experiments in gene splicing had early success.  Herbert W. Boyer (Univ. Calif. at San Francisco) and Stanley N. Cohen (Stanford) significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring genetic material into a bacterium, such that the imported material would be reproduced.  The commercial viability of a biotechnology industry was significantly expanded on June 16, 1980, when the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that a [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] [[microorganism]] could be [[patent]]ed in the case of ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]''.<ref name="DiamondvChakrabarty">"[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=447&invol=303 Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980). No. 79-139]." ''[[United States Supreme Court]].'' June 16, 1980. Retrieved on May 4, 2007.</ref> Indian-born Ananda Chakrabarty, working for [[General Electric]], had modified a bacterium (of the ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' genus) capable of breaking down crude oil, which he proposed to use in treating oil spills.  (Chakrabarty's work did not involve gene manipulation but rather the transfer of entire organelles between strains of the ''Pseudomonas'' bacterium.

Revenue in the industry is expected to grow by 12.9% in 2008. Another factor influencing the biotechnology sector's success is improved intellectual property rights legislation—and enforcement—worldwide, as well as strengthened demand for medical and pharmaceutical products to cope with an ageing, and ailing, U.S. population.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080402034432/http://www.ibisworld.com/pressrelease/pressrelease.aspx?prid=115 VoIP Providers And Corn Farmers Can Expect To Have Bumper Years In 2008 And Beyond, According To The Latest Research Released By Business Information Analysts At IBISWorld]. Los Angeles (March 19, 2008)</ref>

Rising demand for biofuels is expected to be good news for the biotechnology sector, with the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] estimating [[ethanol]] usage could reduce U.S. petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030. The biotechnology sector has allowed the U.S. farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeans—the main inputs into biofuels—by developing genetically modified seeds which are resistant to pests and drought. By boosting farm productivity, biotechnology plays a crucial role in ensuring that biofuel production targets are met.<ref>[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-technology-1/The-Recession-List---Top-10-Industries-to-Fly-and-Flop-in-2008-4076-3/ The Recession List — Top 10 Industries to Fly and Fl...

==Examples==
[[File:99341.jpg|thumb|A [[rose]] plant that began as cells grown in a tissue culture]]

Biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas, including health care (medical), crop production and agriculture, non food (industrial) uses of crops and other products (e.g. [[biodegradable plastic]]s, [[vegetable oil]], [[biofuel]]s), and environmental uses.

For example, one application of biotechnology is the directed use of [[organism]]s for the manufacture of organic products (examples include [[beer]] and [[milk]] products). Another example is using naturally present [[bacteria]] by the mining industry in [[bioleaching]]. Biotechnology is also used to recycle, treat waste, clean up sites contaminated by industrial activities ([[bioremediation]]), and also to produce [[biological warfare|biological weapons]].

A series of derived terms have been coined to identify several branches of biotechnology; for example:
* '''[[Bioinformatics]]''' is an interdisciplinary field which addresses biological problems using computational techniques, and makes the rapid organization as well as analysis of biological data possible. The field may also be referred to as ''computational biology'', and can be defined as, "conceptualizing biology in terms of molecules and then applying informatics techniques to understand and organize the information associated with these molecules, on a large scale."<ref name="gerstein">Gerstein, M. "[http://www.primate.or.kr/bioinformatics/Course/Yale/intro.pdf Bioinformatics Introduction]." ''[[Yale University]].'' Retrieved on May 8, 2007.</ref> Bioinformatics plays a key role in various areas, such as [[functional genomics]], [[structural genomics]], and [[proteomics]], and forms a key component in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector.
* '''[[Blue biotechnology]]''' is a term that has been used to describe the marine and aquatic applications of biotechnology, but its use is relatively rare.
* '''[[Green biotechnology]]''' is biotechnology applied to agricultural processes. An example would be the selection and domestication of plants via [[micropropagation]]. Another example is the designing of [[transgenic plant]]s to grow under specific environments in the presence (or absence) of chemicals. One hope is that green biotechnology might produce more environmentally friendly solutions than traditional [[industrial agriculture]]. An example of this is the engineering of a plant to express a [[pesticide]], thereby ending the need of external application of pesticides. An example of this would be [[Transgenic maize|Bt corn]]. Whether or not green biotechnology products such as this are ultimately more environmentally friendly is a topic of considerable debate.
* '''[[biopharmaceutical|Red biotechnology]]''' is applied to medical processes. Some examples are the designing of organisms to produce [[antibiotic]]s, and the engineering of genetic cures through [[genetic manipulation]].
* '''White biotechnology''', also known as industrial biotechnology, is biotechnology applied to [[Industry|industrial]] processes. An example is the designing of an organism to produce a useful chemical. Another example is the using of [[enzymes]] as industrial [[catalyst]]s to either produce valuable chemicals or destroy hazardous/polluting chemicals. White biotechnology tends to consume less in resources than traditional processes used to produce industrial goods.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The investment and economic output of all of these types of applied biotechnologies is termed as "[[bioeconomy]]".

===Medicine===
In medicine, modern biotechnology finds applications in areas such as [[pharmaceutical drug]] discovery and production, [[pharmacogenomics]], and genetic testing (or genetic screening).
[[File:Microarray2.gif|thumb|[[DNA microarray]] chip – some can do as many as a million blood tests at once ]]

Biotechnology has contributed to the discovery and manufacturing of traditional [[small molecule]] [[pharmaceutical drugs]] as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology - [[biopharmaceutics]]. Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 [[Genentech]] developed synthetic humanized [[insulin]] by joining its gene with a [[plasmid]] vector inserted into the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of [[abattoir]] animals (cattle and/or pigs). The resulting genetically engineered bacterium enabled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bains, W. |title=Genetic Engineering For Almost Everybody: What Does It Do?

[[Genetic testing]] allows the [[Genetics|genetic]] [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of vulnerabilities to inherited [[diseases]], and can also be used to determine a child's parentage (genetic mother and father) or in general a person's [[ancestry]]. In addition to studying [[chromosomes]] to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes [[biochemical]] tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders.  Genetic testing identifies changes in [[chromosomes]], genes, or proteins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting |title=What is genetic testing? - Genetics Home Reference |publisher=Ghr.nlm.nih.gov |date=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref> Most of the time, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders.

These conclusions represent the consensus of the scientific evidence surveyed by the ICSU (2003) and they are consistent with the views of the World Health Organization (WHO, 2002). These foods have been assessed for increased risks to human health by several national regulatory authorities (inter alia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and the United States) using their national food safety procedures (ICSU). To date no verifiable untoward toxic or nutritionally deleterious effects resulting from the consumption of foods derived from genetically modified crops have been discovered anywhere in the world (GM Science Review Panel).

===Industrial biotechnology===
Industrial biotechnology (known mainly in Europe as white biotechnology) is the application of biotechnology for industrial purposes, including [[industrial fermentation]]. It includes the practice of using [[Cell (biology)|cells]] such as [[micro-organisms]], or components of cells like [[enzymes]], to generate [[Industry|industrially]] useful products in sectors such as chemicals, food and feed, detergents, paper and pulp, textiles and [[biofuels]].<ref>[http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/media/documents/pdf/Energy_Environment/Industrial_biotech_and_biomass_utilisation_EGM_report.pdf Industrial Biotechnology and Biomass Utilisation]</ref> In doing so, biotechnology uses renewable raw materials and may contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and moving away from a petrochemical-based economy.<ref>[http://www.innovationeu.org/news/innovation-eu-vol2-1/0262-industrial-biotechnology.html Industrial biotechnology, A powerful, innovative technology to mitigate climate change]</ref>

===Regulation===
{{main|Regulation of genetic engineering|Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms}}

The regulation of genetic engineering concerns approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of [[genetic engineering]] technology, and the development and release of genetically modified organisms (GMO), including [[genetically modified crops]] and [[genetically modified fish]]. There are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Learning==
In 1988, after prompting from the [[United States Congress]], the [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]] ([[National Institutes of Health]]) (NIGMS) instituted a funding mechanism for biotechnology training. Universities nationwide compete for these funds to establish [[Biotechnology Training Program]]s (BTPs). Each successful application is generally funded for five years then must be competitively renewed. [[Graduate students]] in turn compete for acceptance into a BTP; if accepted, then stipend, tuition and health insurance support is provided for two or three years during the course of their [[Ph.D.]] thesis work. Nineteen institutions offer NIGMS supported BTPs.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/InstPredoc/Pages/PredocDesc-Biotechnology.aspx|title = Biotechnology Predoctoral Training Program|date = 18 December 2013|accessdate = 28 October 2014|website = National Institute of General Medical Sciences|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Biotechnology training is also offered at the undergraduate level and in community colleges.
