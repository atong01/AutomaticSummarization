The '''Euglenozoa''' are a large group of [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]]. They include a variety of common free-living species, as well as a few important parasites, some of which infect humans.  There are two main subgroups, the [[euglenid]]s and [[Kinetoplastida|kinetoplastid]]s.  Euglenozoa are unicellular, mostly around [[1 E-5 m|15-40 µm]] in size, although some euglenids get up to 500&nbsp;µm long.<ref>{{cite web|title=Euglenozoa |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/~reagle/wp-redux/Euglenozoa/983861847.html|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> 

==Structure==
Most euglenozoa have two flagella, which are inserted parallel to one another in an apical or subapical pocket.  In some these are associated with a [[cytostome]] or mouth, used to ingest [[bacteria]] or other small organisms.  This is supported by one of three sets of [[microtubule]]s that arise from the flagellar bases; the other two support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell.<ref name=Pat1999>

Some other euglenozoa feed through absorption, and many euglenids possess [[chloroplast]]s and so obtain energy through [[photosynthesis]].  These chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and contain [[chlorophyll]]s ''A'' and ''B'', along with other pigments, so are probably derived from a [[endosymbiosis|captured]] [[green alga]].  Reproduction occurs exclusively through cell division.  During [[mitosis]], the nuclear membrane remains intact, and the spindle microtubules form inside of it.<ref name="Pat1999"/>

The group is characterized by the ultrastructure of the flagella.  In addition to the normal supporting microtubules or [[axoneme]], each contains a rod (called ''paraxonemal''), which has a tubular structure in one flagellum and a latticed structure in the other.  Based on this, two smaller groups have been included here: the [[diplonemid]]s and ''[[Postgaardi]]''.<ref name=Sim1997>

==Classification==
The euglenozoa are generally accepted as monophyletic.  They are related to [[Percolozoa]]; the two share mitochondria with disk-shaped [[cristae]], which only occurs in a few other groups.<ref name=Bal2000>{{Cite journal | last1 = Baldauf | first1 = S.

Both probably belong to a larger group of eukaryotes called the [[excavate]]s.<ref name=Sim2003>
