However, the degree of influence remains debated, and it has recently been argued that its grammatical influence accounts for the substantial innovations noted between English and the other West Germanic languages.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>English and Welsh</target></link>, 1955 J. R. R.

One of these dialects,<space/><link><target>Late West Saxon</target></link>, eventually came to dominate. The original<space/><link><target>Old English language</target></link><space/>was then influenced by two waves of invasion: the first was by speakers of the Scandinavian branch of the Germanic family, who conquered and colonised parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second was the<space/><link><target>Normans</target></link><space/>in the 11th century, who spoke<space/><link><target>Old Norman</target></link><space/>and ultimately developed an English variety of this called<space/><link><target>Anglo-Norman language</target><part>Anglo-Norman</part></link>. These two invasions caused English to become &quot;mixed&quot; to some degree (though it was never a truly<space/><link><target>mixed language</target></link><space/>in the strictest sense of the word; mixed languages arise from the cohabitation of speakers of different languages, who develop a hybrid tongue for basic communication).</paragraph><paragraph>The more idiomatic, concrete and descriptive English is, the more it is from Anglo-Saxon origins.

Surveys started in 1979 by the<space/><link><target>Inner London Education Authority</target></link><space/>discovered over 100 languages being spoken domestically by the families of the inner city's schoolchildren.

In Northampton the older accent has been influenced by overspill Londoners. There is an accent known locally as the<space/><link><target>Kettering</target></link><space/>accent, which is a transitional accent between the<space/><link><target>East Midlands</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>East Anglia</target><trail>n</trail></link>.

In the town of<space/><link><target>Corby</target></link>, five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) north, one can find Corbyite, which unlike the Kettering accent, is largely influenced by the West Scottish accent.</paragraph><paragraph>In addition, most British people can to some degree temporarily &quot;swing&quot; their accent towards a more neutral form of English at will, to reduce difficulty where very different accents are involved, or when speaking to foreigners.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Glottal stop</heading><paragraph>In a number of forms of spoken British English, it is common for the phoneme<space/><template><target>IPA</target><arg>/t/</arg></template><space/>to be realized as a<space/><link><target>glottal stop</target></link><space/><template><target>IPA</target><arg>[ʔ]</arg></template><space/>when it is in the intervocalic position, in a process called<space/><link><target>T-glottalisation</target></link>.
