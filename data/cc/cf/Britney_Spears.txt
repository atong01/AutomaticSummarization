'''Britney Jean Spears''' (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer and actress. Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]], and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she performed acting roles in stage productions and television shows as a child before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first and second studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), became international successes, with the former becoming the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.<ref>Folkard, Claire (2003). ''Guinness World Records 2003''. Bantam Books. p. 288. ISBN 978-0-553-58636-7.</ref> Title tracks "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]" and "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]" broke international sales records. In 2001, Spears released her self-titled third studio album, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'', and played the starring role in the film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002). She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), which yielded the worldwide success of the "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" single.

In 2007, Spears's much-publicized personal issues sent her career into hiatus. Her fifth studio album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'', was released later that year, and spawned hits such as "[[Gimme More]]" and "[[Piece of Me]]". Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations continued through the following year, at which point she was placed under a still ongoing [[conservatorship]]. Spears's sixth studio album, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008), included global chart-topping lead single "[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]". Its supporting tour [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] was one of the highest-grossing global concert tours in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereotude.com/madonna/15-most-profitable-female-tours-ever.html|title=15 Most Profitable Female Tours Ever|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=July 27, 2010| last=Esmailian|first=Ani|work=Hollyscoop|publisher=DNA Group}}</ref> Later that October, "[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]" became Spears's third single to reach number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Her seventh studio album, ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), became her first to yield three top-ten singles in the United States: "[[Hold It Against Me]]", "[[Till the World Ends]]" and "[[I Wanna Go]]". She also served as a judge during the [[The X Factor (U.S. season 2)|second season]] of the [[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|American version]] of ''[[The X Factor]]''. Spears's eponymous eighth studio album ''[[Britney Jean]]'' was released in 2013; it spawned the top 15 hit "[[Work Bitch]]"; however, it became the lowest-selling record of her career. Later that year, Spears began the four-year [[residency show]] [[Britney: Piece of Me]] at [[The AXIS]] at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas.

Spears was established as a [[pop icon]] and credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s. She became the 'best-selling teenaged artist of all time'<ref>Ruggieri, Melissa (December 19, 2000). "Music Notes".

==Life and career==

===1981–97: Early life and career beginnings===
Spears was born in [[McComb, Mississippi]], the second child of [[Lynne Spears|Lynne Irene Bridges]] and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was [[English people|English]] (born in [[London]]), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was [[Maltese people|Maltese]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1056674/EXCLUSIVE-First-photos-Britney-Spears-newly-discovered-British-family.html|title=Exclusive: First photos of Britney Spears' newly-discovered British family|work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=June 4, 2010|last=Thomas|first=Liz}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Spears |first=Lynne |date=September 16, 2008 |chapter=Chapter 2: Kentwood – From Malta to Louisiana |title=Through the Storm: A Real Story of Fame and Family in a Tabloid World |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eOiunEB5ccMC&pg=PA4 |edition=1st |location=Nashville, Tennessee |publisher=[[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson, Inc.]] |page=4 |isbn=9781418567354 |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |quote=But on my mama's side, the family tree is a little more colorful and glamorous.

During her childhood, she also attended gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=56}}</ref><ref name=rs1>{{cite journal|title=Cover Story: Britney Spears: Britney Spears : Rolling Stone|date=April 15, 1999|work=Rolling Stone|last=Daly|first=Steven|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=foxnews>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html|title=Britney Spears' Biography |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=June 6, 2010|last=Reporter|first=Staff}}</ref> Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing "[[What Child Is This?]]" at her [[kindergarten]] graduation. She said about her ambition as a child, "I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age".<ref name=rs1/> At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for an audition in the 1990s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her for being too young to join the series at the time, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's vocals and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and was cast in a number of commercials.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}</ref> In December 1992, she was finally cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'', but returned to Kentwood after the show was canceled in 1995. She enrolled at [[Parklane Academy]] in McComb, Mississippi. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to "the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more."<ref name=rs1/><ref name=rs2>{{cite journal|title=Cover Story: The Girl Can't Help It|date=May 25, 2000|work=Rolling Stone|last=Mundy|first=Chris|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv}}</ref>

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join the female pop group [[Innosense]]. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song of [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineer|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing that audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and "there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]], or another [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]]." Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.<ref name="hughes145"/> Senior vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that "it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that."<ref name=rs1/> She then sang Houston's "[[I Have Nothing]]" (1992) for the executives, and got signed to the label.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Taylor, Chuck | url = http://books.google.com/?id=JQoEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false | journal=Billboard | title = Air Waves: Jive's Britney Spears Sets Top 40 Abuzz With Rhythm-Leaning 'Baby One More Time' | volume = 110 | issue = 43 | date = October 24, 1998 | accessdate = March 11, 2011 | issn = 0006-2510 | ref=harv}}</ref> They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney."<ref name="Hughes 2005 147">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}</ref> After hearing the recorded material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned "[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger more adult contemporary" but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." She flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others.<ref name=rs1/>

===1998–2000: ''...Baby One More Time'' and ''Oops!... I Did It Again''===
After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her debut album. Her show was a four song set and she was accompanied by two back up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for [[NSYNC]].<ref>{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=28}}</ref> Her debut studio album, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'', was released on January 12, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/britney-spears-teen-queen-rolling-stones-1999-cover-story-20110329|title=Britney Spears, Teen Queen: Rolling Stone's 1999 Cover Story|work=Rolling Stone|year=2011|accessdate=January 22, 2010}}</ref> It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified two-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] after a month.

The April 1999 cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' featured Spears lying on her bed, covered with a bra, shorts and an open top. The [[American Family Association]] (AFA) referred to the shoot as "a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality" and called to "God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums." Spears responded to the outcry commenting, "What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine.

In January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives.

==Artistry==

===Musical style===
Following her debut, Spears was credited with leading the revival of [[teen pop]] in the late 1990s. ''[[The Daily Yomiuri]]'' reported that "[m]usic critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and [[Janet Jackson]]."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Teen pop idols stage comeback|newspaper=Yomiuri Shimbun|page=1|date=November 25, 1999|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Rob Sheffield of ''Rolling Stone'' wrote: "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene."<ref>{{cite web|title=Oops!...I Did It Again – Album Review|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/oops-i-did-it-again-20040609|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=June 9, 2004|accessdate=October 8, 2009|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Following the release of her debut album, Chuck Taylor of ''Billboard'' observed, "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice&nbsp;...

''Oops!...I Did It Again'' and subsequent albums saw Spears working with several contemporary R&B producers, leading to "a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and [[raga]]."<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|title=Oops!...I Did It Again|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r478679|pure_url=yes}}|year=2000|accessdate=October 8, 2009|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Her third studio album, ''Britney'' derived from the teen pop niche, "[r]hythmically and melodically&nbsp;... sharper, tougher than what came before.

Since ''In the Zone'', Spears has explored and heavily incorporated the genres of [[Synthpop|electropop]] and [[dance music]] in her albums, as well as influences of [[urban contemporary|urban]] and [[hip hop music]] which are most present in ''In the Zone'' and ''Blackout''.

Barbara Ellen of ''[[The Observer]]'' has reported: "Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena&nbsp;— a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall.

"We don't ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer...we'll still send her straight up the charts simply because she's Britney. She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. Musically, though, Spears will always have to measure up to her own gold standards of pop euphony: the operatic slither of 2004's 'Toxic' and the candied funk of 2000's 'Oops!...I Did It Again.' Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure.

Spears has been cited as a musical inspiration by contemporary artists. [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s character in 2010 drama film ''[[Country Strong]]'' was inspired on the singer's public meltdown. According to film director Shana Fest, "that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears.
