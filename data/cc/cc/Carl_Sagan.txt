'''Carl Edward Sagan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|ɡ|ə|n}}; November 9, 1934 – December 20, 1996) was an American [[astronomer]], [[physical cosmology|cosmologist]], [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]], [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]], author, science popularizer, and [[science communicator]] in astronomy and other natural sciences. His contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of [[Venus]]. However, he is best known for his contributions to the scientific research of [[extraterrestrial life]], including experimental demonstration of the production of [[amino acids]] from basic chemicals by [[radiation]]. Sagan assembled the first physical messages that were sent into space: the [[Pioneer plaque]] and the [[Voyager Golden Record]], universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them.

He published more than 600 scientific papers and articles and was author, co-author or editor of more than 20 books. Sagan wrote many [[popular science]] books, such as ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]'', ''[[Broca's Brain]]'' and ''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot]]'', and narrated and co-wrote the award-winning 1980 television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.  The most widely-watched series in the history of American [[public television]], ''Cosmos'' has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different countries.<ref name =Starchild>{{cite web | url=http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level2/sagan.html | title=StarChild: Dr. Carl Sagan |work=StarChild | publisher=[[NASA]] | accessdate=October 8, 2009}}</ref> The book ''[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]]'' was published to accompany the series. He also wrote the science fiction novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'', the basis for a 1997 [[Contact (1997 US film)|film of the same name]].

Sagan always advocated [[Scientific skepticism|scientific skeptical inquiry]] and the [[scientific method]], pioneered [[exobiology]] and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence ([[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]]). He spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at [[Cornell University]], where he directed the Laboratory for [[Planetary science|Planetary Studies]]. Sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors, including the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the [[National Academy of Sciences]] [[Public Welfare Medal]], the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] for his book ''The Dragons of Eden'', and, regarding ''Cosmos: A Personal Voyage'', two [[Emmy Award]]s, the [[Peabody Award]] and the [[Hugo Award]]. He married three times and had five children. After suffering from [[myelodysplasia]], Sagan died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 62 on December 20, 1996.

== Early life ==
Carl Sagan was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York.<ref name=poundstone>[[#Poundstone|Poundstone 1999]], pp. 363–364, 374–375</ref> His father, Samuel Sagan, was an immigrant garment worker from [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], then [[Russian Empire]],<ref name="Internet Accuracy Project">{{cite web |title=Carl Sagan |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Sagan,Carl.html |website=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=Internet Accuracy Project |location=Grandville, MI |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Carl Sagan |url=http://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/carl-sagan-155.php |website=The Famous People |publisher=The Famous People |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> in today's [[Ukraine]]. His mother, Rachel Molly Gruber, was a housewife from New York. Carl was named in honor of Rachel's [[biological mother]], Chaiya Clara, in Sagan's words, "the mother she never knew."<ref name="Davidson">[[#Davidson|Davidson 1999]]</ref>

He had a sister, Carol, and the family lived in a modest apartment near the Atlantic Ocean, in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]], a Brooklyn neighborhood. According to Sagan, they were [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jews]], the most liberal of North American Judaism's four main groups. Both Sagan and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious, but that their mother "definitely believed in God, and was active in the temple&nbsp;... and served only [[Kosher foods|kosher]] meat."<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|12}} During the depths of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], his father worked as a theater usher.

According to biographer Keay Davidson, Sagan's "inner war" was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents, who were in many ways "opposites." Sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother, a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in New York City during [[World War&nbsp;I]] and the 1920s.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|2}} As a young woman she had held her own intellectual ambitions, but they were frustrated by social restrictions: her poverty, her status as a woman and a wife, and her Jewish ethnicity. Davidson notes that she therefore "worshipped her only son, Carl. He would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams."<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|2}}

However, he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father. In his free time he gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labor-management tensions within New York's garment industry.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|2}} Although he was awed by Carl's intellectual abilities, he took his son's inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|2}} In his later years as a writer and scientist, Sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points, as he did in his book, ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (book)|Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]''.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|9}} Sagan describes his parents' influence on his later thinking:
: My parents were not scientists. They knew almost nothing about science. But in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder, they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method.<ref name="Spangenburg">[[#Spangenburg & Moser|Spangenburg & Moser 2004]], pp. 2–5</ref>

=== 1939 World's Fair ===
Sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] when he was four years old. The exhibits became a turning point in his life. He later recalled the moving map of the ''[[Futurama (New York World's Fair)|America of Tomorrow]]'' exhibit: "It showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little General Motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers, buildings with lovely spires, flying buttresses—and it looked great!"<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|14}} At other exhibits, he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a [[Solar cell|photoelectric cell]] created a crackling sound, and how the sound from a [[tuning fork]] became a wave on an [[oscilloscope]]. He also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio: television. Sagan wrote:
: Plainly, the world held wonders of a kind I had never guessed. How could a tone become a picture and light become a noise?<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|14}}

He also saw one of the Fair's most publicized events, the burial of a [[time capsule]] at [[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park|Flushing Meadows]], which contained mementos of the 1930s to be recovered by Earth's descendants in a future millennium. "The time capsule thrilled Carl," writes Davidson. As an adult, Sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules—ones that would be sent out into the galaxy; these were the [[Pioneer plaque]] and the ''[[Voyager Golden Record]]'' records, all of which were spinoffs of Sagan's memories of the World's Fair.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|15}}

=== World War II ===
During [[World War&nbsp;II]] Sagan's family worried about the fate of their European relatives. Sagan, however, was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war. He wrote, "Sure, we had relatives who were caught up in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was not a popular fellow in our household...&nbsp;But on the other hand, I was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war." His sister, Carol, said that their mother "above all wanted to protect Carl...&nbsp;She had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with World War&nbsp;II and the Holocaust."<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|15}} Sagan's book, ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' (1996), included his memories of this conflicted period, when his family dealt with the realities of the war in Europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit.<ref name="Spangenburg" />

=== Inquisitiveness about nature ===
Soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature. Sagan recalled taking his first trips to the [[public library]] alone, at the age of five, when his mother got him a library card. He wanted to learn what stars were, since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer:
: I went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars&nbsp;... And the answer was stunning. It was that the Sun was a star but really close. The stars were suns, but so far away they were just little points of light&nbsp;... The scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me. It was a kind of religious experience. There was a magnificence to it, a grandeur, a scale which has never left me. Never ever left me.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|18}}

At about age six or seven, he and a close friend took trips to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City. While there, they went to the [[Hayden Planetarium]] and walked around the museum's exhibits of [[outer space|space]] objects, such as [[meteorite]]s, and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings. Sagan writes about those visits:
: I was transfixed by the dioramas—lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world. Penguins on the dimly lit Antarctic ice;&nbsp;...a family of [[gorilla]]s, the male beating his chest,&nbsp;...an American [[grizzly bear]] standing on his hind legs, ten or twelve feet tall, and staring me right in the eye.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|18}}

His parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials. His interest in space, however, was his primary focus, especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as [[Mars]]. According to biographer Ray Spangenburg, these early years as Sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a "driving force in his life, a continual spark to his intellect, and a quest that would never be forgotten."<ref name="Spangenburg" />

In 1947 he discovered ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine, which introduced him to more [[hard science fiction]] speculations than those in Burroughs's novels. That same year inaugurated the "[[flying saucer]]" [[mass hysteria]] with the young Carl suspecting the "discs" might be alien spaceships.<ref name="anb.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/13/13-02612-print.html |title=American National Biography Online, Carl Sagan}}</ref>

=== High school years ===
Sagan had lived in Bensonhurst where he went to David A. Boody Junior High School. He had his [[bar mitzvah]] in Bensonhurst when he turned 13.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|23}} The following year, 1948, his family moved to the nearby town of [[Rahway, New Jersey]] for his father's work, where Sagan then entered [[Rahway High School]]. He graduated in 1951.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|23}} Rahway was an older industrial town, and the Sagans were among its few Jewish families. Today the town is best known as the site of a [[East Jersey State Prison|state prison.]]<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|23}}

Sagan was a straight-A student but was bored due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring teachers.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|23}} His teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school, the administrator telling them, "This kid ought to go to a school for gifted children, he has something really remarkable."<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|24}} This they couldn't do, partly because of the cost.

Sagan was made president of the school's chemistry club, and at home he set up his own laboratory. He taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how [[molecules]] were formed: "I found that about as interesting as doing [chemical] experiments," he said.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|24}} Sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a hobby, and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed: "That was a splendid day&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;—when I began to suspect that if I tried hard I could do astronomy full-time, not just part-time."<ref name="Davidson"/>{{rp|25}}

== Education and scientific career ==
He attended the [[University of Chicago]], where he participated in the Ryerson Astronomical Society,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://astro.uchicago.edu/RAS/ |title=Ryerson Astronomical Society |work=Ryerson Astronomical Society (RAS) |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in self-proclaimed "nothing" with general and special honors in 1954, a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[physics]] in 1955, and an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] degree in [[physics]] in 1956, before earning a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in 1960 with the dissertation "Physical Studies of Planets" submitted to the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.<ref>{{Citation | last = Sagan | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Sagan | title = Physical Studies of the Planets | type = dissertation | date = June 1960 | publisher = University of Chicago | page = ii | quote = A thesis in four parts submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Department of Astronomy, University of Chicago, June, 1960.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |date=November 11, 1993 |title=Graduate students receive first Sagan teaching awards |journal=University of Chicago Chronicle |volume=13 |issue=6 |publisher=University of Chicago News Office |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/931111/sagan.shtml}}</ref><ref>[[#Head|Head 2006]], p. xxi</ref><ref>[[#Spangenburg & Moser|Spangenburg & Moser 2004]], p. 28</ref>  The title of Sagan's thesis reflects his shared interests with [[Gerard Kuiper]], his [[Doctoral advisor|dissertation director]], who throughout the 1950s had been president of the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s commission on "Physical Studies of Planets and Satellites".<ref>{{Citation | last = Tatarewicz | first = Joseph N. | author-link =  | title = Space Technology & Planetary Astronomy | place = Bloomington, IN | publisher = Indiana University Press | series = Science, technology, and society | year = 1990 | page = 22 | isbn = 0-253-35655-5 }}</ref>

During his time as an honors program [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]], Sagan worked in the laboratory of the [[geneticist]] [[Hermann Joseph Muller|H. J. Muller]] and wrote a thesis on the [[abiogenesis|origins of life]] with [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] [[Harold Urey|H. C. Urey]]. He used the summer months of his [[Postgraduate education|graduate studies]] to work with [[planetary science|planetary scientist]] Gerard Kuiper, physicist [[George Gamow]], and chemist [[Melvin Calvin]]. From 1960 to 1962 Sagan was a [[Miller Research Fellows|Miller Fellow]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/happy-belated-birthday-carl/ |title=Happy (Belated) Birthday Carl! |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] The Berkeley Science Review |accessdate=December 1, 2013}}</ref> From 1962 to 1968, he worked at the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. At the same time, he worked with [[geneticist]] [[Joshua Lederberg]].

Sagan lectured and did research at [[Harvard University]] until 1968, when he moved to Cornell University in [[Ithaca, New York]], after being denied [[Tenure (academic)|tenure]] at Harvard. It has been suggested that Sagan was denied tenure in part because of his publicized scientific advocacy, which some scientists perceived as being self-promotion;<ref name="morrison">{{cite journal |last=Morrison |first=David |authorlink=David Morrison (astrophysicist) |date=January–February 2007 |title=Carl Sagan's Life and Legacy as Scientist, Teacher, and Skeptic |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagans_life_and_legacy_as_scientist_teacher_and_skeptic |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |volume=31.1 |pages=29–38 |issn=0194-6730 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}</ref> [[Harold Urey]] wrote a letter to the tenure committee recommending against tenure for Sagan.<ref name="anb.org"/> He became a [[Professor|full professor]] at Cornell in 1971, and directed the Laboratory for [[Planetary science|Planetary Studies]] there. From 1972 to 1981, Sagan was associate director of the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research (CRSR) at Cornell.

Sagan was associated with the U.S. space program from its inception. From the 1950s onward, he worked as an advisor to [[NASA]], where one of his duties included briefing the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[astronaut]]s before their flights to the [[Moon]]. Sagan contributed to many of the [[robotic spacecraft]] missions that explored the [[Solar System]], arranging experiments on many of the expeditions. He conceived the idea of adding an unalterable and universal message on spacecraft destined to leave the Solar System that could potentially be understood by any [[extraterrestrial intelligence]] that might find it. Sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space: a [[gold]]-[[anodized]] [[Pioneer plaque|plaque]], attached to the space probe [[Pioneer&nbsp;10]], launched in 1972. [[Pioneer&nbsp;11]], also carrying another copy of the plaque, was launched the following year. He continued to refine his designs; the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the [[Voyager Golden Record]] that was sent out with the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] space probes in 1977. Sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]] at the expense of further robotic missions.<ref name="CharlieRose">{{cite interview |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=An Interview with Carl Sagan |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soF-aS169bw |program=''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' |callsign=[[PBS]] |city=New York |date=January 5, 1995 |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}</ref>

Sagan taught a course on [[critical thinking]] at Cornell University until he died in 1996 from pneumonia, a few months after finding that he was in remission of [[myelodysplastic syndrome]].

== Scientific achievements ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
Former student [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] describes Sagan as "an 'idea person' and a master of intuitive physical arguments and '[[Back-of-the-envelope calculation|back of the envelope]]' calculations,"<ref name="morrison" /> and Gerard Kuiper said that "Some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory; others are best in liaison between sciences. Dr. Sagan belongs in the latter group."<ref name="morrison" />

Sagan's contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet [[Venus]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In the early 1960s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of that planet's surface, and Sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a [[Time–Life]] book, ''Planets''. His own view was that Venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined. He had investigated radio emissions from Venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of {{convert|500|°C|-2}}. As a visiting scientist to NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], he contributed to the first [[Mariner program|Mariner]] missions to Venus, working on the design and management of the project. [[Mariner&nbsp;2]] confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of Venus in 1962.

Sagan was among{{clarify|date=October 2014}} the first to hypothesize that [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] might possess subsurface oceans of water. This would make Europa potentially habitable.<ref>Much of Sagan's research in the field of planetary science is outlined by [[William Poundstone]]. Poundstone's biography of Sagan includes an 8-page list of Sagan's scientific articles published from 1957 to 1998. Detailed information about Sagan's scientific work comes from the primary research articles. Example: {{cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=C. |last2=Thompson |first2=W.R. |last3=Khare |first3=B.N. |year=1992 |title=Titan: A Laboratory for Prebiological Organic Chemistry |journal=[[Accounts of Chemical Research]] |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=286–292 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |doi=10.1021/ar00019a003}} There is commentary on this research article about Titan at [[David J. Darling]]'s [http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/T/Titanprebiotic.html ''The Encyclopedia of Science''].</ref> Europa's subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]''. The mystery of Titan's reddish haze was also solved with Sagan's help. The reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] constantly raining down onto Titan's surface.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pafumi |first=G.R. |title=Is Our Vision of God Obsolete?: Often What We Believe is not What We Observe |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ySNfuGKwfMcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA338#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Xlibris]] |location=Bloomington, IN |isbn=978-1-4415-9041-1 |oclc=710798384 |page=338}}</ref>

He further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of Venus and Jupiter as well as seasonal changes on [[Mars]]. He also perceived [[global warming]] as a growing, man-made danger and likened it to the natural development of Venus into a hot, life-hostile planet through a kind of [[runaway greenhouse effect]].<ref name="cosmos_book" /> Sagan and his Cornell colleague [[Edwin Ernest Salpeter]] speculated about [[Jupiter#Possibility of life|life in Jupiter's clouds]], given the planet's dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules. He studied the observed color variations on Mars' surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believed{{clarify|date=October 2014}} but shifts in surface dust caused by [[dust storm#Extraterrestrial dust storms|windstorms]].

Sagan is best known, however, for his research on the possibilities of [[Astrobiology|extraterrestrial life]], including experimental demonstration of the production of [[amino acid]]s from basic chemicals by [[radiation]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |title=Sagan, Carl Edward |url=http://www.bartelby.com/65/sa/Sagan-Ca.html |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |edition=Sixth |date=May 2001 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=New York |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011220013/http://bartelby.com/65/sa/Sagan-Ca.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref><ref name="ATP Synthesized">{{cite news|last1=No Writer Attributed|title=Sagan Synthesizes ATP In Laboratory|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1963/8/21/sagan-synthesizes-atp-in-laboratory-plaboratory/|accessdate=2015-09-12|work=The Harvard Crimson|date=1963-08-21}}</ref>

== Scientific and critical thinking advocacy ==
<span id="Scientific_advocacy"><!-- [[Sagan (number)]] redirects here --></span>

Sagan's ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos better—simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race, and the relative insignificance of the Earth in comparison to the [[Universe]]. He delivered the 1977 series of [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]] in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://richannel.org/christmas-lectures/1977/1977-carl-sagan |title=Christmas Lectures 1977: The Planets : Ri Channel |work=Ri Channel |publisher=[[Royal Institution|Royal Institution of Great Britain]] |location=London |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}</ref> He hosted and, with [[Ann Druyan]], co-wrote and co-produced the highly popular thirteen-part [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.<ref name="NationalGeo">{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140316-carl-sagan-science-galaxies-space/ |title=Who Was Carl Sagan? |last=Vergano |first=Dan |date=March 16, 2014 |website=National Geographic Daily News |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}</ref>

Sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life. He urged the scientific community to listen with [[radio telescope]]s for signals from potential intelligent [[Extraterrestrial life#Indirect search|extraterrestrial life-forms]]. Sagan was so persuasive that by 1982 he was able to get a petition advocating SETI published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and signed by 70 scientists, including seven [[Nobel Prize]] winners. This was a tremendous increase in the respectability of this controversial field. Sagan also helped [[Frank Drake]] write the [[Arecibo message]], a radio message beamed into space from the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]] on November 16, 1974, aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about Earth.

Sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal ''[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]'' for twelve years. He co-founded [[The Planetary Society]], the largest space-interest group in the world, with over 100,000 members in more than 149 countries, and was a member of the [[SETI Institute]] Board of Trustees. Sagan served as Chairman of the Division for Planetary Science of the [[American Astronomical Society]], as President of the Planetology Section of the [[American Geophysical Union]], and as Chairman of the Astronomy Section of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS).

At the height of the [[Cold War]], Sagan became involved in public awareness efforts for the effects of [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] when a 1982 mathematical climate model, titled [[Nuclear winter#1982|"Twilight at Noon"]] suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could trigger a [[Nuclear winter#1982|nuclear twilight]] and upset the delicate balance of life on Earth by cooling the surface. In 1983 he was one of five authors—the "S"—in the follow-up [[Nuclear winter#1983|"TTAPS"]] report, as the research paper came to be known, which contained the term "[[nuclear winter]]" for the first time, a term coined by his colleague [[Richard P. Turco]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Turco |first1=R.P. |authorlink1=Richard P.

Sagan also wrote books to popularize science, such as ''Cosmos'', which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of ''A Personal Voyage'' and became the best-selling science book ever published in English;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.discovery.com/convergence/cosmos/bio/bio.html?clik=fsmain_feat3 |title=Meet Carl Sagan |work=[[Science (TV network)|The Science Channel]] |publisher=[[Discovery Communications]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070518042909/http://science.discovery.com/convergence/cosmos/bio/bio.html?clik=fsmain_feat3 |archivedate=May 18, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}</ref> ''[[The Dragons of Eden|The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence]]'', which won a [[Pulitzer Prize]]; and ''[[Broca's Brain (book)|Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]]''. Sagan also wrote the best-selling science fiction novel ''Contact'' in 1985, based on a [[film treatment]] he wrote with his wife in 1979, but he did not live to see the book's 1997 [[Contact (1997 US film)|motion picture adaptation]], which starred [[Jodie Foster]] and won the 1998 [[Hugo Award]] for Best Dramatic Presentation.

He wrote a sequel to ''Cosmos'', ''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space]]'', which was selected as a notable book of 1995 by ''[[The New York Times]]''. He appeared on PBS' ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' program in January 1995.<ref name="CharlieRose" /> Sagan also wrote the introduction for [[Stephen Hawking]]'s bestseller, ''[[A Brief History of Time]]''. Sagan was also known for his popularization of science, his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public, and his positions in favor of [[scientific skepticism]] and against [[pseudoscience]], such as his [[Debunker|debunking]] of the [[Betty and Barney Hill abduction]]. To mark the tenth anniversary of Sagan's death, [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]], a former student of Sagan's, recalled "Sagan's immense contributions to planetary research, the public understanding of science, and the skeptical movement" in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''.<ref name="morrison" />

Following [[Saddam Hussein]]'s threats to light [[Kuwait]]'s oil wells on fire in response to any physical challenge to [[Iraq]]i control of the oil assets, Sagan and his "TTAPS" colleagues warned in January 1991 in the [[Baltimore Sun]] and [[Wilmington Morning Star]] newspapers that if the fires were left to burn over a period of several months, enough smoke from the 600 or so 1991 [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] "might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of South Asia&nbsp;..." and that this possibility should "affect the war plans";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan |title=PAGE 1 OF 2: Burning oil wells could be disaster, Sagan says January 23, 1991}}</ref><ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6tEVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RBQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6851,2148654&dq=world-climate-conference+oil+fires&hl=en Wilmington morning Star] January 21’st, 1991</ref> these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between Sagan and physicist [[Fred Singer]] on 22 January, aired on the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/4960296/The-Kuwaiti-Oli-Fires|title=The Kuwaiti Oil Fires|author=Hirschmann, Kris|publisher=Facts on File.}}</ref><!--The reference for this is a hardcopy transcript of the episode, excerpts on the Fred Singer talk page.--><ref>{{cite episode| title = FIRST ISRAELI SCUD FATALITIES OIL FIRES IN KUWAIT| series = Nightline| serieslink = Nightline (US news program)| network = ABC| airdate = 1991-01-22| transcript = yes }}</ref>[[File:F-14A VF-114 over burning Kuwaiti oil well 1991.JPEG|thumb|left|Sagan admitted he was wrong about the extent of danger from the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]].]] In the televised debate, Sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a [[nuclear winter]], with Singer arguing to the contrary. After the debate, the fires burnt for many months before extinguishing efforts were complete, the results of the smoke did not produce continental-sized cooling. Sagan later conceded in ''The Demon-Haunted World'' that the prediction did not turn out to be correct: "it ''was'' pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4°–6 °C over the [[Persian Gulf]], but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared".<ref>[[#Sagan 1995|Sagan 1995]], p. 257</ref>

In his later years Sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for asteroids/[[near-Earth object]]s (NEO) that might impact the Earth, and to postpone developing the technology to defend against them.<ref>[[#Head|Head 2006]], p. 86–87</ref> He argued that the [[nuclear weapon design|nuclear detonation]], along with the other methods of deflection proposed as a means to [[asteroid impact avoidance|alter the orbit of an asteroid]], created a [[Asteroid impact avoidance#Deflection technology concerns|Deflection Dilemma]]: if the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the Earth exists, then one would also have the ability to deflect a close approaching asteroid towards Earth, creating an immensely destructive weapon.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=Carl |last2=Ostro |first2=Steven J. |authorlink2=Steven J.

Sagan however was hopeful that the natural impact threat and the intrinsically [[double edged sword|double edged]] essence of the methods to prevent these threats, would serve as a "new and potent motivation to maturing international relations".<ref>{{cite podcast |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/silicon-valley-astronomy-lectures/taking-a-hit-asteroid-impacts-and-evolution/ |title=Taking a Hit: Asteroid Impacts & Evolution |website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific |publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] |last=Morrison |first=David |date=October 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=Carl |last2=Ostro |first2=Steven J. |authorlink2=Steven J.

Sagan was a critic of [[Plato]]. Sagan said of Plato: "Science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the artisans. This tendency found its most effective advocate in a follower of [[Pythagoras]] named Plato" and "He (Plato) believed that ideas were far more real than the natural world. He advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets. It was better, he believed, just to think about them. Plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment. He taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge. Plato's followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by [[Democritus]] and the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|other Ionians]]."<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Backbone of Night |series=[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]] |first=Carl (writer/host) |last=Sagan |network=PBS |airdate=November 9, 1980 |number=7}}</ref>

=== Popularizing science ===
Speaking about his activities in popularizing science, Sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to explain what science is about. Naked self-interest was one because much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public had a right to know how their money was being spent. If scientists increased public excitement about science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters. The other reason was the excitement of communicating one's own excitement about science to others.<ref>{{cite news |title=Carl Sagan, an Astronomer Who Excelled at Popularizing Science, Is Dead at 62 |first=William |last=Dicke |url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1109.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 21, 1996 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}</ref>

From ''Cosmos'' and his frequent appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', Sagan became associated with the [[catchphrase]] "billions and billions".

[[Frank Zappa]] satirized the line in the song "Be in My Video", noting as well "atomic light". Sagan took this all in good humor, and his final book was entitled ''[[Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium|Billions and Billions]]'', which opened with a tongue-in-cheek discussion of this catchphrase, observing that Carson was an amateur astronomer and that Carson's comic caricature often included real science.<ref name="BandB" />

He is also known for expressing wonderment at the vastness of space and time, as in his phrase "The total number of stars in the Universe is larger than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth."

== Social concerns ==
Sagan believed that the [[Drake equation]], on substitution of reasonable estimates, suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the [[Fermi paradox]] suggests [[Technology|technological]] civilizations tend to self-destruct. This stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself, with the hope of avoiding such a [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|cataclysm]] and eventually becoming a [[spacefaring]] species. Sagan's deep concern regarding the potential destruction of [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|human civilization]] in a [[nuclear holocaust]] was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of ''Cosmos'', called "Who Speaks for Earth?" Sagan had already resigned{{date?}} from the [[United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board|Air Force Scientific Advisory Board]]'s UFO investigating [[Condon Committee]] and voluntarily surrendered his [[Security clearance#Top Secret|top secret clearance]] in protest over the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Druyan |first=Ann |authorlink=Ann Druyan |date=November 2000 |title=A New Sense of the Sacred Carl Sagan's 'Cosmic Connection' |journal=[[American Humanist Association|The Humanist]] |volume=60 |issue=6 |publisher=[[American Humanist Association]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=August 29, 2013 |url=http://www.questia.com/library/1G1-78889720/a-new-sense-of-the-sacred-carl-sagan-s-cosmic-connection}}</ref> Following his marriage to his third wife ([[novelist]] Ann Druyan) in June 1981, Sagan became more politically active—particularly in opposing escalation of the [[nuclear arms race]] under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]].
[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|The United States and [[Soviet Union]]/Russia nuclear stockpiles, in [[Historical nuclear weapons stockpiles and nuclear tests by country|total number of nuclear bombs/warheads in existence]] throughout the [[Cold War]] and post-Cold War era.]]
In March 1983, Reagan announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]—a multibillion-dollar project to develop a comprehensive [[missile defense|defense]] against attack by [[Nuclear weapons delivery#Ballistic missile|nuclear missiles]], which was quickly dubbed the "Star Wars" program. Sagan spoke out against the project, arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required, and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through [[Decoy#Military decoy|decoy]]s and other means—and that its construction would seriously destabilize the "nuclear balance" between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], making further progress toward [[nuclear disarmament]] impossible.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

When Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] declared a unilateral moratorium on the [[Nuclear weapons testing|testing of nuclear weapons]], which would begin on August 6, 1985—the 40th&nbsp;anniversary of the [[Nuclear weapon#Fission weapons|atomic bomb]]ing of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]]—the Reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda, and refused to follow suit. In response, US [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the [[Nevada National Security Site|Nevada Test Site]], beginning on [[Easter|Easter Sunday]] in 1986 and continuing through 1987. Hundreds of people in the "[[Nevada Desert Experience]]" group were arrested, including Sagan, who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chain-link fence at the test site during the underground [[Operation Charioteer]] and [[Operation Musketeer (Nuclear test)|United States's Musketeer nuclear test series]] of detonations.<ref>[[#Spangenburg & Moser|Spangenburg & Moser 2004]], p. 106</ref>

Sagan was also a vocal advocate of the controversial notion of [[testosterone poisoning]], arguing in 1992 that human males could become gripped by an "usually severe [case of] testosterone poisoning" and this could compel them to become [[genocidal]].<ref>[http://books.google.ie/books?id=XX6Us6SjLYkC&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=testoosterone+poisoning+carl+sagan&source=bl&ots=eQKKVx9Vyx&sig=PEYODgmGPwat-mak_d0XcKo-jcc&hl=ga&sa=X&ei=SwYuVNDyKtDkaP-jgNgG&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=testoosterone%20poisoning%20carl%20sagan&f=false Rethinking Risk and the Precautionary Principle, edited by Julian Morris. pg 116]</ref> In his review of [[Moondance magazine]] writer [[Daniela Gioseffi]]'s 1990 book ''Women on War'', he argues that females are the only half of humanity "untainted by testosterone poisoning".<ref>[http://www.italianamericanwriters.com/womenonwar.html Women On War], Daniela Gioseffi.</ref> </blockquote> One chapter of his 1993 book, ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (book)|Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'' is dedicated to testosterone and its alleged poisonous effects.<ref>[http://books.google.ie/books?id=iMjaAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA102&lpg=PA102&dq=testoosterone+poisoning+carl+sagan&source=bl&ots=84MxQzhyJL&sig=B6FYDXOMswvpTX4N34Wgd_YF2M0&hl=ga&sa=X&ei=SwYuVNDyKtDkaP-jgNgG&ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=testoosterone%20poisoning%20carl%20sagan&f=false Atheists in America edited by Melanie E.

== Personal life and beliefs ==
Sagan was married three times.  In 1957, he married biologist [[Lynn Margulis]], mother of [[Dorion Sagan]] and [[Jeremy Sagan]].  After Sagan and Margulis divorced, he married artist [[Linda Salzman Sagan|Linda Salzman]] in 1968, mother of [[Nick Sagan]].  During these marriages, Sagan focused heavily on his career, a factor which may have contributed to Sagan's first divorce.<ref name="morrison" /> In 1981, Sagan married author [[Ann Druyan]], mother of Alexandra Rachel (Sasha) Sagan and Samuel Democritus Sagan.  Sagan and Druyan remained married until his death in 1996.

''How They Said it'', Prentice-Hall Press (2000) p. 20</ref>}}

[[Isaac Asimov]] described Sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own. The other, he claimed, was the [[Computer science|computer scientist]] and [[artificial intelligence]] expert [[Marvin Minsky]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978 |origyear=Originally published 1980; Garden City, NY: [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |year=1981 |publisher=[[Avon (publisher)|Avon]] |location=New York |isbn=0-380-53025-2 |oclc=7880716 |lccn=79003685 |pages=217, 302}}</ref>

Sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example: <blockquote>Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Albert Einstein]]—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=[[Broca's Brain (book)|Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]] |edition=Reprint |origyear=Originally published 1979 |year=1980 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=0-345-33689-5 |oclc=428008204 |lccn=78021810 |page=330}}</ref></blockquote>

In another description of his view on the concept of God, Sagan emphatically writes: <blockquote>The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God. This God is emotionally unsatisfying&nbsp;... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/library/quotes/bl_q_CSagan.htm |title=Quotes on Religion – Carl Sagan |website=Atheism.about.com |publisher=[[IAC (company)|IAC]] |accessdate=March 10, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: <blockquote>An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.<ref name="Sagan2006">[[#Head|Head 2006]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=gJ1rDj2nR3EC&pg=PA70 p. 70]</ref></blockquote>

Sagan also commented on Christianity, stating "My long-time view about Christianity is that it represents an amalgam of two seemingly immiscible parts, the religion of Jesus and the religion of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. Thomas Jefferson attempted to excise the Pauline parts of the New Testament. There wasn't much left when he was done, but it was an inspiring document."<ref>{{cite book|last=Schei|first=Kenneth A.|title=An Atheist for Jesus|year=1996|publisher=Synthesis|isbn=0-926491-01-6}}</ref>

Regarding the relationship between spirituality and science, Sagan stated: "Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bennett |first1=Jeffrey O. |last2=Donahue |first2=Megan O. |last3=Schneider |first3=Nicholas |last4=Voit |first4=Mark |title=The Cosmic Perspective |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |location=Boston |edition=6th (student) |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-321-63366-8 |oclc=569911190 |lccn=2009040910 |display-authors=3}}</ref>

An environmental appeal, "Preserving and Cherishing the Earth", signed by Sagan with other noted scientists in January 1990, stated that "The historical record makes clear that religious teaching, example, and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment... Thus, there is a vital role for religion and science."<ref name="The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology">{{cite web |work=[[The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology]]|url=http://fore.research.yale.edu/publications/statements/preserve/|title=Preserving and Cherishing the Earth|year= 2013 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}</ref>

In 2006, Ann Druyan edited Sagan's 1985 Glasgow ''[[Gifford Lectures]] in Natural Theology'' into a book, ''[[The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God]]'', in which he elaborates on his views of divinity in the [[nature|natural world]].

Sagan is also widely regarded as a [[freethought|freethinker]] or [[skepticism|skeptic]]; one of his most famous quotations, in ''Cosmos'', was, "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"<ref>{{Cite episode | title= Encyclopaedia Galactica | series=Cosmos: A Personal Voyage |first=Carl (writer/host) |last=Sagan | network=PBS | airdate=December 14, 1980 | number=12 | minutes=01:24}}</ref> (called the "Sagan Standard" by some<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lawsoflife.co.uk/sagans-standard/ | title= Sagan's Standard |last=Rawson |first=Hugh | work=The Unwritten Laws of Life | publisher= CSBC Ltd | year=2008 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120112045003/http://lawsoflife.co.uk/sagans-standard/ |archivedate=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref>).

Late in his life, Sagan's books elaborated on his skeptical, [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] view of the world. In ''The Demon-Haunted World'', he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones, essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method. The compilation ''Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium'', published in 1997 after Sagan's death, contains essays written by Sagan, such as his views on abortion, and his widow Ann Druyan's account of his death as a skeptic, [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], and freethinker.

Sagan warned against humans' tendency towards [[anthropocentrism]]. He was the faculty adviser for the Cornell Students for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In the ''Cosmos'' chapter "Blues For a Red Planet", Sagan wrote, "If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even if the Martians are only microbes."<ref>[[#Sagan 1980 (1985 ed.)|Sagan 1980 (1985 ed.)]], p. 108</ref>

Sagan was a user and advocate of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Under the pseudonym "Mr.&nbsp;X", he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the 1971 book ''Marihuana Reconsidered''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grinspoon |first=Lester |authorlink=Lester Grinspoon |others=New introduction by author |edition=2nd (reprint) |title=Marihuana Reconsidered |origyear=2nd ed. published 1977; Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1994 |publisher=Quick American Archives |location=Oakland, CA |isbn=0-932551-13-0 |oclc=32410025 |lccn=77076767}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Mr. X | url=http://marijuana-uses.com/mr-x/ | publisher=Marijuana-Uses.com | author=Sagan, Carl | accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref><!-- NOTE: The book's title spells 'Marihuana' with an 'h' --> The essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of Sagan's works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences.

== Sagan and UFOs ==
In 1947, the year that inaugurated the "[[flying saucer]]" [[fad|craze]], the young Sagan suspected the "discs" might be alien spaceships.<ref name="anb.org"/>

Sagan's interest in [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] reports prompted him on August 3, 1952, to write a letter to U.S.&nbsp;Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] to ask how the United States would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial.<ref name="Davidson" />{{rp|51–52}} He later had several conversations on the subject in 1964 with [[Jacques Vallée]].<ref name=westrum>{{cite book |last=Westrum |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Westrum |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=David M. |editor-link=David M.

[[Stuart Appelle]] notes that Sagan "wrote frequently on what he perceived as the [[logic]]al and [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fallacy|fallacies]] regarding UFOs and the [[Alien abduction|abduction experience]]. Sagan rejected an [[extraterrestrial hypothesis|extraterrestrial explanation]] for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] benefits for examining UFO reports and that the subject was, therefore, a legitimate topic of study."<ref>{{cite book |last=Appelle |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Appelle |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=David M. |title=UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge |year=2000 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |location=Lawrence, KS |pages=7–30 |chapter=Ufology and Academia: The UFO Phenomenon as a Scholarly Discipline |isbn=0-7006-1032-4 |oclc=43615835 |lccn=00028970}}</ref>

In 1966 Sagan was a member of the Ad&nbsp;Hoc Committee to Review [[Project Blue Book]], the [[United States Air Force|U.S.&nbsp;Air Force]]'s UFO investigation project. The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the [[Condon Committee]] (1966–68), led by physicist [[Edward Condon]], and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of what any of them actually were, did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security.

Sociologist [[Ron Westrum]] writes that "The high point of Sagan's treatment of the UFO question was the AAAS' symposium in 1969. A wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants, including not only proponents such as [[James E. McDonald|James McDonald]] and [[J.&nbsp;Allen Hynek]] but also skeptics like astronomers [[William Kenneth Hartmann|William Hartmann]] and [[Donald Howard Menzel|Donald Menzel]]. The roster of speakers was balanced, and it is to Sagan's credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from Edward Condon."<ref name=westrum /> With physicist Thornton Page, Sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium; these were published in 1972 as ''UFO's: A Scientific Debate''. Some of Sagan's many books examine UFOs (as did one episode of ''Cosmos'') and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon.

Sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his 1980 ''Cosmos'' series. In one of his last written works, Sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth are vanishingly small. However, Sagan did think it plausible that Cold War concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about UFOs, and wrote that "some UFO reports and analyses, and perhaps voluminous files, have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills&nbsp;... It's time for the files to be declassified and made generally available." He cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed UFO data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the Earth either in the past or present.<ref>[[#Sagan 1995|Sagan 1995]], pp. 81–96, 99–104</ref>

In 1997 the [[Sagan Planet Walk]] was opened in Ithaca, New York. It is a walking-scale model of the Solar System, extending 1.2&nbsp;km from the center of The Commons in downtown Ithaca to the [[Sciencenter]], a hands-on museum. The exhibition was created in memory of Carl Sagan, who was an Ithaca resident and Cornell Professor. Professor Sagan had been a founding member of the museum's advisory board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencenter.org/saganpw/ |title=Sagan Planet Walk |website=sciencenter.org |publisher=[[Sciencenter]] |location=Ithaca, NY |accessdate=March 10, 2013}}</ref>

The landing site of the unmanned [[Mars Pathfinder]] spacecraft was renamed the ''[[Mars Pathfinder#End of mission|Carl Sagan Memorial Station]]'' on July 5, 1997. Asteroid [[2709&nbsp;Sagan]] is named in his honor, as is the [[Carl Sagan Institute]] for the search of habitable planets.

Sagan's son, Nick Sagan, wrote several episodes in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. In an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' entitled "[[Terra Prime]]", a quick shot is shown of the relic [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] ''[[Mars Pathfinder#Sojourner rover|Sojourner]]'', part of the Mars Pathfinder mission, placed by a historical marker at [[Mars Pathfinder|Carl Sagan Memorial Station]] on the Martian surface. The marker displays a quote from Sagan: "Whatever the reason you're on Mars, I'm glad you're there, and I wish I was with you." Sagan's student [[Steve Squyres]] led the team that landed the rovers ''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' and ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity]]'' successfully on Mars in 2004.

On November 9, 2001, on what would have been Sagan's 67th birthday, the [[Ames Research Center]] dedicated the site for the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Cosmos. "Carl was an incredible visionary, and now his legacy can be preserved and advanced by a 21st&nbsp;century research and education laboratory committed to enhancing our understanding of life in the universe and furthering the cause of space exploration for all time", said NASA Administrator [[Daniel Goldin]]. Ann Druyan was at the Center as it opened its doors on October 22, 2006.

Sagan has at least three awards named in his honor:
* The [[Carl Sagan Memorial Award]] presented jointly since 1997 by the American Astronomical Society and The Planetary Society,
* The [[Carl Sagan Medal]] for Excellence in Public Communication in Planetary Science presented since 1998 by the American Astronomical Society's [[Division for Planetary Sciences]] (AAS/DPS) for outstanding communication by an active planetary scientist to the general public—Carl Sagan was one of the original organizing committee members of the DPS, and
* The [[Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science]] presented by the [[Council of Scientific Society Presidents]] (CSSP)—Sagan was the first recipient of the CSSP award in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cssp.us/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=17&Itemid=47 |title=Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science |publisher=Council of Scientific Society Presidents |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070726075012/http://cssp.us/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=17&Itemid=47 |archivedate=July 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 2, 2007}}</ref>

In 2006, the [[Carl Sagan Medal]] was awarded to astrobiologist and author [[David Grinspoon]], the son of Sagan's close friend [[Lester Grinspoon]].

August 2007 the [[Independent Investigations Group]] (IIG) awarded Sagan posthumously a Lifetime Achievement Award.

In February 2015, the Finnish-based [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]] released the song "Sagan" as a non-album bonus track for their single "[[Élan (song)|Élan]]".<ref>http://www.nightwish.com/en/news?page=2</ref> The song, written by the band's songwriter/composer/keyboardist [[Tuomas Holopainen]], is an homage to the life and work of the late Carl Sagan.

In August 2015, it was announced that a biopic of Sagan's life was being planned by Warner Brothers.<ref>[http://www.tracking-board.com/tb-exclusive-warner-bros-heads-to-the-cosmos-with-carl-sagan-biopic/ "WARNER BROS.
