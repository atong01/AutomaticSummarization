Pascal invented his machine just four hundred years ago, as a youth of nineteen. He was spurred to it by sharing the burden of arithmetical labor involved in his father's official work as supervisor of taxes at Rouen. He conceived the idea of doing the work mechanically, and developed a design appropriate for this purpose ; showing herein the same combination of pure science and mechanical genius that characterized his whole life. But it was one thing to conceive and design the machine, and another to get it made and put into use. Here were needed those practical gifts that he displayed later in his inventions....<xhtml:br></xhtml:br>In a sense, Pascal's invention was premature, in that the mechanical arts in his time were not sufficiently advanced to enable his machine to be made at an economic price, with the accuracy and strength needed for reasonably long use. This difficulty was not overcome until well on into the nineteenth century, by which time also a renewed stimulus to invention was given by the need for many kinds of calculation more intricate than those considered by Pascal.<space/><link><target>#NAT CHAP</target><part>S.

They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British<space/><link><target>Pilot ACE</target></link><space/>computer project, to lead the development. The<space/><link><target>Sumlock ANITA calculator</target><part>ANITA</part></link><space/>sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.</paragraph><paragraph>The tube technology of the<space/><link><target>Sumlock ANITA calculator</target><part>ANITA</part></link><space/>was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured<space/><link><target>Friden, Inc.</target><part>Friden</part></link><space/>EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a<space/><template><target>convert</target><arg>5</arg><arg>in</arg><arg>cm</arg><arg name="adj">on</arg></template><space/><link><target>Cathode ray tube</target><part>CRT</part></link>, and introduced<space/><link><target>reverse Polish notation</target></link><space/>(RPN) to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced:<space/><link><target>Sharp Corporation</target><part>Sharp</part></link><space/>introduced the<space/><link><target>CS-10A</target></link>, which weighed 25&amp;nbsp;kg (55&amp;nbsp;lb) and cost 500,000 yen (~US$2500), and Industria Macchine Elettroniche of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time).</paragraph><paragraph>There followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers, including Canon, Mathatronics,<space/><link><target>Olivetti</target></link>, SCM (Smith-Corona-Marchant), Sony, Toshiba, and Wang.

Memory, implemented by an acoustic delay line, could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards. It is regarded as the first personal computer produced by a company (that is, a desktop<space/><bold>electronic calculating machine</bold><space/>programmable by non-specialists for personal use).

This, and another few similar models, used Sharp's &quot;COS&quot; (Calculator On Substrate) technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the Liquid Crystal Display was used as a substrate to mount the required chips based on a new hybrid technology. The &quot;COS&quot; technology may have been too expensive since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.</paragraph><paragraph>In the mid-1970s the first calculators appeared with field-effect,<space/><italics>Twisted Nematic TN</italics><space/>LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging<space/><link><target>ultraviolet</target></link><space/>rays. The advantage of LCDs is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the<space/><link><target>Casio</target></link><space/><italics>Mini Card LC-78</italics><space/>of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.</paragraph><paragraph>There were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators. All of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first &quot;Calculator on a chip&quot;<space/><link><target>integrated circuits</target></link><space/>in 1971, but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high. Many calculators continued to use two or more<space/><link><target>integrated circuits</target></link><space/>(ICs), especially the scientific and the programmable ones, into the late 1970s.</paragraph><paragraph>The power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced, especially with the introduction of<space/><link><target>CMOS</target></link><space/>technology. Appearing in the Sharp &quot;EL-801&quot; in 1972, the<space/><link><target>transistor</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>in the logic cells of CMOS ICs only used any appreciable power when they changed state. The<space/><link><target>LED</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Vacuum fluorescent display</target><part>VFD</part></link><space/>displays often required additional driver transistors or ICs, whereas the LCD displays were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator IC itself.</paragraph><paragraph>With this low power consumption came the possibility of using<space/><link><target>solar cells</target></link><space/>as the power source, realised around 1978 by such calculators as the Royal<space/><italics>Solar 1</italics>, Sharp<space/><italics>EL-8026</italics>, and Teal<space/><italics>Photon</italics>.<table style='border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid grey;'><tablerow><tablecell valign="top" align="left"><link><target>File:CasioFX20-inside.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>center</part><part></part></link><xhtml:br></xhtml:br>The interior of a Casio fx-20 scientific calculator from the mid-1970s, using a VFD.

The high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were expensive to produce, and production runs were not very large. Many companies saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on these high prices. However, the cost of calculators fell as components and their production techniques improved, and the effect of economies of scale was felt.</paragraph><paragraph>By 1976 the cost of the cheapest four-function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars, about one 20th of the cost five years earlier. The consequences of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable, and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit out of calculators, leading to many companies dropping out of the business or closing down altogether. The companies that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators, or producing high-specification scientific and programmable calculators.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Mid-1980s to present</heading><paragraph>The first calculator capable of symbolic computation was the<space/><link><target>HP-28</target><trail>C</trail></link>, released in 1987.

In 2003 several new models were released, including an improved version of the HP 12c, the &quot;HP 12c platinum edition&quot; which added more memory, more built-in functions, and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Calculated Industries</target></link><space/>competed with the<space/><link><target>HP-12C</target><part>HP 12c</part></link><space/>in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling; changing the I, PV, FV to easier labeling terms such as &quot;Int&quot;, &quot;Term&quot;, &quot;Pmt&quot;, and not using the<space/><link><target>reverse Polish notation</target></link>.
