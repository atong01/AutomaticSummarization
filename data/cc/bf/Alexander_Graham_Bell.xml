He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house. Keeping &quot;night owl&quot; hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment.

Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell's previous application in which Bell described a cup of mercury, not water. Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and because he did not contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876.

According to one of his biographers,<space/><link><target>Charlotte Gray (author)</target><part>Charlotte Gray</part></link>, Bell's work ranged &quot;unfettered across the scientific landscape&quot; and he often went to bed voraciously reading the<space/><italics>Encyclopdia Britannica</italics>, scouring it for new areas of interest.<template><target>sfn</target><arg>Gray</arg><arg>2006</arg><arg name="p">219</arg></template><space/>The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the<space/><link><target>photophone</target></link>, one for the<space/><link><target>phonograph</target></link>, five for aerial vehicles, four for &quot;hydroairplanes&quot; and two for<space/><link><target>selenium</target></link><space/>cells.

During his<space/><link><target>Volta Laboratory and Bureau</target><part>Volta Laboratory</part></link><space/>period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a<space/><link><target>magnetic field</target></link><space/>on a record as a means of reproducing sound.

Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of Garfield, Bell &quot;...proceeded to the Executive Mansion the next morning...to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed. It was then recollected that underneath the horse-hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires. Upon obtaining a duplicate, the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires, with large meshes. The extent of the [area that produced a response from the detector] having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect.&quot; In a footnote, Bell adds that &quot;The death of President Garfield and the subsequent<space/><italics>post-mortem</italics><space/>examination, however, proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus.&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Bell<space/></arg><arg name="first">Alexander Graham<space/></arg><arg name="date">1882<space/></arg><arg name="title">Upon the electrical experiments to determine the location of the bullet in the body of the late President Garfield; and upon a successful form of induction balance for the painless detection of metallic masses in the human body<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Gibson Brothers<space/></arg><arg name="location">Washington, DC<space/></arg><arg name="url">https://archive.org/details/uponelectricalex00bell<space/></arg><arg name="p">33<space/></arg><arg name="access-date">April 29, 2013<space/></arg><arg name="ref">harv</arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Hydrofoils</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>HD-4</arg></template><link><target>File:Bell HD-4.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Bell<space/><link><target>HD-4</target></link><space/>on a test run ca. 1919</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The March 1906<space/><italics><link><target>Scientific American</target></link></italics><space/>article by American pioneer William E.
