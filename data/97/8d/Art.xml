Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the<space/><link><target>muses</target></link>, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the<space/><italics><link><target>Phaedrus (Plato)</target><part>Phaedrus</part></link><space/></italics>(265ac), and yet in the<space/><italics><link><target>Republic (Plato)</target><part>''Republic''</part></link></italics><space/>wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In<space/><italics><link><target>Ion (dialogue)</target><part>Ion</part></link></italics>, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the<space/><italics>Republic</italics>. The dialogue<space/><italics>Ion</italics><space/>suggests that<space/><link><target>Homer</target></link>'s<space/><italics><link><target>Iliad</target></link></italics><space/>functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted. With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered<space/><link><target>epic poetry</target></link>, tragedy, comedy,<space/><link><target>Dithyramb</target><part>dithyrambic poetry</part></link><space/>and music to be<space/><link><target>Mimesis</target><part>mimetic</part></link><space/>or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.<extension extension_name='ref'>Aristotle,<space/><italics>Poetics</italics><space/>I 1447a</extension><space/>For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.<extension extension_name='ref'>Aristotle,<space/><italics>Poetics</italics><space/>III</extension><space/>Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.<extension extension_name='ref'>Aristotle,<space/><italics>Poetics</italics><space/>IV</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The second, and more recent, sense of the word<space/><italics>art</italics><space/>as an abbreviation for<space/><italics>creative art</italics><space/>or<space/><italics>fine art</italics><space/>emerged in the early 17th century.<extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</target><part>The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</part></link>.<space/><italics><link><target>Oxford University Press</target></link></italics>, Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;120</extension><space/>Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or<space/><italics>finer</italics><space/>work of art.</paragraph><paragraph>Within this latter sense, the word<space/><italics>art</italics><space/>may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (<italics>art</italics><space/>as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce<space/><italics>artworks</italics><space/>(<italics>art</italics><space/>as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience). Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as<space/><link><target>Kant</target></link>, the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.</paragraph><paragraph>Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered<space/><link><target>commercial art</target></link><space/>instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered<space/><link><target>applied art</target></link>. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.<extension extension_name='ref'>David Novitz, &quot;The Boundaries of Art&quot;, 1992</extension><space/>However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see<space/><link><target>aesthetics</target></link>); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong<space/><link><target>emotion</target><trail>s</trail></link>. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.</paragraph><paragraph>The nature of art has been described by philosopher<space/><link><target>Richard Wollheim</target></link><space/>as &quot;one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref'>Richard Wollheim,<space/><italics>Art and its objects</italics>, p.1, 2nd edn, 1980, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-29706-0</extension><space/>Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating<space/><link><target>Formalism (art)</target><part>formal elements</part></link><space/>for their own sake, and as<space/><italics><link><target>mimesis</target></link></italics><space/>or<space/><link><target>Representation (arts)</target><part>representation</part></link>.

Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Byzantine art</target><part>Byzantine</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Medieval art</target></link><space/>of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms.

Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning<space/><link><target>terracotta army</target></link><space/>of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example,<space/><link><target>Tang dynasty</target></link><space/>paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but<space/><link><target>Ming Dynasty</target></link><space/>paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition.

Pointillism, a technique in late Impressionism (1880s) developed especially by the artist<space/><link><target>Georges Seurat</target></link>, employs dots to create variation in color and depth in an attempt to approximate the way people really see color. Both artists use dots, but the particular style and technique relate to the artistic movement adopted by each artist.</paragraph><paragraph>These are all ways of beginning to define a work of art, to narrow it down.<template><target>quote</target><arg>Imagine you are an art critic whose mission is to compare the meanings you find in a wide range of individual artworks. How would you proceed with your task? One way to begin is to examine the materials each artist selected in making an object, image video, or event. The decision to cast a sculpture in bronze, for instance, inevitably effects its meaning; the work becomes something different from how it might be if it had been cast in gold or plastic or chocolate, even if everything else about the artwork remains the same. Next, you might examine how the materials in each artwork have become an arrangement of shapes, colors, textures, and lines. These, in turn, are organized into various patterns and compositional structures. In your interpretation, you would comment on how salient features of the form contribute to the overall meaning of the finished artwork. [But in the end] the meaning of most artworks... is not exhausted by a discussion of materials, techniques, and form. Most interpretations also include a discussion of the ideas and feelings the artwork engenders.<ref>Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980, page 4.

Much art has been commissioned by rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society. Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the<space/><link><target>ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas</target></link><space/>are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a<space/><link><target>social elite</target></link>, though other forms of art may have been.

Once<space/><link><target>coin</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>were widely used these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society. Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when<space/><link><target>printmaking</target></link><space/>began with small<space/><link><target>woodcut</target><trail>s</trail></link>, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by<space/><link><target>peasant</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>who glued them to the walls of their homes.

Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the<space/><link><target>Palace of Versailles</target></link>, where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.</paragraph><paragraph>Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the<space/><link><target>Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris</target><part>Orleans Collection</part></link><space/>mostly housed in a wing of the<space/><link><target>Palais Royal</target></link><space/>in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy the art tourism of the<space/><link><target>Grand Tour</target></link><space/>became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British<space/><link><target>Royal Collection</target></link><space/>remains distinct, but large donations such as the<space/><link><target>Old Royal Library</target></link><space/>were made from it to the<space/><link><target>British Museum</target></link>, established in 1753. The<space/><link><target>Uffizi</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Florence</target></link><space/>opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before. The building now occupied by the<space/><link><target>Prado</target></link><space/>in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in<space/><link><target>Vienna</target></link>, Munich and other capitals. The opening of the<space/><link><target>Muse du Louvre</target></link><space/>during the<space/><link><target>French Revolution</target></link><space/>(in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.</paragraph><paragraph>Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone.

Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art.

At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1946,<space/><link><target>W.

Rather, &quot;the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life&quot; are &quot;so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art&quot; (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the<space/><link><target>Daily Mail</target></link><space/>criticized<space/><link><target>Damien Hirst</target><part>Hirst</part></link>'s and<space/><link><target>Tracey Emin</target><part>Emin</part></link>'s work by arguing &quot;For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces.

It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity.</paragraph><paragraph>Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered<space/><italics>art</italics><space/>is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, &quot;good&quot; art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example,<space/><link><target>Francisco Goya</target></link>'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd&amp;nbsp;of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.</paragraph><paragraph>The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the<space/><italics><link><target>zeitgeist</target></link></italics>.</paragraph><paragraph>Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse<space/><link><target>aesthetic</target></link><space/>or<space/><link><target>morality</target><part>moral</part></link><space/>feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously.
