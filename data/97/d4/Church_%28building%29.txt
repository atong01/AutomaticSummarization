A '''church building''', often simply called a '''church''', is a building used for religious activities, particularly worship services. The term in its architectural sense is most often used by [[Christian]]s to refer to their religious buildings; they can be used by other religions.<ref>Use of the term [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362167/Manichaeism "The Manichaean Church"], ''Encyclopedia Britannica''</ref> In traditional [[Christian architecture]], the church is often arranged in the shape of a [[Christian cross]]. When viewed from [[plan view]] the longest part of a cross is represented by the aisle and the junction of the cross is located at the altar area.

Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the [[heaven]]s and inspiring church visitors. Modern church buildings have a variety of architectural styles and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use; and, similarly, many original church buildings have been put to other uses.

The earliest identified Christian church was a [[house church]] founded between 233 and 256. During the 11th through 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller parish churches occurred across Western Europe. A [[cathedral]] is a church, usually Roman Catholic, [[Anglican]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] or [[Eastern Orthodox]], housing the seat of a bishop.

In [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' means "belonging, or pertaining, to a ''Kýrios''" ("Lord"), and the usage was adopted by [[early Christians]] of the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the Lord [[Jesus Christ]]: hence "''Kyriakós oíkos''" ("house of the Lord", church), "''Kyriakē''" ("[the day] of the Lord", i.e. [[Sunday]]), or "''Kyriakē proseukhē''" (the "[Lord's prayer]").

In standard Greek usage, the older word "ecclesia" (ἐκκλησία, ''ekklesía'', literally "assembly", "congregation", or the place where such a gathering occurs) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of Christian worship (a "[[wikt:church|'''c'''hurch"]]), and the overall community of the faithful ([[wikt:Church|the "'''C'''hurch"]]).  This usage was also retained in [[Latin]] and the languages derived from Latin (e.g. French ''église'', Italian ''chiesa'', Spanish ''iglesia'', Portuguese ''igreja'', etc.), as well as in the [[Celtic languages]] (Welsh ''eglwys'', Irish ''eaglais'', Breton ''iliz'', etc.) and in Turkish (''kilise'').

In the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and some [[Slavic languages]], the word ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof.  In [[Old English]] the sequence of derivation started as "cirice" (Ki-ri-keh), then "churche" (kerke), and eventually "church" in its current pronunciation.  German ''Kirche'', Scottish ''kirk'', Russian церковь (''tserkov''), etc., are all similarly derived.

==History==

===Antiquity===
According to the New Testament, the earliest Christians did not build church buildings. Instead, they gathered in homes (Acts 17:5, 20:20, 1 Cor 16:19) or in Jewish worship places like the [[Second Temple]] or synagogues (Acts 2:46, 19:8). The earliest archeologically identified Christian church is a [[house church]], the [[Dura-Europos church]], founded between 233 and 256.<ref>{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Graydon F. |title=Ante Pacem: Archaeological Evidence of Church Life Before Constantine |publisher=Mercer University Press |year=2003 |pp=128}}</ref>

===Medieval times===
[[File:Frauenkirche München abends.jpg|thumb|The [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in [[Munich]] is a largely [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], medieval church.]]
During the 11th through 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller parish churches occurred across Western Europe.  In addition to being a place of worship, the cathedral or parish church was used by the community in other ways.  It could serve as a meeting place for [[guilds]] or a hall for [[banquet]]s. [[Mystery plays]] were sometimes performed in cathedrals, and cathedrals might also be used for [[fair]]s.  The church could be used as a place to thresh and store grain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levy |title=Cathedrals and the Church |page=12}}</ref>

During the Renaissance thousands of churches were built all throughout Europe and soon the Americas.

{{main|Church architecture}}
A common architecture for churches is the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]] (a long central rectangle, with side rectangles, and a rectangle in front for the [[altar]] space or sanctuary). These churches also often have a [[dome]] or other large [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] space in the interior to represent or draw attention to the heavens. Other common shapes for churches include a circle, to represent eternity, or an [[octagon]] or similar star shape, to represent the church's bringing light to the world. Another common feature is the [[spire]], a tall tower on the "west" end of the church or over the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]].

==Types==
[[File:Norwich Cathedral from Cloisters, Norfolk, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Norwich Cathedral]] in England is an example of a Cathedral complex built during the [[Middle Ages]].]]
===Basilica===
{{main|Basilica}}
The [[Latin]] word basilica (derived from [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[Stoa Basileios|Basiliké Stoà]]'', Royal ''[[Stoa]]'') was originally used to describe a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] public building (as in [[Greece]], mainly a [[tribunal]]), usually located in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of a Roman town.

After the [[Roman Empire]] became [[Edict of Thessalonica|officially Christian]], the term came by extension to refer to a large and important church that has been given special ceremonial rights by the [[Pope]]. Thus the word retains two senses today, one architectural and the other ecclesiastical.

===Cathedral===
{{main|Architecture of cathedrals and great churches}}

A [[cathedral]] is a church, usually Roman Catholic, [[Anglican]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] or [[Eastern Orthodox]], housing the seat of a bishop. The word cathedral takes its name from ''[[cathedra]]'', or Bishop's Throne (In {{lang-la|ecclesia cathedralis}}). The term is sometimes (improperly) used to refer to any church of great size.

A church that has the function of cathedral is not necessarily a large building. It might be as small as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]] in [[Oxford]], England, [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh, United States]], or [[Chur]] Cathedral in [[Switzerland]]. However, frequently, the cathedral along with some of the abbey churches, was the [[List of largest buildings in the world|largest building]] in any region.

===Alternative buildings===
Old and disused church buildings can be seen as an interesting proposition for developers as the architecture and location often provide for attractive homes<ref>{{cite news| url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/new_homes/article3047285.ece |work=The Times |location=London  | title=Church conversions | first=Lucy | last=Alexander | date=14 December 2007 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourproperty.co.uk/guides/buying_a_church_conversion.html |title=Buying a church conversion |publisher=OurProperty.co.uk |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> or city centre entertainment venues<ref>{{cite web|author=Site design and technology by Lightmaker.com |url=http://www.pitcherandpiano.com/locations/bar.cfm?area=Nottingham |title=quality food and drink |publisher=Pitcher and Piano |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> On the other hand, many newer Churches have decided to host meetings in public buildings such as schools,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familychurchchristchurch.org.uk |title=Welcome to the Family Church Christchurch Dorset |publisher=The Family Church Christchurch |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> universities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-hope.org.uk |title=Welcome to The Hope Church, Manchester...

There is another trend to convert old buildings for [[worship]] rather than face the construction costs and planning difficulties of a new build.  Unusual venues in the UK include an old Tram power station,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-church.co.uk |title=CITY CHURCH NEWCASTLE & GATESHEAD – enjoying God...making friends...changing lives – Welcome |publisher=City-church.co.uk |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> a former [[bus garage]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aylshamcommunitychurch.org |title=Aylsham Community Church |publisher=Aylsham Community Church |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> an old cinema and [[Bingo (UK)|bingo]] hall,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Reg|year=2004|title=Things are different now: A short history of Winchester Family Church|publisher=Winchester Family Church|location=Winchester|page=11}}</ref> a former [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] Drill Hall,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnabascommunitychurch.com/barnabascentre.htm |title=Shrewsbury Venue Shrewsbury – Barnabas Community Church Shrewsbury |publisher=Barnabascommunitychurch.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> a former synagogue<ref>{{cite web |title=the Jubilee Centre . . .

There has been an increase in partnerships between church management and private real estate companies to redevelop church properties into mixed uses. While it has garnered criticism from some, the partnership offers congregations the opportunity to increase revenue while preserving the property.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Churches Redeveloping Properties to Give Them New Life|url = http://www.wsj.com/articles/churches-redeveloping-properties-to-give-them-new-life-1443519001|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-10-23|issn = 0099-9660|first = Robyn A.|last = Friedman}}</ref>
