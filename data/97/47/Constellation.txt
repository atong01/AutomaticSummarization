In modern [[astronomy]], a '''constellation''' is a specific area of the [[celestial sphere]] as defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU). These areas had their origins in Western-traditional [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] from which the constellations take their names. There are [[88 modern constellations|88 officially recognized constellations]], covering the entire sky.<ref name=iau-const>{{cite web |title=The Constellations |url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/ |publisher=IAU—[[International Astronomical Union]] |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>

Thus, any given point in a [[celestial coordinate system]] can unambiguously be assigned to a constellation. It is usual in astronomy to give the constellation in which a given object is found along with its coordinates in order to convey a rough idea in which part of the sky it is located. 

== Terminology ==

The origin of the word constellation seems to come from the [[Late Latin]] term ''cōnstellātiō'' can be translated as "set of stars", but came into use in [[Middle English|English]] during the 14th century. A more modern astronomical sense of the term is as a recognisable pattern of stars whose appearance is identified with mythological characters or creatures, associated earthbound animals or objects.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

Colloquial usage does not draw a sharp distinction between "constellation" in the sense of an asterism (pattern of stars) and "constellation" in the sense of an area surrounding an asterism.{{cn|date=October 2015}} The modern system of constellations used in astronomy employs the latter concept. For example, the northern asterism known as the [[Big Dipper]] comprises the seven brightest stars in the IAU constellation (area) [[Ursa Major]] while the southern [[False Cross]] includes portions of the constellations [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]].

The term [[circumpolar constellation]] is used for any constellation that, from a particular latitude on Earth, never sets below the horizon. From the [[North Pole]] or [[South Pole]], all constellations north or south of the [[celestial equator]] are circumpolar constellations. In the equatorial or temperate latitudes, the informal term ''equatorial constellation'' has sometimes been used for constellations that lie to the opposite the circumpolar constellations.<ref name=steele1884 /> Depending on the definition,{{cn|date=October 2015}} equatorial constellations can include those that lie entirely between declinations 45° north and 45° south,<ref name=harbord_goodwin1897/> or those that pass overhead between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn between declinations of 23½° north and 23½° south.{{cn|date=October 2015}} They generally include all constellations that intersect the celestial equator or part of the [[zodiac]].{{cn|date=October 2015}}

Usually the only thing the stars in a constellation have in common is that they appear near each other in the sky when viewed from the Earth, but in galactic space, most constellation stars lie at a variety of distances. Since stars also travel on their own orbits through the [[Milky Way]], our familiar constellations do change slowly over time. After tens to hundreds of thousands of years, their familiar outlines will slowly become unrecognisable.<ref name="marc">{{cite web|url=http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-space/constellations.html|title=Do Constellations Ever Break Apart or Change?|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref>

== History ==

The earliest direct evidence for the constellations comes from inscribed stones and clay writing tablets dug up in Mesopotamia (within modern Iraq) dating back to 3000 BC<ref>''Origins of the ancient constellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions'', by [[J. H. Rogers]]. [[Journal of the British Astronomical Association, vol.108, no.1, p.9-28]] 1998. URL: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA..108....9R</ref> It seems that the bulk of the Mesopotamian constellations were created within a relatively short interval from around 1300 to 1000 BC These groupings appeared later in many of the classical Greek constellations.<ref name="Greek Constellations 2006">''The Origin of the Greek Constellations'', by [[Bradley E. Schaefer]]. [[Scientific American]], November 2006.</ref>

[[File:Babylonian tablet recording Halley's comet.jpg|thumb|upright| Babylonian tablet recording [[Halley's comet]] in 164 BC.]]

The Babylonians were the first to recognize that astronomical phenomena are periodic and apply mathematics to their predictions. The oldest [[Babylonian star catalogues]] of stars and constellations date back to the beginning in the [[Middle Bronze Age]], most notably the ''Three Stars Each'' texts and the ''[[MUL.APIN]]'', an expanded and revised version based on more accurate observation from around 1000 BC. However, the numerous [[Sumerian language|Sumerian names]] in these catalogues suggest that they build on older, but otherwise unattested, [[Sumer]]ian traditions of the [[Early Bronze Age]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.westnet.com.au/Gary-David-Thompson/page11-4.html |title=History of the Constellations and Star Names — D.4: Sumerian constellations and star names? |work=Gary D. Thompson |date=21 April 2015 |accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>

The classical [[Zodiac]] is a product of a revision of the Old Babylonian system in later [[Neo-Babylonian]] astronomy 6th century BC. Knowledge of the Neo-Babylonian zodiac is also reflected in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. [[E. W. Bullinger]] interpreted the creatures appearing in the books of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] (and thence in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]) as the middle signs of the four quarters of the Zodiac,<ref>E.W. Bullinger, ''The Witness of the Stars''</ref><ref>D. James Kennedy, ''The Real Meaning of the Zodiac''.</ref> with the Lion as [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], the Bull as [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], the Man representing Aquarius and the Eagle standing in for Scorpio.<ref>Richard Hinckley Allen, ''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning'', Vol. 1 (New York: Dover Publications, 1899, p. 213-215.) argued for ''Scorpio'' having previously been called ''Eagle''.</ref>
The biblical [[Book of Job]] also makes reference to a number of constellations, including {{lang|he|עיש ''`Ayish''}} "bier", {{lang|he| כסיל ''Kĕciyl''}} "fool" and {{lang|he| כימה ''Kiymah''}} "heap" (Job 9:9, 38:31-32), rendered as "Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades" by the [[KJV]], but ''`Ayish'' "the bier" actually corresponding to [[Ursa Major]].<ref>[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H5906&t=KJV Gesenius, ''Hebrew Lexicon'']</ref> The term ''[[Mazzaroth]]'' {{lang|he|מַזָּרוֹת}}, a ''[[hapax legomenon]]'' in Job 38:32, may be the Hebrew word for the zodiacal constellations.

The Greeks adopted the Babylonian system in the 4th century BC. A total of twenty Ptolemaic constellations are directly continued from the Ancient Near East. Another ten have the same stars but different names.<ref name="Greek Constellations 2006"/>

=== Chinese astronomy ===
{{further|Chinese astronomy}}
[[File:Su Song Star Map 1.JPG|thumb|[[Chinese star map]] with a cylindrical projection ([[Su Song]])]]

In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] astronomy has had a long tradition in accurately observing celestial phenomena.<ref>Needham, Volume 3, p.171</ref> Star names later categorized in the [[twenty-eight mansions]] have been found on [[oracle bones]] unearthed at [[Anyang]], dating back to the middle [[Shang Dynasty]]. These [[Chinese constellations]] are one of the most important and also the most ancient structures in the Chinese sky, attested from the 5th century BC.
Parallels to the earliest Babylonian (Sumerian) star catalogues suggest that the ancient Chinese system did not arise independently.<ref>Xiaochun Sun, Jacob Kistemaker, ''The Chinese sky during the Han'', vol. 38 of Sinica Leidensia, BRILL, 1997, ISBN 978-90-04-10737-3, p. 18, note 9.</ref>

Classical Chinese astronomy is recorded in the [[Han period]] and appears in the form of three schools, which are attributed to astronomers of the [[Zhanguo period]]. The constellations of the three schools were conflated into a single system by [[Chen Zhuo]], an astronomer of the 3rd century ([[Three Kingdoms period]]). Chen Zhuo's work has been lost, but information on his system of constellations survives in [[Tang period]] records, notably by [[Qutan Xida]]. The oldest extant Chinese star chart dates to that period and was preserved as part of the [[Dunhuang Manuscripts]]. Native Chinese astronomy flourished during the [[Song dynasty]], and during the [[Yuan Dynasty]] became increasingly influenced by [[medieval Islamic astronomy]] (see [[Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era]]).<ref>Xiaochun Sun, Jacob Kistemaker, ''The Chinese sky during the Han'', vol. 38 of Sinica Leidensia, BRILL, 1997, ISBN 978-90-04-10737-3, chapter 2, 15-36.</ref>

Traditional Chinese star maps incorporated 23 asterisms of the southern sky based on the knowledge of western star charts.<ref>{{cite book | last=Sun | first=Xiaochun | editor=Helaine Selin | editor-link=Helaine Selin | title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | date=1997 | pages=910 | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | isbn=0-7923-4066-3}}</ref> They were first introduced by [[Xu Guangqi]], by the end of the [[Ming Dynasty]], in the middle of the seventeenth century.

Some of the earliest roots of [[Indian astronomy]] can be dated to the period of [[Indus Valley Civilization]], a Bronze Age civilisation in the northwest Indian subcontinent. Afterwards the astronomy developed as a discipline of [[Vedanga]] or one of the "auxiliary disciplines" associated with the study of the [[Veda]]s,<ref name=Sarma-Ast-Ind>Sarma (2008), ''Astronomy in India''</ref> dating 1500 BC or older.The oldest known text is the [[Vedanga Jyotisha]], dated to 1400–1200 BC<ref name=Cosmic>{{cite book|last=Subbarayappa|first=B.

As with [[astronomy and astrology|other traditions]], the original application of astronomy was thus religious. Indian astronomy was influenced by Greek astronomy beginning in the 4th century BC and through the early centuries of the Common Era, for example by the [[Yavanajataka]] and the [[Romaka Siddhanta]], a Sanskrit translation of a Greek text disseminated from the 2nd century.<ref name="Naskar">Foreign Impact on Indian Life and Culture (c. 326 B.C. to C. 300 A.D.).

Indian astronomy flowered in the 5th–6th century, with [[Aryabhata]], whose ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' represented the pinnacle of astronomical knowledge at the time. Later the Indian astronomy significantly influenced medieval Islamic, Chinese and European astronomy.<ref>"Star Maps: History, Artistry, and Cartography", p. 17, by Nick Kanas, 2012</ref> Other astronomers of the classical era who further elaborated on Aryabhata's work include [[Brahmagupta]], [[Varahamihira]] and [[Lalla]]. An identifiable native Indian astronomical tradition remained active throughout the medieval period and into the 16th or 17th century, especially within the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]].

Ptolemy's catalogue is informed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], a Greek astronomer of the 4th century BC who introduced earlier [[Babylonian astronomy]] to the Hellenistic culture. There is only limited information on indigenous Greek constellations. Some evidence is found in the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of Greek poet [[Hesiod]], who mentioned the "heavenly bodies".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8540536 |title=Stars and Constellations in Homer and Hesiod |publisher=The Annual of the British School at Athens |date=1951}}</ref> Greek astronomy essentially adopted the older Babylonian system in the [[Hellenistic era]], first introduced to Greece by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] in the 4th century BC. The original work of Eudoxus is lost, but it survives as a versification by [[Aratus]], dating to the 3rd century BC. The most complete existing works dealing with the mythical origins of the constellations are by the Hellenistic writer termed [[pseudo-Eratosthenes]] and an early Roman writer styled pseudo-[[Hyginus]]. The basis of western astronomy as taught during [[Late Antiquity]] and until the [[Early Modern period]] is the ''[[Almagest]]'' by [[Ptolemy]], written in the 2nd century.

Particularly during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (8th–15th centuries) the [[Islamic world]] experienced development in astronomy. These developments were mostly written in Arabic and took place from North Africa to Central Asia, [[Al-Andalus]], and later in the [[Far East]] and India. It closely parallels the genesis of other [[Islamic science]]s in its assimilation of foreign material and the amalgamation of the disparate elements of that material to create a science with [[Islam]]ic characteristics.

The skies around the [[Celestial pole|celestial South Pole]] are not observable from north of the equator and were never catalogued by the ancient Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese and Arabs. The modern constellations in this region were first defined during the [[age of exploration]] by [[Petrus Plancius]], who used the records from observations of twelve new constellations made by the Dutch navigators [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] at the end of the sixteenth century. They were later depicted by Johann Bayer in his [[star atlas]] ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title = Bayer's southern star chart| author = Ian Ridpath}}</ref> Several more were created by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in his star catalogue, published in 1756.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm | title = Lacaille's southern planisphere| author = Ian Ridpath}}</ref>

Some modern proposals for new constellations were not successful; an example is [[Quadrans Muralis|Quadrans]], eponymous of the [[Quadrantid]] meteors, now divided between [[Boötes]] and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] in the northern sky. The classical constellation of [[Argo Navis]] was broken up into several different constellations, for the convenience of stellar cartographers.

The current list of 88 constellations recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]] since 1922 is based on the 48 listed by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' in the 2nd century, with early modern modifications and additions (most importantly introducing constellations covering the parts of the southern sky unknown to Ptolemy) by [[Petrus Plancius]] (1592, 1597/98 and 1613), [[Johannes Hevelius]] (1690) and [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] (1763).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/constellations/| title = The Constellations| author = International Astronomical Union}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm |title=Constellation names, abbreviations and sizes |author=Ian Ridpath |accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/almagest.htm |title=Star Tales – The Almagest |author=Ian Ridpath |accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>

== IAU constellations ==
{{constellations_ecliptic_equirectangular_plot.svg}}
{{Main|88 modern constellations}}

In 1922, [[Henry Norris Russell]] aided the IAU (International Astronomical Union) in dividing the celestial sphere into 88 official constellations.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/iaulist1.htm| title = The original names and abbreviations for constellations from 1922. | accessdate = 2010-01-31}}</ref> Where possible, these modern constellations usually share the names of their Graeco-Roman predecessors, such as [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] or [[Scorpius]].
The aim of this system is area-mapping, i.e. the division of the celestial sphere into contiguous fields.<ref name=iau-const /> Out of the 88 modern constellations, 36 lie predominantly in the northern sky, and the other 52 predominantly in the southern.

In 1930, the boundaries between the 88 constellations were devised by [[Eugène Delporte]] along vertical and horizontal lines of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/boundaries.htm| title = Constellation boundaries. | accessdate = 2011-05-24}}</ref> However, the data he used originated back to [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] [[B1875.0]], which was when [[Benjamin A. Gould]] first made his proposal to designate boundaries for the celestial sphere, a suggestion upon which Delporte would base his work. The consequence of this early date is that due to the [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] of the [[equinox]]es, the borders on a modern star map, such as epoch [[J2000]], are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal.<ref>A.C. Davenhall & S.K. Leggett, [http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/VI/49/constell.pdf "A Catalogue of Constellation Boundary Data"], (Centre de Donneés astronomiques de Strasbourg, February 1990).</ref> This effect will increase over the years and centuries to come.

== Asterisms ==
{{main|Asterism (astronomy)}}
[[File:Plough big dipper.svg|thumb|The [[Big Dipper]] asterism]]

An asterism is a pattern of stars recognized in the Earth's night sky and may be part of an official constellation. It may also be composed of stars from more than one constellation. The stars of the main asterism within a constellation are usually given Greek letters in their order of brightness, the so-called [[Bayer designation]] introduced by [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603. A total of 1,564 stars are so identified, out of approximately 10,000 stars visible to the [[naked eye]].<ref>The [[Bright Star Catalogue]] lists 9,110 objects of the night sky which are visible to the naked eye ([[apparent magnitude]] of 6.5 or brighter). 9,096 of these are stars, all of them well within [[Milky Way|our galaxy]].</ref>

The brightest stars, usually the stars that make up the constellation's eponymous asterism, also retain proper names, often from Arabic.For example, the "Little Dipper" asterism of the constellation [[Ursa Minor]] has ten stars with Bayer designation, [[α UMi]] to [[π UMi]]. Of these ten stars, six have a proper name, viz. [[Polaris]] (α UMi), [[Kochab]] (β UMi), [[Pherkad]] (γ UMi), [[Yildun]] (δ UMi), [[Ahfa al Farkadain]] (ζ UMi) and [[Anwar al Farkadain]] (η UMi).

The stars within an asterism rarely have any substantial astrophysical relationship to each other, and their apparent proximity when viewed from Earth disguises the fact that they are far apart, some being much farther from Earth than others. However, there are some exceptions: almost all of the stars<ref>https://books.google.pl/books?id=z3JIQG3qP0kC&pg=PA212&lpg=PA212&dq=%22The+stars+within+a+constellation%22++proximity</ref> in the constellation of [[Ursa Major]] (including most of the [[Big Dipper]]) are genuinely close to one another, travel through the galaxy with similar [[proper motion|velocities]], and are likely to have formed together as part of a [[star cluster|cluster]] that is slowly dispersing. These stars form the [[Ursa Major moving group]].

== Ecliptic coordinate systems ==
{{main|Zodiac|Lunar mansion}}

The idea of dividing the celestial sphere into ''constellations'', understood as areas surrounding asterisms, is early modern.{{cn|date=October 2015}} 
The currently-used boundaries between constellations were defined in 1930. The concept is ultimately derived from the ancient tradition of dividing the ecliptic into twelve equal parts named for nearby asterisms (the [[Zodiac]]).{{cn|date=October 2015}} This defined an [[ecliptic coordinate system]] which was used throughout the medieval period and into the 18th century.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

Systems of dividing the ecliptic (as opposed to dividing the celestial sphere into constellations in the modern sense) are also found in Chinese and Hindu astronomy. In classical [[Chinese astronomy]], the northern sky is divided geometrically, into five "enclosures" and [[twenty-eight mansions]] along the ecliptic, grouped into [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]] of seven asterisms each. Ecliptic longitude is measured using 24 [[Solar term]]s, each of 15° longitude, and are used by [[Chinese calendar|Chinese lunisolar calendars]] to stay synchronized with the seasons, which is crucial for agrarian societies. In [[Hindu astronomy]], the term for "lunar mansion" is [[nakshatra|''{{IAST|nákṣatra}}'']]<ref>In [[Vedic Sanskrit]], the term ''{{IAST|nákṣatra}}'' may refer to any heavenly body, or to "the stars" collectively.{{cn|date=October 2015}} The classical sense of "lunar mansion" is first found in the [[Atharvaveda]],{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} and becomes the primary meaning of the term in [[Classical Sanskrit]].The [[Sanskrit verb|verbal root]] ''{{IAST|nákṣ}}'' means "to approach, come near".</ref> A ''{{IAST|nákṣatra}}'' is one of 27 (sometimes also 28) sectors along the ecliptic. Comparable to the zodiacal system, their names are related to the most prominent asterisms in the respective sectors. The first [[Indian astronomy|astronomical]] text that lists them is the ''[[Vedanga Jyotisha]]''.

== Dark cloud constellations ==
{{further|Great Rift (astronomy)}}

The Great Rift, a series of dark patches in the [[Milky Way]], is more visible and striking in the [[southern hemisphere]] than in the northern. It vividly stands out when conditions are otherwise so dark that the Milky Way's central region casts shadows on the ground.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Some cultures have discerned shapes in these patches and have given names to these "dark cloud constellations." Members of the [[Inca]] civilization identified various dark areas or [[dark nebula]]e in the [[Milky Way]] as animals, and associated their appearance with the seasonal rains.<ref>[http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/andes/inca.nightsky.html The Incan View of the Night Sky]</ref> [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy]] also describes dark cloud constellations, the most famous being the "emu in the sky" whose head is formed by the [[Coalsack]].
