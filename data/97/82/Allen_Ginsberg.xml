This was a source of strain in their relationship.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Miles"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Also, in New York, Ginsberg met<space/><link><target>Gregory Corso</target></link><space/>in the Pony Stable Bar. Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting. Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison. Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso's poems, realizing Corso was &quot;spiritually gifted.&quot; Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window. Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg's girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment. There the woman proposed sex with Corso, who was still very young and fled in fear. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together. Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Miles"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Shortly after this period in Ginsberg's life, he became romantically involved with<space/><link><target>Elise Cowen</target><part>Elise Nada Cowen</part></link><space/>after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at<space/><link><target>Barnard College</target></link><space/>whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generation's period of development. As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of<space/><link><target>Ezra Pound</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>T.S. Eliot</target></link>, when she met<space/><link><target>Joyce Johnson</target></link><space/>and Leo Skir, among other Beat players. As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona. While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname &quot;Beat Alice&quot; as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books, including &quot;Minor Characters&quot; and<space/><italics>Come and Join the Dance</italics>, which expressed the two women's experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community. Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend, Carl Solomon, to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem &quot;Howl&quot;. This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time.</paragraph><heading level='3'>The Blake vision</heading><paragraph>In 1948 in an apartment in<space/><link><target>Harlem</target></link>, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of<space/><link><target>William Blake</target></link><space/>(later referred to as his &quot;Blake vision&quot;).

The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe.

Of more personal significance to Ginsberg, the reading that night included the first public presentation of &quot;Howl&quot;, a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him. An account of that night can be found in<space/><link><target>Kerouac</target></link>'s novel<space/><italics><link><target>The Dharma Bums</target></link></italics>, describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched.</paragraph><paragraph>Ginsberg's principal work, &quot;Howl&quot;, is well known for its opening line: &quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked....&quot; &quot;Howl&quot; was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language.

Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of &quot;Howl&quot; were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though &quot;Kaddish&quot; deals more explicitly with his mother, &quot;Howl&quot; in many ways is driven by the same emotions. &quot;Howl&quot; chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsbergs life. He begins the poem with I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Raskin"></extension><space/>This madness was the angry fix that society needed to functionmadness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on Carl Solomon! Im with you in Rockland, and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his straightjacket. Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, &quot;Howl&quot;, his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start.</paragraph><heading level='3'>To Paris and the &quot;Beat Hotel&quot;, Tangier and India.</heading><paragraph>In 1957, Ginsberg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco.

Photo taken in 1978</part></link>Though the term &quot;Beat&quot; is most accurately applied to Ginsberg and his closest friends (Corso, Orlovsky, Kerouac, Burroughs, etc.), the term &quot;Beat Generation&quot; has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name &quot;Beat Generation.&quot; Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader. Ginsberg never claimed to be the leader of a movement. He claimed that many of the writers with whom he had become friends in this period shared many of the same intentions and themes.

Later in life, Ginsberg entered academia, teaching poetry as Distinguished Professor of English at<space/><link><target>Brooklyn College</target></link><space/>from 1986 until his death.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Inspiration from friends</heading><paragraph>Since Ginsberg's poetry is intensely personal, and since much of the vitality of those associated with the<space/><link><target>beat generation</target></link><space/>comes from mutual inspiration, much credit for style, inspiration, and content can be given to Ginsberg's friends.</paragraph><paragraph>Ginsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouac's concept of &quot;spontaneous prose&quot;. He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions. Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac. For example, when Kerouac saw the first draft of &quot;Howl&quot; he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil (transposing &quot;negro&quot; and &quot;angry&quot; in the first line, for example). Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsberg's insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Miles"></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Carl Solomon, Patti Smith, Allen Ginsberg and William S.

Many of the characters Ginsberg references in &quot;Howl&quot;, such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle. The personal aspects of &quot;Howl&quot; are perhaps as important as the political aspects. Carl Solomon, the prime example of a &quot;best mind&quot; destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg's schizophrenic mother: the line &quot;with mother finally ****** (fucked)&quot; comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says: &quot;I'm with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother.&quot; Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write &quot;Howl&quot; was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly.

After attending a reading by Williams, Ginsberg sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter.

He included the letter in a later part of<space/><italics>Paterson</italics>. He encouraged Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters, but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American. From Williams, Ginsberg learned to focus on strong visual images, in line with Williams' own motto &quot;No ideas but in things.&quot; Studying Williams' style led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose, colloquial free verse style. Early breakthrough poems include<space/><italics>Bricklayer's Lunch Hour</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Dream Record</italics>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Miles"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Spontaneous"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Carl Solomon introduced Ginsberg to the work of Antonin Artaud (<italics>To Have Done with the Judgement of God</italics><space/>and<space/><italics>Van Gogh: The Man Suicided by Society</italics>), and Jean Genet (<italics>Our Lady of the Flowers</italics>).<space/><link><target>Philip Lamantia</target></link><space/>introduced him to other<space/><link><target>Surrealists</target></link><space/>and Surrealism continued to be an influence (for example, sections of &quot;Kaddish&quot; were inspired by<space/><link><target>Andr Breton</target></link>'s<space/><italics>Free Union</italics>). Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of &quot;Howl&quot; and other poems was inspired by Christopher Smart in such poems as<space/><italics>Jubilate Agno</italics>. Ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences, such as:<space/><link><target>Franz Kafka</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Herman Melville</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Fyodor Dostoevsky</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Edgar Allan Poe</target></link>, and even<space/><link><target>Emily Dickinson</target></link>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Miles"></extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="Deliberate"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Ginsberg also made an intense study of<space/><link><target>haiku</target></link><space/>and the paintings of<space/><link><target>Paul Czanne</target></link>, from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the<space/><italics>Eyeball Kick</italics>.

Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy. The example Ginsberg most often used was &quot;hydrogen jukebox&quot; (which later became the title of a<space/><link><target>song cycle</target></link><space/>composed by<space/><link><target>Philip Glass</target></link><space/>with lyrics drawn from Ginsberg's poems).
