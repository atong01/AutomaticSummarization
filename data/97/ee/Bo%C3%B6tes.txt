'''Boötes''' {{IPAc-en|b|oʊ|ˈ|oʊ|t|iː|z}} is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky, located between 0° and +60° [[declination]], and 13 and 16 hours of [[right ascension]] on the [[celestial sphere]]. The name comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Βοώτης, ''Boōtēs'', meaning [[herder|herdsman]] or [[plowman]] (literally, ox-driver; from βοῦς ''bous'' “cow”). The "ö" in the name is a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], not an [[Umlaut (linguistics)|umlaut]], meaning that each 'o' is to be pronounced separately.

One of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], Boötes is now one of the 88 modern constellations. It contains the [[List of brightest stars|fourth brightest star]] in the night sky, the orange-hued [[Arcturus]]. Boötes is home to many other bright stars, including eight above the fourth magnitude and an additional 21 above the fifth magnitude, making a total of 29 stars easily visible to the naked eye.

== History and mythology ==

In ancient Babylon the stars of Boötes were known as SHU.PA. They were apparently depicted as the god [[Enlil]], who was the leader of the Babylonian pantheon and special patron of farmers.{{sfn|White|2008|p=207}}

The name ''Boötes'' was first used by [[Homer]] in his [[Odyssey]] as a celestial reference point for [[History of navigation#Antiquity|navigation]],<ref>Homer, Odyssey, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+5.270&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 book 5, 272]</ref> described as "late-setting" or "slow to set", translated as the "Plowman".{{sfn|Mandelbaum|1990|p=103}} Exactly whom Boötes is supposed to represent in [[Greek mythology]] is not clear. According to one version, he was a son of [[Demeter]],<ref>Levy 1996 pp=141</ref> [[Philomenus]], twin brother of [[Plutus]], a ploughman who drove the oxen in the constellation [[Ursa Major]].{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} This is corroborated by the constellation's name, which itself means "ox-driver" or "herdsman."<ref>Levy 1996 pp=141</ref> The ancient Greeks saw the [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] now called the "[[Big Dipper]]" or "Plough" as a cart with oxen.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=102}} This influenced the name's etymology, derived from the Greek for "noisy" or "ox-driver".{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} Another myth associated with Boötes tells that he invented the [[plow]] and was memorialized for his ingenuity as a constellation.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|p=133}}

Another myth associated with Boötes by [[Hyginus]] is that of [[Icarius]], who was schooled as a grape farmer and winemaker by [[Dionysus]]. Icarius made wine so strong that those who drank it appeared poisoned, which caused shepherds to avenge their supposedly poisoned friends by killing Icarius. [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], Icarius's dog, brought his daughter [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]] to her father's body, whereupon both she and the dog committed suicide. Zeus then chose to honor all three by placing them in the sky as constellations: Icarius as Boötes, Erigone as [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], and Maera as [[Canis Major]] or [[Canis Minor]].{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

Following another reading, the constellation is identified with [[Arcas]] and also referred to as Arcas and Arcturus, son of [[Zeus]] and [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]. Arcas was brought up by his maternal grandfather [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]], to whom one day Zeus went and had a meal. To verify that the guest was really the king of the gods, Lycaon killed his grandson and prepared a meal made from his flesh. Zeus noticed and became very angry, transforming Lycaon into a wolf and gave back life to his son. In the meantime Callisto had been transformed into a she-bear, by Zeus's wife, [[Hera]], who was angry at Zeus's infidelity.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}}{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} This is corroborated by the Greek name for Boötes, ''Arctophylax'', which means "Bear Watcher".{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} Callisto in form of a bear was almost killed by her son who was out hunting. Zeus rescued her, taking her into the sky where she became Ursa Major, "the Great Bear". The name Arcturus (the constellation's brightest star) comes from the Greek word meaning "guardian of the bear".  Sometimes [[Arcturus]] is depicted as leading the hunting dogs of nearby [[Canes Venatici]] and driving the bears of Ursa Major and [[Ursa Minor]].<ref>Levy 1996 pp=141</ref>

[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Bootes, Canes Venatici, Coma Berenices, and Quadrans Muralis.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Boötes as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. In his left hand he holds his hunting dogs, Canes Venatici. Below them is the constellation Coma Berenices. Above the head of Boötes is [[Quadrans Muralis]], now obsolete, but which lives on as the name of the early January [[Quadrantid]] meteor shower. [[Mons Mænalus]] can be seen at his feet.]]

Several [[former constellations]] were formed from stars now included in Boötes. [[Quadrans Muralis]], the Quadrant, was a constellation created near Beta Boötis from faint stars.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} It was invented in 1795 by [[Jérôme Lalande]], an astronomer who used a [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] to perform detailed [[astrometry|astronometric measurements]]. Lalande worked with [[Nicole-Reine Lepaute]] and others to predict the 1758 return of [[Halley's Comet]]. Quadrans Muralis was formed from the stars of eastern Boötes, western [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=51}} It was originally called ''Le Mural'' by [[Jean Fortin]] in his 1795 [[Atlas Céleste]]; it was not given the name ''Quadrans Muralis'' until [[Johann Bode]]'s 1801 ''Uranographia''. The constellation was quite faint, with its brightest stars reaching the 5th magnitude.{{sfn|Star Tales Quadrans Muralis}} [[Mons Maenalus]], representing the [[Maenalus]] mountains, was created by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687 at the foot of the constellation's figure. The mountain was named for the son of Lycaon, [[Maenalus]]. The mountain, one of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'s hunting grounds, was also holy to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].{{sfn|Star Tales Mons Maenalus}}

=== Non-Western astronomy ===
The stars of Boötes were incorporated into many different [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese constellations]]. Arcturus was part of the most prominent of these, variously designated as the celestial king's throne (''Tian Wang'') or the Blue Dragon's horn (''Daijiao''); the name ''Daijiao'', meaning "great horn", is more common. Arcturus was given such importance in Chinese celestial mythology because of its status marking the beginning of the lunar calendar, as well as its status as the brightest star in the northern night sky. Two constellations flanked ''Daijiao'', ''Yousheti'' to the right and ''Zuosheti'' to the left; they represented companions that orchestrated the seasons. ''Zuosheti'' was formed from modern [[Zeta Bootis|Zeta]], [[Omicron Bootis|Omicron]], and [[Pi Boötis]], while ''Yousheti'' was formed from modern [[Eta Bootis|Eta]], [[Tau Bootis|Tau]], and [[Upsilon Boötis]]. ''Dixi'', the Emperor's ceremonial banquet mat, was north of Arcturus, consisting of the stars [[12 Bootis|12]], [[11 Bootis|11]], and [[9 Boötis]].  Another northern constellation was ''Qigong'', the Seven Dukes, which was mostly across the Boötes-Hercules border. It included either [[Delta Boötis]] or [[Beta Boötis]] as its terminus.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

The other Chinese constellations made up of the stars of Boötes existed in the modern constellation's north; they are all representations of weapons. ''Tianqiang'', the spear, was formed from [[Iota Bootis|Iota]], [[Kappa Bootis|Kappa]], and [[Theta Boötis]]; ''Genghe'', variously representing a lance or shield, was formed from [[Epsilon Bootis|Epsilon]], [[Rho Bootis|Rho]], and [[Sigma Boötis]]. There were also two weapons made up of a singular star. ''Xuange'', the [[halberd]], was represented by [[Lambda Boötis]], and ''Zhaoyao'', either the sword or the spear, was represented by [[Gamma Boötis]].{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

Two Chinese constellations have an uncertain placement in Boötes. ''Kangchi'', the lake, was placed south of Arcturus, though its specific location is disputed. It may have been placed entirely in Boötes, on either side of the Boötes-Virgo border, or on either side of the Virgo-Libra border. The constellation ''Zhouding'', a bronze tripod-mounted container used for food, was sometimes cited as the stars [[1 Bootis|1]], [[2 Bootis|2]], and [[6 Boötis]]. However, it has also been associated with three stars in Coma Berenices.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

== Characteristics ==

Boötes is a constellation bordered by Virgo to the south, [[Coma Berenices]] and Canes Venatici to the west, Ursa Major to the northwest, Draco to the northeast, and [[Hercules]], [[Corona Borealis]] and [[Serpens Caput]] to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Boo'.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 16 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|13|36.1}} and {{RA|15|49.3}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates stretch from +7.36° to +55.1°.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Boötes}} Covering 907 square degrees, Boötes [[culmination|culminates]] at midnight around 2 May and ranks 13th in area.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=150}}

Colloquially, its pattern of stars has been likened to a kite or ice cream cone.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=150}}{{sfn|Polakis|2009}} However, depictions of Boötes have varied historically. [[Aratus]] described him circling the north pole, herding the two bears. Later ancient Greek depictions, described by Ptolemy, have him holding the reins of his hunting dogs (Canes Venatici) in his left hand, with a spear, club, or staff in his right hand.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} After Hevelius introduced Mons Maenalus in 1681, Boötes was often depicted standing on the [[Peloponnese]] mountain.{{sfn|Star Tales Mons Maenalus}} By 1801, when Johann Bode published his ''Uranographia'', Boötes had acquired a sickle, which was also held in his left hand.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

The placement of Arcturus has also been mutable through the centuries. Traditionally, Arcturus lay between his thighs, as Ptolemy depicted him. However, [[Germanicus Caesar]] deviated from this tradition by placing Arcturus "where his garment is fastened by a knot".{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

=== Stars ===

{{see also|List of stars in Boötes}}
In his ''[[Uranometria]]'', [[Johann Bayer]] used the Greek letters Alpha through to Omega and then A to k to label what he saw as the most prominent 35 stars in the constellation, with subsequent astronomers splitting Kappa, Mu, Nu and Pi as two stars each. Nu is also the same star as Psi Herculis.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=55–57}} [[John Flamsteed]] numbered 54 stars for the constellation.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=355–56}}

Located 36.7 [[light-year]]s from Earth, [[Arcturus]], or Alpha Boötis, is the brightest star in Boötes and the fourth brightest star in the sky at an [[apparent magnitude]] of −0.05;{{sfn|SIMBAD Alpha Boötis}} It is also the brightest star north of the [[celestial equator]], just shading out [[Vega]] and [[Capella]].{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132–133}} Its name comes from the Greek for "bear-keeper". An [[orange giant]] of [[spectral class]] K1.5III,{{sfn|SIMBAD Alpha Boötis}} Arcturus is an ageing star that has exhausted its core supply of hydrogen and cooled and expanded to a diameter of 27 [[solar diameter]]s,{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} equivalent to approximately 32 million kilometers.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} Though its mass is approximately one [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}),{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} Arcturus shines with 133 times the luminosity of [[solar luminosity|the Sun]] ({{Solar luminosity|link=y}}).{{sfn|Kaler Arcturus}} Bayer located Arcturus above the herdsman's left knee in his ''Uranometria''. Nearby [[Eta Boötis]], or Muphrid, is the uppermost star denoting the left leg.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=503}} It is a 2.68-magnitude star 37 light-years distant with a spectral class of G0IV,{{sfn|SIMBAD Eta Boötis}} indicating it has just exhausted its core hydrogen and is beginning to expand and cool. It is 9 times as luminous as the Sun and has 2.7 times its diameter. Analysis of its spectrum reveals that it is a [[spectroscopic binary]].{{sfn|Kaler Muphrid}} Muphrid and Arcturus lie only 3.3 light years away from each other. Viewed from Arcturus, Muphrid would have a visual magnitude of -2½, while Arcturus would be around visual magnitude -4½ when seen from Muphrid.{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|p=136}}

Marking the herdsman's head is Beta Boötis,{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=503}} or Nekkar, a [[yellow giant]] of magnitude 3.5 and spectral type G8IIIa.{{sfn|SIMBAD Beta Boötis}} Like Arcturus, it has expanded and cooled off the [[main sequence]]—likely to have lived most of its stellar life as a blue-white [[B-type main sequence star]].{{sfn|Kaler Nekkar}} Its common name comes from the Arabic phrase for "ox-driver". It is 219 light-years away{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} and has a luminosity of {{Solar luminosity|58|link=y}}.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} Located 86 light-years distant, [[Gamma Boötis]], or Seginus, is a white giant star of spectral class A7III,{{sfn|SIMBAD Gamma Boötis}} with a luminosity 34 times and diameter 3.5 times that of the Sun.{{sfn|Kaler Seginus}} It is a [[Delta Scuti variable]], ranging between magnitudes 3.02 and 3.07 every 7 hours.{{sfn|AAVSO Gamma Boötis}} Thes stars are short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candles]] and as subjects to study [[astroseismology]].{{sfn|AAVSO Delta Scuti Variables}} [[Delta Boötis]] is a wide double star with a primary of magnitude 3.5 and a secondary of magnitude 7.8. The primary is a yellow giant that has cooled and expanded to 10.4 times the diameter of the Sun.{{sfn|Kaler Delta Boötis}} Of spectral class G8IV, it is around 121 light-years away,{{sfn|SIMBAD Delta Boötis}} while the secondary is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V.{{sfn|SIMBAD BD+33 2562}} The two are thought to take 120,000 years to orbit each other.{{sfn|Kaler Delta Boötis}} [[Mu Boötis]], known as [[Alkalurops]], is a triple star popular with amateur astronomers. It has an overall magnitude of 4.3 and is 121 light-years away. Its name is from the Arabic phrase for "club" or "staff". The primary appears to be of magnitude 4.3 and is blue-white. The secondary appears to be of magnitude 6.5, but is actually a close double star itself with a primary of magnitude 7.0 and a secondary of magnitude 7.6. The secondary and tertiary stars have an orbital period of 260 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} The primary has an absolute magnitude of 2.6 and is of spectral class F0.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} The secondary and tertiary stars are separated by 2 arcseconds; the primary and secondary are separated by 109.1 arcseconds at an angle of 171 degrees.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=106}} [[Nu Boötis]] is an optical double star. The primary is an orange giant of magnitude 5.0 and the secondary is a white star of magnitude 5.0. The primary is 870 light-years away and the secondary is 430 light-years.

[[Epsilon Boötis]], also known as ''Izar'' or ''Pulcherrima'', is a close triple star popular with amateur astronomers and the most prominent binary star in Boötes. The primary is a yellow-{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} or orange-hued magnitude 2.5 giant star, the secondary is a magnitude 4.6 blue-hued [[main-sequence star]],{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} and the tertiary is a magnitude 12.0 star.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} The system is 210 light-years away. The name "Izar" comes from the Arabic word for "girdle" or "loincloth", referring to its location in the constellation. The name "Pulcherrima" comes from the Latin phrase for "most beautiful", referring to its contrasting colors in a telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} The primary and secondary stars are separated by 2.9 [[arcsecond]]s at an angle of 341 degrees; the primary's spectral class is K0 and it has a luminosity of {{Solar luminosity|200|link=y}}.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} To the naked eye, Izar has a magnitude of 2.37.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} Nearby [[Rho Boötis|Rho]] and [[Sigma Boötis]] denote the herdsman's waist.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=503}} Rho is an orange giant of spectral type K3III located around 160 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|SIMBAD Rho Boötis}} It is ever so slightly variable, wavering by 0.003 of a magnitude from its average of 3.57.{{sfn|AAVSO Rho Boötis}} Sigma, a [[F-type main sequence star|yellow-white main sequence star]] of spectral type F3V, is suspected of varying in brightness from 4.45 to 4.49.{{sfn|AAVSO Rho Boötis}} It is around 52 light-years distant.{{sfn|SIMBAD Sigma Boötis}}

Traditionally known as ''Al Aulād al Dhiʼbah'' ('''ألعولد ألذعب''' - ''al aulād al dhiʼb''), "the Whelps of the Hyenas", [[Theta Boötis|Theta]], [[Iota Boötis|Iota]], [[Kappa Boötis|Kappa]] and [[Lambda Boötis]] are a small group of stars in the far north of the constellation. The magnitude 4.05 [[Theta Boötis]] has a spectral type of F7 and an absolute magnitude of 3.8. [[Iota Boötis]] is a triple star with a primary of magnitude 4.8 and spectral class of A7,{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} a secondary of magnitude 7.5,{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} and a tertiary of magnitude 12.6.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} The primary is 97 light-years away.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} The primary and secondary stars are separated by 38.5 arcseconds, at an angle of 33 degrees.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} The primary and tertiary stars are separated by 86.7 arcseconds at an angle of 194 degrees. Both the primary and tertiary appear white in a telescope, but the secondary appears yellow-hued.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} [[Kappa Boötis]] is another wide double star.

The distinction between the Lambda Boötis stars as a class of stars with peculiar spectra, and the delta Scuti stars whose class describes pulsation in low-overtone pressure modes, is an important one. While many Lambda Boötis stars pulsate and are delta Scuti stars, not many delta Scuti stars have Lambda Boötis peculiarities, since the Lambda Boötis stars are a much rarer class whose members can be found both inside and outside the delta Scuti instability strip. Lambda Boötis stars are [[dwarf star]]s that can be either spectral class A or F.{{sfn|North|2004|p=145}} Like BL Boötis-type stars they are metal-poor.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=62}} Scientists have had difficulty explaining the characteristics of Lambda Boötis stars, partly because only around 60 confirmed members exist, but also due to heterogeneity in the literature. Lambda has an absolute magnitude of 1.8.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

There are two dimmer F-type stars, magnitude 4.83 [[12 Boötis]], class F8; and magnitude 4.93 [[45 Boötis]], class F5.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} [[Xi Boötis]] is a G8 yellow dwarf of magnitude 4.55, and absolute magnitude is 5.5.

Of apparent magnitude 4.06, [[Upsilon Boötis]] has a spectral class of K5 and an absolute magnitude of −0.3. Dimmer than Upsilon Boötis is magnitude 4.54 [[Phi Boötis]], with a spectral class of K2 and an absolute magnitude of −0.1. Just slightly dimmer than Phi at magnitude 4.60 is [[O Boötis]], which, like Izar, has a spectral class of K0. O Boötis has an absolute magnitude of 0.2. The other four dim stars are magnitude 4.91 [[6 Boötis]], class K4; magnitude 4.86 [[20 Boötis]], class K3; magnitude 4.81 [[Omega Boötis]], class K4; and magnitude 4.83 [[A Boötis]], class K1.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

There is one bright B-class star in Boötes; magnitude 4.93 [[Pi1 Boötis|Pi<sup>1</sup> Boötis]], also called Alazal. It has a spectral class of B9 and is 40 parsecs from Earth. There is also one M-type star, magnitude 4.81 [[34 Boötis]]. It is of class gM0.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

Two of the brighter Mira-type variable stars in the constellation are [[R Boötis|R]] and [[S Boötis]]. Both are red giants that range greatly in magnitude—from 6.2 to 13.1 over 223.4 days,{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|pp=199–200}}{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} and 7.8 to 13.8 over a period of 270.7 days respectively.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} Also red giants, [[V Boötis|V]] and [[W Boötis]] are [[semi-regular variable star]]s that range in magnitude from 7.0 to 12.0 over a period of 258 days, and magnitude 4.7 to 5.4 over 450 days respectively.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

[[BL Boötis]] is the prototype of its class of pulsating variable stars,{{sfn|North|2004|p=123}} the [[anomalous Cepheids]]. These stars are somewhat similar to [[Cepheid variable]]s, but they do not have the same relationship between their period and luminosity.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=61}} Their periods are similar to [[RRAB variable]]s; however, they are far brighter than these stars.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=69}} BL Boötis is a member of the cluster [[NGC 5466]]. Anomalous Cepheids are [[metallicity|metal poor]] and have masses not much larger than the Sun's, on average, {{Solar mass|1.5|link=y}}. BL Boötis type stars are a subtype of [[RR Lyrae]] variables.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=70}}

[[T Boötis]] was a [[nova]] observed in April 1860 at a magnitude of 9.7. It has never been observed since, but that does not preclude the possibility of it being a highly irregular [[variable star]] or a [[recurrent nova]].{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132–133}}

==== Stars with planetary systems ====

[[File:Tau Bootis Ab.jpg|thumb|left|A digital rendering of Tau Boötis b]]

[[Extrasolar planet]]s have been discovered encircling ten stars in Boötes as of 2012. [[Tau Boötis]] is orbited by a large planet, discovered in 1999. The host star itself is a magnitude 4.5 star of type F7V, 15.6 [[parsec]]s from Earth. It has a mass of {{Solar mass|1.3|link=y}} and a radius of 1.331 [[solar radius|solar radii]] ({{Solar radius|link=y}}); a companion, [[GJ527B]], orbits at a distance of 240 AU. [[Tau Boötis b]], the sole planet discovered in the system, orbits at a distance of 0.046 AU every 3.31 days. Discovered through [[radial velocity]] measurements, it has a mass of 5.95 [[Jupiter mass]]es ({{Jupiter mass|link=y}}).{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia Tau Boo b}} This makes it a [[hot Jupiter]].{{sfn|Rodler|Lopez-Morales|Ribas|2012}} The host star and planet are [[tidal lock|tidally locked]], meaning that the planet's orbit and the star's particularly high rotation are synchronized.{{sfn|Cameron et al. 2000}}{{sfn|Walker et al.|2008}} Furthermore, a slight variability in the host star's light may be caused by magnetic interactions with the planet.{{sfn|Walker et al.|2008}} [[Carbon monoxide]] is present in the planet's atmosphere. Tau Boötis b does not [[astronomical transit|transit]] its star, rather, its orbit is inclined 46 degrees.{{sfn|Rodler|Lopez-Morales|Ribas|2012}} Like Tau Boötis b, [[HAT-P-4 b]] is also a hot Jupiter. It is noted for orbiting a particularly [[metallicity|metal-rich]] host star and being of low density.{{sfn|Kovács et al.|2007}} Discovered in 2007, HAT-P-4 b has a mass of {{Jupiter mass|0.68}} and a radius of {{Jupiter radius|1.27}}. It orbits every 3.05 days at a distance of 0.04 AU. [[HAT-P-4]], the host star, is an F-type star of magnitude 11.2, 310 parsecs from Earth. It is larger than the Sun, with a mass of {{Solar mass|1.26}} and a radius of {{Solar radius|1.59}}.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HAT-P-4 b}}

[[File:Hd128311.png|thumb|right|Evolution of the HD 128311 system over time]]

Boötes is also home to multiple-planet systems. [[HD 128311]] is the host star for a two-planet system, consisting of [[HD 128311 b]] and [[HD 128311 c]], discovered in 2002 and 2005, respectively.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 b}}{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 c}} HD 128311 b is the smaller planet, with a mass of {{Jupiter mass|2.18}}; it was discovered through [[radial velocity]] observations. It orbits at almost the same distance as Earth, at 1.099 AU; however, its orbital period is significantly longer at 448.6 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 b}} The larger of the two, HD 128311 c, has a mass of {{Jupiter mass|3.21}} and was discovered in the same manner. It orbits every 919 days inclined at 50°, and is 1.76 AU from the host star.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 c}} The host star, HD 128311, is a K0V-type star located 16.6 parsecs from Earth. It is smaller than the Sun, with a mass of {{Solar mass|0.84}} and a radius of {{Solar radius|0.73}}; it also appears below the threshold of naked-eye visibility at an apparent magnitude of 7.51.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 b}}

There are several single-planet systems in Boötes. [[HD 132406]] is a Sun-like star of spectral type G0V with an apparent magnitude of 8.45, 231.5 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Da Silva Udry et al.|2007}} It has a mass of {{Solar mass|1.09}} and a radius of {{Solar radius|1}}.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 132406}} The star is orbited by a gas giant, [[HD 132406 b]], discovered in 2007.{{sfn|Da Silva Udry et al.|2007}} HD 132406 orbits 1.98 AU from its host star with a period of 974 days and has a mass of {{Jupiter mass|5.61}}. The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 132406}} [[WASP-23]] is a star with one orbiting planet, [[WASP-23 b]]. The planet, discovered by the [[transit method]] in 2010, orbits every 2.944 very close to its Sun, at 0.0376 AU. It is smaller than Jupiter, at {{Jupiter mass|0.884}} and {{Jupiter radius|0.962}}. Its star is a K1V type star of apparent magnitude 12.7, far below naked-eye visibility, and smaller than the Sun at {{Solar mass|0.78}} and {{Solar radius|0.765}}.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia WASP-23 b}} [[HD 131496]] is also encircled by one planet, [[HD 131496 b]]. The star is of type K0 and is located 110 parsecs from Earth; it appears at a visual magnitude of 7.96. It is significantly larger than the Sun, with a mass of {{Solar mass|1.61}} and a radius of 4.6 solar radii. Its one planet, discovered in 2011 by the [[radial velocity method]], has a mass of {{Jupiter mass|2.2}}; its radius is as yet undetermined. HD 131496 b orbits at a distance of 2.09 AU with a period of 883 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 131496 b}}

Another single planetary system in Boötes is the [[HD 132563]] system, a [[triple star]] system. The parent star, technically [[HD 132563B]], is a star of magnitude 9.47, 96 parsecs from Earth. It is almost exactly the size of the Sun, with the same radius and a mass only 1% greater. Its planet, [[HD 132563B b]], was discovered in 2011 by the radial velocity method. {{Jupiter mass|1.49}}, it orbits 2.62 AU from its star with a period of 1544 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 132563B b}} Its orbit is somewhat elliptical, with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.22. HD 132563B b is one of very few planets found in triple star systems; it orbits the isolated member of the system, which is separated from the other components, a [[spectroscopic binary]], by 400 AU.{{sfn|Desidera et al.|2011}} Also discovered through the radial velocity method, albeit a year earlier, is [[HD 136418 b]], a 2-Jupiter mass planet that orbits the star [[HD 136418]] at a distance of 1.32 AU with a period of 464.3 days. Its host star is a magnitude 7.88 G5-type star, 98.2 parsecs from Earth. It has a radius of {{Solar radius|3.4}} and a mass of {{Solar mass|1.33}}.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 136418 b}}

[[WASP-14 b]] is one of the most massive and dense exoplanets known,{{sfn|Joshi et al.|2009}} with a mass of {{Jupiter mass|7.341}} and a radius of {{Jupiter radius|1.281}}. Discovered via the transit method, it orbits 0.036 AU from its host star with a period of 2.24 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia WASP-14 b}} WASP-14 b has a density of 4.6 grams per cubic centimeter, making it one of the densest exoplanets known.{{sfn|Joshi et al.|2009}} Its host star, [[WASP-14]], is an F5V-type star of magnitude 9.75, 160 parsecs from Earth. It has a radius of {{Solar radius|1.306}} and a mass of {{Solar mass|1.211}}.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia WASP-14 b}} It also has a very high proportion of [[lithium]].{{sfn|Joshi et al.|2009}}

=== Deep-sky objects ===

Boötes is in a part of the [[celestial sphere]] facing away from the plane of our home [[Milky Way]] galaxy, and so does not have open clusters or nebulae. Instead, it has one bright [[globular cluster]] and many faint [[galaxy|galaxies]].{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=102}} The globular cluster [[NGC 5466]] has an overall magnitude of 9.1 and a diameter of 11 arcminutes.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} It is a very loose globular cluster with fairly few stars and may appear as a rich, concentrated [[open cluster]] in a telescope. NGC 5466 is classified as a [[Shapley-Sawyer Concentration Class]] 12 cluster, reflecting its sparsity.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=103}} Its fairly large diameter means that it has a low [[surface brightness]], so it appears far dimmer than the catalogued magnitude of 9.1 and requires a large amateur telescope to view. Only approximately 12 stars are resolved by an amateur instrument.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=104}}

Boötes has two bright galaxies. [[NGC 5248]] ([[Caldwell catalog|Caldwell]] 45) is a [[Hubble sequence|type Sc galaxy]] (a variety of [[spiral galaxy]]) of magnitude 10.2. It measures 6.5 by 4.9 arcminutes.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} 50 million light-years from Earth, NGC 5248 is a member of the [[Virgo Cluster]] of galaxies; it has dim outer arms and obvious [[H II region]]s, [[dust lane]]s, and young [[star cluster]]s.{{sfn|Niksch|Block|2004}} [[NGC 5676]] is another type Sc galaxy of magnitude 10.9. It measures 3.9 by 2.0 arcminutes.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} Other galaxies include [[NGC 5008]], a type Sc [[emission-line galaxy]],{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5008}} [[NGC 5548]], a type S [[Seyfert galaxy]],{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5548}} [[NGC 5653]], a type S HII galaxy,{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5653}} [[NGC 5778]] (also classified as NGC 5825),{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5825}} a type E galaxy that is the brightest of its cluster,{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5778}} [[NGC 5886]],{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5886}} and [[NGC 5888]], a type SBb galaxy.{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5888}} [[NGC 5698]] is a barred spiral galaxy, notable for being the host of the 2005 supernova [[SN 2005bc]], which peaked at magnitude 15.3.

Further away lies the 250 million light-year diameter [[Boötes void]], a huge space largely empty of galaxies. Discovered by [[Robert Kirshner]] and colleagues in 1981, it is roughly 700 million light years from Earth.{{sfnRef|Schilling|2011|p=179}} Beyond it and within the bounds of the constellation, lie two [[supercluster]]s at around 830 million and 1 billion light years distant.

The [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]], the largest known structure in the Universe, covers a significant part of Boötes.

=== Meteor showers ===
[[File:Quad2011.324.JPG|thumb|left|A Quadrantid captured by an all-sky camera during a 4-second exposure.]]
Boötes is home to the [[Quadrantid]] meteor shower, the most prolific annual meteor shower. It was discovered in January 1835 and named in 1864 by Alexander Hershell.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=357–368}} The [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] is located in northern Boötes near Kappa Boötis,{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=612}} in its namesake former constellation of [[Quadrans Muralis]]. Quadrantid meteors are dim, but have a peak visible hourly rate of approximately 100 per hour on January 3–4.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}}{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132–133}} The [[zenithal hourly rate]] of the Quadrantids is approximately 130 meteors per hour at their peak; it is also a very narrow shower. The Quadrantids are notoriously difficult to observe because of a low radiant and often inclement weather. The parent body of the meteor shower has been disputed for decades;{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=357–368}} however, [[Peter Jenniskens]] has proposed [[2003 EH1|2003 EH<sub>1</sub>]], a minor planet, as the parent.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=368}} 2003 EH<sub>1</sub> may be linked to [[C/1490 Y1|C/1490 Y<sub>1</sub>]], a comet previously thought to be a potential parent body for the Quadrantids.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=373}}{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=376}} 2003 EH<sub>1</sub> is a [[short-period comet]] of the [[Jupiter family comet|Jupiter family]]; 500 years ago, it experienced a catastrophic breakup event. It is now dormant.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2012}} The Quadrantids had notable displays in 1982, 1985, and 2004.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=49}} Meteors from this shower often appear to have a blue hue and travel at a moderate speed of 41.5–43 kilometers per second.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=104}}

On April 28, 1984, a remarkable outburst of the normally placid [[Alpha Bootids]] was observed by visual observer Frank Witte from 00:00 to 2:30 UTC. In a 6&nbsp;cm telescope, he observed 433 meteors in a field of view near [[Arcturus]] with a diameter of less than 1°. [[Peter Jenniskens]] comments that this outburst resembled a "typical dust trail crossing".{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=199}} The Alpha Bootids normally begin on April 14, peaking on April 27th and 28th, and finishing on May 12.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}} Its meteors are slow-moving, with a velocity of 20.9 kilometers per second.{{sfn|IAU Alpha Bootids}} They may be related to Comet [[73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3]], but this connection is only theorized.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}}

[[File:QUADRANTID meteor on January 3 2009.jpg|thumb|left|A bright Quadrantid observed at twilight.]]

The [[June Bootids]], also known as the Iota Draconids, is a meteor shower associated with the comet [[7P/Pons-Winnecke]], first recognized on May 27, 1916 by William F. Denning.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=334}} The shower, with its slow meteors, was not observed prior to 1916 because Earth did not cross the comet's dust trail until Jupiter perturbed Pons-Winnecke's orbit, causing it to come within 0.03 [[astronomical unit|AU]] of Earth's orbit the first year the June Bootids were observed. In 1982, E. A. Reznikov discovered that the 1916 outburst was caused by material released from the comet in 1819.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=335}} Another outburst of the June Bootids was not observed until 1998, because Comet Pons-Winnecke's orbit was not in a favorable position. However, on June 27, 1998, an outburst of meteors radiating from Boötes, later confirmed to be associated with Pons-Winnecke, was observed. They were incredibly long-lived, with trails of the brightest meteors lasting several seconds at times. Many [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]]s, green-hued trails, and even some meteors that cast shadows were observed throughout the outburst, which had a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 200–300 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=336–337}} In 2002, two Russian astronomers determined that material ejected from the comet in 1825 was responsible for the 1998 outburst.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=338}} [[Ejecta]] from the comet dating to 1819, 1825, and 1830 was predicted to enter Earth's atmosphere on June 23, 2004. The predictions of a shower less spectacular than the 1998 showing were borne out in a display that had a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 16–20 meteors per hour that night. The June Bootids are not expected to have another outburst in the next 50 years.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=339–344}} Typically, only 1–2 dim, very slow meteors are visible per hour; the average June Bootid has a magnitude of 5.0. It is related to the [[Alpha Draconids]] and the [[Bootids-Draconids]]. The shower lasts from June 27 to July 5, with a peak on the night of June 28.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=113}} The June Bootids are classified as a class III shower (variable),{{sfn|AMS 2012 List}} and has an average entry velocity of 18 kilometers per second. Its radiant is located 7 degrees north of Beta Boötis.{{sfn|AMS June 23}}

The [[Beta Bootids]] is a weak shower that begins on January 5, peaks on January 16, and ends on January 18. Its meteors travel at 43 kilometers/second.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=105}} The [[January Bootids]] is a short, young meteor shower that begins on January 9, peaks from January 16 to January 18, and ends on January 18th.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=106}} The [[Phi Bootids]] is another weak shower radiating from Boötes. It begins on April 16, peaks on April 30 and May 1, and ends on May 12.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}} Its meteors are slow-moving, with a velocity of 15.1&nbsp;km/s. They were discovered in 2006.{{sfn|IAU Phi Bootids}}  The shower's peak hourly rate can be as high as 6 meteors per hour. Though named for a star in Boötes, the Phi Bootid radiant has moved into [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]].{{sfn|Koed|Sherrod|2003|p=52}} The meteor stream is associated with three different asteroids: [[1620 Geographos]], [[2062 Aten]], and [[1978 CA]].{{sfn|Štohl|Porubčan|1993|p=43}} The [[Lambda Bootids]], part of the [[Bootid-Coronae Borealid Complex]], are a weak annual shower with moderately fast meteors; 41.75&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Lambda Bootids}} The complex includes the Lambda Bootids, as well as the [[Theta Coronae Borealids]] and [[Xi Coronae Borealids]].{{sfn|IAU Bootid-Coronae Borealid Complex}}{{sfn|Green|2007}} All of the Bootid-Coronae Borealid showers are [[Jupiter family comet]] showers; the streams in the complex have highly inclined orbits.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2012}}

There are several minor showers in Boötes, some of whose existence is yet to be verified. The [[Rho Bootids]] radiate from near the namesake star, and were hypothesized in 2010.{{sfn|IAU Rho Bootids}} The average Rho Bootid has an entry velocity of 43&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Rho Bootids}}{{sfn|Brown|Wong|Weryk|Wiegert|2010}} It peaks in November and lasts for 3 days. The Rho Bootid shower is part of the [[SMA complex]], a group of meteor showers related to the [[Taurids]], which is in turn linked to the comet [[2P/Encke]]. However, the link to the Taurid shower remains unconfirmed and may be a chance correlation.{{sfn|Brown|Wong|Weryk|Wiegert|2010}} Another such shower is the [[Gamma Bootids]], which were hypothesized in 2006. Gamma Bootids have an entry velocity of 50.3&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Gamma Bootids}} The [[Nu Bootids]], hypothesized in 2012, have faster meteors, with an entry velocity of 62.8&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Nu Bootids}}
