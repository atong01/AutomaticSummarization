This led the group to perform numerous attacks against the PLO, which had made clear it accepted a negotiated solution to the conflict. Fatah-RC is believed to have assassinated PLO deputy chief<space/><link><target>Abu Iyad</target></link><space/>and PLO security chief Abu Hul in<space/><link><target>Tunis</target></link><space/>in January 1991. It assassinated a<space/><link><target>Jordan</target><trail>ian</trail></link><space/>diplomat in<space/><link><target>Lebanon</target></link><space/>in January 1994 and has been linked to the killing of the PLO representative there. Noted PLO moderate<space/><link><target>Issam Sartawi</target></link><space/>was killed by the Fatah-RC in 1983. In the late 1970s, the group also made failed assassination attempt on the present Palestinian<space/><link><target>President of the Palestinian National Authority</target><part>president</part></link><space/>and PLO chairman,<space/><link><target>Mahmoud Abbas</target></link>. These attacks, and numerous others, led to the PLO issuing a death sentence<space/><italics>in absentia</italics><space/>against Abu Nidal. In the early 1990s, it made an attempt to gain control of a refugee camp in<space/><link><target>Lebanon</target></link>, but this was thwarted by PLO organizations.</paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Abu Nidal</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Further reading</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2203099.stm'>Abu Nidal: Ruthless maverick</link></listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Gaddafi backed</target></template><link><target>Category:Arab nationalist militant groups</target></link><link><target>Category:Designated terrorist organizations associated with Islam</target></link><link><target>Category:Organizations designated as terrorist</target></link><link><target>Category:Palestinian militant groups</target></link><link><target>Category:United Kingdom Home Office designated terrorist groups</target></link></paragraph></article>
