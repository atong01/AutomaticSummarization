All offices may be held by a single person who also can be the sole shareholder. The person, who does not need to be a U.S. citizen or resident, may also operate anonymously with only the Listing Agent with whom the company is registered with Delaware named. This proves advantageous in civil suits as the owner or owners cannot be disclosed under Delaware law and thus are safe from being sued alongside the company. However, this does not apply if the civil suit is in regards to having committed a criminal act which the business has been found guilty of in court.</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>Tax benefits and burdens</heading><paragraph>Delaware charges no<space/><link><target>income tax</target></link><space/>on corporations not operating within the state, so taking advantage of Delaware's other benefits does not result in taxation.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">January 2011</arg><arg name="text"></arg></template><space/>At the same time, Delaware has a particularly aggressive tax on banks that locate in the state.
