The '''Delaware General Corporation Law''' (Title 8, Chapter 1 of the Delaware Code) is the [[statute]] governing [[corporate law]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Delaware]]. Over 50% of [[Public company|publicly traded]] corporations in the United States and 60% of the [[Fortune 500]] are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency.shtml |title=About Agency |publisher=Delaware Division of Corporations}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Regulatory competition|Race to the bottom}}
Delaware acquired its status as a corporate haven in the early 20th century. Following the example of [[New Jersey]], which enacted corporate-friendly laws at the end of the 19th century to attract businesses<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cary|first1=William L.|title=Cases and Materials on Corporations|date=1969|publisher=The Foundation Press , Inc.|location=Mineola|page=9}}</ref> from [[New York]], Delaware adopted on March 10, 1899, a general incorporation act aimed at attracting more businesses.  The group that pushed for this legislation was not acting entirely from altruism, as they intended to establish a corporation that would help other businesses incorporate in Delaware.<ref>[http://www.djcl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/A-History-of-Delaware-Corporation-Law1.pdf A History of Delaware Corporation Law], S. Samuel Arsht, ''Delaware Journal of Corporate Law'', 1976, pg. 6.</ref>  Before the rise of general incorporation acts, forming a corporation required a special act of the state legislature.  General incorporation allowed anyone to form a corporation by simply raising money and filing articles of incorporation with the state's Secretary of State.

==Other legal aspects==
Because of the extensive experience of the Delaware courts, {{cnspan|text=Delaware has a more well-developed body of [[case law]] than other states|date=October 2015}}, which serves to give corporations and their counsel greater guidance on matters of corporate governance and transaction liability issues. Disputes over the internal affairs of Delaware corporations are usually filed in the [[Delaware Court of Chancery]], which is a separate court of [[Equity (law)|equity]], as opposed to a [[court of law]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://courts.delaware.gov/overview.stm |title=Overview of the Delaware Court System |publisher=Delaware State Courts}}</ref> Because it is a court of equity, there are no juries, and its cases are heard by judges, called chancellors. Since 1989, the court has consisted of one Chancellor and four Vice Chancellors. The court is a trial court, with one chancellor hearing each case. Litigants may appeal final decisions of the Court of Chancery to the [[Delaware Supreme Court]].

Delaware has also attracted major credit card banks because of its relaxed rules regarding [[interest]]. Many U.S. states have [[usury]] laws limiting the amount of interest a lender can charge. Federal law allows a national bank to "import" these laws from the state in which its principal office is located.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.occ.gov/static/interpretations-and-precedents/mar98/int822.pdf |title=Interpretive Letter #822 |work=Interpretations and Actions |publisher=[[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] |volume=11 |number=3 |date=March 1998}}</ref> {{citation needed span|date=January 2014|text=Delaware (amongst others) has relatively relaxed interest laws, so several national banks have decided to locate their principal office in Delaware. National banks are, however, corporations formed under federal law, not Delaware law. A corporation formed under Delaware state law benefits from the relaxed interest rules to the extent it conducts business in Delaware, but is subject to restrictions of other states' laws if it conducts business in other states.}}

Pursuant to the "[[internal affairs doctrine]]", corporations which act in more than one state are subject only to the laws of their state of incorporation with regard to the regulation of the internal affairs of the corporation.<ref>''Edgar v. MITE Corp'', {{ussc|457|624|1982}}.</ref> As a result, Delaware corporations are subject almost exclusively to Delaware law, even when they do business in other states. 

{{citation needed span|date=January 2014|text=While most states require a for-profit corporation to have at least one director and two officers, Delaware laws do not have this restriction. All offices may be held by a single person who also can be the sole shareholder. The person, who does not need to be a U.S. citizen or resident, may also operate anonymously with only the Listing Agent with whom the company is registered with Delaware named. This proves advantageous in civil suits as the owner or owners cannot be disclosed under Delaware law and thus are safe from being sued alongside the company. However, this does not apply if the civil suit is in regards to having committed a criminal act which the business has been found guilty of in court.}}

==Tax benefits and burdens==
Delaware charges no [[income tax]] on corporations not operating within the state, so taking advantage of Delaware's other benefits does not result in taxation.{{citation needed|date=January 2011|text=}} At the same time, Delaware has a particularly aggressive tax on banks that locate in the state. However, in general, the state is viewed as a positive location for corporate tax purposes because favorable laws of incorporation allow companies to minimize corporate expenditures (achieved through legal standardization of corporate legal processes), creating a nucleus in Delaware with operating companies often in other states.<ref name=delawareofeurope>{{cite journal | url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=763164 |title=Will There Ever Be a Delaware of Europe? |first=Patrick S. |last=Ryan |journal=Columbia Journal of European Law |volume=11 |page=187 |date=Winter 2004–2005}}</ref>

In addition, Delaware has used its position as the state of incorporation to generate revenue from its abandoned and unclaimed property laws. Under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the state of incorporation gets to keep any [[Lost, mislaid, and abandoned property|abandoned and unclaimed property]], such as uncashed checks and unredeemed gift certificates, if the corporation does not have information about the location of the owner of the property.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://finance.delaware.gov/publications/fiscal_notebook_07/Section02/sec2page24.pdf |title=State General Fund Revenues by Category (F.Y. 2002 - F.Y. 2005) |work=Delaware 2005 Fiscal Notebook |publisher=Delaware Department of Finance}}</ref> 

A state may levy, however, a [[franchise tax]] on the corporations incorporated in it. Franchise taxes in Delaware are actually far higher than in most other states which typically charge little or nothing beyond corporate income taxes on the portion of the corporation's business done in that state. Delaware's franchise taxes supply about one-fifth of its state revenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://finance.delaware.gov/publications/fiscal_notebook_07/Section02/sec2page24.pdf |title=State General Fund Revenues by Category (F.Y. 2002 - F.Y. 2005) |work=Delaware 2005 Fiscal Notebook |publisher=Delaware Department of Finance}}</ref>

In February 2013, ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' published an article on tax-friendly jurisdictions, commenting that Delaware stood for “Dollars and Euros Laundered And Washed At Reasonable Expense”. [[Jeffrey W. Bullock]], Delaware's Secretary of State, insists that the state has struck the right balance between curbing criminality and “paying deference to the millions of legitimate businesspeople who benefit” from hassle-free incorporation.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21571554-some-onshore-jurisdictions-can-be-laxer-offshore-sort-not-palm-tree-sight Onshore financial centres: Not a palm tree in sight].

==2013 amendments==
On June 30, 2013, Delaware Governor [[Jack Markell]] signed into law amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law that affect several provisions in the current law and could substantially affect the process through which public companies are merged. The new legislation took effect August 1, 2013, except for ratification of defective corporate acts amendment which took effect in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hklaw.com/publications/Significant-Amendments-to-Delaware-General-Corporation-Law-Enacted-08-05-2013/ |title=Significant Amendments to Delaware General Corporation Law Enacted |journal=Holland & Knight Securities Bulletin |date=August 5, 2013}}</ref>
