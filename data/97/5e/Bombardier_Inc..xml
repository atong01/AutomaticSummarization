In 1937 Bombardier sold 12 snowmobiles, named the B7 and, in 1942, created l'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limite company.</paragraph><paragraph>The first snowmobiles were large, multipassenger vehicles designed to help people get around during the long winter months. Snowmobiles were used in rural Quebec to take children to school, carry freight, deliver mail, and as ambulances. His invention filled a very particular need in the region and soon business was booming. In&amp;nbsp;1941 Armand opened a new factory in Valcourt. Then a major setback hit the growing business: the<space/><link><target>World War&amp;nbsp;II</target><part>Second World War</part></link><space/>was well underway and the Canadian government issued wartime rationing regulations. Bombardier customers had to prove that snowmobiles were essential to their livelihood in order to buy one. To keep his business going, Armand shifted his focus and developed vehicles for the military. After the war, Bombardier experienced another setback in his snowmobile business. In&amp;nbsp;1948, the Quebec government passed a law requiring all highways and local roads to be cleared of snow; the Bombardier company's sales fell by nearly half in one year. Armand Bombardier therefore decided to diversify his business, first by producing tracked snowplows sized specifically for use on municipal sidewalks (replacing<space/><link><target>horse-drawn vehicles</target></link>), then by making all-terrain vehicles for the<space/><link><target>mining</target></link>, oil, and<space/><link><target>forestry</target></link><space/>industries.</paragraph><paragraph>Of note, the machines had removable front skis that could be replaced with front wheels for use on paved or hard surfaces, thus providing greater utility to his large snowmobiles. Production of these machines evolved over time. During 1951, the wooden bodies were replaced with sheet steel and these vehicles were powered by<space/><link><target>Chrysler</target></link><space/>flathead six-cylinder engines and 3-speed manual transmissions. In the&amp;nbsp;1960s, V-8&amp;nbsp;engines began to appear and during the 1969/1970 production years, the standard round &quot;porthole&quot;-style windows were replaced with larger rectangular windows which allowed more interior light and made them feel less claustrophobic. Following these changes came the switchover to more reliable<space/><link><target>Chrysler</target></link><space/>Industrial 318 engines with the automatic Loadflite transmissions. Production of these machines continued into the mid-1970s.</paragraph><paragraph>Bombardier wanted to develop a fast, lightweight snowmobile that could carry one or two people. In the early 1950s, Armand set aside his dream to focus on developing his company's other tracked vehicles, but by the end of the decade, smaller, more efficient engines had been developed and were starting to come onto the market. Bombardier resumed his efforts to build a &quot;miniature&quot; snowmobile. He worked alongside his eldest son Germain, who shared his father's mechanical talents. Armand and Germain developed several prototypes of the lightweight snowmobile and finally, the first Bombardier snowmobile went on sale in 1959.<link><target>File:BR100+sidea.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>Bombardier BR100+ Groomer, mid engine, hard cab model</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>Ski-Doo</target></link><space/>snowmobile was originally called the &quot;Ski-Dog&quot; because Bombardier meant it to be a practical vehicle to replace the dogsled for hunters and trappers. By an accident, a painter misinterpreted the name and painted &quot;Ski-Doo&quot; on the first prototype.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last"><space/>Skorupa

Suddenly a new winter sport was born, centred in Quebec. In the first year, Bombardier sold 225&amp;nbsp;Ski-Doos; four years later, 8,210 were sold. But Armand was reluctant to focus too much on the Ski-Doo and move resources away from his all-terrain vehicles. He vividly remembered his earlier business setbacks that forced him to diversify. Armand slowed down promotion of the Ski-Doo line to prevent it from dominating the other company products, while still allowing him to dominate the snowmobile industry. The snowmobiles produced were of exceptional quality and performance, earning a better reputation than the rival<space/><link><target>Polaris Industries</target><part>Polaris</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Arctic Cat</target></link><space/>brand of motosleds. In&amp;nbsp;1975 Bombardier completed the purchase of the<space/><link><target>Moto-Ski</target></link><space/>company.</paragraph><paragraph>On February&amp;nbsp;18,&amp;nbsp;1964, J.&amp;nbsp;Armand Bombardier died of cancer at age&amp;nbsp;56. He left behind a thriving business, but also one that had been focused on one person. Armand dominated his company, overseeing all areas of operation. He controlled the small research department, making all the drawings himself. By the time of his death sales of the company had reached<space/><link><target>Canadian dollar</target><part>C$</part></link>20&amp;nbsp;<link><target>million</target></link>, which is the equivalent of C$160&amp;nbsp;million in 2004&amp;nbsp;dollars. The younger generation took over, led by Armand's sons and sons-in-law. The young team reorganized and decentralized the company, adopting modern business tactics. The company adopted the latest technological innovationthe computerto handle inventory, accounts, and billing. Distribution networks were improved and increased, and an incentive program was developed for sales staff.</paragraph><paragraph>In&amp;nbsp;1967 L'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limite was renamed<space/><bold>Bombardier Limited</bold><space/>and on January&amp;nbsp;23,&amp;nbsp;1969, the company went public, listing on the<space/><link><target>Montreal Exchange</target><part>Montreal</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Toronto Stock Exchange</target><part>Toronto</part></link><space/><link><target>stock exchange</target><trail>s</trail></link>.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Aerospace</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Delta Bombardier 20071027.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>right</part><part>A Bombardier<space/><link><target>Canadair Regional Jet</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Delta Air Lines</target><part>Delta</part></link><space/>livery</part></link><template><target>Main</target><arg>Bombardier Aerospace</arg></template><link><target>File:Bd700.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>BD-700 landing at<space/><link><target>MontralPierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport</target><part>Montreal International Airport</part></link></part></link><link><target>File:CS100-FTV1.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>Bombardier CSeries CS100 Flight Test Vehicle (FTV1) at Mirabel</part></link>In 1986,<extension extension_name='ref'><link type='external' href='http://www.projectnorthstar.ca/northstarprimer/ch03s01.html'>&quot;Restoration Primer Sec. 3.1 Canadair.&quot;</link><space/><italics>Project North Star.</italics><space/>Retrieved: January 4, 2013.</extension><space/>Bombardier acquired<space/><link><target>Canadair</target></link><space/>after the Canadian government-owned aircraft manufacturing company recorded the largest corporate loss in Canadian history.
