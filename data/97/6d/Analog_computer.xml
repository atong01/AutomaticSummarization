Another essential was creating the required network of interconnections between computing elements. Sometimes it was necessary to re-think the structure of the problem so that the computer would function satisfactorily. No variables could be allowed to exceed the computer's limits, and differentiation was to be avoided, typically by rearranging the &quot;network&quot; of interconnects, using integrators in a different sense.</paragraph><paragraph>Running an electronic analog computer, assuming a satisfactory setup, started with the computer held with some variables fixed at their initial values. Moving a switch released the holds and permitted the problem to run. In some instances, the computer could, after a certain running time interval, repeatedly return to the initial-conditions state to reset the problem, and run it again.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Timeline of analog computers</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>History of computing hardware</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Precursors</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Timeline of computing hardware 2400 BCâ€“1949</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>This is a list of examples of early computation devices which are considered to be precursors of the modern computers.

The relative resistance of the potentiometer was then equivalent to the formula of the equation being solved.

They can be modeled using equations of the same form.</paragraph><paragraph>However, the difference between these systems is what makes analog computing useful. If one considers a simple massspring system, constructing the physical system would require making or modifying the springs and masses. This would be followed by attaching them to each other and an appropriate anchor, collecting test equipment with the appropriate input range, and finally, taking measurements. In more complicated cases, such as suspensions for racing cars, experimental construction, modification, and testing is both complicated and expensive.</paragraph><paragraph>The electrical equivalent can be constructed with a few<space/><link><target>operational amplifier</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(op amps) and some passive linear components; all measurements can be taken directly with an<space/><link><target>oscilloscope</target></link>. In the circuit, the (simulated) 'stiffness of the spring', for instance, can be changed by adjusting the parameters of a<space/><link><target>capacitor</target></link>. The electrical system is an analogy to the physical system, hence the name, but it is less expensive to construct, generally safer, and typically much easier to modify.</paragraph><paragraph>As well, an electronic circuit can typically operate at higher frequencies than the system being simulated. This allows the simulation to run faster than real time (which could, in some instances, be hours, weeks, or longer). Experienced users of electronic analog computers said that they offered a comparatively intimate control and understanding of the problem, relative to digital simulations.</paragraph><paragraph>The drawback of the mechanical-electrical analogy is that electronics are limited by the range over which the variables may vary.

Two discs on a common axis positioned a sliding block with pin (stubby shaft) on it. One disc was a face cam, and a follower on the block in the face cam's groove set the radius. The other disc, closer to the pin, contained a straight slot in which the block moved. The input angle rotated the latter disc (the face cam disc, for an unchanging radius, rotated with the other (angle) disc; a differential and a few gears did this correction).</paragraph><paragraph>Referring to the mechanism's frame, the location of the pin corresponded to the tip of the vector represented by the angle and magnitude inputs. Mounted on that pin was a square block.</paragraph><paragraph>Rectilinear-coordinate outputs (both sine and cosine, typically) came from two slotted plates, each slot fitting on the block just mentioned. The plates moved in straight lines, the movement of one plate at right angles to that of the other. The slots were at right angles to the direction of movement. Each plate, by itself, was like a<space/><link><target>Scotch yoke</target></link>, known to steam engine enthusiasts.</paragraph><paragraph>During World War II, a similar mechanism converted rectilinear to polar coordinates, but it was not particularly successful and was eliminated in a significant redesign (USN, Mk. 1 to Mk. 1A).</paragraph><paragraph>Multiplication was done by mechanisms based on the geometry of similar right triangles. Using the trigonmetric terms for a right triangle, specifically opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse, the adjacent side was fixed by construction. One variable changed the magnitude of the opposite side. In many cases, this variable changed sign; the hypotenuse could coincide with the adjacent side (a zero input), or move beyond the adjacent side, representing a sign change.</paragraph><paragraph>Typically, a pinion-operated rack moving parallel to the (trig.-defined) opposite side would position a slide with a slot coincident with the hypotenuse. A pivot on the rack let the slide's angle change freely. At the other end of the slide (the angle, in trig, terms), a block on a pin fixed to the frame defined the vertex between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side.</paragraph><paragraph>At any distance along the adjacent side, a line perpendicular to it intersects the hypotenuse at a particular point. The distance between that point and the adjacent side is some fraction that is the product of<space/><italics>1</italics><space/>the distance from the vertex, and<space/><italics>2</italics><space/>the magnitude of the opposite side.</paragraph><paragraph>The second input variable in this type of multiplier positions a slotted plate perpendicular to the adjacent side. That slot contains a block, and that block's position in its slot is determined by another block right next to it. The latter slides along the hypotenuse, so the two blocks are positioned at a distance from the (trig.) adjacent side by an amount proportional to the product.</paragraph><paragraph>To provide the product as an output, a third element, another slotted plate, also moves parallel to the (trig.) opposite side of the theoretical triangle. As usual, the slot is perpendicular to the direction of movement. A block in its slot, pivoted to the hypotenuse block positions it.</paragraph><paragraph>A special type of integrator, used at a point where only moderate accuracy was needed, was based on a steel ball, instead of a disc. It had two inputs, one to rotate the ball, and the other to define the angle of the ball's rotating axis. That axis was always in a plane that contained the axes of two movement-pickoff rollers, quite similar to the mechanism of a rolling-ball computer mouse (in this mechanism, the pickoff rollers were roughly the same diameter as the ball). The pickoff roller axes were at right angles.</paragraph><paragraph>A pair of rollers &quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot; the pickoff plane were mounted in rotating holders that were geared together. That gearing was driven by the angle input, and established the rotating axis of the ball. The other input rotated the &quot;bottom&quot; roller to make the ball rotate.</paragraph><paragraph>Essentially, the whole mechanism, called a component integrator, was a variable-speed drive with one motion input and two outputs, as well as an angle input. The angle input varied the ratio (and direction) of coupling between the &quot;motion&quot; input and the outputs according to the sine and cosine of the input angle.</paragraph><paragraph>Although they did not accomplish any computation, electromechanical position servos were essential in mechanical analog computers of the &quot;rotating-shaft&quot; type for providing operating torque to the inputs of subsequent computing mechanisms, as well as driving output data-transmission devices such as large torque-transmitter synchros in naval computers.</paragraph><paragraph>Other non-computational mechanisms included internal odometer-style counters with interpolating drum dials for indicating internal variables, and mechanical multi-turn limit stops.</paragraph><paragraph>Considering that accurately controlled rotational speed in analog fire-control computers was a basic element of their accuracy, there was a motor with its average speed controlled by a balance wheel, hairspring, jeweled-bearing differential, a twin-lobe cam, and spring-loaded contacts (ship's AC power frequency was not necessarily accurate, nor dependable enough, when these computers were designed).</paragraph><heading level='3'>Electronic analog computers</heading><paragraph>Electronic analog computers typically have front panels with numerous jacks (single-contact sockets) that permit patch cords (flexible wires with plugs at both ends) to create the interconnections which define the problem setup. In addition, there are precision high-resolution potentiometers (variable resistors) for setting up (and, when needed, varying) scale factors. In addition, there is likely to be a zero-center analog pointer-type meter for modest-accuracy voltage measurement. Stable, accurate voltage sources provide known magnitudes.</paragraph><paragraph>Typical electronic analog computers contain anywhere from a few to a hundred or more<space/><link><target>operational amplifier</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>(&quot;op amps&quot;), named because they perform mathematical operations. Op amps are a particular type of feedback amplifier with very high gain and stable input (low and stable offset). They are always used with precision feedback components that, in operation, all but cancel out the currents arriving from input components. The majority of op amps in a representative setup are summing amplifiers, which add and subtract analog voltages, providing the result at their output jacks. As well, op amps with capacitor feedback are usually included in a setup; they integrate the sum of their inputs with respect to time.</paragraph><paragraph>Integrating with respect to another variable is the nearly exclusive province of mechanical analog integrators; it is almost never done in electronic analog computers. However, given that a problem solution does not change with time, time can serve as one of the variables.</paragraph><paragraph>Other computing elements include analog multipliers, nonlinear function generators, and analog comparators.</paragraph><paragraph>Electrical elements such as inductors and capacitors used in electrical analog computers had to be carefully manufactured to reduce non-ideal effects. For example, in the construction of<space/><link><target>Network analyzer (AC power)</target><part>AC power network analyzers</part></link>, one motive for using higher frequencies for the calculator (instead of the actual power frequency) was that higher-quality inductors could be more easily made. Many general-purpose analog computers avoided the use of inductors entirely, re-casting the problem in a form that could be solved using only resistive and capacitive elements, since high-quality capacitors are relatively easy to make.</paragraph><paragraph>The use of electrical properties in analog computers means that calculations are normally performed in<space/><link><target>real-time computing</target><part>real time</part></link><space/>(or faster), at a speed determined mostly by the frequency response of the operational amplifiers and other computing elements. In the history of electronic analog computers, there were some special high-speed types.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Nonlinear</target></link><space/>functions and calculations can be constructed to a limited precision (three or four digits) by designing<space/><link><target>function generator</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>special circuits of various combinations of resistors and diodes to provide the nonlinearity. Typically, as the input voltage increases, progressively more diodes conduct.</paragraph><paragraph>When compensated for temperature, the forward voltage drop of a transistor's base-emitter junction can provide a usably accurate logarithmic or exponential function. Op amps scale the output voltage so that it is usable with the rest of the computer.</paragraph><paragraph>Any physical process which models some computation can be interpreted as an analog computer. Some examples, invented for the purpose of illustrating the concept of analog computation, include using a bundle of<space/><link><target>spaghetti</target></link><space/>as<space/><link><target>Spaghetti sort</target><part>a model of sorting numbers</part></link>; a board, a set of nails, and a rubber band as a model of finding the<space/><link><target>convex hull</target></link><space/>of a set of points; and strings tied together as a model of finding the shortest path in a network.
