In the early 1970s, Ecuador seized about 100 foreign-flag vessels (many of them U.S.) and collected fees and fines of more than $6 million. After a drop-off in such seizures for some years, several U.S. tuna boats were again detained and seized in 1980 and 1981.</paragraph><paragraph>The U.S.<space/><link><target>Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act</target></link><space/>then triggered an automatic prohibition of U.S. imports of tuna products from Ecuador. The prohibition was lifted in 1983, and although fundamental differences between U.S. and Ecuadorian legislation still exist, there is no current conflict. During the period that has elapsed since seizures which triggered the tuna import ban, successive Ecuadorian governments have declared their willingness to explore possible solutions to this problem with mutual respect for longstanding positions and principles of both sides. The election of<space/><link><target>Rafael Correa</target></link><space/>in October 2006, has strained relations between the two countries and relations have since been fraught with tension. Rafael Correa is quite critical of U.S. foreign polcy.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>In April 2011, relations between Ecuador and the United States soured particularly after Ecuador expelled the U.S. ambassador after a<space/><link><target>United States diplomatic cables leak</target><part>leaked</part></link><space/>diplomatic cable was shown accusing president Correa of knowingly ignoring police corruption.
