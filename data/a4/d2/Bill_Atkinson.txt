'''Bill Atkinson''' (born 1951) is an American [[computer engineer]] and [[photographer]].  Atkinson worked at [[Apple Computer]] from 1978 to 1990. He received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of California, San Diego]], where [[Apple Macintosh]] developer [[Jef Raskin]] was one of his professors. Atkinson continued his studies as a graduate student in neurochemistry at the [[University of Washington]], nearly getting a PhD {{r|Isaacson2014}}.

Atkinson was part of the [[Apple Macintosh]] development team,{{r|lemmons198402}} and was the creator of the ground-breaking [[MacPaint]] application, among others. He also designed and implemented [[QuickDraw]], the fundamental toolbox that the Lisa and Macintosh used for graphics. QuickDraw's performance was essential for the success of the Macintosh's [[graphical user interface]].  He also was one of the main designers of the Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces.  Atkinson also conceived, designed and implemented [[HyperCard]], the first popular [[hypermedia]] system.

Around 1990, [[General Magic]]'s founding, with Bill Atkinson as one of the three co-founders, met the following press in ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine:
<blockquote>The obstacles to General Magic's success may appear daunting, but General Magic is not your typical start-up company. Its partners include some of the biggest players in the worlds of computing, communications, and consumer electronics, and it's loaded with top-notch engineers who have been given a clean slate to reinvent traditional approaches to ubiquitous worldwide communications.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec3/art1.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970713005548/http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec3/art1.htm |archivedate=July 13, 1997 |title=Just Like Magic? |publisher=[[Byte Magazine]] |first1=Tom R. |last1=Halfhill |first2=Andy |last2=Reinhardt |date=February 1994}}</ref></blockquote>

In 2007 Atkinson began working as an outside developer with [[Numenta]], a startup working on computer intelligence. On his work there Atkinson said, "what Numenta is doing is more fundamentally important to society than the personal computer and the rise of the Internet."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/02/01/8398989/index.htm |title=Jeff Hawkins and the Brain |work=Business 2.0 |publisher=CNN |first=Erick |last=Schonfeld |date=March 6, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070625063943/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/02/01/8398989/index.htm?| archivedate= 25 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Some of Atkinson's noteworthy contributions to the field of computing include:
* Macintosh [[QuickDraw]] and Lisa [[LisaGraf]]
** Atkinson independently discovered the [[Midpoint circle algorithm]] for fast drawing of circles by using the sum of consecutive odd numbers.
