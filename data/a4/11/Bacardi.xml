During this period, rum was cheaply made and not considered a refined drink, and rarely sold in upmarket taverns. Facundo began attempting to &quot;tame&quot; rum by isolating a proprietary strain of yeast still used in Bacardi production. This yeast gives Bacardi rum its flavour profile. After experimenting with several techniques he hit upon filtering the rum through charcoal, which removed impurities. In addition to this, Facundo aged the rum in white oak barrels, which had the effect of mellowing the drink. The final product was the first clear, or &quot;white&quot; rum in the world.</paragraph><paragraph>Moving from the experimental stage to a more commercial endeavour, he and his brother Jos set up a<space/><link><target>Santiago de Cuba</target></link><space/>distillery they bought in 1862, which housed a<space/><link><target>still</target></link><space/>made of copper and<space/><link><target>cast iron</target></link>.

Facing increased competition in the rum market from the now international brand Havana Club, the company concluded that it was important for sales to associate its rum with Cuba. TV advertisements with slogans of 'Welcome to the Latin Quarter' are but one example of this. In 1998, under the distinctive bat logo, the phrase &quot;company founded in Santiago de Cuba in 1862&quot; was added.</paragraph><paragraph>Bacardi has faced criticism and legal problems for supposedly attempting to encourage consumers to believe that they were purchasing rum made in Cuba, rather than just marking its heritage. Bacardi adverts in Spain, since 1966, had described a popular combination of rum and Coke as &quot;rum and coke&quot;. However, after 1998, it began to describe the drink as<space/><link><target>Cuba Libre</target></link>&amp;nbsp; literally translated as &quot;Free Cuba&quot;, which is the original name of the drink and what it is mostly called in Latin America.
