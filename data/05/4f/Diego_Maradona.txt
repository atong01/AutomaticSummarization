An advanced [[playmaker]] who operated in the [[Attacking midfielder|classic number 10 position]], Maradona is the only player in football history to set the [[World football transfer record|world record transfer fee]] twice, first when he transferred to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] for a then world record £5m, and second, when he transferred to [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] for another record fee £6.9m.<ref name="Times"/> He played for [[Argentinos Juniors]], [[Boca Juniors]], Barcelona, Napoli, [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] and [[Newell's Old Boys]] during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli where he won numerous accolades. In his international career with [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], he earned 91 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 34 goals. Maradona's exceptional vision, passing, ball control, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills, speed, reflexes and thinking time was combined with his small size (he was 5'5", or 1.65m) giving him a low center of gravity which allowed him to be more maneuverable than most other football players; he would often dribble past multiple opposing players on a run. His presence on the pitch would have a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "El Pibe de Oro" ("The Golden Boy"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career.<ref name="Pibe">{{cite web|title=La nuova vita del Pibe de Oro Maradona ct dell'Argentina|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/10/sezioni/sport/calcio/maradona-ct-argentina/maradona-ct-argentina/maradona-ct-argentina.html| publisher=la Repubblica | accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>

Maradona played in four [[FIFA World Cup]]s, including the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico where he captained Argentina and led them to [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|victory over West Germany]] in the final, and won the [[Golden Ball (FIFA)|Golden Ball]] as the tournament's best player. In the 1986 World Cup quarter final, he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over [[England national football team|England]] that entered football history for two different reasons. The first goal was an unpenalized handling foul known as the "[[Hand of God goal|Hand of God]]", while the second goal followed a {{convert|60|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} dribble past five England players, voted  "[[Goal of the Century|The Goal of the Century]]" by FIFA.com voters in 2002.<ref name=voted>[http://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=82406/index.html "Diego Maradona goal voted the FIFA World Cup™ Goal of the Century"]. FIFA (30 May 2002). Retrieved 13 March 2013</ref>

Maradona became coach of Argentina in November 2008. He was in charge of the team at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa before leaving at the end of the tournament. He coached Dubai-based club [[Al Wasl FC|Al Wasl]] in the [[UAE Pro-League]] for the 2011–12 season. In August 2013, Maradona joined Argentine [[Primera D Metropolitana|Primera D]] club [[Deportivo Riestra]]'s staff as "spiritual coach".<ref>[http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/138778/maradona-celebrates-first-victory-as-riestra-spiritual-coach "Maradona celebrates first victory as Riestra 'spiritual coach'", ''The Buenos Aires Herald'', 19 August 2013]</ref>

He was the fifth child and first son of Diego Maradona 'Chitoro' and Dalma Salvadora Franco 'Doña Tota' (1930–2011). Both his parents were illegitimate children. His father took the family name of his mother because his father did not recognise him as his own. Maradona's mother was not recognised by her father, Atanancio Ramón Edisto Franco, until she was eighteen years old. Maradona's parents were both born and brought up in the town of [[Esquina, Corrientes|Esquina]] in the north-east province of Corrientes Province, living only two hundred yards from each other on the banks of the [[Corriente River]]. In 1950, they left Esquina and settled in Buenos Aires. At age eight, Maradona was spotted by a talent scout while he was playing in his neighbourhood club ''Estrella Roja''. He became a staple of ''Los Cebollitas'' (The Little Onions), the junior team of Buenos Aires's [[Argentinos Juniors]]. As a 12-year-old ball boy, he amused spectators by showing his wizardry with the ball during the halftime intermissions of first division games.<ref>[http://www.fundus.org/referat.asp?ID=12053 The Hand of God].

During his time with the Argentine national team, Maradona scored 34 goals in 91 appearances. He made his full international debut at age 16, against [[Hungary]] on 27 February 1977. Maradona was left off the Argentine squad for the 1978 World Cup on home soil by coach [[Cesar Luis Menotti]] who felt the 17-year-old was still too young.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/686139/Diego-Maradona "Diego Maradona Biography"].

Maradona played his first [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] tournament in 1982 in his new country of residence, Spain. Argentina played Belgium in the opening game of the 1982 Cup at the [[Camp Nou]] in Barcelona. The Catalan crowd was eager to see their new world-record signing Maradona in action, but he did not perform to expectations.<ref>[http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1982/wc82story.html 1982 – Story of Spain '82].

Maradona played in all five matches without being substituted, scoring twice against Hungary. He was fouled repeatedly in all five games and particularly in the last one against Brazil at the Sarria; a game that was blighted by poor officiating and violent fouls. With Argentina already down 3-0 to Brazil, Maradona's temper eventually got the better of him and he was sent off with 5 minutes remaining for a serious retaliatory foul against [[João Batista da Silva]].<ref>[http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2943/castrol-debates/2010/06/10/1968569/castrol-world-cup-legends-diego-maradona-1986 "Castrol World Cup Legends: Diego Maradona – 1986"].

Ultimately, on 22 August 2005 Maradona acknowledged on his television show that he had hit the ball with his hand purposely, and no contact with his head was made, and that he immediately knew the goal was illegitimate.

At the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the United States, Maradona played in only two games (both at the [[Foxboro Stadium]] near Boston), scoring one goal against [[Greece national football team|Greece]], before being sent home after failing a [[drug test]] for [[ephedrine]] [[doping (sport)|doping]]. In his autobiography, Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the power drink Rip Fuel. His claim was that the U.S. version, unlike the Argentine one, contained the chemical and that, having run out of his Argentine dosage, his trainer unwittingly bought the U.S. formula. FIFA expelled him from USA '94 and Argentina were subsequently eliminated in the second round by Romania in Los Angeles. Maradona has also separately claimed that he had an agreement with FIFA, on which the organization reneged, to allow him to use the drug for weight loss before the competition in order to be able to play.<ref>Hylands, Alan.

Maradona was dominantly left-footed, often using his left foot even when the ball was positioned more suitably for a right-footed connection. His first goal against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup semi-final is a worthy indicator of such; he had run into the inside right channel to receive a pass but let the ball travel across to his left foot, requiring more technical ability. During his run past several England players in the previous round for the "Goal of the Century" he did not use his right foot once, despite spending the whole movement on the right-hand side of the pitch. In the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]  second round tie against Brazil, he did use his right foot to set up the winning goal for [[Claudio Caniggia|Caniggia]] due to two Brazilian markers forcing him into a position that made use of his left foot less practical.<ref>Brian Glanville (2010).

Hounded for years by the press, Maradona once fired a [[air rifle|compressed-air rifle]] at reporters who he claimed were invading his privacy. This quote from former teammate [[Jorge Valdano]] summarizes the feelings of many:
{{quote|He is someone many people want to emulate, a controversial figure, loved, hated, who stirs great upheaval, especially in Argentina... Stressing his personal life is a mistake. Maradona has no peers inside the pitch, but he has turned his life into a show, and is now living a personal ordeal that should not be imitated.<!--Es un personaje al que mucha gente quiere imitar, un personaje polémico, amado, odiado, que provoca gran convulsión social, sobre todo en Argentina...

Scores of fans gathered around the clinic. He was taken off the [[respirator]] on 23 April and remained in intensive care for several days before being discharged on 29 April. He tried to return to Cuba, where he had spent most of his time in the years leading up to the heart attack, but his family opposed, having filed a judicial petition to exercise his legal guardianship.

Maradona had a tendency to put on weight, and suffered increasingly from [[obesity]] (at one point weighing 280&nbsp;lb (127&nbsp;kg)) from the end of his playing career until undergoing [[gastric bypass surgery]] in a clinic in [[Cartagena de Indias]], Colombia on 6 March 2005.

===Political views===
[[File:Maradona y Kirchner.jpg|thumb|right|Maradona presents a signed shirt to the former President of Argentina [[Néstor Kirchner]] in December 2007]]
Having previously been vocal in his support of [[neoliberal]] Argentine President [[Carlos Menem]] and his Harvard University-educated economist [[Domingo Cavallo]], Maradona has shown sympathy to [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideologies. He became friends with Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]] while receiving treatment on the island with Castro stating: "Diego is a great friend and very noble, too. There’s also no question he’s a wonderful athlete and has maintained a friendship with Cuba to no material gain of his own.”<ref name="Maradona FIFA"/> He has a portrait of Castro [[tattoo]]ed on his left leg and one of Fidel's second in command, fellow Argentine [[Che Guevara]] on his right arm.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/argentina/story/0,,1635417,00.html |title=A big hand |work=The Observer |location=UK |accessdate=19 June 2006 |date=6 November 2005  | first=Chris | last=Taylor}}</ref> In his autobiography, ''El Diego'', he dedicated the book to various people, including Castro, he wrote "To Fidel Castro and, through him, all the [[Cubans|Cuban people]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Maradona |first=Diego |author2=Daniel Arcucci |author3=Ernesto Cherquis Bialo  |title=El Diego |year=2005 |publisher=Yellow Jersey |location=London |isbn=0-224-07190-4}}</ref>

Maradona was also a supporter of former Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]]. In 2005, he came to Venezuela to meet Chávez, who received him in the [[Miraflores Palace|Miraflores]]. After this meeting, Maradona claimed that he had come with the aim of meeting a "great man" ("un grande" in Spanish) but he had met instead a gigantic man ("un gigante" in Spanish, meaning he was more than great). "I believe in Chávez, I am [[Chavista]].

He has declared his opposition to what he identifies as [[imperialism]], notably during the 2005 [[Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas|Summit of the Americas]] in [[Mar del Plata]], Argentina.

With his poor shanty town upbringing, Maradona has cultivated a man of the people persona.<ref name="Vatican"/> During a meeting with [[Pope John Paul II]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in 1987 they clashed on the issue of wealth disparity, with Maradona stating: "I argued with him because I was in the Vatican and I saw all these golden ceilings and afterwards I heard the Pope say the Church was worried about the welfare of poor kids.

===Financial problems===
In March 2009 Italian officials announced that Maradona still owed the Italian government €37&nbsp;million in taxes; €23.5&nbsp;million of which was accrued interest on his original debt.

The American newspaper ''[[The Houston Chronicle]]'' wrote about Maradona:
{{quote|text=To understand the gargantuan shadow Maradona casts over his football-mad homeland, one has to conjure up the athleticism of Michael Jordan, the power of Babe Ruth – and the human fallibility of Mike Tyson.

In Argentina, Maradona is considered a sports hero to many. He is idolized, receiving the name of "God". On the idolatry that exists in Argentina, former teammate [[Jorge Valdano]] said: "At the time that Maradona retired from active football, left traumatized Argentina. Maradona was more than just a great footballer. It was a special compensation factor for a country that in a few years lived several military dictatorships and social frustrations of all kinds".<ref name="Deportes"/> Valdano added that "Maradona offered to the Argentines a way out of their collective frustration, and that's why people love him. There is a divine figure."<ref name="Deportes">[http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story?id=455305 "¿Es el sucesor natural?"]. ESPN Deportes. (Ed, 29 June 2014). Retrieved 3 July 2014</ref>

Maradona was included in many [[cameo appearance|cameo]]s in the Argentine comic book [[El Cazador de Aventuras]].
