Those who have led pristine lives enter immediately into the &quot;<link><target>Olam Haba</target></link>&quot; or World to Come. Most do not enter the World to Come immediately, but now experience a period of review of their earthly actions and they are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as being a &quot;re-schooling&quot;, with the soul gaining wisdom as one's errors are reviewed. Others view this period to include spiritual discomfort for past wrongs. At the end of this period, not longer than one year, the soul then takes its place in the World to Come. Although discomforts are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of &quot;eternal damnation&quot;, so prevalent in other religions, is no tenet of the Jewish afterlife. According to the Talmud, extinction of the soul is reserved for a far much smaller group of malicious and evil leaders, either whose very evil deeds go way beyond norms, or who lead large groups of people to utmost evil.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tsa/tsa37.htm<space/></arg><arg name="title">Tractate Sanhedrin: Interpolated Section: Those Who have no Share in the World to Come<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Sacred-texts.com<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2014-03-08</arg></template></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10049.html<space/></arg><arg name="title">Jehoiakim<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Jewishvirtuallibrary.org<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2014-03-08</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>Maimonides</target></link><space/>describes the<space/><link><target>Olam Haba</target></link><space/>(&quot;World to Come&quot;) in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the Messianic era.

Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus' judgment in John 3:19-21 as their model: &quot;19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God. As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr.<space/><link><target>Thomas Hopko</target></link><space/>writes, &quot;[I]t is precisely the presence of Gods mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives. . . . In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be all and in all, with boundless mercy and uncondi- tional pardon.

Adventists believe that the body + the breath of God = a living soul. Like Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists use key phrases from the Bible, such as &quot;For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten&quot; (Eccl. 9:5 KJV). Adventists also point to the fact that the wage of sin is death and God alone is<space/><link><target>immortality</target><part>immortal</part></link>. Adventists believe God will grant eternal life to the redeemed who are resurrected at Jesus' second coming. Until then, all those who have died are &quot;asleep&quot;. When Jesus the Christ, who is the Word and the Bread of Life, comes a second time, the righteous will be raised incorruptible and will be taken in the clouds to meet their Lord. The righteous will live in heaven for a thousand years (the millennium) where they will sit with God in judgment over the unredeemed and the fallen angels. During the time the redeemed are in heaven, the Earth will be devoid of human and animal inhabitation. Only the fallen angels will be left alive. The second resurrection is of the unrighteous, when Jesus brings the New Jerusalem down from heaven to relocate to Earth. Jesus will call to life all those who are unrighteous. Satan and his angels will convince the unrighteous to surround the city, but hell fire and brimstone will fall from heaven and consume them, thus cleansing Earth of all sin. The universe will be then free from sin forever. This is called the second death. On the new earth God will provide an eternal home for all the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, where Eden will be restored. The great controversy will be ended and sin will be no more. God will reign in perfect harmony forever.(Rom. 6:23; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11-14; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1-10; Rev. 20; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Jer. 4:23-26; Rev. 21:1-5; Mal. 4:1; Eze. 28:18, 19; 2 Peter 3:13; Isa. 35; 65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5; 11:15.)<extension extension_name='ref'>White, E.G.

This is why an oil lamp is lit and kept beside the head of the corpse, to light the dark tunnel and allow the soul to travel comfortably.</paragraph><paragraph>The soul, called &quot;<link><target>Atman (Hinduism)</target><part>Atman</part></link>&quot; leaves the body and reincarnates itself according to the deeds or Karma performed by one in last birth. Rebirth would be in form of animals or other lower creatures if one performed bad Karmas and in human form in a good family with joyous lifetime if the person was good in last birth. In between the two births a human is also required to either face punishments for bad Karmas in &quot;<link><target>Naraka (Hinduism)</target><part>naraka</part></link>&quot; or hell or enjoy for the good karmas in &quot;svarga&quot; or heaven for good deeds. Whenever his or her punishments or rewards are over he or she is sent back to earth, also known as &quot;Mrutyulok&quot; or human world. A person stays with the God or ultimate power when he discharges only &amp; only yajna karma (means work done for satisfaction of supreme lord only) in last birth and the same is called as &quot;Moksha&quot; or &quot;Nirvana&quot;, which is the ultimate goal of a self realised soul. Atma moves with &quot;Parmatma&quot; or the greatest soul. According to Bhagavad Gita an &quot;Atma&quot; or soul never dies, what dies is the body only made of five elementsEarth, Water, Fire, Air, and Sky. Soul is believed to be indestructible. None of the five elements can harm or influence it. Hinduism through Garuda Purana also describes in detail various types of &quot;Narkas&quot; or Hells where a person after death is punished for his bad Karmas and dealt with accordingly.</paragraph><paragraph>Hindus also believe in 'Karma'. 'Karma' is the accumulated sums of one's good or bad deeds. Satkarma means good deeds, vikarma means bad deeds. According to<space/><link><target>Hinduism</target></link><space/>the basic concept of Karma is 'As you sow, you shall reap'. So, if a person has lived a good life, they will be rewarded in the afterlife. Similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life. Good 'Karma' brings good rewards and bad 'karmas' lead to bad results. There is no judgment here. People accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts. In Bhagavad Gita when Arjuna hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus &quot;Do you believe that you are the doer of the action. No. You are merely an instrument in MY hands. Do you believe that the people in front of you are living? Dear Arjuna, they are already dead. As a<space/><italics>kshatriya</italics><space/>(warrior) it is your duty to protect your people and land. If you fail to do your duty, then you are not adhering to dharmic principles.&quot;</paragraph><heading level='3'>Buddhism</heading><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">November 2014</arg></template><template><target>main</target><arg>Buddhist eschatology</arg></template>Buddhists maintain that<space/><link><target>rebirth (Buddhism)</target><part>rebirth</part></link><space/>takes place without an unchanging<space/><link><target>Atman (Buddhism)</target><part>self</part></link><space/>or soul passing from one form to another.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last1">Becker<space/></arg><arg name="first1">Carl B.<space/></arg><arg name="title">Breaking the circle: death and the afterlife in Buddhism<space/></arg><arg name="date">1993<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Southern Illinois University Press<space/></arg><arg name="location">Carbondale<space/></arg><arg name="isbn">0-585-03949-6<space/></arg><arg name="page">viii<space/></arg><arg name="quote">Buddhists believe in karma and rebirth, and yet they deny the existence of permanent souls.</arg></template></extension><space/>The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person's actions (kamma or<space/><link><target>karma</target></link>). For example, if a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a<space/><link><target>ghost</target></link><space/>or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness (<link><target>metta</target></link>), compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.</paragraph><paragraph>Yet the mechanism of rebirth with kamma is not deterministic. It depends on various levels of kamma. The most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment. At that moment, heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed, if not then near death kamma, if not then habitual kamma, finally if none of the above happened, then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen. According to Theravada Buddhism, there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into.</paragraph><paragraph>Pure Land Buddhism of Mahayana believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called Pure Land. It is believed that each Buddha has their own pure land, created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a Buddha there. Thus the main practice of pure land Buddhism is to chant a Buddha's name.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>Tibetan Buddhism</target></link><space/>the<space/><link><target>Bardo Thodol</target><part>Tibetan Book of the Dead</part></link><space/>explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different<space/><link><target>Buddhahood</target><part>Buddha</part><trail>s</trail></link><space/>who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the<space/><link><target>Dharma (Buddhism)</target><part>Dharma</part></link><space/>and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.</paragraph><paragraph>&quot;Life is cosmic energy of the universe and after death it merges in universe again and as the time comes to find the suitable place for the entity died in the life condition it gets born.

They believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in God. However it's been a matter of great debate amongst the Sikhs about Sikhism's belief in afterlife. Many believe that Sikhism endorses afterlife and the concept of reward and punishment as there are verses given in Guru Granth sahib, but a large number of Sikhs believe otherwise and treat those verses as metaphorical or poetic.</paragraph><paragraph>But if one analyse the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions Afterlife, existence of heaven and hell are mentioned succinctly in Guru Granth Sahib and in Dasam granth so from that it can been concluded that Sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell, however, heaven and hell are created to reward and punish, one will then take birth again until one merges in God. According to the Sikh scriptures, the human form is the closet form to God and the best opportunity for a human being attain salvation and merge back with God. Sikh Gurus said that nothing dies, nothing is born, everything is ever present, and it just changes forms. That is a higher philosophy. Its like standing in front of a wardrobe, you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it. You wear another one. Youre just changing one form into another one. Actually, your soul is never born and never dies. Your soul is a part of God and hence lives forever.<extension extension_name='ref'>http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1248308791&amp;ucat=7</extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>Neopaganism</heading><heading level='3'>Wicca</heading><paragraph>The Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as<space/><link><target>The Summerland</target></link>.

Sympathy, the alleviating of hardships, the seeking of love, beauty and song are some influences that people from that realm possess. Beauty, either natural or man-made, will move these individuals; furthermore, there is a desire to beautify the home. There is a strong attraction to the opposite sex. This dimension is an indescribably lovely existence. Here one must leave behind all rigid intellectual structures and dogmas, be they scientific, religious, or philosophical. An infinite variety of new sounds, colors and feelings are experienced here and souls find a much wider freedom to function with highly energized intellect and spirit. If, in this dimension, the soul becomes free from the Earth pull, it is qualified to experience cosmic ranges beyond Earth's confines.<template><target>citation needed</target><arg name="date">October 2015</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Zoroastrianism</heading><paragraph><template><target>unreferenced section</target><arg name="date">December 2014</arg></template><template><target>main</target><arg>Frashokereti</arg></template>Zoroastrianism states that the<space/><italics>urvan</italics>, the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima.
