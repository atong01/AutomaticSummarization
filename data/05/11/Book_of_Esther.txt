{{Tanakh OT|Ketuvim|historical}}

The '''Book of Esther''', also known in [[Hebrew]] as "the Scroll" (''Megillah''), is a book in the third section (''[[Ketuvim]]'', "Writings") of the [[Judaism|Jewish]] ''[[Tanakh]]'' (the [[Hebrew Bible]]) and in the Christian [[Old Testament]]. It relates the story of a [[Jewish]] girl in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], born as Hadassah but known as [[Esther]], who becomes queen of Persia and thwarts a [[genocide]] of her people. The story forms the core of the [[Jewish festival]] of [[Purim]], during which it is read aloud twice: once in the evening and again the following morning. Along with the [[Song of Songs]], Esther is one of only two books in the Bible that do not explicitly mention [[God in Judaism|God]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://overviewbible.com/the-2-books-of-the-bible-that-dont-mention-god/ |title=The 2 books of the Bible that don’t mention God |author=Jeffrey Kranz |date=February 4, 2014 |access-date=July 8, 2015}}</ref>

Traditionally, unlike other Tanakh scrolls, a scroll of Esther is given only one roller, fixed to its left-hand side, rather than the customary two rollers (one fixed to the right-hand side as well as the one fixed to the left-hand side).<ref name="RosselTorah212">{{cite book |last=Rossel |first=Seymour |authorlink=Seymour Rossel |title=The Torah: Portion by Portion |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AzZlANCOIRgC&pg=PA212 |accessdate=13 October 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Torah Aura Productions |location=Los Angeles, CA, USA |isbn=978-1-891662-94-2 |page=212}}</ref>{{why?|date=May 2014}}

==Setting==
The biblical Book of Esther is set in the Persian [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Susa]] (''Shushan'') in the third year of the reign of the [[King of Persia|Persian king]] [[Ahasuerus#Book of Esther|Ahasuerus]]. The name ''Ahasuerus'' is equivalent to ''Xerxes''<ref name="Baumgarten">

However, classical sources such as [[Josephus]], the Jewish commentary ''[[Esther Rabbah]]'' and the [[Christian theologian]] [[Bar-Hebraeus]],<ref name="budge">''E A W Budge, ''The Chronography of Bar Hebraeus'', Gorgias Press LLC, reprinted 2003</ref> as well as the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] translation of Esther, instead identify Ahasuerus as either [[Artaxerxes I]] (reigned 465 to 424 BCE) or [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] (reigned 404 to 358 BCE).<ref name="budge" />

Assuming that Ahasuerus is indeed Xerxes I, the events described in Esther began around the years 483-482 BCE, and concluded in March 473 BCE.

==Summary==
[[File:Megillat Esther (1).jpg|thumb|235px|The opening chapter of a hand-written scroll of the Book of Esther, with reader's pointer]]

The text begins with Ahasuerus, ruler of a [[Achaemenid Empire|massive Persian empire]], holding a lavish banquet, initially for his court and dignitaries and afterwards for all inhabitants of the capital city, [[Susa|Shushan]]. On the seventh day, Ahasuerus orders the queen, [[Vashti]], to come and display her beauty before the guests. She refuses. Furious, Ahasuerus has her removed from her position and makes arrangements to choose a new queen from a selection of beautiful young women from throughout the empire.

One of these is the Jewish [[orphan]], [[Esther]]. After the death of her parents, she was fostered by her [[cousin]], [[Mordecai]]. She finds favour in the King's eyes, and is crowned his new queen. Shortly afterwards, Mordecai discovers a plot by two courtiers, [[Bigthan and Teresh]], to assassinate Ahasuerus. The conspirators are apprehended and hanged, and Mordecai's service to the King is duly recorded.

Ahasuerus appoints [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] as his [[prime minister]]. Mordecai, who sits at the palace gates, falls into Haman's disfavour, as he refuses to bow down to him. Having discovered that Mordecai is Jewish, Haman plans to kill not just Mordecai, but all the Jews in the empire. He duly obtains Ahasuerus' permission to execute this plan, against payment of ten thousand [[talent (measurement)|talent]]s of silver, and casts lots to choose the date on which to do this—the thirteenth of the month of [[Adar]].

When Mordecai finds out about the plan, he implores Esther to try and intercede with the King; but she is afraid to break the law and present herself to the King unsummoned, as this was punishable by death. She orders Mordecai to have all Jews fast for three days together with her, and on the third day she goes to Ahasuerus, who stretches out his sceptre to her to indicate that she is not to be punished. She invites him to a feast in the company of Haman. During the feast, she asks them to attend a further feast the next evening. Meanwhile, Haman is again offended by Mordecai and, at his wife's suggestion, has a [[gallows]] built to hang him.

That night, King Ahasuerus suffers [[insomnia]], and when he orders the court records be read to him in order to help him sleep, he is reminded of the services rendered by Mordecai in the previous plot against his life. Ahasuerus is informed that Mordecai never received any recognition for this.

Just then, Haman appears, to request the King's permission to hang Mordecai, but before he can make this request, King Ahasuerus asks Haman what should be done for the man that the King wishes to honor. Assuming that the man that the King is referring to is himself, Haman suggests that the man be dressed in the King's royal robes and led around on the King's royal horse, while a [[herald]] calls: "See how the King honours a man he wishes to reward!" To his surprise and horror, the King instructs Haman to do so to Mordecai!

Immediately after, Ahasuerus and Haman attend Esther's second banquet, at which she reveals that she is Jewish and that Haman is planning to exterminate her people, including her. Overcome by rage, Ahasuerus leaves the room; meanwhile Haman stays behind and begs Esther for his life, falling upon her in desperation. The King returns in at this very moment and thinks Haman is assaulting the queen; this makes him angrier than before and he orders Haman hanged on the gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai.

Although the King cannot annul his previous decree, he does permit the Jews to defend themselves during the attacks. On 13 Adar, 500 attackers and Haman's ten sons are killed in Shushan, followed by a Jewish slaughter of 75,000 [[Persian people|Persians]], taking no plunder. Esther sends a letter instituting an annual commemoration of the Jewish people's redemption, in a holiday called [[Purim]] (lots). Ahasuerus remains very powerful and continues reigning, with Mordecai assuming a prominent position in his court.<ref>Esther chapters 9–10</ref>

==Authorship and date==
[[File:Göttingen-Esther.Rolle.0.JPG|thumb|right|Scroll of Esther (Megillah)]]

The ''Megillat Esther'' (Book of Esther) became the last of the 24 books of the [[Tanakh]] to be canonized by the Sages of the [[Great Assembly]]. 
According to the Talmud, it was a [[redaction]] by the Great Assembly of an original text by Mordecai.<ref>''Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Baba Bathra'' 15a</ref> 
It is usually dated{{bywhom|date=May 2015}} to the 3rd{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} or 4th century BCE.<ref>NIV Study Bible, ''Introductions to the Books of the Bible, Esther'', Zondervan, 2002</ref> 
[[Shemaryahu Talmon]], however, suggests that "the traditional setting of the book in the days of Xerxes I cannot be wide off the mark."<ref>Shemaryahu Talmon, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1516862 "Wisdom in the Book of Esther"], ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'' 13 (1963), p. 453 (at JSTOR, free subscription needed)</ref> 

The Greek book of Esther, included in the [[Septuagint]], is a retelling of the events of the Hebrew Book of Esther rather than a translation and records [[#Additions to Esther|additional traditions]] which do not appear in original Hebrew version, in particular the identification of Ahasuerus with [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes]] and details of various letters.

==Historicity==
[[File:Sofer, Jewish scribe.JPG|thumb|A ''[[Sofer]]'' (Jewish religious scribe) completing the Book of Esther, [[Ein Bokek]], Israel, January 2012]]
The book of Esther falls under the category of [[Ketuvim]], one of three parts of the Jewish canon.<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009">Coogan, Michael David Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 396.</ref> According to some sources, it is a [[historical novel]]la, written to [[Myth of origins|explain the origin]] of the Jewish holiday of Purim.<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009"/><ref name="Sidnie White Crawford 2003">Sidnie White Crawford, “Esther,” in The New Interpreters Study Bible New Revised Standard Version with the Apocrypha, ed. Walter J. Harrison and Donald Senior (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2003), 689–690.</ref>

As noted by biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan, the book contains specific details regarding certain subject matter (for example, Persian rule) which are historically inaccurate. For example, Coogan discusses an apparent inaccuracy regarding the age of Esther's cousin (or, according to others, uncle) [[Mordecai]].<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009"/><ref name="Sidnie White Crawford 2003"/> In Esther 2:5–6, either Mordecai or his great-grandfather Kish is identified as having been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar in 597&nbsp;BCE: "Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jeconiah king of Judah." If this refers to Mordecai, he would have had to live over a century to have witnessed the events described in the Book of Esther.<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009"/> However, the verse may be read as referring not to Mordecai's exile to Babylon, but to his great-grandfather Kish's exile.<ref>New King James Version, translation of [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=esther%202:6&version=NKJV Esther 2:6]</ref><ref name="ISBE">Bromiley, Geoffrey W. (Editor), ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Volume II'', 1982, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. [http://books.google.com/books?id=yklDk6Vv0l4C&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=kish+mordecai+antecedent&source=bl p. 159 (entry: Book of Esther)]</ref><ref>Wiersbe,Warren W., [http://books.google.com/books?id=DUCs8HJTmhEC ''Bible Exposition Commentary: Old Testament History''], David C Cook, 2004 p. 712</ref>

In her article “The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling,” biblical scholar [[Adele Berlin]] discusses the reasoning behind scholarly concern about the historicity of Esther. Much of this debate relates to the importance of distinguishing history and fiction within biblical texts, as Berlin argues, in order to gain a more accurate understanding of the history of the Israelite people.<ref name="Adele Berlin 2001">[[Adele Berlin]], “The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling,” ''[[Journal of Biblical Literature]]'' 120. no. 1 (Spring 2001): 3–14.</ref> Berlin quotes a series of scholars who suggest that the author of Esther did not mean for the book to be considered as a historical writing, but intentionally wrote it to be a historical novella.<ref>Adele Berlin, “The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling,” Journal of Biblical Literature 120. no. 1 (Spring 2001): 6.</ref> The genre of novellas under which Esther falls was common during both the Persian and Hellenistic periods to which scholars have dated the book of Esther.<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009"/><ref name="Adele Berlin 2001"/>

There are certain elements of the book of Esther that are historically accurate. The story told in the book of Esther takes place during the rule of Ahasuerus, who has been identified as the 5th-century Persian king Xerxes (486–465). The author also displays an accurate knowledge of Persian customs and palaces.<ref name="ISBE"/> However, according to Coogan, considerable historical inaccuracies remain throughout the text, supporting the view that the book of Esther is to be read as a historical novella which tells a story describing historical events but is not necessarily historical fact.<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009"/> [[Edwin M. Yamauchi]] has questioned the reliability of other historical sources, such as Herodotus, to which Esther has been compared. Yamauchi wrote, “[Herodotus] was, however, the victim of unreliable informants and was not infallible.”<ref name="Yamauchi, Edwin M., 1980">"The archaeological background of Esther : archaeological backgrounds of the exilic and postexilic era, pt 2." Bibliotheca sacra 137, no. 546 (1980), 102.</ref> The reason for questioning the historical accuracy of such ancient writers as Herodotus is that he is one of the primary sources of knowledge for this time period, and it has been frequently assumed that his account may be more accurate than Esther's account.

==Historical reading==
{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
[[File:012 lrg.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''The Feast of Esther'' (''Feest van Esther'', 1625) by [[Jan Lievens]], held at the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]].]]

Those arguing in favour of an historical reading of Esther most commonly identify Ahasuerus with [[Artaxerxes II]] (ruled 405–[[359 BC|359&nbsp;BCE]]), although in the past it was often assumed that he was [[Xerxes I]] (ruled 486–[[465 BC|465&nbsp;BCE]]). The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Ahasuerus'' (''ʔaḥašwērōš'') is most likely derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Xšayārša'', the origin of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Xerxes''. The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that Xerxes sought his [[Harem (household)|harem]] after being defeated in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He makes no reference to individual members of the harem except for a domineering [[Queen consort]] named [[Amestris]], whose father, Otanes, was one of Xerxes's generals. (In contrast, the Greek historian [[Ctesias]] refers to a similar father-in-law/general figure named Onaphas.) Amestris has often been identified with [[Vashti]], but this identification is problematic, as Amestris remained a powerful figure well into the reign of her son, [[Artaxerxes I]], whereas Vashti is portrayed as dismissed in the early part of Xerxes's reign. Alternative attempts have been made to identify her with [[Esther]], although Esther is an orphan whose father was a Jew named Abihail.

As for the identity of Mordecai, the similar names ''Marduka'' and ''Marduku'' have been found as the name of officials in the Persian court in over thirty texts from the period of Xerxes I and his father Darius, and may refer to up to four individuals, one of which might after all be Mordecai.

The "Old Greek" Septuagint version of Esther translates the name Ahasuerus as ''Artaxerxes'',<ref>http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/17-esther-nets.pdf Note on two Greek versions of the book of Esther</ref> a Greek name derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Artaxšaϑra''. [[Josephus]] too relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks, and the [[Midrash]]ic text, ''Esther Rabba'' also makes the identification. [[Bar-Hebraeus]] identified Ahasuerus explicitly as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]]; however, the names are not necessarily equivalent: Hebrew has a form of the name ''Artaxerxes'' distinct from ''Ahasuerus'', and a direct Greek rendering of ''Ahasuerus'' is used by both Josephus and the Septuagint for occurrences of the name outside the Book of Esther. Instead, the Hebrew name Ahasuerus accords with an inscription of the time that notes that Artaxerxes II was named also ''Aršu'', understood as a shortening of ''Aḫšiyaršu'' the Babylonian rendering of the Persian ''Xšayārša'' (Xerxes), through which the Hebrew ''ʔaḥašwērōš'' (Ahasuerus) is derived.<ref name="Hosch">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref> [[Ctesias]] related that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' which is understood as a similar shortening with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' that is applied to shortened names. [[Deinon]] related that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Oarses'' which is also understood to be derived from ''Xšayārša''.<ref name="Hosch"/>

Another view attempts to identify him instead with [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] (ruled 465–[[424 BC|424&nbsp;BCE]]), whose Babylonian concubine, [[Kosmartydene]], was the mother of his son [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]] (ruled 424–[[405 BC|405&nbsp;BCE]]). Jewish tradition relates that Esther was the mother of a King Darius and so some try to identify Ahasuerus with Artaxerxes I and Esther with Kosmartydene.

Based on the view that the Ahasuerus of the [[Book of Tobit]] is identical with that of the Book of Esther, some have also identified him as Nebuchadnezzar's ally [[Cyaxares]] (ruled 625–[[585 BC|585&nbsp;BCE]]). In certain manuscripts of Tobit, the former is called ''Achiachar'', which, like the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Cyaxares'', is thought to be derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Huwaxšaϑra''. Depending on the interpretation of Esther 2:5–6, Mordecai or his great-grandfather Kish was carried away from [[Jerusalem]] with [[Jeconiah]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]], in [[597 BC|597&nbsp;BCE]]. The view that it was Mordecai would be consistent with the identification of Ahasuerus with Cyaxares. Identifications with other Persian monarchs have also been suggested.

Jacob Hoschander has argued that evidence of the historicity of Haman and his father Hamedatha is seen in ''Omanus'' and ''Anadatus'' mentioned by [[Strabo]] as being honoured with Anahita in the city of [[Zile|Zela]]. Hoschander argues that these were not deities as Strabo supposed but garbled forms of "Haman" and "Hamedatha" who were being worshipped as martyrs. The names are indeed unattested in Persian texts as gods, however the Talmud (''Sanhedrin'' 61b) and [[Rashi]] both record a practice of deifying Haman and Josephus speaks of him being worshipped.<ref name="Hosch"/> Attempts have been made to connect both "Omanus" and "Haman" with the Zoroastrian term [[Vohu Mana]]; however this denotes the principle of "Good Thoughts" and is not the name of a deity.)

Whenever the book was written and whatever the historicity of the events recounted in it, clearly by the time it was written the term "Yehudim" (יהודים – Jews) already gained a meaning quite close to what it means up to the present—i.e. an ethnic-religious group, scattered in many countries, organised in autonomous communities and a target of hatred.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Interpretation==
There are many classical Jewish readings of allegories into the book of Esther, mostly from Hasidic sources. They say that the literal meaning is true but that hidden behind this historical account are many allegories.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Additions to Esther==<!--[[Additions to the Book of Esther]] redirects here-->

An additional six chapters appear interspersed in Esther in the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation of the Bible. This was noted by [[Jerome]] in compiling the Latin [[Vulgate]]. Additionally, the Greek text contains many small changes in the meaning of the main text. Jerome recognized the former as additions not present in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Text]] and placed them at the end of his Latin translation as chapters 10:4–16:24. However, some modern Catholic English Bibles restore the Septuagint order, such as Esther in the [[New American Bible|NAB]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ourelement.org/blog/61-faq/141-esther-missing-sections-explanation |title=Esther: "Missing" Sections? Explanation. |date=July 7, 2010 |publisher=Element Christian Church}}</ref>

These additions include:<ref>see [http://www.usccb.org/bible/scripture.cfm?bk=Esther&ch= the NAB online] for the passages</ref>
* an opening prologue that describes a dream had by Mordecai
* the contents of the decree against the Jews
* prayers for God's intervention offered by Mordecai and by Esther
* an expansion of the scene in which Esther appears before the king, with a mention of God's intervention
* a copy of the decree in favor of the Jews
* a passage in which Mordecai interprets his dream (from the prologue) in terms of the events that followed
* a colophon appended to the end, which reads: In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and his son Ptolemy brought the present letter of Purim, saying that it was genuine and that Lysimachus, son of Ptolemy, of the community of Jerusalem, had translated it.

By the time Esther was written, the foreign power visible on the horizon as a future threat to Judah was the [[Macedon]]ians of [[Alexander the Great]], who defeated the Persian empire about 150 years after the time of the story of Esther; the [[Septuagint]] version noticeably calls Haman a "Bougaion" (βουγαῖον) where the Hebrew text describes him as an [[Agagite]].

The canonicity of these Greek additions has been a subject of scholarly disagreement practically since their first appearance in the [[Septuagint]]— [[Martin Luther]], being perhaps the most vocal [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]-era critic of the work, considered even the original Hebrew version to be of very doubtful value.<ref>Frederic W. Bush, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/esther_bush.pdf "The Book of Esther: Opus non gratum in the Christian Canon"], ''[[Bulletin for Biblical Research]]'' 8 (1998), p. 39</ref> Luther's complaints against the book carried past the point of scholarly critique and may reflect Luther's antisemitism, which is disputed, such as in the biography of Luther by Derek Wilson, which points out that Luther's anger at the Jews was not at their race but at their theology.

The [[Council of Trent]], the summation of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation]], reconfirmed the entire book, both Hebrew text and Greek additions, as canonical. The Book of Esther is used twice in commonly used sections of the Catholic [[Lectionary]]. In both cases, the text used is not only taken from a Greek addition, the readings also are the prayer of [[Mordecai]], and nothing of [[Esther]]'s own words is ever used. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] uses the Septuagint version of Esther, as it does for all of the Old Testament. The additions are specifically listed in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], Article VI, of the [[Church of England]]:<ref>[http://www.episcopalian.org/pbs1928/articles/AnglicanTeaching/041.htm Article VI: Of the sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation] {{wayback|url=http://www.episcopalian.org/pbs1928/articles/AnglicanTeaching/041.htm |date=20071110004750 }}</ref> "The rest of the Book of Esther".
