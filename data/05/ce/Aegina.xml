The legendary history of these relations, as recorded by Herodotus (v. 79-89; vi. 49-51, 73, 85-94), involves critical problems of some difficulty and interest. He traces the hostility of the two states back to a dispute about the images of the goddesses<space/><link><target>Damia (goddess)</target><part>Damia</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Auxesia</target></link>, which the Aeginetes had carried off from<space/><link><target>Epidaurus</target><part>Epidauros</part></link>, their parent state.</paragraph><paragraph>The Epidaurians had been accustomed to make annual offerings to the Athenian deities<space/><link><target>Athena</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Erechtheus</target></link><space/>in payment for the Athenian olive-wood of which the statues were made. Upon the refusal of the Aeginetes to continue these offerings, the<space/><link><target>Athenians</target></link><space/>endeavoured to carry away the images. Their design was frustrated miraculously according to the Aeginetan version, the statues fell upon their knees and only a single survivor returned to Athens. There he became victim to the fury of his comrades' widows who pierced him with their brooch-pins. No date is assigned by Herodotus for this &quot;old feud&quot;; recent writers, e.g.<space/><link><target>J. B. Bury</target></link><space/>and R. W. Macan, suggest the period between Solon and Peisistratus, circa 570 BC. It is possible that the whole episode is mythical. A critical analysis of the narrative seems to reveal little else than a series of aetiological traditions (explanatory of cults and customs), e.g. of the kneeling posture of the images of Damia and Auxesia, of the use of native ware instead of Athenian in their worship, and of the change in women's dress at Athens from the Dorian to the<space/><link><target>Ionia</target><trail>n</trail></link><space/>style.</paragraph><paragraph><link><target>File:Blouet Trzel Egine.JPG</target><part>thumb</part><part>Colour depiction of the Temple of Aphaea.</part></link><link><target>File:Greece-1172 Temple of Athena.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>The<space/><link><target>Temple of Aphaea</target></link>.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The account which Herodotus gives of the hostilities between the two states during the early years of the 5th century BC is to the following effect. The<space/><link><target>Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)</target><part>Thebans</part></link>, after the defeat by Athens about 507 BC, appealed to Aegina for assistance. The Aeginetans at first contented themselves with sending the images of the<space/><link><target>Aeacidae</target></link>, the<space/><link><target>tutelary deity</target><part>tutelary heroes</part></link><space/>of their island. Subsequently, however, they contracted an alliance, and ravaged the seaboard of Attica. The Athenians were preparing to make reprisals, in spite of the advice of the<space/><link><target>Delphic oracle</target></link><space/>that they should desist from attacking Aegina for thirty years, and content themselves meanwhile with dedicating a precinct to<space/><link><target>Aeacus</target></link>, when their projects were interrupted by the<space/><link><target>Sparta</target><trail>n</trail></link><space/>intrigues for the restoration of<space/><link><target>Hippias</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>In 491 BC Aegina was one of the states which gave the symbols of submission (&quot;earth and water&quot;) to<space/><link><target>Achaemenid Persia</target></link>. Athens at once appealed to Sparta to punish this act of<space/><link><target>medism</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Cleomenes I</target></link>, one of the Spartan kings, crossed over to the island, to arrest those who were responsible for it. His attempt was at first unsuccessful; but, after the deposition of<space/><link><target>Demaratus</target></link>, he visited the island a second time, accompanied by his new colleague<space/><link><target>Leotychides</target></link>, seized ten of the leading citizens and deposited them at Athens as hostages.</paragraph><paragraph>After the death of Cleomenes and the refusal of the Athenians to restore the hostages to Leotychides, the Aeginetans retaliated by seizing a number of Athenians at a festival at<space/><link><target>Sunium</target></link>. Thereupon the Athenians concerted a plot with<space/><link><target>Nicodromus</target></link>, the leader of the democratic party in the island, for the betrayal of Aegina. He was to seize the old city, and they were to come to his aid on the same day with seventy vessels. The plot failed owing to the late arrival of the Athenian force, when<space/><link><target>Nicodromus</target></link><space/>had already fled the island. An engagement followed in which the Aeginetans were defeated. Subsequently, however, they succeeded in winning a victory over the Athenian fleet.</paragraph><paragraph>All the incidents subsequent to the appeal of Athens to Sparta are referred expressly by Herodotus to the interval between the sending of the heralds in 491 BC and the invasion of<space/><link><target>Datis</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Artaphernes</target></link><space/>in 490 BC (cf. Herod. vi. 49 with 94).</paragraph><paragraph>There are difficulties with this story, of which the following are the principal elements:</paragraph><list type='numbered'><listitem>Herodotus nowhere states or implies that peace was concluded between the two states before 481 BC, nor does he distinguish between different wars during this period.

This inference is supported by the date of the building of the 200 triremes &quot;for the war against Aegina&quot; on the advice of<space/><link><target>Themistocles</target></link>, which is given in the<space/><italics>Constitution of Athens</italics><space/>as 483-482 BC.<extension extension_name='ref'>Herod. vii. 144;<space/><link><target>Ath.

The refusal of Aegina was in the diplomatic guise of &quot;sending the Aeacidae.&quot; The real occasion of the beginning of the war was the refusal of Athens to restore the hostages some twenty years later. There was but one war, and it lasted from 488 to 481 BC. That Athens had the worst of it in this war is certain.</paragraph><paragraph>Herodotus had no Athenian victories to record after the initial success, and the fact that Themistocles was able to carry his proposal to devote the surplus funds of the state to the building of so large a fleet seems to imply that the Athenians were themselves convinced that a supreme effort was necessary.</paragraph><paragraph>It may be noted, in confirmation of this opinion, that the naval supremacy of Aegina is assigned by the ancient writers on chronology to precisely this period, i.e. the years 490-480.<extension extension_name='ref' name="EB1911"></extension><extension extension_name='ref'><link><target>Eusebius of Caesarea</target><part>Eusebius</part></link>, Chron. Can. p.&amp;nbsp;337</extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Decline</heading><paragraph>In the repulse of<space/><link><target>Xerxes I</target></link><space/>it is possible that the Aeginetans played a larger part than is conceded to them by Herodotus. The Athenian tradition, which he follows in the main, would naturally seek to obscure their services. It was to Aegina rather than Athens that the prize of valour at Salamis was awarded, and the destruction of the Persian fleet appears to have been as much the work of the Aeginetan contingent as of the Athenian (Herod. viii. 91). There are other indications, too, of the importance of the Aeginetan fleet in the Greek scheme of defence. In view of these considerations it becomes difficult to credit the number of the vessels that is assigned to them by Herodotus (30 as against 180 Athenian vessels, cf.<space/><link><target>Greek History</target></link>, sect. Authorities). During the next twenty years the Philo-Laconian policy of<space/><link><target>Cimon</target></link><space/>secured Aegina, as a member of the Spartan league, from attack. The change in Athenian foreign policy, which was consequent upon the ostracism of Cimon in 461 BC, resulted in what is sometimes called the First Peloponnesian War, during which most of the fighting was experienced by Corinth and Aegina. The latter state was forced to surrender to Athens after a siege, and to accept the position of a subject-ally (c. 456 BC). The tribute was fixed at 30 talents.</paragraph><paragraph>By the terms of the<space/><link><target>Thirty Years' Peace</target></link><space/>(445 BC) Athens covenanted to restore to Aegina her autonomy, but the clause remained ineffective. During the first winter of the<space/><link><target>Peloponnesian War</target></link><space/>(431 BC) Athens expelled the Aeginetans and established a<space/><link><target>cleruchy</target></link><space/>in their island. The exiles were settled by Sparta in<space/><link><target>Thyreatis</target></link>, on the frontiers of Laconia and Argolis. Even in their new home they were not safe from Athenian rancour. A force commanded by<space/><link><target>Nicias</target></link><space/>landed in 424 BC, and killed most of them. At the end of the Peloponnesian War<space/><link><target>Lysander</target></link><space/>restored the scattered remnants of the old inhabitants to the island, which was used by the Spartans as a base for operations against Athens during the<space/><link><target>Corinthian War</target></link>. Its greatness, however, was at an end. The part which it plays henceforward is insignificant.</paragraph><paragraph>It would be a mistake to attribute the demise of Aegina solely to the development of the<space/><link><target>Athenian navy</target></link>. It is probable that the power of Aegina had steadily declined during the twenty years after Salamis, and that it had declined absolutely, as well as relatively to that of Athens. Commerce was the source of Aegina's greatness, and her trade, which seems to have been principally with the Levant, must have suffered seriously from the war with Persia. Aegina's medism in 491 is to be explained by its commercial relations with the Persian Empire. It was forced into patriotism in spite of itself, and the glory won by the<space/><link><target>battle of Salamis</target></link><space/>was paid for by the loss of its trade and the decay of its marine. The completeness of the ruin of so powerful a state is explained by the economic conditions of the island, the prosperity of which was based on slave-labour. It is impossible, indeed, to accept Aristotle's (cf. Athenaeus vi. 272) estimate of 470,000 as the number of the slave-population; it is clear, however, that the number must have been much greater than that of the free inhabitants.

In 1462, the Venetian Senate ordered the relic to be removed to St. Giorgio Maggiore in Venice. On 12 November, it was transported from Aegina by Vettore Cappello, the famous Venetian commander. In return, the Senate gave the Aeginetans 100<space/><link><target>ducat</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>apiece towards fortifying the island.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1519, the government was reformed.

The populace now demanded its share and the home government ordered that at least one of the three inspectors should be a non-noble.</paragraph><paragraph>Aegina had always been exposed to the raids of<space/><link><target>Privateer</target><part>corsairs</part></link><space/>and had oppressive governors during these last 30&amp;nbsp;years of Venetian rule. Venetian nobles were not willing to go to this island. In 1533, three rectors of Aegina were punished for their acts of injustice and there is a graphic account of the reception given by the Aeginetans to the captain of Nauplia, who came to command an enquiry into the administration of these delinquents (vid. inscription over the entrance of St. George the Catholic in Paliachora). The rectors had spurned their ancient right to elect an islander to keep one key of the money-chest. They had also threatened to leave the island en masse with the commissioner, unless the captain avenged their wrongs. In order to spare the economy of the community, it was ordered that appeals from the governor's decision should be made on Crete, instead of in Venice. The republic was to pay a<space/><link><target>bakshish</target></link><space/>to the Turkish governor of the Morea and to the<space/><link><target>voevode</target></link><space/>who was stationed at the frontier of Thermisi (opposite Hydra). The fortifications too, were allowed to become decrepit and were inadequately guarded.</paragraph><heading level='4'>16th century</heading><paragraph>After the end of the Duchy of Athens and the<space/><link><target>principality of Achaia</target></link>, the only Latin possessions left on the mainland of Greece were the papal city of Monemvasia, the fortress of<space/><link><target>Vonitsa</target></link>, the Messenian stations Coron and Modon, Lepanto, Pteleon, Navarino, and the castles of Argos and Nauplia, to which the island of Aegina was subordinate.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1502/03, the new peace treaty left Venice with nothing but Cephalonia, Monemvasia and Nauplia, with their appurtenances in the Morea. And against the sack of Megara, it had to endure the temporary capture of the castle of Aegina by<space/><link><target>Kemal Reis</target></link><space/>and the carrying off of 2000 Aeginetans. This treaty was renewed in 1513 and 1521. All supplies of grain from Nauplia and Monemvasia had to be imported from Turkish possessions, while corsairs rendered dangerous all traffic by sea.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1537, sultan<space/><link><target>Suleyman the Magnificent</target><part>Suleiman</part></link><space/>declared war upon Venice and his admiral<space/><link><target>Hayreddin Barbarossa</target></link><space/>devastated much of the<space/><link><target>Ionian Islands</target></link>, and in October invaded the island of Aegina.

Hayreddin Barbarossa had the adult male population massacred and took away 6000 surviving women and children as slaves. Then Barbarossa sailed to Naxos, whence he carried off an immense booty, compelling the Duke of Naxos to purchase his further independence by paying a tribute of 5000 ducats.</paragraph><paragraph>With the peace of 1540, Venice ceded Nauplia and Monemvasia.

In 1687 the Venetian army arrived in Piraeus and captured Attica. The number of the Athenians at that time exceeded 6000, the Albanians from the villages of Attica excluded, whilst in 1674 the population of Aegina did not seem to exceed 3000 inhabitants, of which were women. The Aeginetans had been reduced to poverty to pay their taxes. The most significant plague epidemic began in Attica during 1688, an occasion that caused the massive migration of Athenians toward the south; most of them settled in Aegina. In 1693 Morosini resumed command, but his only acts were to refortify the castle of Aegina, which he had demolished during the Cretan war in 1655, the cost of upkeep being paid as long as the war lasted by the Athenians, and to place it and Salamis under Malipiero as Governor. This caused the Athenians to send him a request for the renewal of Venetian protection and an offer of an annual tribute. He died in 1694 and Zeno was appointed at his place.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1699, thanks to English mediation, the war ended with the<space/><link><target>peace of Karlowitz</target></link><space/>by which Venice retained possession of the 7 Ionian islands as well as Butrinto and<space/><link><target>Parga</target></link>, the Morea,<space/><link><target>Spinalonga</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Suda</target></link>, Tenos,<space/><link><target>Santa Maura</target></link><space/>and Aegina and ceased to pay a tribute for<space/><link><target>Zante</target></link>, but which restored Lepanto to the<space/><link><target>Ottoman sultan</target></link>.<space/><link><target>Cerigo</target></link><space/>and Aegina were united administratively since the peace with Morea, which not only paid all the expenses of administration but furnished a substantial balance for the naval defence of Venice, in which it was directly interested.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Second Ottoman period (17151821)</heading><paragraph>During the early part of the<space/><link><target>OttomanVenetian War (17141718)</target><part>OttomanVenetian War of 17141718</part></link><space/>the Ottoman Fleet commanded by Canum Hoca captured Aegina.
