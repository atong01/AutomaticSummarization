CJD is caused by an agent called a [[prion]]. Prions are misfolded proteins that replicate by converting their properly folded counterparts, in their host, to the same misfolded structure they possess. CJD causes the brain tissue to degenerate rapidly, and as the disease destroys the brain, the brain develops holes and the texture changes to resemble that of a kitchen sponge.

==Classification==
Types of CJD include:
*variant (vCJD):<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ironside|first=JW|author2=Sutherland, K |author3=Bell, JE |author4=McCardle, L |author5=Barrie, C |author6=Estebeiro, K |author7=Zeidler, M |author8=Will, RG |title=A new variant of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease: neuropathological and clinical features.|journal=Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative biology|year=1996|volume=61|pages=523–30|pmid=9246478|doi=10.1101/SQB.1996.061.01.052}}</ref>

* iatrogenic: 
:This form of CJD arises from contamination with tissue from an infected person, usually as the result of a medical procedure. Medical procedures that are associated with the spread of this form of CJD include blood transfusion from the infected person, use of human-derived pituitary growth hormones,<ref name=ricketts/> gonadotropin hormone therapy,<ref name=ricketts/> corneal and/or meningeal transplants.<ref name=whoint>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs180/en/ who.int: "Fact sheets no 180: Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease" Feb 2012 ed.]</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
<!--
[[Image:http://pathology.mc.duke.edu/neuropath/CNSlecture2/cjd.jpg]] The spongiform look of the cortex cross-section is characteristic of CJD. -->
The first symptom of CJD is rapidly progressive [[dementia]], leading to [[memory]] loss, [[Personality psychology|personality]] changes, and [[hallucinations]]. Other frequently occurring features include [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[paranoia]], [[obsessive-compulsive]] symptoms, and [[psychosis]].<ref>Murray ED, Buttner N, Price BH. (2012) Depression and Psychosis in Neurological Practice. In: Neurology in Clinical Practice, 6th Edition. Bradley WG, Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J (eds.) Butterworth Heinemann. April 12, 2012. ISBN 1437704344 | ISBN 978-1437704341</ref> This is accompanied by physical problems such as [[Speech communication|speech]] impairment, jerky movements ([[myoclonus]]), balance and coordination dysfunction ([[ataxia]]), changes in [[gait (human)|gait]], rigid [[Human position|posture]], and [[seizures]]. The duration of the disease varies greatly, but sporadic (non-inherited) CJD can be fatal within months or even weeks.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In some people, the symptoms can continue for years. In most patients, these symptoms are followed by [[Dyskinesia|involuntary movements]] and the appearance of an atypical diagnostic [[electroencephalogram]] tracing. Most victims die six months after initial symptoms appear, often of [[pneumonia]] due to impaired coughing reflexes. About 15% of patients survive for two or more years.<ref name="Gambetti">{{cite web|last=Gambetti|first=Pierluigi|title=Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease (CJD)|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec06/ch090/ch090b.html|publisher=The Merck Manuals: Online Medical Library|accessdate=4/6/11}}</ref> Some patients have been known to live 4–5 years with mostly psychological symptoms until the disease progresses causing more physical symptoms leading to a diagnosis and inevitable death usually within the first year of diagnosis.

The symptoms of CJD are caused by the progressive [[cell death|death]] of the brain's [[neuron|nerve cells]], which is associated with the build-up of abnormal prion proteins forming [[amyloids]]. When brain tissue from a CJD patient is examined under a [[microscope]], many tiny holes can be seen where whole areas of nerve cells have died. The word "spongiform" in "[[transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]]" refers to the sponge-like appearance of the brain tissue.

==Cause==
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases are caused by [[prion]]s. Prions are proteins that occur normally in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). {{As of|2007}}, these proteins are thought to affect signaling processes, damaging neurons and resulting in degeneration that causes the spongiform appearance in the affected brain.<ref>{{cite book|
title = Fundamentals of Pathology
author = Sattar, Husain A.
page = 189}}</ref>

The CJD prion is dangerous because it promotes [[Protein folding|refolding]] of native proteins into the diseased state.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=AR|author2=Jackson, GS |author3=Collinge, J |title=The molecular biology of prion propagation|journal=Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences|date=Feb 28, 2001|volume=356|issue=1406|pages=185–95|pmid=11260799|doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0764|pmc=1088424}}</ref>  The number of misfolded protein molecules will increase [[exponential growth|exponentially]] and the process leads to a large quantity of insoluble protein in affected [[cell (biology)|cells]]. This mass of misfolded proteins disrupts neuronal cell function and causes cell death. Mutations in the gene for the prion protein can cause a misfolding of the dominantly alpha helical regions into beta pleated sheets. This change in conformation disables the ability of the protein to undergo digestion. Once the prion is transmitted, the defective proteins invade the brain and are produced in a self-sustaining [[feedback loop]].{{mcn|date=May 2015}}

These neurodegenerative diseases are commonly called ''[[prion disease]]s''.

People can also acquire CJD genetically through a mutation of the gene that codes for the prion protein (PRNP). This occurs in only 5-10% of all CJD cases.  An EU study determined that "87% of cases were sporadic, 8% genetic, and 5% iatrogenic." <ref>

===Transmission===
The defective protein can be transmitted by contaminated harvested human brain products,<ref>In July 2012, Greenville Memorial Hospital in South Carolina released a public warning after warning eleven other patients that a brain surgery patient was later diagnosed with CJD, and though workers sterilized instruments, the hospital stated the CJD patient's diagnosis wasn't known at the time of the surgery and it wanted to warn other patients out of an abundance of caution, noting the CDC recommendation for additional instrument cleaning when CJD is suspected.

[[Cannibalism]] has also been implicated as a transmission mechanism for abnormal prions, causing the disease known as [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], once found primarily among women and children of the [[Fore people]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. While the men of the tribe ate the body of the deceased and rarely contracted the disease, the women and children, who ate the less desirable body parts, including the brain, were eight times more likely than men to contract kuru from infected tissue.

Prions, the [[infectious agent]] of CJD, may not be inactivated by means of routine [[surgical instrument]] [[Autoclave|sterilization]] procedures. The [[World Health Organization]] and the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommend that instrumentation used in such cases be immediately destroyed after use; short of destruction, it is recommended that heat and chemical decontamination be used in combination to process instruments that come in contact with high-infectivity tissues. No cases of iatrogenic transmission of CJD have been reported subsequent to the adoption of current sterilization procedures, or since 1976.<ref>{{cite web|title =Questions and Answers: Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Infection-Control Practices|work =Infection Control Practices/CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Classic)|publisher =Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date =January 4, 2007|url = http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/cjd/qa_cjd_infection_control.htm#sterilization|accessdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =WHO Infection Control Guidelines for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies|publisher =World Health Organization: Communicable Disease Surveillance and Control|date =26 March 1999|url =http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/bse/WHO_CDS_CSR_APH_2000_3/en/|accessdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

On May 28, 2002, the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] instituted a policy that excludes from donation anyone having spent at least six months in certain European countries (or three months in the United Kingdom) from 1980 to 1996. Given the large number of U.S. military personnel and their dependents residing in Europe, it was expected that over 7% of donors would be deferred due to the policy. Later changes to this policy have relaxed the restriction to a cumulative total of five years or more of civilian travel in European countries (six months or more if military). The three-month restriction on travel to the UK, however, has not been changed.<ref name="titleIn-Depth Discussion of Variant Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease and Blood Donation">{{cite web

The [[American Red Cross]]' policy is as follows: During the period January 1, 1980, to December 31, 1996, spending a total time of three months or more in the [[Channel Islands]], [[England]], the [[Falkland Islands]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]] precludes individuals from donating. Moreover, spending a total time of five years or more after January 1, 1980 (to present), in the above-mentioned countries and/or any country in Europe (except the former USSR), also precludes donation. People with a biologic relative having been diagnosed with CJD or vCJD are unable to donate. Biologic relative in this setting means mother, father, sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or child.

A similar policy applies to potential donors to the [[Australian Red Cross]]' [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service|Blood Service]], precluding people who have spent a cumulative time of six months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996.

The [[Singapore Red Cross]] precludes potential donors having spent a cumulative time of three months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996.

In New Zealand, the [[New Zealand Blood Service]] (NZBS) in 2000 introduced measures to preclude permanently donors having resided in the United Kingdom (including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) for a total of six months or more between January 1980 and December 1996. The measure resulted in ten percent of New Zealand's active blood donors at the time becoming ineligible to donate blood. In 2003, the NZBS further extended restrictions to preclude permanently donors having had received a blood transfusion in the United Kingdom since January 1980, and in April 2006, restrictions were further extended to include the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[France]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/620/3988/file/CJD%20Information%20Leaflet%20111I077.pdf |title= CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) - Information for blood donors |publisher= New Zealand Blood Service |accessdate= 20 July 2012}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of CJD is suspected when there are typical clinical symptoms and signs such as rapidly progressing dementia with startle [[myoclonus]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Sattar|first=Hussain A. |title=Fundamentals of Pathology|accessdate=3 September 2014|publisher=Pathoma LLC.|location=Chicago |page=187 }}</ref> Further investigation can then be performed to support the diagnosis including
* [[Electroencephalography]]&mdash; often has characteristic generalized periodic sharp wave pattern (~80% of pts by 6 months){{mcn|date=May 2015}}
* [[Cerebrospinal fluid]] analysis for [[14-3-3 protein]]
* [[MRI]] of the brain&mdash;often shows high signal intensity in the caudate nucleus and putamen bilaterally on T2-weighted images.
* Research in 2010 and 2011 identified a possible blood test for CJD. The test attempts to identify the prion responsible for the disease. However, it has not yet been demonstrated if it is able to detect the prions in early stages of the disease.<ref name="MSNBC Rettner">{{cite news |title = Blood test may screen for human form of mad cow |author=Rachael Rettner |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41406612/ns/health-infectious_diseases/ |publisher = [[MSNBC]] |date = 2011-02-03 |accessdate = 2011-02-09}}</ref>

Clinical testing for CJD has always been an issue. Diagnosis has been based mostly on clinical and physical examination of symptoms. In recent years, studies have shown that the tumour marker [[Neuron-specific enolase]] (NSE) is often elevated in CJD cases, however its diagnostic utility is seen primarily when combined with a test for the [[14-3-3 protein]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000230159.67128.00 |title=CSF tests in the differential diagnosis of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease |author=Sanchez–Juan, P., Green, A., Ladogana, A.|year=2006 |journal=Neurology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=637–643 |pmid=16924018|display-authors=etal}}</ref> {{As of|2010}}, screening tests to identify infected asymptomatic individuals, such as blood donors, are not yet available, though methods have been proposed and evaluated.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02731.x|title=A highly sensitive immunoassay for the detection of prion-infected material in whole human blood without the use of proteinase K|author=Tattum, M.

In 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> even when initially present at only one part in one hundred billion (10<sup>−11</sup>) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called [[surround optical fiber immunoassay]] (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so that it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artefacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals’ brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. The researchers could therefore compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals’ lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> could be detected in the blood of animals long before the symptoms appeared. After further development and testing, this method could be of 
great value in surveillance as a blood or urine-based screening test for CJD.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Detecting Prions in Blood |journal=Microbiology Today |pages=195 |date=August 2010 |url= https://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/081010.pdf |accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bionosis.com/news/Bionosis%20PrioNet%20Poster.pdf |title=SOFIA: An Assay Platform for Ultrasensitive Detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in Brain and Blood |publisher= [[SUNY Downstate Medical Center]] |authorlink=Rubenstein, R., et al. |accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref> In 2014 a human study showed a nasal brushing method that can accurately detect PrP in the olfactory epithelial of CJD patients. .<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1315200|title=A test for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease using nasal brushings.|author=Orrú, C.D., Bongianni, M., Tonoli, G., Ferrari, S., Hughson, A.G., Groveman, B.R., Fiorini, M., Pocchiari, M., Monaco, S., Caughey, B., Zanusso, G. |date=August 2014|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=371|pages=530–9|issue=6|pmid=25099576}}</ref>

[[Image:SpongiformChangeCJD.jpg|thumbnail|right|Spongiform change in CJD]]
The classic [[histologic]] appearance is spongiform change in the gray matter: the presence of many round vacuoles from one to 50 micrometres in the [[neuropil]], in all six cortical layers in the cerebral cortex or with diffuse involvement of the cerebellar molecular layer. These vacuoles appear glassy or eosinophilic and may coalesce. Neuronal loss and gliosis are also seen.<ref>{{cite web|title=CNS Degenerative Diseases|url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/CNS/CNSDG.html}}</ref> Plaques of amyloid-like material can be seen in the neocortex in new-variant CJD.

However, [[vacuolization]] can be seen in other disease states. Diffuse cortical vacuolization occurs in [[Alzheimer's]], and superficial cortical vacuolization occurs in [[ischemia]] and [[frontotemporal dementia]]. These vacuoles appear clear and punched-out. Larger vacuoles encircling neurons, vessels, and [[glia]] are a possible processing artifact.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Treatment==
{{As of|2015}}, no generally accepted treatment for CJD exists; the disease is invariably fatal and research continues. An experimental treatment was given to a Northern [[Irish people|Irish]] teenager, Jonathan Simms, beginning in January 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=Teenager with vCJD 'stable'' |publisher=BBC News |date=13 December 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4092363.stm |accessdate=2007-01-01 |location=London}}</ref> The medication, called [[pentosan polysulphate]] (PPS) and used to treat [[interstitial cystitis]], is infused into the patient's [[ventricular system|lateral ventricle]] within the brain.

Both [[amphotericin B]] and [[doxorubicin]] have been investigated as potentially effective against CJD, but as yet there is no strong evidence that either drug is effective in stopping the disease. Further study has been taken with other medical drugs, but none are effective. However, drugs to reduce suffering do exist, and include [[valproate]], an anticonvulsant agent, [[clonazepam]] and [[benzodiazepine]], to reduce muscle jerks.<ref name="Gambetti"/>

Scientists from the [[University of California, San Francisco]] are currently running a [http://memory.ucsf.edu/cjd/research/current/quinacrine treatment trial for sporadic CJD] using [[quinacrine]], a medicine originally created for [[malaria]]. Pilot studies showed quinacrine permanently cleared abnormal prion proteins from cell cultures, but results have not yet been published on their clinical study. The efficacy of quinacrine was also assessed in a rigorous clinical trial in the UK and the results were published in Lancet Neurology,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Collinge|first=J|author2=Gorham, M |author3=Hudson, F |author4=Kennedy, A |author5=Keogh, G |author6=Pal, S |author7=Rossor, M |author8=Rudge, P |author9=Siddique, D |author10=Spyer, M |author11=Thomas, D |author12=Walker, S |author13=Webb, T |author14=Wroe, S |author15=Darbyshire, J |title=Safety and efficacy of quinacrine in human prion disease (PRION-1 study): a patient-preference trial|journal=Lancet neurology|date=April 2009|volume=8|issue=4|pages=334–44|pmid=19278902|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70049-3|pmc=2660392}}</ref>

In a 2013 paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists from The [[Scripps Research Institute]] reported that [[Astemizole]], a medication approved for human use, has been found to have anti-prion activity and may lead to a treatment for Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.<ref name="Karapetyan2013">{{cite journal|last= Karapetyan |first= Yervand Eduard |author2=Gian Franco Sferrazza |author3=Minghai Zhou |author4=Gregory Ottenberg |author5=Timothy Spicer |author6=Peter Chase |author7=Mohammad Fallahi |author8=Peter Hodder |author9=Charles Weissmann |author10=Corinne Ida Lasmézas  |title= Unique drug screening approach for prion diseases identifies tacrolimus and astemizole as antiprion agents |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year= 2013 |url= http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/03/29/1303510110.abstract |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1303510110 | laysummary = http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2013/20130403lasmezas.html |laysource= Scripps Research Institute News Release |laydate = April 3, 2013|volume= 110|issue= 17|pages= 7044–7049}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Global mad cow cases map.PNG|thumb|450px|Dark green areas are countries that have confirmed human cases of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and light green are countries that have bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases.]]
Although CJD is the most common human [[prion disease]], it is still rare, occurring in about one out of every one million people every year. It usually affects people aged 45–75, most commonly appearing in people between the ages of 60–65. The exception to this is the more recently recognised 'variant' CJD (vCJD), which occurs in younger people.

[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] monitors the occurrence of CJD in the United States through periodic reviews of national mortality data. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]:
* CJD occurs worldwide at a rate of about 1 case per million population per year.
* On the basis of mortality surveillance from 1979 to 1994, the annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of CJD remained stable at approximately 1 case per [[million]] persons in the United States.
* In the United States, CJD deaths among persons younger than 30 years of age are extremely rare (fewer than five deaths per [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] per year<ref name="CDC1"/><ref name="VCJD1">{{cite web

</ref>).
* The disease is found most frequently in patients 55–65 years of age, but cases can occur in people older than 90 years and younger than 55 years of age.
* In more than 85% of cases, the duration of CJD is less than 1 year (median: four months) after onset of symptoms.<ref name="CDC1"/><ref name="VCJD1" />

===Additional concerns===
In ''[[The Lancet]]'' (June 2006), a University College London team suggested that it may take more than 50 years for vCJD to develop, from their studies of [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], a similar disease in [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref name="titleForbes.com"/> The reasoning behind the claim is that kuru was possibly transmitted through [[cannibalism]] in Papua New Guinea when family members would eat the body of a dead relative as a sign of [[mourning]]. In the 1950s, cannibalism was banned in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=Diamond>{{cite journal

</ref>
In the late 20th century, however, kuru reached epidemic proportions in certain Papua New Guinean communities, therefore suggesting that vCJD may also have a similar [[incubation period]] of 20 to 50 years. A critique to this theory is that while mortuary cannibalism was banned in Papua New Guinea in the 1950s, that does not necessarily mean that the practice ended. 15 years later [[Jared Diamond]] was informed by [[Papuans]] that the practice continued.<ref name=Diamond/> Kuru may have passed to the [[Fore people]] through the preparation of the dead body for burial.  Some cite this as substantiation for the belief that cannibalism transmits some metaphysical part of the meal to the diner.

These researchers noticed a genetic variation in some kuru patients that has been known to promote long [[incubation period]]s. They have also proposed that individuals having contracted CJD in the early 1990s represent a distinct genetic subpopulation, with unusually short incubation periods for [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE). This means that there may be many more vCJD patients with longer incubation periods, which may surface many years later.<ref name="titleForbes.com">{{cite journal

==History==
The disease was first described by German [[neurologist]] [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]] in 1920 and shortly afterward by [[Alfons Maria Jakob]], giving it the name Creutzfeldt&ndash;Jakob. Some of the clinical findings described in their first papers do not match current criteria for Creutzfeldt&ndash;Jakob disease, and it has been speculated that at least two of the patients in initial studies were suffering from a different ailment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} An early description of familial CJD stems from the German psychiatrist and neurologist [[Friedrich Meggendorfer]] (1880–1953).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Meggendorfer F | year = 1930 | title = Klinische und genealogische Beobachtungen bei einem Fall von spastischer Pseudokosklerose Jakobs | url = | journal = Z Neurol Psychiatry | volume = 128 | issue = | pages = 337–41 | doi=10.1007/bf02864269}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 14522861 | volume=66 | title=Sporadic and familial CJD: classification and characterisation | year=2003 | author=Gambetti P, Kong Q, Zou W, Parchi P, Chen SG | journal=Br.

The first report of suspected [[iatrogenic]] CJD was published in 1974. Animal experiments showed that corneas of infected animals could transmit CJD, and the causative agent spreads along visual pathways. A second case of CJD associated with a corneal transplant was reported without details. In 1977, CJD transmission caused by silver electrodes previously used in the brain of a person with CJD was first reported. Transmission occurred despite decontamination of the electrodes with ethanol and formaldehyde. Retrospective studies identified four other cases likely of similar cause. The rate of transmission from a single contaminated instrument is unknown, although it is not 100%. In some cases the exposure occurred weeks after the instruments were used on a person with CJD.<ref name=ricketts/>

A review article published in 1979 indicated that 25 dura mater cases had occurred by that date in Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<ref name=ricketts/>

By 1985, a series of case reports in the United States showed that when injected, cadaver-extracted pituitary [[human growth hormone]] could transmit CJD to humans.<ref name=ricketts/>

In 1992 it was recognized that human [[gonadotropin]] administered by injection could also transmit CJD from person to person.<ref name=ricketts/>

In 2004, a report published by Edinburgh doctors in the ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' medical journal demonstrated that vCJD was transmitted by [[blood transfusion]].<ref name="pmid15302196"/>

===Australia===
Four Australians had been reported with CJD following transfusion as of 1997.<ref name=ricketts/>  There have been ten cases of healthcare-acquired CJD in Australia. They consist of five deaths following treatment with pituitary extract hormone for either infertility or short stature, with no further cases since 1991. The five other deaths were caused by dura grafting during brain surgery, where the covering of the brain was repaired. There have been no other known healthcare-acquired CJD deaths in Australia.<ref>[http://ideas.health.vic.gov.au/diseases/cjd-facts.asp Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) - the facts - Infectious Diseases Epidemiology & Surveillance - Department of Health, Victoria, Australia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===New Zealand===
A case was reported in 1989 in a 25-year-old man from New Zealand, who also received [[dura mater]] transplant.<ref name=ricketts/> Five New Zealanders have been confirmed to have died of the sporadic form of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in 2012.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/7962582/ Mad cow link in hunter's death | Stuff.co.nz<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Researchers believe one in 2,000 people in the UK is a carrier of the disease linked to eating contaminated beef (vCJD).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24525584 | work=BBC News | title=Estimate doubled for vCJD carriers in UK | date=2013-10-15}}</ref> The survey provides the most robust prevalence measure to date—and identifies abnormal prion protein across a wider age group than found previously and in all genotypes, indicating "infection" may be relatively common. This new study examined over 32,000 anonymous appendix samples. Of these, 16 samples were positive for abnormal prion protein, indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population, or one in 2,000 people are likely to be carriers. No difference was seen in different birth cohorts (1941–60 and 1961–85), in both sexes, and there was no apparent difference in abnormal prion prevalence in three broad geographical areas. Genetic testing of the 16 positive samples revealed a higher proportion of valine homozygous (VV) genotype on the codon 129 of the gene encoding the prion protein (PRNP) compared with the general UK population. This also differs from the 177 patients with vCJD, all of whom to date have been methionine homozygous (MM) genotype. The concern is that individuals with this VV genotype may be susceptible to developing the condition over longer incubation periods, or they may not show any clinical signs of disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gill|first=Noel|title=Prevalent abnormal prion protein in human appendixes after bovine spongiform encephalopathy epizootic: large scale survey|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/doi/10.1136/bmj.f5675|work=British Medical Journal |accessdate=27 December 2013|doi=10.1136/bmj.f5675|volume=347|pages=f5675}}</ref>

===United States===
In 1988, there was a confirmed death from CJD of a person from [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]. [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] believed the patient acquired the disease from a surgical instrument at a [[podiatrist]]'s office.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In September 2013, another patient in Manchester was posthumously determined to have died of the disease. The patient had undergone brain surgery at [[Catholic Medical Center]] three months before his death, and a surgical probe used in the procedure was subsequently reused in other operations. Public health officials identified thirteen patients at three hospitals who may have been exposed to the disease through the contaminated probe, but said the risk of anyone's contracting CJD is "extremely low."<ref>{{cite web|title=Autopsy confirms rare brain disease in NH patient|url=http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/23489308/2013/09/20/autopsy-confirms-rare-brain-disease-in-nh-patient|publisher=MyFoxBoston|accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NH PATIENT LIKELY DIED OF RARE BRAIN DISEASE|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/surgical-gear-quarantined-over-rare-brain-disease|publisher=AP|accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=globe>{{cite news|last=Kowalczyk |first=Liz |title=5 patients at Cape hospital at risk for rare brain disease |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/09/05/cape-cod-hospital-patients-possibly-exposed-brain-disease/CwGauqzFxf6Om8agTvUoAJ/story.html |work=Boston Globe |accessdate=25 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130909210818/http://www.boston.com:80/news/local/massachusetts/2013/09/05/cape-cod-hospital-patients-possibly-exposed-brain-disease/CwGauqzFxf6Om8agTvUoAJ/story.html |archivedate=9 September 2013 }}</ref> In 2008, a man in Germantown, Wisconsin died of CJD within four months of finding first symptoms.
