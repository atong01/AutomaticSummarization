There was a huge outcry in Constance when it was discovered that John had fled, and Sigismund was furious about this setback to his plans for ending the Schism. The King of the Romans issued orders to all the powers on the Upper Rhine and in Swabia stating that he had declared Frederick to be an outlaw and that his lands and possessions were forfeit. In due course this led to a great deal of political upheaval and many Austrian losses in the region, notably in<space/><link><target>Aargau</target></link><space/>to the Swiss Confederation.</paragraph><paragraph>In the meantime, Pope John XXIII and Frederick fled further downriver along the Rhine to the town of<space/><link><target>Freiburg im Breisgau</target></link>, which recognised the duke of Austria as its lord.
