This was the context to the ad hominem of ‘chardonnay socialist’ that was extended to any Labor speaker and to the whole ALP in an attempt to undermine their ethos through associations with self-indulgence, selfishness and lack of concern for the people. Frequent deployment of these terms by the media provided a further convincing context for this rhetoric. Kim Carr was called a ‘Bollinger Bolshevik’ by Vanstone (Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates [CPD], Senate, 13 May 1997) and there was ‘Chardonnay Cheryl’ Kernot, the ‘shadow minister for the selfish “me generation” yuppies’ with her ‘list of hors d’oeuvres for the next caucus radical chic soiree’, said Richard Alston (CPD, Senate, 4 March 1998; 23 March 1998; 30 March 1998). She could be seen with Mark Latham, said David Kemp, ‘on the patio sipping their wine, complaining about the excesses of capitalism’ (CPD, Senate, 22 October 1997).</arg></template></extension></paragraph><paragraph>The older term for this or a similar kind of person was &quot;salon communist.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>Other similar terms are the &quot;<link><target>chattering classes</target></link>&quot; (coined in England in the 1980s) and &quot;<link><target>latte</target></link><space/>liberal&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Byrnes"><template><target>cite journal</target><arg name="last"><space/>Byrnes</arg><arg name="first"><space/>Andrew</arg><arg name="authorlink"><space/></arg><arg name="coauthors"><space/></arg><arg name="year"><space/></arg><arg name="month"><space/></arg><arg name="title"><space/>Law, Lawyers and Lattes: The (Ir)relevance of the Chattering Classes in a Time of Insecurity: Law Week Lecture 29 March 2006</arg><arg name="journal"><space/>University of New South Wales Faculty of Law Research Series</arg><arg name="volume"><space/>2007</arg><arg name="issue">6<space/></arg><arg name="pages"><space/></arg><arg name="id"><space/></arg><arg name="url"><space/>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLRS/2007/6.html</arg><arg name="accessdate">2008-09-11<space/></arg><arg name="quote"><space/>The political origins and the use of terms such as the ‘chattering classes’ -- and its close friends ‘chardonnay socialist’ and ‘latte liberal’ – have been carefully analysed by Australian and overseas scholars of political science. They locate the origins of the term ‘chattering classes’ in England of the early 1980s and its use as a common derogatory term against political opponents to the time of Margaret Thatcher, and trace its emergence in Australia in the form of an anti-elitist discourse (‘new class’ discourse) which takes on those members of elites identified as members of the ‘chattering classes’.<space/></arg></template></extension></paragraph><heading level='2'>See also</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link><target>Bourgeois bohemian</target></link>,<space/><link><target>radical chic</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>limousine liberal</target></link>, United States</listitem><listitem><link><target>Champagne socialist</target></link>, also known as a Bollinger bolshevik</listitem><listitem><link><target>Gauche caviar</target></link>, France</listitem><listitem><link><target>Gucci socialist</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Left-wing politics</target></link></listitem><listitem><link><target>Liberal elite</target></link></listitem></list><heading level='2'>References</heading><paragraph><template><target>Reflist</target><arg>2</arg></template></paragraph><heading level='2'>External links</heading><list type='bullet'><listitem><link type='external' href='http://users.cyberone.com.au/myers/wittfogel2.html'>The Case Against Wittfogel</link><space/>- &quot;Salon bolshevik&quot;</listitem></list><paragraph><template><target>Use dmy dates</target><arg name="date">May 2011</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph><template><target>DEFAULTSORT:Chardonnay Socialist</target></template><link><target>Category:Socialism</target></link><link><target>Category:Political terminology in Australia</target></link><link><target>Category:New Zealand slang</target></link><link><target>Category:Political metaphors referring to people</target></link><link><target>Category:Metaphors referring to food and drink</target></link></paragraph><paragraph><link><target>el:Gauche caviar</target></link><link><target>es:Izquierda caviar</target></link><link><target>fr:Gauche caviar</target></link><link><target>nl:Salonsocialist</target></link><link><target>pt:Gauche caviar</target></link><link><target>sv:Gauche caviar</target></link></paragraph></article>
