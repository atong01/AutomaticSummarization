==Biography==
[[File:Polish sci fi fantasy books.JPG|thumb|upright|Sapkowski [[novel]]s on display in a [[Poland|Polish]] [[bookstore]]]]
Sapkowski studied economics, and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. He started his literary career as a translator, in particular, of science fiction. He says he wrote his first [[short story]], "[[The Witcher]]" ("Wiedźmin",also translated "The Hexer" or "Spellmaker") on a whim, in order to enter a contest by Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine ''[[Fantastyka]]''. Being an expert in marketing{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}, he says he knew how to sell, and indeed, he won the 3rd prize.<ref>[http://www.mirf.ru/Articles/art934.htm http://www.mirf.ru/Articles/art934.htm НО МЫ ЖЕ СЛАВЯНЕ! РАЗГОВОР С АНДЖЕЕМ САПКОВСКИМ], An interview with Sapkowski for Russian monthly magazine "World of Fatnastics"</ref> The story was published in ''Fantastyka'' in 1986 and  was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a [[Novel sequence|cycle of tales]] based on the world of "The Witcher", comprising three collections of short stories and five novels. This cycle and his many other works have made him one of the best-known [[fantasy author]]s in Poland in the 1990s.<ref name=mo/>

The main character of "The Witcher" is [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], a [[mutant]] hunter who has been trained since childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s signature character [[Philip Marlowe]].<ref name=mo>{{pl icon}} Marek Oramus ''[http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/jedynie-sluszny-wizerunek-wiedzmina,365834.html Jedynie słuszny wizerunek wiedźmina]'',  Polityka – nr 36 (2261) from 2000-09-02; pp. 52–54</ref> The world in which these adventures take place is heavily influenced by [[Slavic mythology]].<ref>''[http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Andrzej-Sapkowski/The-Last-Wish.html The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski ]'', fantasybookreview</ref>

Sapkowski has won five [[Janusz A. Zajdel Award|Zajdel Award]]s, including three for short stories "Mniejsze zło" ("Lesser Evil") (1990), "Miecz przeznaczenia" ("Sword of Destiny") (1992) and "W leju po bombie" ("In a Bomb Crater") (1993), and two for the novels, ''[[Krew elfów]]'' (''Blood of Elves'') (1994) and [[Narrenturm (novel)|''Narrenturm'']] (2002).  He also won the Spanish [[Ignotus Award]], best anthology, for ''The Last Wish'' in 2003, and for ''Muzykanci'' (''The Musicians''), best foreign short story, same year.

In 1997, Sapkowski won the prestigious [[Polityka's Passport]] award,<ref name="libraryThing">{{cite web

In 2001, a [[The Hexer (TV series)|television series]] based on the ''Witcher'' cycle was released in Poland and internationally, entitled ''Wiedźmin'' (''The Hexer''). A [[The Hexer (film)|film by the same title]] was compiled from excerpts of the television series but both have been critical and box office failures.

Sapkowski's books have been translated into Czech, Hungarian, Russian, Lithuanian, German, Spanish, French, Ukrainian, Portuguese, Finnish, Slovak, Bulgarian, Serbian, English, Italian, Dutch, Estonian and Swedish.
