== Historical perspective ==

=== Middle Ages ===
Elements of unity for Western and Central Europe were [[Roman Catholicism]] and Latin. Eastern Europe, which remained [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]], was the area of Byzantine cultural influence; after the schism (1054), it will develop cultural unity and resistance to the Western world (Catholic and Protestant) within the framework of Slavonic language and the Cyrillic alphabet.<ref name="Magocsi">{{cite book |title=Historical Atlas of Central Europe |author=Paul Robert Magocsi |publisher=University of Toronto Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XoxHdcNYhiMC&q=%22development+of+Central+Europe%22#v=snippet&q=%22development%20of%20Central%20Europe%22&f=false |isbn=0802084869 |chapter=The development of Central Europe (Chapter 11) |year=2002 }}</ref><ref name="Greyerz">{{cite book |title=Religion and Culture in Early Modern Europe |author=Kasper von Greyerz |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmEpMnfYZ-oC&q=%22all+of+central+Europe%22#v=snippet&q=%22all%20of%20central%20Europe%22&f=false |isbn=0198043848 |page=38 &ndash; |date=2007-10-22 }}</ref><ref name="Sedlar">{{cite book |title=East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000-1500 |author=Jean W Sedlar |publisher=University of Washington Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3o5lrvuwOVwC&q=%22estrangement+to+be+permanent%22#v=snippet&q=%22estrangement%20to%20be%20permanent%22&f=false |isbn=0295972912 |page=161 &ndash; |year=1994 }}</ref><ref name="shape of europe"/>

According to Hungarian historian [[Jenő Szűcs]], foundations of Central European history at the first millennium were in close connection with Western European development. He explained that between the 11th and 15th centuries not only Christianization and its cultural consequences were implemented, but well-defined social features emerged in Central Europe based on Western characteristics. The keyword of Western social development after millennium was the spread of liberties and autonomies in Western Europe. These phenomena appeared in the middle of the 13th century in Central European countries. There were self-governments of towns, counties and parliaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/1162/1/Zsinka_2013b.pdf|author=László Zsinka|title=Similarities and Differences in Polish and Hungarian History|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

In 1335 under the rule of the King [[Charles I of Hungary]], the castle of [[Visegrád]], the seat of the [[King of Hungary|Hungarian monarchs]] was the scene of the royal summit of the [[King of Poland|Kings of Poland]], [[King of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and Hungary.<ref name=Halman/> They agreed to cooperate closely in the field of politics and commerce, inspiring their late successors to launch a successful [[Visegrád Group|Central European initiative]].<ref name=Halman>{{cite book|last=Halman|first=Loek|author2=Wilhelmus Antonius Arts|title=European values at the turn of the millennium|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2004|page=120|isbn=978-90-04-13981-7}}</ref>

In the Middle Ages, countries in Central Europe adopted [[Magdeburg rights]].

=== Before World War I ===
[[File:Central Europe 1902.PNG|thumb|left|A view of Central Europe dating from the time before the [[First World War]] (1902):<ref>Source: Geographisches Handbuch zu [[Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas|Andrees Handatlas]], vierte Auflage, Bielefeld und Leipzig, Velhagen und Klasing, 1902.</ref> {{legend|#FF0000|Central European countries and regions: Germany and Austria-Hungary (without Bosnia-Herzegovina and Dalmatia)}}{{legend|#FB607F|Regions located at the transition between Central Europe and Southern Europe: Romania}}]]
Before 1870, the industrialization that had developed in Western and Central Europe and the United States did not extend in any significant way to the rest of the world. Even in [[Eastern Europe]], industrialization lagged far behind. [[Russia]], for example, remained largely rural and agricultural, and its autocratic rulers kept the peasants in serfdom.<ref>Jackson J. Spielvogel: ''Western Civilization: Alternate Volume: Since 1300''. p. 618.</ref>
The concept of Central Europe was already known at the beginning of the 19th century,<ref name="essex.ac.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/events/graduateconference/barcelona/papers/681.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217051750/http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/events/graduateconference/barcelona/papers/681.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-17 |title="Mitteleuropa" is a multi-facetted concept and difficult to handle |format=PDF |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> but its real life began in the 20th century and immediately became an object of intensive interest. However, the very first concept mixed science, politics and economy – it was strictly connected with intensively growing German economy and its aspirations to dominate a part of European continent called ''Mitteleuropa''. The German term denoting Central Europe was so fashionable that other languages started referring to it when indicating territories from [[Rhine]] to [[Vistula]], or even [[Dnieper]], and from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Balkans]].<ref>A. Podraza, ''Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny'', 17th Congress of Polish Historians, [[Jagiellonian University]] 2004</ref> An example of that-time vision of Central Europe may be seen in J. Partsch’s book of 1903.<ref>Joseph Franz Maria Partsch, Clementina Black, Halford John Mackinder, ''Central Europe'', New York 1903</ref>

On 21 January 1904 – ''Mitteleuropäischer Wirtschaftsverein'' (Central European Economic Association) was established in [[Berlin]] with economic integration of Germany and Austria–Hungary (with eventual extension to [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]) as its main aim. Another time, the term Central Europe became connected to the German plans of political, economic and cultural domination. The "bible" of the concept was [[Friedrich Naumann]]’s book ''Mitteleuropa''<ref>F. Naumann, ''Mitteleuropa'', Berlin: Reimer, 1915</ref> in which he called for an economic federation to be established after the war. Naumann's idea was that the federation would have at its center Germany and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] but would also include all European nations outside the Anglo-French alliance, on one side, and Russia, on the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11015/Regions-Regionalism-Eastern-Europe-Central-versus-Eastern-Europe.html |title=Regions and Eastern Europe Regionalism – Central Versus Eastern Europe |publisher=Science.jrank.org |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> The concept failed after the German defeat in [[World War I]] and the [[Austria–Hungary#Dissolution|dissolution of Austria–Hungary]]. The revival of the idea may be observed during the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler era]].

=== Interwar period ===

According to [[Emmanuel de Martonne]], in 1927 the Central European countries included: Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Switzerland. Italy and Yugoslavia are not considered by the author to be Central European because they are located mostly outside Central Europe. The author use both Human and Physical Geographical features to define Central Europe.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img73.imageshack.us/img73/5269/file0039ao0.jpg ], [http://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4384/martonne1.jpg ] and [http://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/1867/martonne2a.jpg]; ''Géographie universelle'' (1927), edited by [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] and [[Lucien Gallois]]</ref>

The [[interwar period]] (1918–1939) brought new geopolitical system and economic and political problems, and the concept of Central Europe took a different character. The centre of interest was moved to its eastern part – the countries that have (re)appeared on the map of Europe: [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]]. Central Europe ceased to be the area of German aspiration to lead or dominate and became a territory of various integration movements aiming at resolving political, economic and national problems of "new" states, being a way to face German and Soviet pressures. However, the conflict of interests was too big and neither [[Little Entente]] nor [[Intermarium]] (''Międzymorze'') ideas succeeded.

The interwar period brought new elements to the concept of Central Europe. Before World War I, it embraced mainly German states (Germany, [[Austria]]), non-German territories being an area of intended German penetration and domination – German leadership position was to be the natural result of economic dominance.<ref name="essex.ac.uk"/> After the war, the Eastern part of Central Europe was placed at the centre of the concept. At that time the scientists took interest in the idea: the International Historical Congress in [[Brussels]] in 1923 was committed to Central Europe, and the 1933 Congress continued the discussions.<ref name="ehr.oxfordjournals.org">{{cite journal|last1=Deak|first1=I. |title=The Versailles System and Central Europe|doi=10.1093/ehr/cej100 |page=338|volume=CXXI |year=2006 |journal=The English Historical Review|issue=490}}</ref>

Hungarian scholar Magda Adam wrote in her study ''Versailles System and Central Europe'' (2006): "Today we know that the bane of Central Europe was the [[Little Entente]], military alliance of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), created in 1921 not for Central Europe's cooperation nor to fight German expansion, but in a wrong perceived notion that a completely powerless Hungary must be kept down".<ref name="ehr.oxfordjournals.org"/>

The avant-garde movements of Central Europe were an essential part of modernism’s evolution, reaching its peak throughout the continent during the 1920s. The ''Sourcebook of Central European avantgards'' (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) contains primary documents of the avant-gardes in [[Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] from 1910 to 1930.<ref name="Between Worlds – The MIT Press">{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=8958 |title=Between Worlds – The MIT Press |publisher=Mitpress.mit.edu |accessdate=31 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060922195357/https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=8958 |archivedate=22 September 2006 }}</ref> The manifestos and magazines of Western European radical art circles are well known to Western scholars and are being taught at primary universities of their kind in the western world.

=== Mitteleuropa ===
[[File:Grossgliederung Europas-en.svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Mitteleuropa]]'': [[Austria|AT]], [[Croatia|CRO]], [[Czech Republic|CZ]], [[Germany|GER]], [[Hungary|HUN]], [[Poland|POL]], [[Slovakia|SVK]], [[Slovenia|SLO]], [[Baltic states|EST/LAT/LTV]], large parts of [[Romania|ROM]], minor parts of [[France|FRA]], [[Italy|ITA]], [[Russia|RUS]], [[Serbia|SRB]], [[Ukraine|UA]]]]
The German term ''[[Mitteleuropa]]'' (or alternatively its literal translation into English, ''Middle Europe''<ref name="Johnson, p. 165">Johnson, p. 165</ref>) is an ambiguous German concept.<ref name="Johnson, p. 165"/> It is sometimes used in English to refer to an area somewhat larger than most conceptions of 'Central Europe'; it refers to territories under Germanic [[cultural hegemony]] until World War I (encompassing Austria–Hungary and Germany in their pre-war formations but usually excluding the [[Baltic countries]] north of [[East Prussia]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} According to [[Fritz Fischer]] ''Mitteleuropa'' was a scheme in the era of the [[German Empire|Reich of 1871–1918]] by which the old imperial elites had allegedly sought to build a system of German economic, military and political domination from the northern seas to the Near East and from the Low Countries through the steppes of Russia to the Caucasus.<ref>Hayes, p. 16</ref> Later on, professor Fritz Epstein argued the threat of a Slavic "Drang nach Westen" (Western expansion) had been a major factor in the emergence of a ''Mitteleuropa'' ideology before the Reich of 1871 ever came into being.<ref>Hayes, p. 17</ref>

In Germany the connotation was also sometimes linked to the pre-war German provinces east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} which were lost as the result of World War II, annexed by [[People's Republic of Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and ethnically cleansed of Germans by communist authorities and forces (''see [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]]'') due to [[Yalta Conference]] and [[Potsdam Conference]] decisions. In this view [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], with its dual [[West Slavs|Western Slavic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] heritage, combined with the historic element of the "[[Sudetenland]]", is a core region illustrating the problems and features of the entire Central European region.<br />
The term Mitteleuropa conjures up negative historical associations among some elder people, although the Germans have not played an exclusively negative role in the region.<ref name="Johnson, p. 6">Johnson, p. 6</ref> Most Central European Jews embraced the enlightened German humanistic culture of the 19th century.<ref name="Johnson, p. 7">Johnson, p. 7</ref> German-speaking Jews from turn of the 20th century [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]] became representatives of what many consider to be Central European culture at its best, though the Nazi version of "Mitteleuropa" destroyed this kind of culture instead.<ref name="Johnson, p. 165"/><ref name="Johnson, p. 7"/><ref>Johnson, p. 170</ref> However, the term "Mitteleuropa" is now widely used again in German education and media without negative meaning, especially since the end of communism. In fact, many people from the [[New states of Germany]] do not identify themselves as being part of [[Western Europe]] and therefore prefer the term "Mitteleuropa".

Following [[World War II]], large parts of Europe that were culturally and historically Western became part of the [[Eastern bloc]]. Czech author [[Milan Kundera]] (emigrant to France) thus wrote in 1984 about the "Tragedy of Central Europe" in the [[New York Review of Books]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ises.hu/webimages/files/Kundera_tragedy_of_Central_Europe.pdf|title=Kundera's article in PDF format}}</ref> Consequently, the English term ''Central Europe'' was increasingly applied only to the westernmost former Warsaw Pact countries (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary) to specify them as communist states that were culturally tied to Western Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11015/Regions-Regionalism-Eastern-Europe-Central-versus-Eastern-Europe.html|title=Central versus Eastern Europe}}</ref> This usage continued after the end of the Warsaw Pact when these countries started to undergo transition.

The post-World War II period brought blocking of the research on Central Europe in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, as its every result proved the dissimilarity of Central Europe, which was inconsistent with the [[Stalinist]] doctrine. On the other hand, the topic became popular in Western Europe and the United States, much of the research being carried out by immigrants from Central Europe.<ref>One of the main representatives was Oscar Halecki and his book ''The limits and divisions of European history'', London and New York 1950</ref> At the end of the communism, publicists and historians in Central Europe, especially anti-communist opposition, came back to their research.<ref>A. Podraza, Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny, 17th Congress of Polish Historians, Jagiellonian University 2004</ref>

According to Karl A. Sinnhuber (Central Europe: Mitteleuropa: Europe Centrale: An Analysis of a Geographical Term)<ref name="jstor29"/> most Central European states were unable to preserve their political independence and became Soviet Satellite Europe. Besides [[Austria]], only marginal Central European states of [[Finland]] and [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] did preserve their political sovereignty to a certain degree, being left out from any military alliances in Europe.

According to ''Meyers Enzyklopädisches Lexikon'',<ref>Band 16, Bibliographisches Institut Mannheim/Wien/Zürich, Lexikon Verlag 1980</ref> Central Europe is a part of Europe composed by the surface of the [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and [[Switzerland]], and northern marginal regions of [[Italy]] and Yugoslavia (northern states - [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]]), as well as northeastern [[France]].

=== Current views ===
Rather than a physical entity, Central Europe is a concept of shared history which contrasts with that of the surrounding regions. The issue of how to name and define the Central European region is subject to debates. Very often, the definition depends on the nationality and historical perspective of its author.

Main propositions, gathered by [[Jerzy Kłoczowski]], include:<ref>[[Jerzy Kłoczowski]], Actualité des grandes traditions de la cohabitation et du dialogue des cultures en Europe du Centre-Est, in: L'héritage historique de la Res Publica de Plusieurs Nations, Lublin 2004, pp. 29–30 ISBN 83-85854-82-7</ref>
* West-Central and [[East-Central Europe]] – this conception, presented in 1950,<ref>[[Oskar Halecki]], The Limits and Divisions of European History, Sheed & Ward: London and New York 1950, chapter VII</ref> distinguishes two regions in Central Europe: German West-Centre, with imperial tradition of the ''[[Reich]]'', and the East-Centre covered by variety of nations ''from [[Finland]] to [[Greece]]'', placed between great empires of [[Scandinavia]], Germany, [[Italy]] and the [[Soviet Union]].
* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] – [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Belarus]]ian and [[Lithuania]]n historians, in cooperation (since 1990) with [[Poland|Polish]] historians, insist on the importance of the concept.
* Central Europe as a region connected to the [[western world|Western civilisation]] for a very long time, including countries like the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], later [[German Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Crown of Bohemia]]. Central Europe understood in this way borders on [[Russia]] and [[South-Eastern Europe]], but the exact frontier of the region is difficult to determine.
* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the Habsburg Empire (later [[Austria-Hungary]]) – a concept which is popular in regions along the [[Danube River]].
[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|right|325px|[[Austria-Hungary|Habsburg-ruled lands]]]]
* A concept underlining the links connecting [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] with [[Russia]] and treating the [[Russian Empire]] together with the whole [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population as one entity – this position is taken by the [[Russia]]n historiography.
* A concept putting an accent on the links with the West, especially from the 19th century and the grand period of liberation and formation of Nation-states – this idea is represented by in the [[South-Eastern Europe|South-Eastern]] states, which prefer the enlarged concept of the "East Centre" expressing their links with the [[Western culture]].

According to [[Ronald Tiersky]], the 1991 summit held in [[Visegrád]], [[Hungary]] and attended by the [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] presidents was hailed at the time as a major breakthrough in Central European cooperation, but the [[Visegrád Group]] became a vehicle for coordinating Central Europe's road to the European Union, while development of closer ties within the region languished.<ref name="Tiersky, p. 472">[[Ronald Tiersky|Tiersky]], p. 472</ref>

[[Lonnie R. Johnson]] points out criteria to distinguish Central Europe from [[Western Europe|Western]], [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeast Europe]]:<ref>Lonnie R. Johnson "Central Europe: enemies, neighbors, friends", [[Oxford University Press]], 1996 ISBN 0-19-538664-7</ref>
* One criterion for defining Central Europe is the frontiers of medieval empires and kingdoms that largely correspond to the religious frontiers between the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] West and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox East]].<ref name="Johnson, p.4">Johnson, p.4</ref> The pagans of Central Europe were converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] while in [[Southeastern Europe|Southeastern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] they were brought into the fold of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].<ref name="Johnson, p.4"/>
* Multinational empires were a characteristic of Central Europe.<ref name="Johnson, p. 4">Johnson, p. 4</ref> [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]], small and medium-size states today, were empires during their early histories.<ref name="Johnson, p. 4"/> The historical [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was until 1918 three times larger than Hungary is today,<ref name="Johnson, p. 4"/> while Poland was the largest state in Europe in the 16th century.<ref name="Johnson, p. 4"/> Both these kingdoms housed a wide variety of different peoples.<ref name="Johnson, p. 4"/>

He also thinks that Central Europe is a dynamical historical concept, not a static spatial one. For example, [[Lithuania]], a fair share of [[Belarus]] and western [[Ukraine]] are in [[Eastern Europe]] today, but 250 years ago they were in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.<ref name="Johnson, p. 4"/><br /> Johnson's study on Central Europe received acclaim and positive reviews<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1997-05-01/central-europe-enemies-neighbors-friends|title=Central Europe: Enemies, Neighbors, Friends|last=Legvold|first=Robert|date=May–June 1997|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|accessdate=20 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/InternationalStudies/?view=usa&ci=9780195148251&view=usa |title=Selected as "Editor's Choice" of the History Book Club |work=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=20 May 2009 |deadurl=yes}}{{Dead link|date=October 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> in the scientific community.

The German Encyclopaedia ''Meyers Grosses Taschenlexikon'' ({{lang-en|''Meyers Big Pocket Encyclopedia''}}), 1999, defines Central Europe as the central part of Europe with no precise borders to the East and West. The term is mostly used to denominate the territory between the [[Schelde]] to [[Vistula River|Vistula]] and from the [[Danube]] to the [[Moravian Gate]]. Usually the countries considered to be Central European are [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Switzerland]]; in the broader sense [[Romania]] too, occasionally also [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]].

The [[Baltic states]], geographically located in [[Northern Europe]], have been considered part of Central Europe in the German tradition of the term, [[Mittleuropa]]. [[Benelux]] countries are generally considered a part of Western Europe, rather than Central Europe. Nevertheless, they are occasionally mentioned in the Central European context due to cultural, historical and linguistic ties.

Smaller parts of the following states may sometimes be included in Central Europe:
*{{flagcountry|Italy}} ([[South Tyrol]], [[Trentino]], [[Trieste]] and [[Gorizia]], [[Friuli]], occasionally all of Northern Italy)
*{{flagcountry|Liechtenstein }}
*{{flagcountry|Switzerland }}

== Geography ==
Geography defines Central Europe's natural borders with the neighbouring regions to the North across the [[Baltic Sea]] namely the [[Northern Europe]] (or [[Scandinavia]]), and to the South across the [[Alps]], the [[Apennine peninsula]] (or [[Italy]]), and the [[Balkan peninsula]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Robert Magocsi|authorlink=Paul Robert Magocsi|title=Historical Atlas of Central Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XoxHdcNYhiMC&pg=PP20|accessdate=16 October 2015|year=2002|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8486-6|page=20}}</ref> across the Soča-Krka-Sava-Danube line. The borders to [[Western Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe]] are geographically less defined and for this reason the [[cultural]] and historical boundaries migrate more easily West-East than South-North. The [[Rhine]] river which runs South-North through Western Germany is an exception.{{or|date=November 2013}}

Southwards, the [[Pannonian Plain]] is bounded by the rivers [[Sava]] and [[Danube]]- and their respective floodplains.<ref>[http://www.icpdr.org/main/sites/default/files/BA%20Facts%20Figures.pdf Danube Facts and Figures.

=== Demography ===
Central Europe is one of continent's most populous regions. It includes countries of varied sizes, ranging from tiny Liechtenstein to Germany, the largest European country by population (that is entirely placed in Europe). Demographic figures for countries entirely located within notion of Central Europe ("the core countries") number around 165 million people, out of which around '''82 million''' are residents of [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|format=PDF|title=Demography report 2010|work=[[Eurostat]]|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KE-ET-10-001/EN/KE-ET-10-001-EN.PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227155258/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KE-ET-10-001/EN/KE-ET-10-001-EN.PDF|archivedate=2012-02-27|accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref> Other populations include: [[Poland]] with around '''38.5 million''' residents,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20140714010001/http://stat.gov.pl/spisy-powszechne/nsp-2011/wyniki-spisu-nsp-2011 Główny Urząd Statystyczny / Spisy Powszechne / NSP 2011 / Wyniki spisu NSP 2011<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Czech Republic]] at '''10.5 million''',<ref>{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/2010_phc/Czech/2011CENSUS_CZE.pdf|title=Czech Republic: The Final Census Results to be Released in the Third Quarter of 2012|work=Czech Statistical Office|date=7 May 2012|accessdate=15 October 2015}}</ref> [[Hungary]] at '''10 million''',<ref>{{cite press release|format=PDF|url=http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/nepsz2011/nepsz_sajto_20130328.pdf|script-title=SAJTÓTÁJÉKOZTATÓ 2013|trans-title=PRESS CONFERENCE 2013|language=hu|agency=Hungarian Central Statistical Office|date=28 March 2013|accessdate=15 October 2015}}</ref> [[Austria]] with '''8.5 million''', [[Switzerland]] with its '''8 million inhabitants''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/01/02/blank/key/bevoelkerungsstand.html|title=Swiss Statistics - Overview|date=27 August 2015|publisher=Bfs.admin.ch|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref> [[Slovakia]] at '''5.4 million''',<ref>{{cite news|format=PDF|url=http://portal.statistics.sk/files/table-1.pdf|title=Development in the number of inhabitants - 2011, 2001, 1991, 1980, 1970|agency=Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic|date=2012|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114211217/http://portal.statistics.sk/files/table-1.pdf|archive-date=14 November 2012}}</ref> [[Croatia]] with its '''4.3 million'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/results/htm/E01_01_01/e01_01_01.html |title=Central Bureau of Statistics |publisher=Dzs.hr |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref> residents, [[Slovenia]] at '''2 million''' (2014 estimate)<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20140502032343/http://www.stat.si/eng/novica_prikazi.aspx?ID=6200 Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia - Population, Slovenia, 1 January 2014 – final data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[Liechtenstein]] at a bit less than '''40,000'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llv.li/#/11508/bevolkerungvorlaufige-ergebnisse--dezember-|title=Landesverwaltung Liechtenstein|publisher=Llv.li|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref>

If the countries which are occasionally included in Central Europe were counted in, partially or in whole – [[Romania]] (20 million), [[Lithuania]] (2.9 million), [[Latvia]] (2 million), [[Estonia]] (1.3 million) – it would contribute to the rise of between 25–35 million, depending on whether regional or integral approach was used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Total population, Candidate countries and potential candidates|work=[[Eurostat]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&language=en&pcode=tgs00027&plugin=1}}</ref> If smaller, western and eastern historical parts of Central Europe would be included in the demographic corpus, further 20 million people of different nationalities would also be added in the overall count, it would surpass the 200 million people figure.

==Economy==

===Currencies===
Currently, the members of the [[Eurozone]] include Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania use their currencies (Croatian kuna, Czech koruna, Hungarian forint, Polish złoty, Romanian leu), but are obliged to adopt the Euro.

===Infrastructure===
Industrialisation occurred early in Central Europe. That caused construction of rail and other types of infrastructure.

====Rail====
[[Image:Rail density map.png|thumb|300px|Rail network density.]]
Central Europe contains the continent's earliest railway systems, whose greatest expansion was recorded in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[German Empire|German]] territories between 1860-1870s.<ref name="Historical Atlas of Central Europe">{{cite book|author=Paul Robert Magocsi|title=Historical Atlas of Central Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XoxHdcNYhiMC&pg=PA1758|accessdate=16 October 2015|year=2002|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8486-6|page=1758}}</ref> By the mid-19th century Berlin, Vienna, and Buda/Pest were focal points for network lines connecting industrial areas of Saxony, Silesia, Bohemia, Moravia and Lower Austria with the Baltic (Kiel, Szczecin) and Adriatic (Rijeka, Trieste).<ref name="Historical Atlas of Central Europe"/> Rail infrastructure in Central Europe remains the densest in the world. Railway density, with total length of lines operated (km) per 1,000 km2, is the highest in the Czech Republic (198.6), Poland (121.0), Slovenia (108.0), Germany (105.5), Hungary (98.7), Romania (85.9), Slovakia (73.9) and Croatia (72.5).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaypro.com/wp/launch-of-railway-projects-puts-serbia-among-eu-member-states/|title=Launch of railway projects puts Serbia among EU member states|publisher=Railway Pro|date=27 February 2013|accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.internationaltransportforum.org/statistics/investment/Country-responses/Serbia.pdf|title=Response to questionnaire for: Assessment of strategic plans and policy measures on Investment and Maintenance in Transport Infrastructure Country: Serbia|work=internationaltransportforum.org|accessdate=15 October 2015}}</ref> when compared with most of Europe and the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Inland_transport_infrastructure_at_regional_level|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508143341/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Inland_transport_infrastructure_at_regional_level|archivedate=8 May 2013|title=Inland transport infrastructure at regional level - Statistics Explained|publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu|date= |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.unece.org/pxweb/quickstatistics/readtable.asp?qs_id=47|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022173535/http://w3.unece.org/pxweb/quickstatistics/readtable.asp?qs_id=47|archivedate=2014-10-22 |title=Statistical Database - United Nations Economic Commission for Europe |publisher=W3.unece.org |date=29 December 1980 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>

====River transport and canals====
Before the first railroads appeared in the 1840s, river transport constituted the main means of communication and trade.<ref name="Historical Atlas of Central Europe"/> Earliest canals included Plauen Canal (1745), Finow Canal, and also [[Begej|Bega Canal]] (1710) which connected [[Timisoara]] to [[Novi Sad]] and [[Belgrade]] via Danube.<ref name="Historical Atlas of Central Europe"/> The most significant achievement in this regard was the facilitation of navigability on Danube from the Black sea to Ulm in the 19th century.

===Branches===
Compared to most of Europe, the economies of Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland tend to demonstrate [[List of countries by economic complexity|high complexity]].

*{{flagcountry|Poland}} (position 17th, 15 sites)
*{{flagcountry|Czech Republic}} (position 19th, 12 sites)

===Beliefs===
[[File:Catholic Church by Country in Europe.PNG|thumb|right|180px|Central European major Christian denomination is [[Catholicism]] (map) as well as large [[Protestant]] populations]]
Central European countries are mostly [[Roman Catholic]] (Austria, Croatia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia) or mixed Catholic and [[Protestant]], (Germany, Hungary and Switzerland). Large Protestant groups include [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]. Significant populations of [[Eastern Catholicism]] and [[Old Catholic]]ism are also prevalent throughout Central Europe. Central Europe has been a centre of Protestantism in the past; however, it has been mostly eradicated by the [[Counterreformation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go.hrw.com/hrw.nd/gohrw_rls1/pKeywordResults?ST9%20Eur%20Religions%201600%7ctitle=GO.HRW.COM%7c |title=pError |publisher=Go.hrw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wps.ablongman.com/wps/media/objects/262/268312/art/figures/KISH_13_309.gif|title=Map: The Religious Divisions of Europe ca. 1555|publisher=Pearson|date=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emersonkent.com/map_archive/europe_religion_1560.htm|title=Map of Europe in 1560: Religion|publisher=Emersonkent.com|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref> The Czech Republic (Bohemia) was historically the first Protestant country, then violently recatholised, and now overwhelmingly non-religious with the largest number of religious being Catholic (10.3%). [[Romania]] is mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] with significant [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] minorities.

In some of these countries, there is a number of [[atheist]]s, undeclared and [[irreligion|non-religious]] people: the Czech Republic (non-religious 34.2% and undeclared 45.2%), Germany (non-religious 38%), Slovenia (atheist 30.2%), Luxembourg (25% non-religious), Switzerland (20.1%), Hungary (27.2% undeclared, 16.7% "non-religious" and 1.5% atheists), Slovakia (atheists and non-religious 13.4%, "not specified" 10.6%) Austria (19.7% of "other or none"), Liechtenstein (10.6% with no religion), Croatia (4%) and Poland (3% of non-believers/agnostics and 1% of undeclared).

===Cuisine===
[[Central European cuisine]] has evolved through centuries due to social and political change. Most countries share many dishes. The most popular dishes typical to Central Europe are sausages and cheeses, where the earliest evidence of cheesemaking in the archaeological record dates back to 5,500 BCE ([[Kujawy]], Poland).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/art-of-cheese-making-is-7-500-years-old-1.12020|title=Art of cheese-making is 7,500 years old|work=Nature News & Comment}}</ref> Other foods widely associated with Central Europe are [[goulash]] and [[beer]]. [[List of countries by beer consumption per capita]] is led by the [[Czech Republic]], followed by [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. [[Poland]] comes 5th, [[Croatia]] 7th and [[Slovenia]] 13th.

===Human rights===

====History====
Human rights have a long tradition in Central Europe. In 1222 Hungary defined for the first time the rights of the nobility in its "Golden Bull". In 1264 the Statute of Kalisz and the General Charter of Jewish Liberties introduced numerous rights for the Jews in Poland, granting them de facto autonomy. In 1783 for the first time, Poland forbid corporal punishment of children in schools. In the same year, a German state of Baden banned slavery.

On the other hand, there were also major regressions, such as "Nihil novi" in Poland in 1505 which forbade peasants from leaving their land without permission from their feudal lord.

====Present====
Generally, the countries in the region are progressive on the issue of human rights: death penalty is illegal in all of them, corporal punishment is outlawed in most of them and people of both genders can vote in elections. Nevertheless, Central European countries struggle to adopt new generations of human rights, such as [[same-sex marriage]]. Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland and Romania also have a history of participation in the CIA's extraordinary rendition and detention program, according to the [[Open Society Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/projects/globalizing-torture|title=CIA Secret Detention and Torture|work=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transcend.org/tms/2013/02/the-latin-american-exception-how-a-washington-global-torture-gulag-was-turned-into-the-only-gulag-free-zone-on-earth/|title=TRANSCEND MEDIA SERVICE|work=TRANSCEND Media Service|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref>

Central Europe is a home to some of world's oldest democracie. However, most of them have been impacted by totalitarian rule, particularly Nazism (Germany, Austria, other occupied countries) and Communism. Most of Central Europe have been occupied and later allied with the USSR, often against their will through forged referendum (e.g., [[Polish people's referendum, 1946|Polish people's referendum in 1946]]) or force (northeast Germany, Poland, Hungary et alia). Nevertheless, these experiences have been dealt in most of them. Most of Central European countries score very highly in the Democracy Index:<ref>{{cite web|format=PDF|url=https://portoncv.gov.cv/dhub/porton.por_global.open_file?p_doc_id=1034|title=Democracy index 2012: Democracy at a standstill: A report from The Economist Intelligence Unit|work=The Economist|date=2013|accessdate=15 October 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Time zones of Europe.svg|thumb|right|300px|Central European Time Zone (dark red)]]

==Central European Time==
{{Speculation section}}
The time zone used in most parts of the European Union is a standard time which is 1 hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. It is commonly called [[Central European Time]] because it has been first adopted in central Europe (by year):
*{{flagcountry|Hungary}} (1890)
*{{flagcountry|Slovakia}} (1890)
*{{flagcountry|Czech Republic}} (1891)
*{{flagcountry|Germany}} (1893)
*{{flagcountry|Austria}} (1893)
*{{flagcountry|Poland}} (1893<ref>Since Poland was partitioned since 1922 (official adoption), the dates of introduction in Germany (1893) and Austria (1893) should be understood as de facto adoption</ref>)
*{{flagcountry|Slovenia}} (1893)
*{{flagcountry|Switzerland}} (1894)
*{{flagcountry|Liechtenstein}} (1894)

==In popular culture==
Central Europe is mentioned in 35th episode of [[Lovejoy]], entitled "The Prague Sun", filmed in 1992. While walking over the famous [[Charles Bridge]], the main character, Lovejoy says: " I've never been to Prague before. Well, it is one of the great unspoiled cities in Central Europe. Notice: I said: "Central", not "Eastern"! The Czechs are a bit funny about that, they think of Eastern Europeans as ''turnip heads''."<ref>{{cite web|title=Lovejoy - Season 3, Episode 13: The Prague Sun - TV.com|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/lovejoy/the-prague-sun-78515/|website=TV.com|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>
