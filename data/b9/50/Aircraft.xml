The advent of powered balloons, called dirigible balloons, and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size, began to change the way these words were used. Huge powered aerostats, characterized by a<space/><link><target>rigid airship</target><part>rigid</part></link><space/>outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags, were produced, the<space/><link><target>Zeppelin</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>being the largest and most famous. There were still no fixed-wing aircraft or non-rigid balloons large enough to be called airships, so &quot;airship&quot; came to be synonymous with these aircraft. Then several accidents, such as the<space/><link><target>Hindenburg disaster</target></link><space/>in 1937, led to the demise of these airships. Nowadays a &quot;balloon&quot; is an unpowered aerostat and an &quot;airship&quot; is a powered one.</paragraph><paragraph>A powered, steerable aerostat is called a<space/><italics><link><target>dirigible</target></link></italics>. Sometimes this term is applied only to non-rigid balloons, and sometimes<space/><italics>dirigible balloon</italics><space/>is regarded as the definition of an airship (which may then be rigid or non-rigid). Non-rigid dirigibles are characterized by a moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back.

During the<space/><link><target>World War II</target><part>Second World War</part></link>, this shape was widely adopted for tethered balloons; in windy weather, this both reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon.

In modern times, any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp, though a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Heavier-than-air aerodynes<template><target>Anchor</target><arg>Heavier than air</arg></template></heading><preblock><preline>Heavier-than-air aircraft, such as<space/><link><target>airplane</target><trail>s</trail></link>, must find some way to push air or gas downwards, so that a reaction occurs (by Newton's laws of motion) to push the aircraft upwards.

A<space/><link><target>balloon</target></link><space/>similarly relies on internal gas pressure but may have a rigid basket or gondola slung below it to carry its payload. Early aircraft, including<space/><link><target>airship</target><trail>s</trail></link>, often employed flexible<space/><link><target>aircraft dope</target><part>doped</part></link><space/><link><target>aircraft fabric covering</target></link><space/>to give a reasonably smooth aeroshell stretched over a rigid frame. Later aircraft employed semi-<link><target>monocoque</target></link><space/>techniques, where the skin of the aircraft is stiff enough to share much of the flight loads. In a true monocoque design there is no internal structure left.</paragraph><paragraph>The key structural parts of an aircraft depend on what type it is.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Aerostats</heading><paragraph>Lighter-than-air types are characterised by one or more gasbags, typically with a supporting structure of flexible cables or a rigid framework called its hull.
