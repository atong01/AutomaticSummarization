Luthor fired every employee of the newspaper except for four people: Simone D'Neige, Dirk Armstrong,<space/><link><target>Jimmy Olsen</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Lois Lane</target></link>. As a final insult, Luthor saw to it that the<space/><italics>Planet</italics><space/>globe was unceremoniously dumped in the Metropolis<space/><link><target>landfill</target></link>. In the<space/><italics>Planet</italics>'s place emerged &quot;LexCom,&quot; a news-oriented<space/><link><target>Internet</target></link><space/>website that primarily catered to Luthor's views of &quot;quality journalism.&quot;</paragraph><paragraph>After Lois Lane made a deal with Luthor where, in exchange for him returning the<space/><italics>Planet</italics><space/>to Perry, she would kill one story of his choosing with no questions asked, Luthor sold the<space/><italics>Daily Planet</italics><space/>to Perry White for the token sum of one dollar.

Eventually, Superman turned the public to his favor and Sam Lane was seen in a bad light after his soldier John Corben AKA<space/><link><target>Metallo</target></link><space/>ruthlessly endangered civilians.

Along with being a writer for The Daily Star, partly because editor George Taylor was a friend of his adopted parents, Clark is an active blogger who speaks against political corruption and reports on the troubles of every day citizens who are not often the focus of news media. While working at the Star, Clark meets Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen and the two become friends despite working at rival publications. Clark is also a great fan of Lois Lane's work at the Daily Planet, eventually meeting her through Jimmy. Months after Superman makes his public debut, Clark leaves The Daily Star on good terms and accepts a position at The Daily Planet.</paragraph><paragraph>After the merger with Galaxy Broadcasting, Lois was promoted to run the TV division, with Clark acting as an on-the-scene reporter for the TV division. Clark is later assigned the &quot;Superman beat.&quot; But after rising tension between himself and Lois, as well as with Galaxy Broadcasting head Morgan Edge, Clark concludes that the Daily Planet is now more concerned with ratings and internet page views than actual journalism. He quits and goes off to begin an independent, internet news site with fellow journalist Cat Grant. Though Lois and Jimmy consider this to be a bad and risky decision, they continue to act as Clark's friends and confidants, offering aid when they can.</paragraph><heading level='3'>30th and 31st Centuries</heading><paragraph>In virtually every incarnation of the era inhabited by the<space/><link><target>Legion of Super-Heroes</target></link>, the<space/><italics>Daily Planet</italics><space/>is depicted as a fixture in Metropolis, and one of Earth's major media sources.
