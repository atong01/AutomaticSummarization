The '''Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' ([[Serbo-Croat-Bosnian]]: ''Oružane snage Bosne i Hercegovine, OSBIH''/Оружане снаге Босне и Херцеговине, ОСБИХ) is the official [[military]] force of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The BiH Armed forces were officially unified in 2005 and are composed of two founding [[army|armies]]: the [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]]-[[Bosnian Croat|Croat]] [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Bosnian Serb]] [[Army of Republika Srpska]].

The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], founded in 2004, is in charge of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Chain of command==
In accordance with BiH Law of defense and BiH Law of service the supreme civilian commander of the Armed Forces Bosnia and Herzegovina is the collective Presidency of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The collective Presidency directs the Ministry of defense BiH and the Armed Forces. Former Bosnia and Herzegovina ministers of defense include H.E. Nikola Radovanović, H.E. Selmo Cikotić and H.E. Muhamed Ibrahimović. The current Minister of defense BiH is H.E. Marina Pendeš. Former Chiefs of Joint Staff AF BiH include LGEN Sifet Podžić and Lieutenant General Miladin Milojčić. The current BiH Chief of Joint Staff is Lieutenant General Anto Jeleč. [[Conscription]] was completely abolished in Bosnia and Herzegovina effective on and from 1 January 2006.<ref>[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/special/dayton/peacekeeping/feature-11 NATO and the Defence Reform Commission: partners for progress (SETimes.com)<!-- Bot generated title --> ]</ref>

==Defence law==
The Bosnia and Herzegovina Defence Law addresses the following areas: the Military of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Government Institutions, Entity Jurisdictions and Structure, Budget and Financing, Composition of Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, War Declaration, natural disasters, conflict of interests and professionalism, Oath to Bosnia-Herzegovina, flags, anthem and military insignia, and transitional and end orders.

==History==
The AFBiH was formed from three armies of the [[Bosnian War]] period: the Bosnian (dominantly Bosniak with numbers of Serbs and Croats) [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the Bosnian Serb [[Army of Republika Srpska]], and the [[Croat Defence Council]].

The Army of the Republic of Bosnia And Herzegovina was created on 15 April 1992 during the early days of the [[Bosnian War]]. Before the ARBiH was formally created, there existed [[Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Territorial Defence]], an official military force of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a number of [[paramilitary]] groups such as the [[Zelene beretke|Green Berets]], [[Patriotic League (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Patriotic League]], and [[civil defense]] groups, as well as many criminal gangs and collections of police and military professionals. The army was formed under poor circumstances, with a very low number of [[tanks]], [[Armored Personnel Carrier|APC]]s and no military aviation assets. The army was divided into Corps, each Corp was stationed in a territory. The first commander was [[Sefer Halilović]].

The Army of Republika Srpska was created on 12 May 1992. Before the VRS was formally created, there were a number of [[paramilitary]] groups such as the Srpska Dobrovoljačka Garda, [[White Eagles (paramilitary)|Beli Orlovi]], as well as some [[Russians|Russian]], [[Greeks|Greek]] and other volunteers. The army was equipped with ex-[[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] inventory. It had about 200 tanks, mostly [[T-55]]s and 85 [[M-84]]s, and 150 APCs with several heavy artillery pieces. The Air Defense of VRS has shot down several aircraft, like [[F-16]], [[Mirage 2000]], [[F-18]] and one [[Croatian Air Force]] [[MiG-21]]. The VRS received support from the [[Yugoslav Army]] and [[FRY]].

The [[Croatian Defence Council]] was the main military formation of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]] during the Bosnian War. It was first organized military force to with the aim to control the Croat populated areas, created on 8 April 1992. They ranged from men armed with shotguns assigned to [[Croatian Defence Council#Village Guards|village defense tasks]] to organized, uniformed, and well-equipped [[Croatian Defence Council#Guard brigades|brigade-sized formations]] that nevertheless employed [[Croatian Defence Council#Home Guard|part-time soldiers]]. As time went on, the HVO forces became increasingly better organized and more "professional", but it was not until early 1994, that the HVO began to form the so-called [[Croatian Defence Council#Guard brigades|guards brigades]], mobile units manned by full-time professional soldiers.

In 1995–96, a [[NATO]]-led international peacekeeping force ([[IFOR]]) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning on December 21, 1995 to implement and monitor the military aspects of the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]]. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force or [[SFOR]]. The number of SFOR troops was reduced first to 12,000 and then to 7,000. SFOR was in turn succeeded by an even smaller, [[European Union]]-led European Union Force, [[EUFOR Althea]]. As of 2004, EUFOR Althea numbered around 7,000 troops.

As the joint AFBiH began to develop, troops began to be sent abroad. Bosnia and Herzegovina deployed a unit of 37 men to destroy munitions and clear mines, in addition to 6 command personnel as part of the [[Multinational force in Iraq]]. The unit was first deployed to [[Fallujah]], then [[Talil Air Base]], and is now located at [[Camp Echo (Iraq)|Camp Echo]]. In December 2006, the Bosnian government formerly extended its mandate through June 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina is planning to send another 49 soldiers from the 6th Infantry Division to Iraq in August 2008, their mission will be to protect/guard [[Camp Victory]] in [[Baghdad]].

These regiments have their distinct ethnic insignias and consist of three active battalions each. Headquarters of [[Regiment]]s have no operational authority.

==Air Force==
{{Main|Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence Brigade of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed when elements of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska Air Force]] were merged in 2006. The status of the [[Air Force]] in the last couple of years, has merged a great success. While saying so, it includes aircraft repairs, funds for professional and proper cooperation with the [[Ground Forces]], as well as to the citizens of the country.  The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is in great interest of buying new aircraft's, that include mostly helicopters and perhaps even fighter jets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/bosnia-breaks-through-ethnic-divide-by-merging-serb-muslim-croat-forces-1.43446|title=Bosnia breaks through ethnic divide by merging Serb, Muslim-Croat forces|publisher=Stars and Stripes|date=11 January 2006|accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref>
