The group was formed in 1976 and achieved popularity during the<space/><link><target>disco</target></link><space/>era of the late 1970s.

Farian sang the repeated line &quot;Do you do you wanna bump?&quot; in a deep voice (entirely studio created) as well as performing the high<space/><link><target>falsetto</target></link><space/>chorus. When the record was released as a single, it was credited to &quot;Boney M.&quot;, a pseudonym Farian had created for himself after watching the Australian detective show<space/><italics><link><target>Boney (TV series)</target><part>Boney</part></link></italics>.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Boney">Boney M by<space/><link><target>John Shearlaw</target></link><space/>and David Brown,<space/><link><target>Hamlin Paperbacks</target></link>, 1979 ISBN 0 600 20009 4-page 35-6</extension></paragraph><list type='ident'><listitem>I turned on the TV one day and it was the end of a detective series.

It was then that Farian decided to hire performers to 'front' the group for TV performances. The Katja Wolfe booking agency found model-turned-singer<space/><link><target>Maizie Williams</target></link><space/>(originally from<space/><link><target>Montserrat</target></link>) and her Jamaican singer friend<space/><link><target>Sheyla Bonnick</target></link><space/>for him, along with a dancer known only as &quot;Mike&quot; for the first gigs. Also during 1975, a girl named Nathalie joined but was soon replaced by Jamaica-born<space/><link><target>Claudja Barry</target></link>. Then Bonnick and Mike left, and Maizie Williams brought in<space/><link><target>Bobby Farrell</target></link>, a male exotic dancer from<space/><link><target>Aruba</target></link>. Singer<space/><link><target>Marcia Barrett</target></link><space/>(also from Jamaica) joined the group, which then went through another change in line-up when Claudja Barry left in February 1976 to pursue a solo career as a disco singer. Finally<space/><link><target>Liz Mitchell</target></link>, former member of the<space/><link><target>Les Humphries Singers</target></link>, stepped in. The line-up was finalised with Liz Mitchell, Maizie Williams, Marcia Barrett, and Bobby Farrell.</paragraph><heading level='4'><italics>Take the Heat off Me</italics></heading><paragraph>Boney M.'s first album,<space/><italics><link><target>Take the Heat off Me</target></link></italics>, was released in 1976. It contained tracks that Marcia Barrett had already recorded with Farian, including the title track and &quot;Lovin' or Leavin'&quot;, both of which were previously recorded in German by another Farian act,<space/><link><target>Gilla (singer)</target><part>Gilla</part></link>. As Maizie Williams' voice wasn't considered suitable for recording purposes by Farian, and a try-out with Bobby Farrell performing &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; didn't work, Farian decided to use only Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett along with his own studio-enhanced voice to create the Boney M. sound.</paragraph><paragraph>The album's commercial performance was initially lukewarm. However, the group rigorously toured discos, clubs and even country fairs to earn a reputation for themselves. The group's big break came when, at the end of summer 1976, German television producer Michael 'Mike' Leckebusch (of<space/><link><target>Radio Bremen</target></link>) requested the group for his show<space/><italics><link><target>Musikladen</target></link></italics>. Boney M. appeared on the live music show on 18 September 1976, after 10&amp;nbsp;pm and in their daring stage costumes, where they performed the song &quot;<link><target>Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)</target><part>Daddy Cool</part></link>&quot;. The song quickly went to no.1 in Germany, with the album following the success of the single. Another single, &quot;<link><target>Sunny (song)</target><part>Sunny</part></link>&quot; (a cover of the 1966<space/><link><target>Bobby Hebb</target></link><space/>song) gave the group their second no.1 hit. The group's popularity had also grown throughout Europe, with &quot;Daddy Cool&quot; reaching no.1 in Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Austria. Both singles were also Top 10 hits in the UK, which would become one of their biggest markets.</paragraph><heading level='4'><italics>Love for Sale</italics></heading><paragraph>In 1977, Boney M. released their second album,<space/><italics><link><target>Love for Sale (Boney M. album)</target><part>Love for Sale</part></link></italics>, which contained the hits &quot;<link><target>Ma Baker</target></link>&quot; and &quot;<link><target>Belfast (Boney M. song)</target><part>Belfast</part></link>&quot;.

They released a new double A-sided single, &quot;<link><target>Rivers of Babylon</target></link>/<link><target>Brown Girl in the Ring (song)</target><part>Brown Girl in the Ring</part></link>&quot;, which became a massive hit all over Europe, reaching No. 1 in several countries as well as becoming one of the biggest selling singles of all time in the UK.

Since this had become common practice within the disco genre of the late '70s, few people cared unlike when Farian did the same thing with<space/><link><target>Milli Vanilli</target></link><space/>in the late 1980s. While only two of Boney M.'s official members actually contributed to the band's records, all four members of the group, including Williams and Farrell, performed the vocals live at Boney M. concerts.<extension extension_name='ref'><template><target>cite web</target><arg name="url">http://www.musiclange.dk/<space/></arg><arg name="title">Fantastic Boney M<space/></arg><arg name="publisher">Musiclange.dk<space/></arg><arg name="date"><space/></arg><arg name="accessdate">2011-10-15</arg></template></extension><space/>The band's live sound was also augmented by several backing vocalists, which served to enhance any vocal deficiencies the group may have had compared with the studio productions.</paragraph><heading level='4'><italics>Oceans of Fantasy</italics></heading><paragraph>1979 saw Boney M. release a brand new single, &quot;<link><target>Hooray!

When<space/><italics><link><target>Boonoonoonoos</target></link></italics><space/>was finally released by the end of that year, Bobby Farrell was fired from the group due to his unreliability. While still a healthy seller in continental Europe, &quot;Boonoonoonoos&quot; failed to crack the UK Top 100 after three consecutive No. 1 albums, and Farrell's departure left the group unable to promote it. Following this, the group released a<space/><italics>Christmas Album</italics>.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Ten Thousand Lightyears</heading><paragraph><link><target>Reggie Tsiboe</target></link><space/>was hired to replace Farrell as the new male member of Boney M. in 1982 but the singles &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; and &quot;Jambo&quot; fared poorly, and the group's seventh album<space/><italics><link><target>Ten Thousand Lightyears</target></link></italics>, issued in 1984, marked another commercial low point. The group, however, returned to the German Top 20 in the autumn of 1984 with &quot;Kalimba de Luna&quot; and &quot;Happy Song&quot;, the latter seeing Bobby Farrell return to the group. Both songs were carbon-copies of the original Italian hits by<space/><link><target>Tony Esposito (musician)</target><part>Tony Esposito</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Baby's Gang</target></link><space/>respectively.</paragraph><heading level='4'>Eye Dance</heading><paragraph>By 1985, Farian clearly began losing interest in the group, and their final and eighth studio album<space/><italics><link><target>Eye Dance</target></link></italics><space/>was widely regarded as uninspired and disappointing. After celebrating Boney M.'s 10th anniversary in early 1986, the group officially disbanded after the release of the commercially unsuccessful single 'Young, Free and Single'.</paragraph><heading level='3'>Later Years</heading><paragraph>From this point, different versions of the group were formed by members, some with cooperation of Farian, others without (for example by independently obtaining the rights to use the Boney M. name in a different country). One version began touring in the first half of 1987 with Marilyn Scharbaai (Carrilho) taking Liz Mitchell's place. Mitchell returned for a second leg of the tour late 1987, and Marcia Barrett soon left the band. At the same time, Bobby Farrell had set up a deal for a new Boney M. album to be recorded without Farian in Belgium. When Farrell failed to show up for either recording or tour, and Maizie Williams had never sung on record, the album ended up being released as Liz Mitchell's first solo album<space/><italics>No One Will Force You</italics>. Mitchell and Williams completed a tour during 198788, adding singer Celena Duncan and Ron Gale as replacements for Barrett and Farrell. Carol Grey later replaced Celena Duncan and Curt De Daran later replaced Ron Gale.</paragraph><paragraph>In October 1988, the classic Boney M. line-up reunited without producer Frank Farian for the album<space/><italics><link><target>Greatest Hits of All Times - Remix '88</target></link></italics><space/>but tensions ran high between the members, and Liz Mitchell left in the spring of 1989 to be replaced by Madeleine Davis. While Mitchell promoted her solo album, the group recorded the single &quot;<link><target>Everybody Wants to Dance Like Josephine Baker</target></link>&quot;, without Farian's knowledge or approval. Threatened with legal action by the producer over the use of the Boney M. name, the single was subsequently withdrawn and Farian issued &quot;Stories&quot; with his own new Boney M. line-up featuring Liz Mitchell, Reggie Tsiboe and two new members, Sharon Stevens and Patty Onoyewenjo. A second remix album<space/><italics><link><target>Greatest Hits of All Times - Remix '89 - Volume II</target></link></italics><space/>was released but fared poorly.</paragraph><heading level='3'>1990s</heading><paragraph>1992 saw a renewed interest in Boney M.'s music with the &quot;Boney M. Megamix&quot; single returning the group to the UK Top 10 for the first time since 1980, and a subsequent Greatest Hits album reaching the UK Top 20 in 1993. While Marcia Barrett, now residing in Florida, was battling cancer and unable to perform, Boney M. toured the world with a line-up of Liz Mitchell, Carol Grey, Patricia Lorna Foster and Curt Dee Daran (replaced by Tony Ashcroft in 1994). They released the single Papa Chico but failed to chart. Maizie Williams assembled her own Boney M. line-up with her friend and short-time Boney M. member in the early days in 1975,<space/><link><target>Sheyla Bonnick</target></link>, and two others.
