'''Belgian hip hop music''' has a few [[rapper]]s stemming from [[Africa]] and [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mtviggy.com/articles/artist-of-the-week-congolese-belgian-rapper-baloji/ |title=Artist of the Week: Congolese-Belgian Rapper Baloji! |publisher=Mtv Iggy |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}</ref> [[Belgium]], like [[France]], controlled [[Africa]]n countries like the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly Zaire), [[Rwanda]], and [[Burundi]] until the early 1960s. Like in France, [[Immigration|immigrants]] from these countries started to study and live in [[Belgium]].

The Belgian [[hip hop music|hip hop]] scene started in the late 1980s with a U.S.-based [[techno music|techno]]/hip hop group called [[Technotronic]]. In the group was an emcee named [[Ya Kid K]] from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] who later led the group into international fame with hits like "Pump up the Jam" and "Shake That Body". In 1990, she also joined the group Hi-Tek 3 who were heard on the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' movie [[soundtrack]]. 

However, the first major pop rapper from Belgium was [[Benny B]], who had a very mainstream and commercial sound.  According to the European Music Office's report on ''Music in Europe'', this was the first of many pop acts that helped inspire a backlash and the creation of an underground hip hop scene.

Also in the late 1990s in the [[Wallonia|Walloon south]] of the country, French speaking/rapping [[Starflam]] was the biggest name in hip hop.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Morgan |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/dec/04/baloji-rapper-congo-sorcerer-interview |title=Baloji: 'I want to make music that is very African and very modern' &#124; Music &#124; The Observer |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}</ref> In the [[Flanders|Flemish]] north Dutch speaking/rapping groups like [['t Hof van Commerce]], Krapoel In Axe, St Andries MC's, and ABN were popular, rapping in their regional [[dialect]]s.
