It was not until 1826 that the energetic Dost Mohammad Khan was able to exert sufficient control over his brothers to take over the throne in<space/><link><target>Kabul</target></link>, where he proclaimed himself the<space/><link><target>Shah</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Dost Mohammad achieved prominence among his brothers through clever use of the support of his mother's<space/><link><target>Qizilbash</target></link><space/>tribesmen and his own youthful apprenticeship under his brother,<space/><link><target>Fateh Khan</target></link>.

After working assiduously to establish control and stability in his domains around Kabul, the Shah next chose to confront the warring Sikhs.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1834 Dost Mohammad defeated an invasion by the former ruler,<space/><link><target>Shuja Shah Durrani</target></link>, but his absence from Kabul gave the Sikhs the opportunity to expand westward.<space/><link><target>Ranjit Singh</target></link>'s forces occupied<space/><link><target>Peshawar</target></link>, moving from there into territory ruled directly by Kabul. In 1836 Dost Mohammad's forces, under the command of his son<space/><link><target>Wazir Akbar Khan</target><part>Akbar Khan</part></link>, defeated the Sikhs at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Jamrud</target></link>, a post fifteen kilometres west of Peshawar. This was a<space/><link><target>pyrrhic victory</target></link><space/>and they failed to fully dislodge the Sikhs from Jamrud. The Afghan leader did not follow up this triumph by retaking Peshawar, however, but instead contacted<space/><link><target>George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland</target><part>Lord Auckland</part></link>, the new<space/><link><target>British Empire</target><part>British</part></link><space/>governor general in<space/><link><target>British India</target></link>, for help in dealing with the Sikhs. With this letter, Dost Mohammad formally set the stage for British intervention in Afghanistan. At the heart of the<space/><link><target>The Great Game</target><part>Great Game</part></link><space/>lay the willingness of Britain and Russia to subdue, subvert, or subjugate the small independent states that lay between Russia and British India.</paragraph><heading level='2'>The Great Game</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>The Great Game</arg></template><link><target>File:Ghazni City during 1839-42.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part><link><target>Ghazni</target></link><space/>in early 1800s.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>The<space/><link><target>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</target><part>British</part></link><space/>became the major power in the Indian sub-continent after the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Paris (1763)</target></link><space/>and began to show interest in Afghanistan as early as their 1809 treaty with<space/><link><target>Shah Shujah Durrani</target><part>Shuja Shah Durrani</part></link>. It was the threat of the expanding<space/><link><target>Russian Empire</target></link><space/>beginning to push for an advantage in the Afghanistan region that placed pressure on British India, in what became known as the &quot;Great Game&quot;. The Great Game set in motion the confrontation of the British and Russian empires, whose<space/><link><target>spheres of influence</target></link><space/>moved steadily closer to one another until they met in Afghanistan. It also involved Britain's repeated attempts to impose a puppet government in Kabul. The remainder of the 19th century saw greater European involvement in Afghanistan and her surrounding territories and heightened conflict among the ambitious local rulers as Afghanistan's fate played out globally.</paragraph><paragraph>The dbcle of the Afghan civil war left a vacuum in the<space/><link><target>Hindu Kush</target></link><space/>area that concerned the British, who were well aware of the many times in history it had been employed as the invasion route to South Asia. In the early decades of the 19th century, it became clear to the British that the major threat to their interests in India would not come from the fragmented Afghan empire, the<space/><link><target>Iran</target><trail>ians</trail></link>, or the French, but from the Russians, who had already begun a steady advance southward from the<space/><link><target>Caucasus</target></link><space/>winning decisive wars against the<space/><link><target>Ottoman Turks</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Qajar Dynasty</target><part>Qajar Persians</part></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>At the same time, the Russians feared permanent British occupation in<space/><link><target>Central Asia</target></link><space/>as the British encroached northward, taking the<space/><link><target>Punjab region</target><part>Punjab</part></link>,<space/><link><target>Sindh</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>Kashmir</target></link>; later to become Pakistan.

First was the Russian influence at the Iranian court, which prompted the Russians to support Iran in its attempt to take<space/><link><target>Herat</target></link>, historically the western gateway to Afghanistan and northern India. In 1837 Iran advanced on Herat with the support and advice of Russian officers. The second immediate reason was the presence in Kabul in 1837 of a Russian agent,<space/><link><target>Yan Vitkevich</target></link>, who was ostensibly there, as was the British agent<space/><link><target>Alexander Burnes</target></link>, for commercial discussions.</paragraph><paragraph>The British demanded that Dost Mohammad sever all contact with the Iranians and Russians, remove Vitkevich from Kabul, surrender all claims to Peshawar, and respect Peshawar's independence as well as that of Kandahar, which was under the control of his brothers at the time. In return, the British government intimated that it would ask Ranjit Singh to reconcile with the Afghans. When Auckland refused to put the agreement in writing, Dost Mohammad turned his back on the British and began negotiations with Vitkevich.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1838 Auckland, Ranjit Singh, and Shuja signed an agreement stating that Shuja would regain control of Kabul and Kandahar with the help of the British and Sikhs; he would accept Sikh rule of the former Afghan provinces already controlled by Ranjit Singh, and that Herat would remain independent. In practice, the plan replaced Dost Mohammad with a British figurehead whose autonomy would be as limited as that of other Indian princes.</paragraph><paragraph>It soon became apparent to the British that Sikh participation, advancing toward Kabul through the Khyber Pass while Shuja and the British advanced through Kandahar, would not be forthcoming. Auckland's plan in the spring of 1838 was for the Sikhs to place Shuja on the Afghan throne, with British support. By the end of the summer however, the plan had changed; now the British alone would impose the pliant Shuja Shah.</paragraph><heading level='2'>First Anglo-Afghan War, 18381842</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>First Anglo-Afghan War</arg></template><link><target>File:Shah Shujah of Afghanistan.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>150px</part><part><link><target>Shah Shujah Durrani</target><part>Shah Shujah</part></link><space/>became the last<space/><link><target>Durrani dynasty</target><part>Durrani ruler</part></link>, who first reigned between 1803 and 1809, and again from 1839 to 1842.</part></link>To justify his plan, the<space/><link><target>Governor-General of India</target></link><space/>Lord Auckland issued the<space/><link><target>Simla Manifesto</target></link><space/>in October 1838, setting forth the necessary reasons for British intervention in Afghanistan. The manifesto stated that in order to ensure the welfare of India, the British must have a trustworthy ally on India's western frontier. The British pretense that their troops were merely supporting<space/><link><target>Shah Shujah Durrani</target><part>Shah Shujah's</part></link><space/>small army in retaking what was once his throne fooled no one. Although the Simla Manifesto stated that British troops would be withdrawn as soon as Shuja was installed in Kabul, Shuja's rule depended entirely on British arms to suppress rebellion and on British funds to buy the support of tribal chiefs. The British denied that they were invading Afghanistan, instead claiming they were merely supporting its legitimate Shuja government &quot;against foreign interference and factious opposition&quot;.<link><target>File:Britattack.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part><link><target>Battle of Ghazni</target></link></part></link>In November 1841 insurrection and massacre flared up in Kabul. The British vacillated and disagreed and were beleaguered in their inadequate cantonments. The British negotiated with the most influential sirdars, cut off as they were by winter and insurgent tribes from any hope of relief. Mohammad Akbar Khan, son of the captive Dost Mohammad, arrived in Kabul and became effective leader of the sirdars. At a conference with them Sir William MacNaghten was killed, but in spite of this, the sirdars' demands were agreed to by the British and they withdrew. During the withdrawal they were attacked by<space/><link><target>Ghilzai</target></link><space/>tribesmen and in running battles through the snowbound passes nearly the entire column of<space/><link><target>Massacre of Elphinstone's Army</target><part>4,500 troops and 12,000 camp followers were killed</part></link>. Of the British only one, Dr.<space/><link><target>William Brydon</target></link>, reached Jalalabad, while a few others were captured.</paragraph><paragraph>Afghan forces loyal to Akbar Khan besieged the remaining British contingents at Kandahar, Ghazni and Jalalabad. Ghazni fell, but the other garrisons held out, and with the help of reinforcements from India their besiegers were defeated. While preparations were under way for a renewed advance on Kabul, the new Governor-General<space/><link><target>Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough</target><part>Lord Ellenborough</part></link><space/>ordered British forces to leave Afghanistan after securing the release of the prisoners from Kabul and taking reprisals. The forces from Kandahar and Jalalabad again defeated Akbar Khan, retook Ghazni and Kabul, inflicted widespread devastation and rescued the prisoners before withdrawing through the Khyber Pass.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Mid-nineteenth century</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Sher Ali Khan with Cd Charles Chamberlain and Sir Richard F.

In the following decade, Dost Mohammad concentrated his efforts on reconquering Mazari Sharif, Konduz, Badakhshan, and Kandahar. Mohammad Akbar Khan died in 1845. During the<space/><link><target>Second Anglo-Sikh War</target></link><space/>(184849), Dost Mohammad's last effort to take Peshawar failed.</paragraph><paragraph>By 1854 the British wanted to resume relations with Dost Mohammad, whom they had essentially ignored in the intervening twelve years. The 1855<space/><link><target>Treaty of Peshawar</target></link><space/>reopened diplomatic relations, proclaimed respect for each side's territorial integrity, and pledged both sides as friends of each other's friends and enemies of each other's enemies.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1857 an addendum to the 1855 treaty permitted a British military mission to become a presence in Kandahar (but not Kabul) during a conflict with the<space/><link><target>Qajar dynasty</target><part>Persians</part></link>, who had attacked Herat in 1856. During the<space/><link><target>Indian Rebellion of 1857</target></link>, some British officials suggested restoring Peshawar to Dost Mohammad, in return for his support against the rebellious<space/><link><target>sepoy</target><trail>s</trail></link><space/>of the Bengal Army, but this view was rejected by British political officers on the North West frontier, who believed that Dost Mohammad would see this as a sign of weakness and turn against the British.<extension extension_name='ref'><list type='bullet'><listitem><template><target>cite book</target><arg name="last">Allen</arg><arg name="first">Charles</arg><arg name="authorlink">Charles Allen (writer)</arg><arg name="title">Soldier Sahibs</arg><arg name="publisher">Abacus</arg><arg name="year">2000</arg><arg name="isbn">0-349-11456-0</arg><arg name="page">283</arg></template></listitem></list></extension></paragraph><paragraph>In 1863 Dost Mohammad retook Herat with British acquiescence.

By the time Sher Ali had established control in Kabul in 1868, he found the British ready to support his regime with arms and funds, but nothing more. Over the next ten years, relations between the Afghan ruler and Britain deteriorated steadily. The Afghan ruler was worried about the southward encroachment of<space/><link><target>Russia</target></link>, which by 1873 had taken over the lands of the khan, or ruler, of<space/><link><target>Khiva</target></link>. Sher Ali sent an envoy seeking British advice and support. The previous year the British had signed an agreement with the Russians in which the latter agreed to respect the northern boundaries of Afghanistan and to view the territories of the Afghan Emir as outside their sphere of influence. The British, however, refused to give any assurances to the disappointed Sher Ali.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Second Anglo-Afghan War, 18781880</heading><paragraph><template><target>See also</target><arg>Second Anglo-Afghan War</arg></template><link><target>File:Mohammad Yaqub Khan with British officers in May of 1879.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>King<space/><link><target>Mohammad Yaqub Khan</target></link><space/>with Britain's<space/><link><target>Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari</target><part>Sir Pierre Cavagnari</part></link><space/>on 26 May 1879, when the<space/><link><target>Treaty of Gandamak</target></link><space/>was signed.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>After tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878<space/><link><target>Congress of Berlin</target></link>, Russia turned its attention to Central Asia.

A British force of about 40,000 fighting men was distributed into military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. An alarmed Sher Ali attempted to appeal in person to the tsar for assistance, but unable to do so, he returned to<space/><link><target>Mazari Sharif</target></link>, where he died on 21 February 1879.</paragraph><paragraph>With British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Ali's son and successor,<space/><link><target>Mohammad Yaqub Khan</target></link>, signed the Treaty of Gandamak in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to the British. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the Khyber and<space/><link><target>Michni Pass</target><part>Michni passes</part></link>, and Afghanistan ceded various<space/><link><target>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</target><part>frontier</part></link><space/><link><target>Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)</target><part>areas</part></link><space/>and Quetta to Britain. The British army then withdrew.

The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub's brother<space/><link><target>Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)</target><part>Ayub Khan</part></link><space/>on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin Abdur Rahman Khan as emir instead. Ayub Khan, who had been serving as governor of Herat, rose in revolt, defeated a British detachment at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Maiwand</target></link><space/>in July 1880 and besieged Kandahar. Roberts then led the main British force from Kabul and decisively defeated Ayub Khan in September at the<space/><link><target>Battle of Kandahar</target></link>, bringing his rebellion to an end. Abdur Rahman had confirmed the Treaty of Gandamak, leaving the British in control of the territories ceded by Yaqub Khan and ensuring British control of Afghanistan's foreign policy in exchange for protection and a subsidy. Abandoning the provocative policy of maintaining a British resident in Kabul, but having achieved all their other objectives, the British withdrew.</paragraph><heading level='2'>The Iron Amir, 18801901</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Abdur Rahman Khan sitting.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part><link><target>Emir</target><part>Amir</part></link><space/><link><target>Abdur Rahman Khan</target></link><space/>(''The Iron Amir'') in 1897.</part></link>As far as British interests were concerned,<space/><link><target>Abdur Rahman Khan</target><part>Abdur Rahman</part></link><space/>answered their prayers: a forceful, intelligent leader capable of welding his divided people into a state; and he was willing to accept limitations to his power imposed by British control of his country's foreign affairs and the British buffer state policy. His twenty-one-year reign was marked by efforts to modernize and establish control of the kingdom, whose boundaries were delineated by the two empires bordering it. Abdur Rahman turned his considerable energies to what evolved into the creation of the modern state of Afghanistan.</paragraph><paragraph>He achieved this consolidation of Afghanistan in three ways. He suppressed various rebellions and followed up his victories with harsh punishment, execution, and deportation. He broke the stronghold of Pashtun tribes by forcibly transplanting them. He transplanted his most powerful Pashtun enemies, the<space/><link><target>Ghilzai</target></link>, and other tribes from southern and south-central Afghanistan to areas north of the Hindu Kush with predominantly non-Pashtun populations. The last non-Muslim Afghans of<space/><link><target>Kafiristan</target></link><space/>north of Kabul were forcefully converted to Islam. Finally, he created a system of provincial governorates different from old tribal boundaries. Provincial governors had a great deal of power in local matters, and an army was placed at their disposal to enforce tax collection and suppress dissent. Abdur Rahman kept a close eye on these governors, however, by creating an effective intelligence system. During his reign, tribal organization began to erode as provincial government officials allowed land to change hands outside the traditional clan and tribal limits.</paragraph><paragraph>In addition to forging a nation from the splintered regions comprising Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman tried to modernize his kingdom by forging a regular army and the first institutionalized<space/><link><target>bureaucracy</target></link>. Despite his distinctly<space/><link><target>authoritarian personality</target></link>, Abdur Rahman called for a<space/><link><target>loya jirga</target></link>, an assemblage of royal princes, important notables, and religious leaders. According to his autobiography, Abdur Rahman had three goals: subjugating the tribes, extending government control through a strong, visible army, and reinforcing the power of the ruler and the royal family.<link><target>File:Afghanmap1893.JPG</target><part>left</part><part>thumb</part><part>300px</part><part>Maps showing the boundary of Afghanistan before the 1893<space/><link><target>Durand Line</target><part>Durand Line Treaty</part></link>.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>During his visit to Rawalpindi in 1885, the Amir requested the Viceroy of India to depute a Muslim Envoy to Kabul having noble birth and of ruling family background. Mirza Atta Ullah Khan, Sardar Bahadur s/o Khan Bahadur Mirza Fakir Ullah Khan (Saman Burj Wazirabad), a direct descendent of Jarral Rajput Rajas of Rajauri was selected and approved by the Amir to be the British Envoy to Kabul.</paragraph><paragraph>Abdur Rahman also paid attention to technological advancement. He brought foreign physicians, engineers (especially for mining), geologists, and printers to Afghanistan. He imported European machinery and encouraged the establishment of small factories to manufacture soap, candles, and leather goods. He sought European technical advice on communications, transport, and irrigation. Local Afghan tribes strongly resisted this modernization. Workmen making roads had to be protected by the army against local warriors. Nonetheless, despite these sweeping internal policies, Abdur Rahman's foreign policy was completely in foreign hands.</paragraph><paragraph>The first important frontier dispute was the<space/><link><target>Panjdeh</target></link><space/>crisis of 1885, precipitated by Russian encroachment into Central Asia. Having seized the<space/><link><target>Merv</target></link><space/>(now Mary) Oasis by 1884, Russian forces were directly adjacent to Afghanistan. Claims to the<space/><link><target>Panjdeh Oasis</target></link><space/>were in debate, with the Russians keen to take over all the region's Turkoman domains. After battling Afghan forces in the spring of 1885, the Russians seized the oasis. Russian and British troops were quickly alerted, but the two powers reached a compromise; Russia was in possession of the oasis, and Britain believed it could keep the Russians from advancing any farther. Without an Afghan say in the matter, the<space/><link><target>Afghan Boundary Commission</target><part>Joint Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission</part></link><space/>agreed the Russians would relinquish the farthest territory captured in their advance but retain Panjdeh. This agreement on these border sections delineated for Afghanistan a permanent northern frontier at the Amu Darya but also the loss of much territory, especially around Panjdeh.</paragraph><paragraph>The second section of Afghan border demarcated during Abdur Rahman's reign was in the<space/><link><target>Wakhan</target></link>. The British insisted Abdur Rahman accept sovereignty over this remote region where unruly Kyrgyz held sway, he had no choice but to accept Britain's compromise. In 1895 and 1896 another Joint Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission agreed on the frontier boundary to the far northeast of Afghanistan, which bordered Chinese territory (although the Chinese did not formally accept this as a boundary between the two countries until 1964.)</paragraph><paragraph>For Abdur Rahman, delineating the boundary with India (through the Pashtun area) was far more significant, and it was during his reign that the Durand Line was drawn. Under pressure, Abdur Rahman agreed in 1893 to accept a mission headed by the British Indian foreign secretary, Sir<space/><link><target>Mortimer Durand</target></link>, to define the limits of British and Afghan control in the Pashtun territories. Boundary limits were agreed on by Durand and Abdur Rahman before the end of 1893, but there is some question about the degree to which Abdur Rahman willingly ceded certain regions. There were indications that he regarded the Durand Line as a delimitation of separate areas of political responsibility, not a permanent international frontier, and that he did not explicitly cede control over certain parts (such as<space/><link><target>Kurram Valley</target><part>Kurram</part></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Chitral</target></link>) that were already in British control under the Treaty of Gandamak.</paragraph><paragraph>The Durand Line cut through tribes and bore little relation to the realities of<space/><link><target>demography</target></link><space/>or military strategy. The line laid the foundation not for peace between the border regions, but for heated disagreement between the governments of Afghanistan and British India, and later, Afghanistan and Pakistan over what came to be known as the issue of<space/><link><target>Pashtunistan</target></link><space/>or 'Land of the Pashtuns'. (See<space/><link><target>Siege of Malakand</target></link>).</paragraph><paragraph>The clearest manifestation that Abdur Rahman had established control in Afghanistan was the peaceful succession of his eldest son,<space/><link><target>Habibullah Khan</target></link>, to the throne on his father's death in October 1901. Although Abdur Rahman had fathered many children, he groomed Habibullah to succeed him, and he made it difficult for his other sons to contest the succession by keeping power from them and sequestering them in Kabul under his control.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Habibullah Khan, 19011919</heading><paragraph><link><target>File:Habibullah Khan of Afghanistan in 1893.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>150px</part><part><link><target>Habibullah Khan</target></link>, eldest son of Abur Rahman Khan, in 1893.</part></link>Habibullah Khan, Abdur Rahman Khan's eldest son and child of a slave mother, kept a close watch on the palace intrigues revolving around his father's more distinguished wife (a granddaughter of Dost Mohammad), who sought the throne for her own son.

The 1907<space/><link><target>Anglo-Russian Entente</target></link><space/>(the<space/><link><target>Convention of St. Petersburg</target></link>) not only divided the region into separate areas of Russian and British influence but also established foundations for Afghan neutrality.

Britain, for its part, would not occupy or annex Afghan territory, or interfere in Afghanistan's internal affairs.</paragraph><paragraph>During<space/><link><target>World War I</target></link>, Afghanistan remained neutral despite pressure to support<space/><link><target>Turkey</target></link><space/>when its sultan proclaimed his nation's participation in what it considered a holy war. Habibullah did, however, entertain an<space/><link><target>Niedermayer-Hentig Mission</target><part>Indo-German-Turkish mission</part></link><space/>in Kabul in 1915 that had as its titular head the Indian nationalist<space/><link><target>Mahendra Pratap</target></link><space/>and was led by<space/><link><target>Oskar Niedermayer</target></link><space/>and the German legate<space/><link><target>Werner Otto von Hentig</target></link>. After much procrastination, he won an agreement from the<space/><link><target>Central Powers</target></link><space/>for a huge payment and arms provision in exchange for attacking British India. But the crafty Afghan ruler clearly viewed the war as an opportunity to play one side off against the other, for he also offered the British to resist a Central Powers attack on India in exchange for an end to British control of Afghan foreign policy.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Third Anglo-Afghan War and Independence</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Third Anglo-Afghan War</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Amanullah's ten years of reign initiated a period of dramatic change in Afghanistan in both foreign and domestic politics. Amanullah declared full independence and sparked the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Amanullah altered foreign policy in his new relations with external powers and transformed domestic politics with his social, political, and economic reforms. Although his reign ended abruptly, he achieved some notable successes, and his efforts failed as much due to the centrifugal forces of tribal Afghanistan and the machinations of Russia and Britain as to any political folly on his part.</paragraph><paragraph>Amanullah came to power just as the entente between Russia and Britain broke down following the<space/><link><target>Russian Revolution of 1917</target></link>. Once again Afghanistan provided a stage on which the great powers played out their schemes against one another. Keen to modernise his country and free it from foreign domination, Amanullah, sought to shore up his powerbase. Amidst intrigue in the Afghan court, and political and civil unrest in India, he sought to divert attention from the internal divisions of Afghanistan and unite all faction behind him by attacking the British.<extension extension_name='ref'>Barthorp, p. 151</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Using the civil unrest in India as an excuse to move troops to the Durand Line, Afghan troops crossed the border at the western end of the Khyber Pass on 3 May 1919 and occupied the village of Bagh, the scene of an earlier uprising in April.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Wilkinson-Latham &amp; McBride, p. 23">Wilkinson-Latham &amp; McBride, p. 23</extension><space/>In response, the Indian government ordered a full mobilisation and on 6 May 1919 declared war. For the British it had come at a time when they were still recovering from the First World War. The troops that were stationed in India were mainly reserves and Territorials, who were awaiting demobilisation and keen to return to Britain, whilst the few regular regiments that were available were tired and depleted from five years of fighting.<extension extension_name='ref' name="Wilkinson-Latham &amp; McBride, p. 23"></extension></paragraph><paragraph>Afghan forces achieved success in the initial days of the war, taking the British and Indians by surprise in two main thrusts as the Afghan regular army was joined by large numbers of Pashtun tribesmen from both sides of the border. A series of skirmishes then followed as the British and Indians recovered from their initial surprise. As a counterbalance to deficiencies in manpower and morale, the British had a considerable advantage in terms of equipment, possessing machine guns, armoured cars, motor transport, wireless communications and aircraft and it was the latter that would prove decisive.<extension extension_name='ref'>Barthorp, p. 152</extension></paragraph><paragraph>British forces used airpower to shock the Afghans, and the King's home was directly attacked in what is the first case of aerial bombardment in Afghanistan's history. The attacks played a key role in forcing an armistice but brought an angry rebuke from King Amanullah. He wrote: &quot;It is a matter of great regret that the throwing of bombs by zeppelins on London was denounced as a most savage act and the bombardment of places of worship and sacred spots was considered a most abominable operation. While we now see with our own eyes that such operations were a habit which is prevalent among all civilized people of the west&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Singer, pp. 192193</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The fighting concluded in August 1919 and Britain virtually dictated the terms of the<space/><link><target>Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919</target></link>, a temporary armistice that provided, on one somewhat ambiguous interpretation, for Afghan self-determination in foreign affairs.<extension extension_name='ref'>Balthorp, p. 157</extension><space/>Before final negotiations were concluded in 1921, however, Afghanistan had already begun to establish its own foreign policy without repercussions anyway, including diplomatic relations with the new government in the Soviet Union in 1919. During the 1920s, Afghanistan established diplomatic relations with most major countries.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Amanullah Khan, 19191929</heading><paragraph><template><target>Main</target><arg>Reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war</arg></template><link><target>File:King Amanullah of Afghanistan.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>upright</part><part><link><target>Amanullah Khan</target><part>King Amanullah</part></link>, third son of Habibullah Khan.</part></link></paragraph><paragraph>On 20 February 1919, Habibullah Khan was assassinated on a hunting trip.

But, because Amanullah controlled both the national treasury and the army, Amanullah was well situated to seize power. The army's support allowed Amanullah to suppress other claims and imprison those relatives who would not swear loyalty to him. Within a few months, the new amir had gained the allegiance of most tribal leaders and established control over the cities.<link><target>File:Women of Afghanistan in 1927.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>Family life of Afghan politicians in 1927.</part></link><link><target>File:Atatrk ve Amanullah Han.jpg</target><part>thumb</part><part>left</part><part>King Amanullah in 1928, the scope of the European tour with<space/><link><target>Mustafa Kemal Atatrk</target></link><space/>in<space/><link><target>Turkey</target></link>.</part></link>Amanullah Khan's reforms were heavily influenced by Europe. This came through the influence of Mahmud Tarzi, who was both Amanullah Khan's father-in-law and Foreign Minister. Mahmud Tarzi, a highly educated, well-traveled<space/><link><target>poet</target></link>,<space/><link><target>journalist</target></link>, and<space/><link><target>diplomat</target></link>, was a key figure that brought Western dress and etiquette to Afghanistan. He also fought for progressive reforms such as woman's rights, educational rights, and freedom of press. All of these influences, brought by Tarzi and others, were welcomed by Amanullah Khan.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1926, Amanullah ended the Emirate of Afghanistan and proclaimed the<space/><link><target>Kingdom of Afghanistan</target></link><space/>with himself as king. In 1927 and 1928, King Amanullah Khan and his wife<space/><link><target>Soraya Tarzi</target></link><space/>visited Europe. On this trip they were honored and feted. In fact, in 1928 the King and Queen of Afghanistan received honorary degrees from<space/><link><target>Oxford University</target></link>. This was an era when other Muslim nations, like Turkey and Egypt were also on the path to<space/><link><target>modernization</target></link>. King Amanullah was so impressed with the social progress of Europe that he tried to implement them right away, this met with heavy resistance from the conservative sect and eventually led to his demise.</paragraph><paragraph>Amanullah enjoyed early popularity within Afghanistan and he used his power to modernize the country. Amanullah created new cosmopolitan schools for both boys and girls in the region and overturned centuries-old traditions such as strict dress codes for women. He created a new capital city and increased trade with Europe and Asia. He also advanced a modernist constitution that incorporated equal rights and individual freedoms. This rapid modernization though, created a backlash, and a reactionary uprising known as the<space/><italics>Khost rebellion</italics><space/>which was suppressed in 1924.</paragraph><paragraph>After Amanullah travelled to Europe in late 1927, opposition to his rule increased. An uprising in<space/><link><target>Jalalabad</target></link><space/>culminated in a march to the capital, and much of the army deserted rather than resist. On 14 January 1929, Amanullah abdicated in favor of his brother, King<space/><link><target>Inayatullah Khan</target></link>. On 17 January, Inayatullah abdicated and<space/><link><target>Habibullah Kalakani</target></link><space/>became the next ruler of Afghanistan and restored the emirate. However, his rule was short lived and, on 17 October 1929, Habibullah Kalakani was overthrown and replaced by King<space/><link><target>Nadir Khan</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>After his abdication in 1929, Amanullah went into temporary exile in India. When he attempted to return to Afghanistan, he had little support from the people.

Meanwhile, Nadir Khan made sure his return to Afghanistan was impossible by engaging in a propaganda war.
