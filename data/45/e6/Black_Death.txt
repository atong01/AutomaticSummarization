==Chronology==

===Origins of the disease===
{{Main|Black Death migration}}
The plague disease, caused by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', is [[enzootic]] (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground [[rodent]]s, including [[marmot]]s, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=25}} [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] graves dating to 1338–9 near [[Issyk Kul|Lake Issyk Kul]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]] have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Paleomicrobiology: Past Human Infections |last1=Raoult |last2=Drancourt |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=152 |ref=harv}}</ref> In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China.<ref name=china>{{cite news |author=[[Nicholas Wade]] |title=Europe’s Plagues Came From China, Study Finds |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=31 October 2010 |accessdate=1 November 2010 }}
</ref> In China, the 13th century [[Mongol invasion of China|Mongol conquest]] caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th&nbsp;century. In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after.<ref>The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368, p.585</ref> Epidemics which may have included plague killed an estimated 25&nbsp;million Chinese and other Asians during the 15&nbsp;years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.<ref>{{Cite book | first = George C. | last = Kohn | title = Encyclopedia of plague and pestilence: from ancient times to the present  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tzRwRmb09rgC&pg=PA31&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false | publisher = Infobase Publishing | year = 2008 | page = 31 | isbn = 0-8160-6935-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Sussman GD | title = Was the black death in India and China? | journal = Bulletin of the history of medicine | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 319–55 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22080795 | doi = 10.1353/bhm.2011.0054 | url = http://contagions.wordpress.com/2011/11/26/did-india-and-china-escape-the-black-death/ }}</ref>

The disease may have travelled along the Silk Road with [[Mongols|Mongol]] armies and traders or it could have come via ship.<ref>
{{Cite journal |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8102278/Black-Death-may-have-originated-in-China.html |title=Black Death may have originated in China |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=1 November 2010 |ref=harv}}</ref> By the end of 1346, reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: "India was depopulated, Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with dead bodies".<ref>{{harvnb|Hecker|1859|p=21}} cited by Ziegler, p. 15.</ref>

Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] traders at the port city of [[Feodosia|Kaffa]] in the [[Crimea]] in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted the infected corpses over the [[Defensive wall|city walls]] of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into [[Sicily]] and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/blackdeath.html |title=Channel 4 – History – The Black Death |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=3 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625094232/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/blackdeath.html |archivedate=25 June 2008}}</ref> Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.

===European outbreak===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=The seventh year after it began, it came to England and first began in the towns and ports joining on the seacoasts, in Dorsetshire, where, as in other counties, it made the country quite void of inhabitants so that there were almost none left alive.<br />... But at length it came to Gloucester, yea even to Oxford and to London, and finally it spread over all England and so wasted the people that scarce the tenth person of any sort was left alive.|source=[[Geoffrey the Baker]], ''Chronicon Angliae''}}

There appear to have been several introductions into Europe. The plague reached Sicily in October 1347, carried by twelve Genoese galleys,<ref>
Michael of Piazza (Platiensis) ''Bibliotheca scriptorum qui res in Sicilia gestas retulere'' Vol 1, p. 562, cited in Ziegler, 1998, p. 40.</ref> and rapidly spread all over the island. Galleys from [[Feodosia|Kaffa]] reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348, but it was the outbreak in Pisa a few weeks later that was the entry point to northern Italy. Towards the end of January, one of the galleys expelled from Italy arrived in [[Marseille]].<ref>De Smet, Vol II, ''Breve Chronicon'', p. 15.</ref>

From Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at [[Askøy]], then spread to Bjørgvin (modern [[Bergen]]) and [[Iceland]].<ref>

The plague was somewhat less common in parts of Europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours, including the [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Kingdom of Poland]], the majority of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent.<ref>Zuchora-Walske, Christine, Poland, North Mankato: ABDO Publishing, 2013</ref><ref>Welford, Mark, and Brian H.

Modern researchers do not think that the plague ever became endemic in Europe or its rat population. The disease repeatedly wiped out the rodent carriers so that the fleas died out until a new outbreak from Central Asia repeated the process. The outbreaks have been shown to occur roughly 15 years after a warmer and wetter period in areas where plague is endemic in other species such as gerbils.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bubonic plague was a serial visitor in European Middle Ages|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bubonic-plague-was-serial-visitor-european-middle-ages|first= Kate |last=Baggaley|date=Feb 24, 2015|publisher=Science News|accessdate=Feb 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Schmid|first=Boris V.|year=2015|title=Climate-driven introduction of the Black Death and successive plague reintroductions into Europe|journal=Proc National Academy of Sciences|doi=10.1073/pnas.1412887112|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/02/20/1412887112|accessdate=Feb 24, 2015}}</ref>

===Middle Eastern outbreak===
The plague struck various countries in the Middle East during the [[pandemic]], leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As it spread to western Europe, the disease entered the region from southern Russia also. By autumn 1347, the plague reached [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, probably through the port's trade with [[Constantinople]], and ports on the [[Black Sea]]. During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to [[Gaza City|Gaza]], and north along the eastern coast to cities in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], including [[Ashkelon]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Sidon]], [[Damascus]], [[Homs]], and [[Aleppo]]. In 1348–49, the disease reached [[Antioch]]. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Mecca]] became infected in 1349. During the same year, records show the city of [[Mosul|Mawsil]] (Mosul) suffered a massive epidemic, and the city of Baghdad experienced a second round of the disease. In 1351 [[Yemen]] experienced an outbreak of the plague, coinciding with the return of [[King Mujahid]] of Yemen from imprisonment in [[Cairo]]. His party may have brought the disease with them from Egypt.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Swollen lymph glands (''buboes'') often occur in the neck, armpit and groin (''inguinal'') regions of plague victims]]Contemporary accounts of the plague are often varied or imprecise. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of [[bubo]]es (or gavocciolos) in the groin, the neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened.<ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9/> [[Boccaccio]]'s description is graphic:

{{quotation|In men and women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain tumours in the groin or armpits, some of which grew as large as a common apple, others as an egg...From the two said parts of the body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the malady began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large, now minute and numerous. As the gavocciolo had been and still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also were these spots on whomsoever they showed themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Giovanni Boccaccio|title=[[Decameron]]|year=1351|ref=harv}}</ref>}}

The only medical detail that is questionable is the infallibility of approaching death, as if the bubo discharges, recovery is possible.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=18,19}}

This was followed by acute fever and vomiting of blood. Most victims died two to seven days after initial infection. Freckle-like spots and rashes<ref>D. Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1997), p. 29.</ref> which could be caused by flea-bites as another potential sign of the plague.

Some accounts, like that of Louis Heyligen, a musician in [[Avignon]] who died of the plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease which infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems<ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9/> and which is identified with [[pneumonic plague]].

{{quotation|It is said that the plague takes three forms. In the first people suffer an infection of the lungs, which leads to breathing difficulties.

==Naming==
The phrase "black death" (''atra mors'') is ancient, derived from   Homeric Greek<ref>In Homer's ''Odyssey'', Scylla's mouth is said to contain  rows of teeth "full of black death" (πλείοι μέλανος θανάτοιο).</ref> and adopted in classical Latin. It is in origin a poetic characterisation of death as dark and terrible (''[[:wikt:ater#Latin|ater]]'' "black" having the overtones of "gloomy, sad, dismal, unlucky") not used specifically of epidemics or the bubonic plague. The 12th-century  French physician [[Gilles de Corbeil]] in his ''De signis et sinthomatibus egritudinum'' (On the signs and symptoms of diseases) used it to refer to a pestilential fever (''febris pestilentialis'') <ref>See:  Stephen d'Irsay (May 1926) "Notes to the origin of the expression:  atra mors," ''Isis'', '''8''' (2) :  328-332.</ref>

Writers contemporary to the plague referred to the event as the "Great Mortality",{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} or the "Great Plague".{{clarify|date=May 2015}}<ref name=Bennet&Hollister2006>J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 326.</ref>
The phrase "Black Death" (''mors nigra'') is used in 1350 by Simon de Covino (or Couvin), a Belgian astronomer, who wrote the poem "''De judicio Solis in convivio Saturni''" (On the judgment of the Sun at a feast of Saturn) in which he attributed the plague to a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn.<ref>
*  On page 22 of the manuscript in [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9078277z/f25.image Gallica], Simon mentions the phrase "''mors nigra''" (Black Death):  "''Cum rex finisset oracula judiciorum / Mors nigra surrexit, et gentes reddidit illi'';" (When the king ended the oracles of judgment / Black Death arose, and the nations surrendered to him;).
*  A more legible copy of the poem appears in:  Emile Littré (1841) [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bec_0373-6237_1841_num_2_1_451584?_Prescripts_Search_tabs1=standard& "Opuscule relatif à la peste de 1348, composé par un contemporain"]  (Work concerning the plague of 1348, composed by a contemporary), ''Bibliothèque de l'école des chartes'', '''2''' (2) :  201-243; see especially page 228.

Gasquet (1908) claimed that the Latin name ''atra mors'' (Black Death) for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on Danish history by [[Johan Isaksson Pontanus|J.I. Pontanus]]:  "''Vulgo & ab effectu ''atram mortem'' vocatibant.'' ("Commonly and from its effects, they called it the black death").<ref>Francis Aidan Gasquet, ''The Black Death of 1348 and 1349'', 2nd ed.

</ref> 
The  name spread through Scandinavia and then Germany, gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a proper name.<ref>The German physician [[Justus Friedrich Karl Hecker|Justus Hecker]] (1795–1850) cited the phrase in Icelandic (''Svartur Daudi''), Danish (''den sorte Dod''), etc.  See:  J.F.C. Hecker, ''Der schwarze Tod im vierzehnten Jahrhundert'' [The Black Death in the Fourteenth Century] (Berlin, (Germany):  Friedr. Aug. Herbig, 1832), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LhoqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false page 3.]</ref>  In England, it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the Black Death.<ref>The name "Black Death" first appeared in English in:
*  "Mrs. Markham" (pen name of Elizabeth Penrose (née Cartwright)), ''A History of England'' ... (Edinburgh, Scotland:  Archibald Constable, 1823).  In the 1829 edition, the relevant text appeared on pages 249-250, where, about the English king Edward III, she wrote:  "Edward's successes in France were interrupted during the next six years by a most terrible pestilence — so terrible as to be called the black death — which raged throughout Europe, and proved a greater scourge to the people than even the calamities of war."  (For further information about this book and Mrs. Penrose, see:  [[s:Penrose, Elizabeth (DNB00)|Wikisource]] and [http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=21889&back= the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]).

The name "Black Death" was spread more widely when in 1833, Benjamin Guy Babington published an English translation of J.F.C. Hecker's book ''Der schwarze Tod im vierzehnten Jahrhundert'' as:  J.F.C. Hecker with Benjamin Guy Babington, trans., ''The Black Death in the Fourteenth Century'' (London, England:  A. Schloss, 1833).

Medical knowledge had stagnated during the [[Middle Ages]]. The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the [[Philip VI of France|king of France]] that blamed the heavens, in the form of a [[Conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] of three planets in 1345 that caused a "great pestilence in the air".{{sfn|Horrox|1994|p=159}} This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory. The word 'plague' had no special significance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.

The importance of hygiene was recognised only in the nineteenth century; until then it was common that the streets were filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding. A transmissible disease will spread easily in such conditions. One development as a result of the Black Death was the establishment of the idea of [[quarantine]] in [[Dubrovnik]] in 1377 after continuing outbreaks.<ref>

The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] theory, which attributes the outbreak to ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist [[Alexandre Yersin]], after whom the pathogen was named ''Yersinia pestis''.<ref name=Chritakos2005>{{cite book|first=George |last=Christakos |first2=Ricardo A. |last2=Olea |first3=Marc L. |last3=Serre |first4=Hwa-Lung |last4=Yu |first5=Lin-Lin |last5=Wang |title=Interdisciplinary Public Health Reasoning and Epidemic Modelling: the Case of Black Death |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |ISBN=3-540-25794-2 |pages=110–14}}</ref> The mechanism by which ''Y. pestis'' was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by [[Paul-Louis Simond]] and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose [[midgut]]s had become obstructed by replicating ''Y. pestis'' several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by [[vomiting|regurgitation]], resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human [[Epidemic typhus|epidemic]].<ref name=Chritakos2005/>

The historian [[Francis Aidan Gasquet]], who had written about the 'Great Pestilence' in 1893{{sfn|Gasquet|1893}} and suggested that "it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague" was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the [[Justinian plague]] that was prevalent in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from 541 to 700 CE.<ref name=Chritakos2005/>

Other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists. The modern [[bubonic plague]] has a [[mortality rate]] of 30–75% and symptoms including fever of {{convert|38|–|41|°C|°F}}, headaches, painful aching joints, [[nausea]] and vomiting, and a general feeling of [[malaise]]. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days.<ref>R. Totaro, ''Suffering in Paradise: The Bubonic Plague in English Literature from More to Milton'' (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 2005), p. 26.</ref> [[Pneumonic plague]] has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged [[sputum]]. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free flowing and bright red. [[Septicemic plague]] is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches ([[purpura]] due to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.{{sfn|Byrne|2004|p=8}}

In October 2010, the open-access scientific journal ''[[PLoS Pathogens]]'' published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998.<ref>

The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany

<blockquote>...ends the debate about the [[etiology]] of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that ''Y. pestis'' was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages.<ref name=Haensch2010/></blockquote>

The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related [[clade]]s (genetic branches) of the ''Y. pestis'' [[genome]] associated with medieval mass graves. These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern ''Y. pestis'' strains ''Y. p. orientalis'' and ''Y. p. medievalis'', suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of [[plague pit]] remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of [[Marseille]] around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of [[Bergen op Zoom]] showed the ''Y. pestis'' genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities or another site.<ref name=Haensch2010>{{cite journal | author = Haensch S, Bianucci R, Signoli M, Rajerison M, Schultz M, Kacki S, Vermunt M, Weston DA, Hurst D, Achtman M, Carniel E, Bramanti B | title = Distinct Clones of Yersinia pestis Caused the Black Death | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = e1001134 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20949072 | pmc = 2951374 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001134 | editor1-last = Besansky | editor1-first = Nora J }}</ref>

The results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended.

===Alternative explanations===
{{Main|Theories of the Black Death}}

The plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.<ref name=Chritakos2005/> In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002), [[David Herlihy]] (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).<ref name=Chritakos2005/>

It is recognised that an [[epidemiological]] account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the [[Domesday Book]] and the year 1377.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=233}} Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.

In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves.<ref name=Chritakos2005/> Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.<ref name=Chritakos2005/>

Walløe complains that all of these authors "take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat → rat flea → human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of ''Yersinia pestis'' infection could spread", whilst pointing to several other possibilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval and Modern Bubonic Plague: some clinical continuities|first =Lars|last=Walloe|page=69|series=Pestilential Complexities: Understanding Medieval Plague|editor=Vivian Nutton|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|year=2008|ref=harv}}

[[File:Anthrax PHIL 2033.png|thumb|[[Anthrax]] skin lesion]]
A variety of alternatives to the ''Y. pestis'' have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of [[anthrax]] and [[Norman Cantor|N. F. Cantor]] (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as ''hemorrhagic'' plague similar to [[Ebola]]. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the ''Y. pestis'' was spread from fleas on rats and argues that transmission must have been person to person.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=M.

In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of "blood poisoning") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.<ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9>{{harvnb|Byrne|2004|pp=21–9}}</ref> In 2014, scientists with [[Public Health England]] announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.<ref name=guardian/>

There are no exact figures for the [[infectious disease#Historic pandemics|death toll]]; the rate varied widely by locality.

<blockquote>The trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45–50% of the European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe, areas such as Italy, the south of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years consecutively, it was probably closer to 75–80% of the population. In Germany and England ... it was probably closer to 20%.<ref>[[Philip Daileader]], ''The Late Middle Ages'', audio/video course produced by [[The Teaching Company]], (2007) ISBN 978-1-59803-345-8.</ref></blockquote>

[[Leprosy|Lepers]], and other individuals with skin diseases such as [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or [[psoriasis]], were singled out and exterminated throughout Europe.

Because 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause, Europeans turned to astrological forces, earthquakes, and the poisoning of wells by Jews as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.<ref name=Bennet&Hollister2006/> The governments of Europe had no apparent response to the crisis because no one knew its cause or how it spread. The mechanism of infection and transmission of diseases was little understood in the 14th century; many people believed only God's anger could produce such horrific displays.

===Third plague pandemic===
{{Main|Third plague pandemic}}
The Third plague pandemic (1855–1859) started in China in the middle of the 19th century, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in India alone.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/321/5890/773 Infectious Diseases: Plague Through History], sciencemag.org</ref> Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia in 1900–25 resulted in well over 1,000 deaths, chiefly in Sydney. This led to the establishment of a Public Health Department there which undertook some leading-edge research on plague transmission from rat fleas to humans via the bacillus ''Yersinia pestis''.<ref>[http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/museum/mwmuseum/index.php/Bubonic_Plague_comes_to_Sydney_in_1900 Bubonic Plague comes to Sydney in 1900], University of Sydney, Sydney Medical School</ref>

==Treatment==
Modern treatment methods include [[insecticide]]s, the use of [[antibiotic]]s, and a [[Waldemar Haffkine#Anti-plague vaccine|plague vaccine]]. The [[Plague (disease)|plague]] bacterium could develop [[drug-resistance]] and again become a major health threat. One case of a drug-resistant form of the bacterium was found in [[Madagascar]] in 1995.<ref>[http://www.scidev.net/en/health/antibiotic-resistance/news/drugresistant-plague-a-major-threat-say-scient.html Drug-resistant plague a 'major threat', say scientists], SciDev.Net.</ref> A further outbreak in Madagascar was reported in November 2014.<ref>{{cite web
