'''Greg Broussard''' (born August 31, 1963 in [[Los Angeles, California]]), better known by his stage name '''Egyptian Lover,''' is an [[United States|American]] musician, vocalist, producer and DJ, and was an important part of the L.A. [[dance music]] and rap scene in the early 1980s.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==History==
The Egyptian Lover started out as a [[DJ]] in [[Los Angeles]] with [[Uncle Jam's Army]], DJing dances as large as the L.A. Sports Arena with 10,000 people. He began recording around Los Angeles in 1982 as a member of the Radio Crew, and also [[Uncle Jamm's Army]].

Most of The Egyptian Lover's successful recordings were 12" singles. He eventually released some of the earliest rap LPs, but they were less popular than his singles. On the strength of an alternate mix of his most popular single "[[Egypt, Egypt]]", 1984's ''On the Nile'' was moderately successful. After a break in the early 1990s, Egyptian Lover returned in 1994 with ''Back from the Tomb'', his last full-length album in over ten years.

The Egyptian Lover also established his own record company, Egyptian Empire Records, which included artists such as [[Rodney O & Joe Cooley]].
