BV is the most common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age.<ref name=NIH2013O>{{cite web|title=Bacterial Vaginosis (BV): Condition Information|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/bacterialvag/conditioninfo/Pages/default.aspx|website=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/|accessdate=3 March 2015|date=2013-05-21}}</ref> The percentage of women affected at any given time varies between 5% and 70%.<ref name=Ken2013/> BV is most common in parts of Africa and least common in Asia and Europe.<ref name=Ken2013/> In the United States about 30% of women between the ages of 14 and 49 are affected.<ref name=CDC2010Stats>{{cite web|title=Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Statistics Prevalence|url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/bv/stats.htm|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=3 March 2015|date=September 14, 2010}}</ref> Rates vary considerably between [[ethnic group]]s within a country.<ref name=Ken2013/> While BV like symptoms have been described for much of recorded history, the first clearly documented case occurred in 1894.<ref name=History1997/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Common symptoms include increased [[vaginal discharge]] that usually smells like fish.<!-- <ref name=NIH2013S/> --> The discharge is often white or gray in color.<!-- <ref name=NIH2013S/> --> There may be [[Dysuria|burning with urination]].<!-- <ref name=NIH2013S/> --> Occasionally there may be no symptoms.<ref name=NIH2013S/>

The discharge coats the walls of the vagina, and is usually without significant irritation, pain, or [[erythema]]  (redness), although mild [[Pruritus|itching]] can sometimes occur. By contrast, the normal vaginal discharge will vary in consistency and amount throughout the [[menstrual cycle]] and is at its clearest at [[ovulation]]—about 2 weeks before the [[menstruation|period]] starts. Some practitioners claim that BV can be asymptomatic in almost half of affected women,<ref name="pmid11120507">{{cite journal | author = Schwebke JR | title = Asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis: response to therapy | journal = Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. | volume = 183 | issue = 6 | pages = 1434–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11120507 | doi = 10.1067/mob.2000.107735 }}</ref> though others argue that this is often a misdiagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Forney LJ, Foster JA, Ledger W | title = The vaginal flora of healthy women is not always dominated by Lactobacillus species | journal = Journal of Infections Diseases | volume = 194 | issue = 10 | pages = 1468–9 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17054080 | doi = 10.1086/508497 }}</ref>

==Causes==
{{main|List of bacterial vaginosis microbiota}}
Healthy vaginal microbiota consists of species which do not cause symptoms, infections, or negatively affect pregnancy. It is dominated mainly by Lactobacillus species.<ref name="PetrovaLievens2015">{{cite journal|last1=Petrova|first1=Mariya I.|last2=Lievens|first2=Elke|last3=Malik|first3=Shweta|last4=Imholz|first4=Nicole|last5=Lebeer|first5=Sarah|title=Lactobacillus species as biomarkers and agents that can promote various aspects of vaginal health|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|volume=6|year=2015|issn=1664-042X|doi=10.3389/fphys.2015.00081}}</ref> BV is defined by the disequilibrium in the [[List of microbiota species of the lower reproductive tract of women|vaginal microbiota]] with decline in the number of [[lactobacilli]]. While the infection involves a number of bacteria, it is believed that most infections start with [[Gardnerella vaginalis]] creating a [[biofilm]] which allows other [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic bacteria]] to thrive.<ref name="ClarkTal2014"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=J.

One of the main risks for developing BV is [[douching]], which alters the vaginal flora and predisposes women to developing BV.<ref name="Cottrell">{{cite journal | author = Cottrell BH | title = An Updated Review of Evidence to Discourage Douching | journal = MCN, the American Journal of Maternal/Child Nursing | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–107; quiz 107–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20215951 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1097/NMC.0b013e3181cae9da }}</ref> Douching is strongly discouraged by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] and various medical authorities, for this and other reasons.<ref name="Cottrell" />

BV is a risk factor for [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and reproductive and obstetric disorders or negative outcomes.  <!--Although BV can be associated with [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], there is no clear evidence of sexual transmission.<ref name="Bradshaw2006">{{cite journal | author = Bradshaw CS, Morton AN, Hocking J, Garland SM, Morris MB, Moss LM, Horvath LB, Kuzevska I, Fairley CK | title = High recurrence rates of bacterial vaginosis over the course of 12 months after oral metronidazole therapy and factors associated with recurrence | journal = J.

Having a [[Women who have sex with women|female partner]] increases the risk of BV by 60%. The bacteria associated with BV have been isolated from [[Male reproductive system|male genitalia]]. BV microbiota have been found in the [[penis]], [[coronal sulcus]], and [[male urethra]], in the male partners of infected females. Those [[uncircumcised]] partners may act as a ‘[[Natural reservoir|reservoir]]’ increasing the likelihood of acquiring an infection after sexual intercourse. Another mode of transmission of BV associated microbiota is to a female sexual partner via the skin-to-skin transfer. BV may be transmitted via the perineal enteric bacteria from the microbiota of the female and male genitalia.<ref name=Amaya2015/>

== Diagnosis==
[[File:Bacterial vaginosis workup.jpg|thumb|A [[pH indicator]] to detect vaginal alkalinization (here showing approximately pH 8), and a [[microscope slide]] to microscopically detect [[clue cells]].]]
To make a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, a swab from inside the vagina should be obtained. These swabs should be tested for:
* A characteristic "fishy" odor on [[Wet mount#Wet mount or temporary mount|wet mount]]. This test, called the ''whiff test'', is performed by adding a small amount of [[potassium hydroxide]] to a [[microscopic slide]] containing the vaginal discharge. A characteristic [[fishy odor]] is considered a positive whiff test and is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.
* Loss of [[acidity]]. To control bacterial growth, the vagina is normally slightly acidic with a [[pH]] of 3.8–4.2. A swab of the discharge is put onto [[litmus paper]] to check its acidity. A pH greater than 4.5 is considered alkaline and is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.
* The presence of ''[[clue cell]]s'' on wet mount. Similar to the whiff test, the test for clue cells is performed by placing a drop of [[sodium chloride]] solution on a slide containing vaginal discharge. If present, clue cells can be visualized under a microscope. They are so-named because they give a clue to the reason behind the discharge. These are [[epithelial]] cells that are coated with bacteria.

Two positive results in addition to the discharge itself are enough to diagnose BV. If there is no discharge, then all three criteria are needed.<ref name = Amsel>{{cite journal | author = Amsel R, Totten PA, Spiegel CA, Chen KC, Eschenbach D, Holmes KK | title = Nonspecific vaginitis. Diagnostic criteria and microbial and epidemiologic associations | journal = Am. J. Med. | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–22 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6600371 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(83)91112-9 }}</ref>{{primary-source inline|date=December 2011}}
Differential diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis includes the following:<ref name=diagnosis>{{cite web|title=Diseases Characterized by Vaginal Discharge|url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/vaginal-discharge.htm|website=cdc.gov|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref>
*[[Vaginal discharge|Normal vaginal discharge]].
*[[Candidiasis]] (thrush, or a yeast infection).
*[[Trichomoniasis]], an infection caused by ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]''.

The Center For Disease Control (CDC) defines STIs as "a variety of clinical syndromes and infections caused by pathogens that can be acquired and transmitted through sexual activity."<ref>Workowski, Kimberly A. and Bolan, Gail A. Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2015. MMWR Recomm Rep 2015; volume 64, issue 3:p.1.</ref> But the CDC does not specifically identify BV as sexually transmitted infection.<ref name="cdc.gov"/>

=== Amsel criteria ===
In clinical practice BV can be diagnosed using the Amsel criteria:<ref name = Amsel/>

# Thin, white, yellow, homogeneous discharge
# [[Clue cell]]s on [[microscopy]]
# [[pH]] of vaginal fluid >4.5
# Release of a fishy odor on adding [[alkali]]—10% [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) solution.

At least three of the four criteria should be present for a confirmed diagnosis.<ref name=GCH>{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=11602 |title=National guideline for the management of bacterial vaginosis (2006) |work=Clinical Effectiveness Group, British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) }}</ref>
A modification of the Amsel criteria accepts the presence of two instead of three factors, and is considered equally diagnostic.

===Gram stain===
An alternative is to use a Gram-stained vaginal smear, with the Hay/Ison<ref name = HayIson>{{cite journal | author = Ison CA, Hay PE | title = Validation of a simplified grading of Gram stained vaginal smears for use in genitourinary medicine clinics | journal = Sex Transm Infect | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 413–5 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12473800 | pmc = 1758337 | doi = 10.1136/sti.78.6.413 }}</ref> criteria or the Nugent<ref name="Nugent1991">{{cite journal | author = Nugent RP, Krohn MA, Hillier SL | title = Reliability of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis is improved by a standardized method of gram stain interpretation | journal = J. Clin. Microbiol. | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 297–301 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1706728 | pmc = 269757 | url = http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1706728 }}</ref> criteria. The Hay/Ison criteria are defined as follows:<ref name=GCH/>
* Grade 1 (Normal): [[Lactobacillus]] morphotypes predominate.
* Grade 2 (Intermediate): Mixed flora with some Lactobacilli present, but Gardnerella or Mobiluncus morphotypes also present.
* Grade 3 (Bacterial Vaginosis): Predominantly Gardnerella and/or Mobiluncus morphotypes. Few or absent Lactobacilli. (Hay et al., 1994)
Gardnerella vaginalis is the main culprit in BV. Gardnerella vaginalis is a short rod (coccobacillus). Hence, the presence of clue cells and gram variable coccobacilli are indicative or diagnostic of bacterial vaginosis.

The standards for research are the Nugent criteria.<ref name="Nugent1991"/>  In this scale, a score of 0-10 is generated from combining three other scores. This method is time consuming and requires trained staff, but it has high [[Inter-observer reliability|interobserver reliability]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  The scores are as follows:
* 0–3 is considered negative for BV
* 4–6 is considered intermediate
* 7+ is considered indicative of BV.
At least 10–20 high power (1000× oil immersion) fields are counted and an average determined.

==Prevention==
Some steps suggested to lower the risk include: not [[douching]], avoiding sex, or limiting the number of sex partners.<ref name=CDCbv2014>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/bv/stdfact-bacterial-vaginosis.htm |title=Bacterial Vaginosis – CDC Fact Sheet |author= |date=March 11, 2014 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref>

Antibiotic treatment of male partners could re-establish the normal microbiota of the male uro-genital tract.

===Probiotics===
A 2009 Cochrane review found tentative but insufficient evidence for probiotics as a treatment for BV.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Senok|first1=AC|last2=Verstraelen|first2=H|last3=Temmerman|first3=M|last4=Botta|first4=GA|title=Probiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=7 October 2009|issue=4|pages=CD006289|pmid=19821358}}</ref> A 2014 review reached the same conclusion.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=H|last2=Song|first2=L|last3=Zhao|first3=W|title=Effects of probiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in adult women: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.|journal=Archives of gynecology and obstetrics|date=June 2014|volume=289|issue=6|pages=1225–34|pmid=24318276}}</ref> A 2013 review found some evidence supporting the use of probiotics during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=VandeVusse|first1=L|last2=Hanson|first2=L|last3=Safdar|first3=N|title=Perinatal outcomes of prenatal probiotic and prebiotic administration: an integrative review.|journal=The Journal of perinatal & neonatal nursing|date=2013|volume=27|issue=4|pages=288–301; quiz E1-2|pmid=24164813}}</ref>

==Complications==
Although previously considered a mere nuisance infection, untreated bacterial vaginosis may cause complications, such as increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections including HIV and [[pregnancy complication]]s.<ref name=Amaya2015/><ref name=CDC>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/bv/STDFact-Bacterial-Vaginosis.htm#Complications |title=STD Facts — Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) |accessdate=4 December 2007 |work=CDC| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071203214825/http://www.cdc.gov/std/bv/STDFact-Bacterial-Vaginosis.htm| archivedate= 3 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

It has been shown that HIV-infected women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) have higher HIV concentrations in their vaginal secretions.<ref>{{cite journal | author = | date = Jul 2005 | title = | url = | journal = J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 340–6 }}</ref> Diagnostic criteria for BV have also been associated with a female genital tract factor that induces expression of HIV.<ref name=Amaya2015/>  The elevated HIV copy number in vaginal secretions of women with BV has been associated with an increased risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV.<ref>{{cite journal | author = | year = 2012 | title = | url = | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 9 | issue = 6| page = e1001251 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001251 }}</ref>

There is evidence of an association between BV and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS.<ref name=Amaya2015/> BV is associated with up to a six-fold increase of HIV shedding. There is also a correlation between the absence of vaginal lactobacilli and infection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and [[Chlamydia trachomatis]]. BV is a risk factor for viral shedding and herpes virus type 2 infection. BV may increase the risk infection or reactivation of HPV.<ref name=Amaya2015/><ref name="SenokVerstraelen2009"/>

In addition, bacterial vaginosis an [[intercurrent disease in pregnancy]] may increase the risk of [[pregnancy complications]], most notably [[premature birth]] or [[miscarriage]].<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bacterialvaginosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx Bacterial vaginosis] from [[National Health Service]], UK. Page last reviewed: 03/10/2013</ref> Pregnant women with BV have a higher risk of  chorioamnionitis, miscarriage, preterm birth,  premature rupture of membranes, and postpartum endometritis.  BV is associated with gynaecological and obstetric complications. Data suggest an association between BV, tubal factor infertility, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Women with BV who are treated with vitro fertilization have a lower implantation rate and higher rates of early pregnancy loss.<ref name=Amaya2015/><ref name="SenokVerstraelen2009"/>

==Epidemiology==
BV is the most common infection of the vagina in women of reproductive age.<ref name=NIH2013O/> The percentage of women affected at any given time vary between 5% and 70%.<ref name=Ken2013/> BV is most common in parts of Africa and least common in Asia and Europe.<ref name=Ken2013/> In the United States about 30% of those between the ages of 14 and 49 are affected.<ref name=CDC2010Stats/> Rates vary considerably between ethnic groups within a country.<ref name=Ken2013/>
