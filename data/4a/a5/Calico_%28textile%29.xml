This caused grey cloth (calico that had not been finisheddyed or printed) to be imported instead, and these were printed in southern England with the popular patterns.

Polychromatic prints could be done, with two sets of blocks and an additional blue dye.

After 1880, profits from printing became smaller, there was over capacity and the firms started to form combines. The first was when 3 Scottish firms formed the United Turkey Red Co. Ltd in 1897, and the second, in 1899, was the much larger<space/><link><target>Calico Printers' Association</target></link>. 46 printing concerns and 13 merchants combined, representing 85% of the British printing capacity. Some of this capacity was removed and in 1901 they had 48% of the trade. In 1916, they and the other printers joined and formed a trade association. This then set minimum prices for each 'price section' of the industry. This held until 1954 when it was challenged by the government<space/><link><target>Monopolies Commission</target></link>.
