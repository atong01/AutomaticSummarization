He came over and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill said, 'Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red union suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark gray to make it look more ominous.' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action, and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn't leave fingerprints.<ref name">autogenerated1 /></arg></template></paragraph><heading level='3'>Subsequent creation credit</heading><paragraph>Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say &quot;Batman created by Bob Kane&quot;; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when<space/><link><target>Jerry Siegel</target></link><space/>and<space/><link><target>Joe Shuster</target></link><space/>began receiving a &quot;created by&quot; credit on the Superman titles, along with<space/><link><target>William Moulton Marston</target></link><space/>being given the byline for creating<space/><link><target>Wonder Woman</target></link>, Batman stories began saying &quot;Created by Bob Kane&quot; in addition to the other credits.</paragraph><paragraph>Finger did not receive the same recognition.

However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, &quot;Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career.

Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987.

In proper practice, the &quot;bat&quot; prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s<space/><link><target>Batman (TV series)</target><part>''Batman'' live-action television show</part></link><space/>and the<space/><italics><link><target>Super Friends</target></link></italics><space/>animated series) stretched the practice to<space/><link><target>Camp (style)</target><part>campy</part></link><space/>proportions.

The storyline &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the &quot;bat&quot; prefix on his own. In<space/><italics><link><target>The Dark Knight Returns</target></link></italics>, Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original Robin came up with the name &quot;Batmobile&quot; when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle.</paragraph><paragraph>Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his<space/><link><target>Batman's utility belt</target><part>utility belt</part></link>. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime-fighting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it. Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City. An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are conventional<space/><link><target>firearm</target><trail>s</trail></link>, which he refuses to use on principle, since that weapon class was used in his parents' murder.
