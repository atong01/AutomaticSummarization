The formula is more complex than the Otto cycle (petrol/gasoline engine) relation that has the following formula;</paragraph><paragraph><extension extension_name='math'>\eta_{otto,th}=1-\frac{1}{r^{\gamma-1}}</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The additional complexity for the Diesel formula comes around since the heat addition is at constant pressure and the heat rejection is at constant volume. The Otto cycle by comparison has both the heat addition and rejection at constant volume.</paragraph><paragraph>Comparing the two formulae it can be seen that for a given compression ratio (<template><target>math</target><arg>r</arg></template>), the ideal Otto cycle will be more efficient. However, a<space/><link><target>diesel engine</target></link><space/>will be more efficient overall since it will have the ability to operate at higher compression ratios. If a petrol engine were to have the same compression ratio, then knocking (self-ignition) would occur and this would severely reduce the efficiency, whereas in a diesel engine, the self ignition is the desired behavior. Additionally, both of these cycles are only idealizations, and the actual behavior does not divide as clearly or sharply. And the ideal Otto cycle formula stated above does not include throttling losses, which do not apply to diesel engines.</paragraph><heading level='2'>Applications</heading><heading level='3'>Diesel engines</heading><paragraph><template><target>main</target><arg>Diesel engine</arg></template>Diesel engines have the lowest<space/><link><target>specific fuel consumption (shaft engine)</target><part>specific fuel consumption</part></link><space/>of any large internal combustion engine employing a single cycle, 0.26&amp;nbsp;lb/hph (0.16&amp;nbsp;kg/kWh) for very large marine engines (combined cycle power plants are more efficient, but employ two engines rather than one). Two-stroke diesels with high pressure forced induction, particularly<space/><link><target>turbocharging</target></link>, make up a large percentage of the very largest diesel engines.</paragraph><paragraph>In<space/><link><target>North America</target></link>, diesel engines are primarily used in large trucks, where the low-stress, high-efficiency cycle leads to much longer engine life and lower operational costs.
