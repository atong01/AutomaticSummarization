[[File:1,3-butadiene.svg|thumb|150px|[[1,3-Butadiene|1,3-butadiene]]]]

In [[organic chemistry]] a '''diene''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aɪ|.|iː|n}} {{respell|DY|een}}) or '''diolefin''' ({{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|oʊ|l|ə|f|ɨ|n}} {{respell|dy|OH|lə-fin}}) is a [[hydrocarbon]] that contains two [[carbon]] [[double bond]]s.  Dienes occur occasionally in nature.  [[Conjugated system|Conjugated]] dienes are widely used as [[monomer]]s in the [[polymer]] industry.

==Classes==

Dienes can be divided into three classes, depending on the relative location of the double bonds: 
#'''Cumulated dienes''' have the double bonds sharing a common atom as in a group of compounds called [[allene]]s.
#'''Conjugated dienes''' have [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] double bonds separated by one single bond.
#'''Unconjugated dienes''' have the double bonds separated by two or more single bonds. They are usually less stable than [[isomer]]ic conjugated dienes. This can also be known as an isolated diene.

Compounds that contain more than two double bonds are called [[polyene]]s. Polyenes and dienes share many of their properties.

[[Image:Diene.png|thumb|center|650 px|Some dienes: '''A''': 1,2-Propadiene, also known as [[allene]], is the simplest cumulated diene. '''B''': [[Isoprene]], also known as 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, the precursor to natural rubber. '''C''': [[1,3-Butadiene]], a  precursor to synthetic polymers.  '''D''': [[1,5-Cyclooctadiene]], an unconjugated diene (notice that each double bond is two carbons away from the other). '''E''': [[Norbornadiene]], a strained bicyclic and unconjugated  diene.  '''F''': [[Dicyclopentadiene]].  '''G''': [[Linoleic acid]], a fatty acid that is required in the human diet.]]

==Synthesis of dienes==

On an industrial scale, butadiene is prepared by [[thermal cracking]] of [[butane]]s. In a similarly non-selective process, [[dicyclopentadiene]] is obtained from [[coal tar]]s.

In the laboratory, more directed and more delicate processes are employed such as [[dehydrohalogenation]]s and [[Condensation (chemistry)|condensations]].  Myriad [[organic reaction|methods]] have been developed, such as the [[Whiting reaction]].  Families of nonconjugated dienes are derived from the [[oligomerization]] and [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerization]] of conjugated dienes.  For example, 1,5-cyclooctadiene and vinylcyclohexene are produced by dimerization of [[1,3-Butadiene|1,3-butadiene]].

Diene-containing [[fatty acid]]s are [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from [[acetyl CoA]].

== Reactivity and uses==

===Polymerization===
The most heavily practiced reaction of alkenes, dienes included, is [[polymerization]].  1,3-Butadiene is a precursor to [[Synthetic rubber|rubber]] used in tires, and [[isoprene]] is the precursor to [[natural rubber]].  [[Chloroprene]] is related but it is a synthetic monomer.

===Cycloadditions===
An important reaction for conjugated dienes is the [[Diels–Alder reaction]].  Many specialized dienes have been developed to exploit this reactivity for the synthesis of [[natural product]]s (e.g., [[Danishefsky's diene]]).

===Other addition reactions===
Conjugated dienes add reagents such as [[bromine]] and [[hydrogen]] by both 1,2-addition and 1,4-addition pathways.  Addition of polar reagents can generate complex architectures:<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Roger Bishop | collvol = 9 | collvolpages = 692 | prep = CV9P0692| title = <nowiki>9-Thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione</nowiki>}}{{cite journal | title = <nowiki>2,6-Dichloro-9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane:</nowiki> Multigram Display of Azide and Cyanide Components on a Versatile Scaffold | first4 = M.

===Metathesis reactions===
Nonconjugated dienes are substrates for [[ring-closing metathesis]] reactions.  These reactions require a metal [[catalyst]]:

===Acidity===
The position adjacent to a double bond is [[acidic]] because the resulting [[allyl]] anion is stabilized by resonance. This effect becomes more pronounced as more alkenes are involved to create greater stability. For example, deprotonation at position 3 of a 1,4-diene or position 5 of a 1,3-diene give a pentadienyl anion. An even greater effect is seen if the anion is aromatic, for example, deprotonation of [[cyclopentadiene]] to give the [[cyclopentadienyl]] anion.<!-- TODO: chart of pKa for methylene in alkane, singly and doubly allylic, and Cp -->

===As ligands===
Dienes are widely used chelating [[ligand]]s in [[organometallic chemistry]].  In some cases they serve as placeholder ligands, being removed during a catalytic cycle.  For example, the cyclooctadiene ("cod") ligands in [[bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0)]] are labile.  In some cases, dienes are spectator ligands, remaining coordinated throughout a catalytic cycle and influencing the product distributions.  [[Chiral]] dienes have also been described.<ref>RyoShintani, Tamio Hayashi, "Chiral Diene Ligands for Asymmetric Catalysis" Aldrich Chimica Acta 2009, vol. 42, number 2, pp. 31-38.</ref>
