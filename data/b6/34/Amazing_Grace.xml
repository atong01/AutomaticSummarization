He grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by his recalcitrant insubordination. He was<space/><link><target>Impressment</target><part>pressed</part></link><space/>(forced) into service in the<space/><link><target>Royal Navy</target></link>, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the<space/><link><target>Atlantic slave trade</target></link>. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of<space/><link><target>County Donegal</target></link>,<space/><link><target>Ireland</target></link>, so severely that he called out to God for mercy, a moment that marked<space/><link><target>John Newton#Spiritual conversion</target><part>his spiritual conversion</part></link>. Whilst his boat was being repaired in<space/><link><target>Lough Swilly</target></link>, he wrote the first verse of his world famous song. He did however, continue his slave trading career until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether and began studying<space/><link><target>Christian theology</target></link>.</paragraph><paragraph>Ordained in the<space/><link><target>Church of England</target></link><space/>in 1764, Newton became<space/><link><target>curate</target></link><space/>of<space/><link><target>Olney, Buckinghamshire</target></link>, where he began to write hymns with poet<space/><link><target>William Cowper</target></link>. &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was written to illustrate a sermon on New Year's Day of 1773. It is unknown if there was any music accompanying the verses; it may have simply been chanted by the congregation. It debuted in print in 1779 in Newton and Cowper's<space/><italics><link><target>Olney Hymns</target></link></italics><space/>but settled into relative obscurity in England. In the United States however, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was used extensively during the<space/><link><target>Second Great Awakening</target></link><space/>in the early 19th century. It has been associated with more than 20 melodies, but in 1835 it was joined to a tune named &quot;<link><target>New Britain</target></link>&quot; to which it is most frequently sung today.<space/></paragraph><paragraph>With the message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of sins committed and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of God, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; is one of the most recognizable songs in the English-speaking world. Author<space/><link><target>Gilbert Chase</target></link><space/>writes that it is &quot;without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns,&quot;<extension extension_name='ref'>Chase, p. 181.</extension><space/>and Jonathan Aitken, a Newton biographer, estimates that it is performed about 10&amp;nbsp;million times annually.<extension extension_name='ref' name="aitken224"></extension><space/>It has had particular influence in<space/><link><target>folk music</target></link>, and has become an emblematic<space/><link><target>Negro spiritual</target><part>African American spiritual</part></link>. Its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music. &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; saw a resurgence in popularity in the U.S. during the 1960s and has been recorded thousands of times during and since the 20th century, occasionally appearing on popular music charts.</paragraph><heading level='2'>John Newton's conversion</heading><paragraph><template><target>quote box</target><arg name="width"><space/>22em

Manesty sent the ''Greyhound'', which traveled along the African coast trading at various stops.

The memory of the uttered phrase in a moment of desperation did not leave him; he began to ask if he was worthy of God's mercy or in any way redeemable as he had not only neglected his faith but directly opposed it, mocking others who showed theirs, deriding and denouncing God as a myth.

<poem>
Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)
 That sav'd a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
 Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
 And grace my fears reliev'd;
How precious did that grace appear
 The hour I first believ'd!

Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares,
 I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
 And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promis'd good to me,
 His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
 As long as life endures.

Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
 And mortal life shall cease;
I shall possess, within the veil,
 A life of joy and peace.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
 The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who call'd me here below,
 Will be forever mine.

</arg></template></paragraph><paragraph>Olney was a village of about 2,500 residents whose main industry was making lace by hand. The people were mostly illiterate and many of them were poor.<extension extension_name='ref' name="aitken224">Aitken, p. 224.</extension><space/>Newton's preaching was unique in that he shared many of his own experiences from the pulpit; many clergy preached from a distance, not admitting any intimacy with temptation or sin. He was involved in his parishioners' lives and was much loved, although his writing and delivery were sometimes unpolished.<extension extension_name='ref'>Martin (1950), pp. 208217.</extension><space/>But his devotion and conviction were apparent and forceful, and he often said his mission was to &quot;break a hard heart and to heal a broken heart&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="pollock"></extension><space/>He struck a friendship with<space/><link><target>William Cowper</target></link>, a gifted writer who had failed at a career in law and suffered bouts of insanity, attempting suicide several times. Cowper enjoyed Olney<template><target>snd</target></template><space/>and Newton's company; he was also new to Olney and had gone through a spiritual conversion similar to Newton's. Together, their effect on the local congregation was impressive. In 1768, they found it necessary to start a weekly prayer meeting to meet the needs of an increasing number of parishioners. They also began writing lessons for children.<extension extension_name='ref'>Turner, p. 76.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Partly from Cowper's literary influence, and partly because learned vicars were expected to write verses, Newton began to try his hand at hymns, which had become popular through the language, made plain for common people to understand. Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including<space/><link><target>Isaac Watts</target></link><template><target>snd</target></template><space/>whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing<extension extension_name='ref'>Aitken, p. 28.</extension><template><target>snd</target></template><space/>and<space/><link><target>Charles Wesley</target></link>, with whom Newton was familiar. Wesley's brother<space/><link><target>John Wesley</target><part>John</part></link>, the eventual founder of the Methodist Church, had encouraged Newton to go into the clergy.<template><target>efn</target><arg>Watts had previously written a hymn named "Alas! And Did My Saviour Bleed" that contained the lines "Amazing pity! Grace unknown!/ And love beyond degree!". [[Philip Doddridge]], another well-known hymn writer, wrote another in 1755 titled "The Humiliation and Exaltation of God's Israel" that began "Amazing grace of God on high!" and included other similar wording to Newton's verses. Newton biographer Jonathan Aitken states that Watts had inspired most of Newton's compositions. (Turner, pp. 82–83.)(Aitken, pp. 28–29.)</arg></template><space/>Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his work after the<space/><link><target>Psalms</target></link>. The most prevalent hymns by Watts and others were written in the<space/><link><target>common meter</target></link><space/>in 8.6.8.6: the first line is eight syllables and the second is six.<extension extension_name='ref' name="turner77-79">Turner, pp. 7779.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>Newton and Cowper attempted to present a poem or hymn for each prayer meeting. The lyrics to &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; were written in late 1772 and probably used in a prayer meeting for the first time on January 1, 1773.<extension extension_name='ref' name="turner77-79"></extension><space/>A collection of the poems Newton and Cowper had written for use in services at Olney was bound and published anonymously in 1779 under the title<space/><italics><link><target>Olney Hymns</target></link></italics>. Newton contributed 280 of the 348 texts in<space/><italics>Olney Hymns</italics>; &quot;1 Chronicles 17:1617, Faith's Review and Expectation&quot; was the title of the poem with the first line &quot;Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)&quot;.<extension extension_name='ref' name="dah"></extension></paragraph><heading level='3'>Critical analysis</heading><paragraph>The general impact of<space/><italics>Olney Hymns</italics><space/>was immediate and it became a widely popular tool for evangelicals in Britain for many years. Scholars appreciated Cowper's poetry somewhat more than Newton's plaintive and plain language driven from his forceful personality. The most prevalent themes in the verses written by Newton in<space/><italics>Olney Hymns</italics><space/>are faith in salvation, wonder at<space/><link><target>Grace (Christianity)</target><part>God's grace</part></link>, his love for Jesus, and his cheerful exclamations of the joy he found in his faith.<extension extension_name='ref'>Benson, p. 339.</extension><space/>As a reflection of Newton's connection to his parishioners, he wrote many of the hymns in<space/><link><target>first-person narrative</target><part>first person</part></link>, admitting his own experience with sin. Bruce Hindmarsh in<space/><italics>Sing Them Over Again To Me: Hymns and Hymnbooks in America</italics><space/>considers &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; an excellent example of Newton's testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective.<extension extension_name='ref' name="hindmarsh6">Noll and Blumhofer, p. 6.</extension><space/>Several of Newton's hymns were recognized as great work (&quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was not among them) while others seem to have been included to fill in when Cowper was unable to write.<extension extension_name='ref'>Benson, p. 338.</extension><space/>Jonathan Aitken calls Newton, specifically referring to &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, an &quot;unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation&quot;, noting that only twenty-one of the nearly 150 words used in all six verses have more than one syllable.<extension extension_name='ref'>Aitken, p. 226.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>William Phipps in the<space/><italics><link><target>Anglican Theological Review</target></link></italics><space/>and author James Basker have interpreted the first stanza of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; as evidence of Newton's realization that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness, perhaps representing a wider common understanding of Newton's motivations.<extension extension_name='ref' name="phipps">Phipps, William (Summer 1990). &quot; 'Amazing Grace' in the hymnwriter's life&quot;,<space/><italics><link><target>Anglican Theological Review</target></link></italics>,<space/><bold>72</bold><space/>(3), pp. 306313.</extension><extension extension_name='ref' name="basker281"></extension><space/>Newton joined forces with a young man named<space/><link><target>William Wilberforce</target></link>, the British Member of Parliament who led the Parliamentarian campaign to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire, culminating in the<space/><link><target>Slave Trade Act 1807</target></link>. However, Newton became an ardent and outspoken<space/><link><target>abolitionist</target></link><space/>after he left Olney in the 1780s; he never connected the construction of the hymn that became &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; to anti-slavery sentiments.<extension extension_name='ref'>Aitken, p. 231.</extension><space/>The lyrics in<space/><italics>Olney Hymns</italics><space/>were arranged by their association to the Biblical verses that would be used by Newton and Cowper in their prayer meetings and did not address any political objective.

At the same time he completed a diary<template><target>snd</target></template><space/>which has since been lost<template><target>snd</target></template><space/>that he had begun 17 years before, two years after he quit sailing.

A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds to symbolize the basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound was accompanied by a specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual.

It was a song that could be sung by young and old, Republican and Democrat, Southern Baptist and Roman Catholic, African American and Native American, high-ranking military officer and anticapitalist campaigner.

Since the 1970s, self-help books, psychology, and some modern expressions of Christianity have viewed this disparity in terms of grace being an innate quality within all people who must be inspired or strong enough to find it: something to achieve. In contrast to Newton's vision of wretchedness as his willful sin and distance from God, wretchedness has instead come to mean an obstacle of physical, social, or spiritual nature to overcome in order to achieve a state of grace, happiness, or contentment. Since its immense popularity and iconic nature, &quot;grace&quot; and the meaning behind the words of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; have become as individual as the singer or listener.<extension extension_name='ref'>Turner, pp. 218220.</extension><space/>Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; is due to the absence of any mention of God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins &quot;When we've been there ten thousand years&quot;), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God. &quot;Grace&quot;, however, to John Newton had a clearer meaning, as he used the word to represent God or the<space/><link><target>Grace (Christianity)</target><part>power of God</part></link>.<extension extension_name='ref'>Noll and Blumhofer, p. 16.</extension></paragraph><paragraph>The transformative power of the song was investigated by journalist<space/><link><target>Bill Moyers</target></link><space/>in a documentary released in 1990.
