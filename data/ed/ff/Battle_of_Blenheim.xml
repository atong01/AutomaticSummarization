The French commanders were, however, divided as to how to utilise the Nebel: Tallard's tactic opposed by Marsin and the Elector who felt it better to close their infantry right up to the stream itself was to lure the allies across before unleashing their cavalry upon them, causing panic and confusion; whilst the enemy was struggling in the marshes, they would be caught in crossfire from Blenheim and Oberglauheim.

The French cavalry exerted themselves once more against the first line Lumley's English and Scots on the Allied left, and Hompesch's Dutch and German squadrons on the Allied right. Tallard's squadrons, lacking infantry support, were tired and ragged but managed to push the Allied first line back to their infantry support.

Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, in and around the walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvire. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack.
