'''Affection,''' '''attraction''', '''infatuation''', or '''fondness''' is a "[[disposition]] or rare state of mind or body"<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=affection affection - Definitions from Dictionary.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> that is often associated with a [[feeling]] or type of [[love]]. It has given rise to a number of branches of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] concerning emotion, disease, influence, and state of being.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/LD7Hutcheson.html 17th and 18th Century Theories of Emotions > Francis Hutcheson on the Emotions (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "Affection" is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of [[love]], amounting to more than goodwill or [[friendship]]. Writers on [[ethics]] generally use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic. Some contrast it with ''[[passion (emotion)|passion]]'' as being free from the distinctively sensual element.

A simple expression of affection -through word or deed – can have a wide variety of emotional effects that range from joy to discomfort to outright fear. In fact, affection also has distinct physical effects – both for the receiver and the giver. <ref>{{Cite web|title = The Effects of Affection {{!}} Research Matters|url = https://researchmatters.asu.edu/stories/effects-affection-960|website = researchmatters.asu.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-30}}</ref>

== Restricted definition ==

More specifically, the word has been restricted to [[emotion]]al states, the object of which is a living thing such as a human or animal.  Affection is compared with passion, from the Greek "[[pathos]]". As such it appears in the writings of [[France|French]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]], and most of the writings of early British ethicists.  However, on various grounds (e.g., that it does not involve anxiety or excitement and that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element), it is generally and usefully distinguished from passion.  In this narrower sense the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental ''affections'' as in some sense a part of moral obligation.  For a consideration of these and similar problems, which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary, see [[Henry Sidgwick|H. Sidgwick]], ''Methods of Ethics'' pp.&nbsp;345–349.

==Expression==

{{Further|Public display of affection}}
Affection can be communicated by words, gestures, or touches. Affectionate behavior may have evolved from parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards.<ref>according to [[Communication]] professor Kory Floyd of the [[University of Arizona]]</ref> Such affection has been shown to influence brain development in infants.<ref>Infant Observation: International Journal of Infant Observation and Its Applications</ref> 
Expressions of affection can be unwelcome if they pose implied threats to one's well being. If welcomed, affectionate behavior  may be associated with  various health benefits. It has been proposed that positive sentiment increases the propensity of people to interact and that familiarity gained through affection increases positive sentiment among them.<ref>http://www.techsociety.com/articles/JMF_Lawtonetal.pdf</ref>
 
Affection can be displayed in different manners in different cultural societies. For example, in the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] ethnic group, mothers publicly kissing their infant is viewed as inappropriate, while publicly performing [[fellatio]]  on their infant son is considered an appropriate act of affection.<ref>{{cite book | last=Clarke | first=John R. | title=Looking at Lovemaking | year=2001 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bwNdgd8cQcgC | publisher=University of California Press | location=Berkeley | isbn=978-0-520-22904-4 | pages=15–16 | edition=1st paperback print | quote=In the Manchu tribe, a mother will routinely suck her small son's penis in public but would never kiss his cheeks. Among adults, the Manchu believe, fellatio is a sexual act, but kissing—even between mother and infant son—is always a sexual act, and thus fellation becomes the proper display of motherly affection.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Barre | first=Weston La | title=Anthropological Perspectives of Movement | year=1975 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bI6WIh8-qjIC | publisher=Arno Press | isbn=978-0-405-06201-8| page=56 | editor=Davis, Martha | chapter=The Cultural Basis of Emotions and Gestures | authorlink=Weston La Barre | quote=Manchu kissing is purely a private sexual act, and though husband and wife or lovers might kiss each other, they would do it stealthily since it is shameful to do ... yet Manchu mothers have the pattern of putting the penis of the baby boy into their mouths, a practice which probably shocks Westerners even more than kissing in public shocks the Manchu.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Barre |first=Weston La |title=Social structure and social personality | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q67ZAAAAMAAJ | year=1974 | chapter=The Cultural Basis of Emotions and Gestures | publisher=Little, Brown and Company | location=Boston | page=79 | editor=[[Jerold Starr|Starr, Jerold M.]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Halperin | first=David M. | title=Before Sexuality | year=1990 | publisher=Princeton University Press | location=Princeton | isbn=978-0-691-00221-7 | page=3 |author2=Winkler, John J. |author3=Zeitlin, Froma I. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Walls | first=Neal | title=Desire, Discord and Death | year=2001 | publisher=American Schools of Oriental Research | location=Boston | page=81 | isbn=978-0-89757-056-5 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3mrXAAAAMAAJ&q=manchu+mother+son%27s+penis&dq=manchu+mother+son%27s+penis&redir_esc=y}}</ref>
