'''Dimona''' ({{lang-he-n|דִּימוֹנָה}}) is an [[Israel]]i city in the [[Negev]] desert, {{convert|36|km|mi}} to the south of [[Beersheba]] and {{convert|35|km|mi}} west of the [[Dead Sea]] above the [[Arabah|Arava]] valley in the [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern District of Israel]]. Its population at the end of 2007 was 33,600.<ref name="cbs populations">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/population/new_2009/table3.pdf|publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]]|title=Table 3 - Population of Localities Numbering Above 1,000 Residents and Other Rural Population|date=30 June 2008|accessdate=18 October 2008}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The city's name is derived from a biblical town, mentioned in [[Joshua]] 15:21-22.

==History==

Dimona was one of the [[development town]]s created in the 1950s under the leadership of Israel's first Prime Minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]]. Dimona itself was conceived in 1953, and settled in 1955, mostly by [[History of the Jews in Africa#Northern Africa|new immigrants from Northern Africa]], who also constructed the city's houses. The emblem of Dimona (as a local council), adopted 2 March 1961, appeared on a stamp issued on 24 March 1965.

When the [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israeli nuclear program]] started later that decade, a location not far from the city was chosen for the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]] due to its relative isolation in the desert and availability of housing.

In spite of a gradual decrease during the 1980s, the city's population began to grow once again with the beginning of the [[Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s|Russian immigration in the 1990s]]. Currently, Dimona is the third largest city in the Negev, with the population of 33,900. Due to projected rapid population growth in the Negev, the city is expected to triple in size by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|last=Udasin |first=Sharon |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=248711 |title=‘1.2 million residents in the Negev by 2025’ &#124; JPost &#124; Israel News |publisher=JPost |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>

==Population==
Dimona is described as "mini-India" by many for its 7,500-strong Indian Jewish community.<ref>http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/rockets-hit-mini-india-town-in-israel_946508.html</ref> It is also home to Israel's [[Black Hebrew]] community, formerly governed by its founder and spiritual leader, [[Ben Ammi Ben-Israel]], now deceased.<ref name=Ben_Ammi>{{cite web |url= http://africanhebrewisraelitesofjerusalem.com/?page_id=29 |publisher= African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem |title=Ben Ammi |accessdate=October 7, 2012}}</ref> The Black Hebrews number about 3,000 in Dimona, with additional families in [[Arad, Israel|Arad]], [[Mitzpe Ramon]] and the [[Tiberias]] area. Their official status in Israel was an ongoing issue for many years, but in May 1990, the issue was resolved with the issuing of first B/1 visas, and a year later, issuing of temporary residency. Status was extended to August 2003, when the [[Israeli Ministry of Interior]] granted [[permanent residency]].

==Economy==
In the early 1980s, textile plants, such as Dimona Textiles Ltd., dominated the industrial landscape. Many plants have since closed. Dimona Silica Industries Ltd. manufactures precipitated silica and calcium carbonate fillers. About a third of the city's population works in industrial workplaces (chemical plants near the [[Dead Sea]] like the [[Dead Sea Works]], [[high-tech]] companies and [[textile]] shops), and another third in the area of services. Due to the introduction of new technologies, many workers have been made redundant in the recent years, creating a total unemployment rate of about 10%. Dimona has taken part of [[Solar power in Israel|Israel's solar transformation]]. The Rotem Industrial Complex outside of the city has dozens of solar mirrors that focus the sun's rays on a tower that in turn heats a water boiler to create steam, turning a turbine to create electricity. Luz II, Ltd. plans to use the solar array to test new technology for the three new solar plants to be built in California for [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]].<ref name=Dimona>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25124614/ Calif. solar power test begins — in Israeli desert], [[Associated Press]], June 12, 2008.

==Geography and climate==
Dimona is at an average height of about 550–600 meters [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. It is in the [[Negev Desert]], therefore it has a desert climate with low humidity for most of the year and little precipitation. Summers are hot with an average max temperature of about 33C in August, the hottest month of the year. Average annual precipitation is about {{convert|100|mm|0|abbr=on}}, mostly during the winter.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brawer|first=Moshe|title=University Atlas|year=2009|publisher=Yavne}}</ref>

==Transportation==
In the early 1950s, an extension to Dimona and south was constructed from the [[Railway to Beersheba]], designed for freight traffic. A passenger service began in 2005, after pressure from Dimona's municipality. [[Dimona Railway Station]] is located in the southwestern part of the city. The main bus terminal is the Dimona Central Bus Station, with lines to [[Beersheba]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Eilat]], and nearby towns.
