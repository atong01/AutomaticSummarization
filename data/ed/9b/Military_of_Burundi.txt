The '''National Defence Force''' is the [[Armed forces|state military organisation]] responsible for the defence of [[Burundi]].
A general staff (''État-Major Général'') commands the armed forces, consisting of a joint staff (''État-Major inter-armes''); a training staff (''État-Major de la Formation''), and a logistics staff (''État-Major de la Logistique''). Naval and aviation 
commands exist, as well as specialised units.<ref name=loi1019>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandslacs.net/doc/3335.pdf|title=LOI N° 1/019 DU 31 DECEMBRE 2004 Portant Creation, Organisation, MISSIONS, COMPOSITION ET FONCTIONNEMENT DE LA FORCE DE DEFENSE NATIONALE|publisher=Grandslacs.net|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>

Burundi gained independence in July 1962. In October 1965, an attempted [[1965 Burundian coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by the Hutu-dominated police was carried out but failed. The Tutsi dominated army, then led by Tutsi officer Captain [[Michel Micombero]]<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1068991.stm |work=BBC News | title=Timeline: Burundi | date=25 February 2010 | accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> purged Hutu from their ranks and carried out reprisal attacks which ultimately claimed the lives of up to 5,000 people in a predecessor to the [[Burundian Genocide|1972 Burundian Genocide]].<ref>UMASS AMHERST, MODERN CONFLICTS:CONFLICT PROFILE,http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/dpe/modern_conflicts/burundi.pdf</ref> Micombero then became Prime Minister.

King Mwambutsa, who had fled the country during the October coup of 1965, was deposed by a [[July 1966 Burundian coup d'état|coup in July 1966]] and his teenage son, [[Ntare V of Burundi|Prince Ntare V]], claimed the throne. Later that same year, Prime Minister, then-Captain, Michel Micombero, carried out another [[November 1966 Burundian coup d'état|coup in November, 1966]], this time deposing Ntare, abolishing the monarchy and declaring the nation a [[republic]]. His one-party government was effectively a [[military dictatorship]].<ref name="state">[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2821.htm Background Note: Burundi]. [[United States Department of State]]. February 2008. Retrieved on 28 June 2008.</ref> As president, Micombero became an advocate of [[African socialism]] and received support from the [[People's Republic of China]]. He imposed a staunch regime of law and order and sharply repressed Hutu militarism. After Micombero's [[coup d’etat]] which deposed the monarchy, he became first general in Burundian history. He was also commissioned by the National Council of the Revolution (French: Conseil National de la Révolution (CNR)), and made a Lieutenant Général. In his turn, Micombero raised [[Thomas Ndabemeye]] to the grade of Major General. They were the sole generals of the First Republic.

In 1981-82 the IISS estimated that the Burundian armed forces were 6,000 strong, with 2 infantry battalions, 1 airborne battalion, 1 commando battalion, and an armoured car company.<ref>IISS Military Balance 1988-89</ref> The same estimate was repeated in the 1988-89 edition except that the strength figure had been dropped to 5,500.

The Burundian Civil War lasted from 1993 to 2005, and an estimated 300,000 people were killed. The [[Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi]]<ref>[[Institute for Security Studies]], [http://www.issafrica.org/cdburundipeaceagreements/No%201%20arusha.pdf] (Protocol II, Chapter 1.)</ref> ended 12 years of war and stopped decades of ethnic killings. The [[Burundian constitutional referendum, 2005|2005 constitution]] provided guaranteed representation for both [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]], and [[Burundian legislative election, 2005|2005 parliamentary elections]] that led to Pierre Nkurunziza, from the Hutu [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy – Forces for the Defense of Democracy|FDD]], becoming President.

According to a 2004 report by Child Soldiers International, Burundi's military used conscripted child soldiers. Children in military service were subject to military courts which fell short of international law standards.<ref>Child Soldiers International, [http://www.child-soldiers.org/user_uploads/pdf/africaoverview4900516.pdf "2004 Africa: Regional overview"]</ref>

The armed forces have deployed significant numbers of troops to the [[African Union Mission in Somalia]] since c. 2007. On February 1, 2007 [[Burundi]] committed to the mission, pledging up to 1,000 troops.<ref name=BURUNDI-JOINS-SOMALI-PEACE-FORCE>{{cite news|title=Burundi joins Somalia peace force|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6319937.stm|date=2007-02-01|accessdate=2007-02-09

The army's forces in 2011 included, according to IISS estimates, 2 light armoured battalions (squadrons), seven infantry battalions and independent companies; and artillery, engineer, and air defence battalions (SA-7 'Grail' man-portable SAMs and 14.5mm, 23mm and 37mm guns were reported). Separately reported were the 22nd commando battalion ([[Gitega Province|Gitega]]) and 124th commando battalion [[Bujumbura]]).

In the wake of the [[2015 Burundian unrest]], personnel faced a choice between supporting President [[Pierre Nkurunziza]], with whom some fought when he was a military commander, or opposing him. Interviewed by [[Reuters]] on May 14, 2015, an Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft said moves by Major General [[Godefroid Niyombare]], former director of the intelligence service, "starkly highlight[ed] Nkurunziza’s lack of unified support among his military chiefs," he said. "Even if Niyombare’s attempt fails, Nkurunziza’s political credibility may be damaged irreparably."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/14/us-burundi-politics-army-analysis-idUSKBN0NZ17F20150514|title=Army rifts could push Burundi back to conflict after coup bid}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the coup and the later disputed election, armed forces chief of staff Major General [[Prime Niyongabo]] survived an assassination attempt on September 11, 2015.<ref>http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/09/11/witnesses-burundi-army-chief-is-targeted-in-attack</ref>
