'''Edward Mitchell Bannister''' (ca. 1828 – January 9, 1901) was a [[Black Canadian]]-[[United States|American]] [[tonalism|Tonalist]] [[Painting|painter]]. Like other Tonalists, his style and predominantly pastoral subject matter were drawn from his admiration for [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]] and the French [[Barbizon School]].

==Biography==
[[File:Edward Mitchell Bannister - Landscape - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb||Landscape ]]
Bannister was born in [[St. Andrews, New Brunswick]] and moved to [[New England]] in the late 1840s, where he remained for the rest of his life. While Bannister was well known in the artistic community of his adopted home of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and admired within the wider East Coast art world (he won a bronze medal for his large oil "Under the Oaks" at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition|Philadelphia Centennial]]), he was largely forgotten for almost a century for a complexity of reasons, principally connected with racial prejudice.

With the ascendency of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights movement]] in the 1970s, his work was again celebrated and collected. In 1978, [[Rhode Island College]] dedicated its Art Gallery in Bannister's name with the exhibition: "Four From Providence ~ Alston, Bannister, Jennings & Prophet". This event was attended and commented on by numerous notable political figures of the time, and supported by the Rhode Island Committee for Humanities and the Rhode Island Historical Society. Events like this, across the entire cultural landscape, have ensured that his artwork and life will not be again forgotten.

Although primarily known for his idealised [[Landscape art|landscapes]] and seascapes, Bannister also executed [[portrait]]s, biblical and mythological scenes, and [[Genre works|genre]] scenes. An intellectual [[autodidacticism|autodidact]], his tastes in literature were typical of an educated [[Victorian era|Victorian]] painter, including [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], [[Virgil]], [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]] and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], from whose works much of his iconography can be traced.

Bannister died of a heart attack in 1901 while attending a prayer meeting at his church, Elmwood Avenue Free Baptist Church. He is buried in the [[North Burial Ground]] in Providence.

The historian Anne Louise Avery is currently compiling the first Catalogue Raisonné and major biography of Bannister's work. See the [http://ifar.org/cat_rais.php International Foundation for Art Research] for further details.
