The '''Bosphorus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|s|f|ər|ə|s}}) or '''Bosporus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|s|p|ər|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|{{linktext|Βόσπορος}}}}, ''Bósporos''; {{lang-tr|Boğaziçi}}) is a [[strait]] that forms part of the boundary between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. The Bosphorus, the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Dardanelles]] strait to the southwest together form the [[Turkish Straits]]. The world's narrowest strait used for [[International waterway|international navigation]], the Bosporus connects the [[Black Sea]] with the Sea of Marmara (which is connected by the Dardanelles to the [[Aegean Sea]], and thereby to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].)

The limits of the Bosphorus are defined as the connecting line between the lighthouses [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] in the north and between the [[Ahırkapı Feneri]] and the [[Kadıköy İnciburnu Feneri]] in the south. Between the limits, the strait is {{convert|31|km|nmi|abbr=on}} long, with a width of {{convert|3329|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the northern entrance and {{convert|2826|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the southern entrance. Its maximum width is {{convert|3420|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between Umuryeri and Büyükdere Limanı, and minimum width {{convert|700|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between [[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[Aşiyan]].

The depth of the Bosphorus varies from {{convert|13|to|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} in midstream with an average of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest location is between Kandilli and [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] with {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The most shallow locations are off Kadıköy İnciburnu on the northward route with {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and off Aşiyan Point on the southward route with {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="d"/> The [[Golden Horn]] is an estuary off the main straits that acted as a moat to protect Old Istanbul from attack, as well as providing a sheltered anchorage for the [[Ottoman Empire|imperial navy]] until the 19th century.

Most of the shores of the strait are heavily populated, straddled as it is by the city of [[Istanbul]] (with a [[metropolitan area]] [[population]] in excess of 17 million inhabitants) which extends inland from both coasts.

It has been known since before the 20th century that the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara flow into each other in an example of a density flow and in August 2010 a continuous 'underwater channel' of [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] composition was discovered to flow along the floor of the Bosphorus which would be the sixth largest river on Earth if it were to be on land.  The study of the [[water erosion|water]] and [[wind erosion]] of the straits relates to that of its formation.   Sections of the shore have been reinforced with concrete or rubble and sections of the strait prone to [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] are periodically dredged.

==Name==
The Bosphorus is also known as "Strait of Constantinople", or as "Istanbul  Strait" ({{lang-tr|İstanbul Boğazı}}).
To distinguish it from the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]], it was anciently known as the [[Thrace|Thracian]] Bosphorus ([[Histories (Herodotus)|Herodotus]] 4.83; ''Bosporus Thracius,  Bosporus Thraciae '', {{lang|grc|Βόσπορος Θρᾴκιος}}, also [[Chalcedon]]ian Bosporus, ''Bosporus Chalcedoniae'', {{lang|grc|Bosporos tes Khalkedonies}}, Herodotus 4.87, or [[Mysia]]n Bosporus, ''Bosporus Mysius'').<ref>Friedrich Heinrich Theodor Bischoff, ''Verleichendes wörterbuch der alten, mittleren und neuen geographie'', Becker, 1829,  [http://books.google.ch/books?id=NvYRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA195 195f.]</ref>
The term could also be used as common noun βόσπορος, meaning "a strait", and was also applied to the Hellespont in [[Classical Greek]] ([[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]]).

The Greek name {{lang|grc|Βόσπορος}} (''Bosporos'') was folk-etymologized as from {{lang|grc|βοὸς πόρος}}, i.e. "cattle strait" (or "[[Oxford|Ox-ford]]"<ref>there is a certain (Oxonian) tradition of equating the name "Oxford" with "Bosporus", see e.g. Wolstenholme Parr, ''Memoir on the propriety of the word Oxford'',
Oxford,1820, esp. [http://books.google.ch/books?id=qSwrr71vA7IC&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 18]</ref>), from the genitive of ''bous'' {{lang|grc|[[wikt:βοῦς|βοῦς]]}} "ox, cattle" + ''poros'' {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πόρος|πόρος]]}}   "passage", thus "cattle-passage", or "cow passage"<ref name="Bosporos">Entry: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2320416 '''{{lang|grc|Βόσπορος}}'''] at Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, 1940, ''A Greek-English Lexicon''.</ref> in reference to [[Io (mythology)|Io]] from Greek mythology who was transformed into a cow and condemned to wander the earth until she crossed the Bosphorus where she met [[Prometheus]]. 
This folk etymology was canonized by [[Aeschylus]] in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (v. 734f.), where Prometheus  prophesies to Io that the strait would be named after her. 
The site where Io supposedly went ashore was near [[Üsküdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]], was  named ''he Bous'' "the Cow". The same site was also known as ''Damalis'', as it was where the Athenian general [[Chares of Athens|Chares]] had erected  a monument to his wife Damalis. This monument included a colossal statue of a cow (the name ''Damalis'' translating to "calf").<ref>F. Sickler, ''Handbuch der alten Geographie'', 1824, p. [http://books.google.ch/books?id=07JCAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA551 551].</ref>
The actual etymology of the name is more likely from the verb βύζω or βύω, "to fill up, clog up, plug, stop", referring to a "plugged" or stopped-up passage,  perhaps also cognate with the name of [[Byzantium]] ([[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] has  βύζαντες: πλήθοντες, i.e. ''buzantes'' meaning "filled up").{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The spelling with ''-ph-'', as ''Bosphorus'', has no justification in the ancient Greek name, but it occurs as a variant in [[medieval Latin]] (as ''Bosphorus'', and occasionally ''Bosforus, Bosferus''), and in [[medieval Greek]] sometimes as Βόσφορος,<ref>
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DBosporus Bosporus] inCharlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'' (1879).</ref> 
giving rise to the French form ''Bosphore'', Spanish ''Bósforo'', and Russian Босфор.
The 12th-century Greek scholar [[John Tzetzes]] calls it '' Damaliten Bosporon'' (after ''Damalis''), but he also reports that in popular usage the strait was known as ''Prosphorion'' during his day,<ref>
Carl Müller, ''Geographi graeci minores'', Didot, 1861, [http://books.google.ch/books?id=2VxFAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA7 p. 7].</ref> the name of [[Prosphorion Harbour|the most ancient northern harbour]] of [[Constantinople]].

== Formation ==
{{Main|Black Sea deluge theory}}
[[File:Turkish Strait disambig.svg|thumb|A map depicting the location of the Bosphorus (red) relative to the [[Dardanelles]] (yellow) and the [[Sea of Marmara]], which together form the [[Turkish Straits]].]]

The exact cause for the formation of the Bosphorus remains the subject of debate among geologists. Thousands of years ago, the [[Black Sea]] became disconnected from the [[Aegean Sea]]. The [[Black Sea deluge theory]] (reinforced in credibility by a study of the same name of 1997 by two scientists from [[Columbia University]]) contends that the Bosphorus was formed in circa 5600 BC when the rising waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]] breached through to the [[Black Sea]], which at the time (according to the theory) was a low-lying body of fresh water.

It is also said in myth that floating rocks known as the [[Symplegades]] or Clashing Rocks once crushed any ship that attempted passage of the Bosphorus until the hero [[Jason]] obtained passage, whereupon the rocks became fixed, and Greek access to the Black Sea was opened.

== Ancient Greece, Persia, Rome, the Byzantines and the Ottoman Empire ==
[[File:Allum Bosphorus.jpg|thumb|''The Bosphorus with the Castles of Europe and Asia''. 19th-century engraving by [[Thomas Allom]]. The castles are [[Rumelihisarı]] and [[Anadoluhisarı]], respectively.]]

As part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Bosphorus has always been of great commercial and strategic importance. The Greek city-state of [[Athens]] in the 5th century BC, which was dependent on grain imports from [[Scythia]], maintained critical alliances with cities which controlled the straits, such as the [[Megara|Megarian]] colony [[Byzantium]].

Persian King [[Darius I]] the Great, in an attempt to subdue the [[Scythia]]n horsemen who roamed across the north of the [[Black Sea]], crossed through the Bosphorus, then marched towards the [[Danube|Danube River]]. His army crossed the Bosphorus over an enormous bridge made by connecting [[Achaemenid]] boats.<ref>Polybios, Historiae IV, 39, 16; [[Özhan Öztürk]].

Ankara, 2011 pp. 28–32</ref>

The strategic significance of the strait was one of the factors in the decision of the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] the Great to found there in AD 330 his new capital, [[Constantinople]], which came to be known as the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. On 29 May 1453 it was [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered]] by the emerging [[Ottoman Empire]]. In fact, as the Ottoman Turks closed in on Constantinople, they constructed a fortification on each side of the strait, [[Anadoluhisarı]] (1393) and [[Rumelihisarı]] (1451).

== Strategic importance ==
[[File:Istanbulbosphorusfrombridge.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A view of the Bosphorus strait, with the [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] seen in the background.]]

The Bosphorus remains strategically important. It is a major sea access route for [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Control over it has been an objective of a number of hostilities in modern history, notably the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]], as well as of the attack of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] on the [[Dardanelles]] during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in the course of [[World War I]].

At its peak in the 16th through the 18th centuries, the Ottoman Empire had wrested control of the entire [[Black Sea]] area, which was for the time an "Ottoman lake", on which Russian warships were prohibited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://workmall.com/wfb2001/turkey/turkey_history_koprulu_era.html |title=Turkey - Köprülü Era |publisher=Workmall.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref>

Subsequently, several international treaties have governed vessels using the waters. Under the [[Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi]] of July 8, 1833, the Bosporus and [[Dardanelles]] straits were to be closed on Russian demand to naval vessels of other powers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://workmall.com/wfb2001/turkey/turkey_history_external_threats_and_internal_transformations.html |title=Turkey - External Threats and Internal Transformations |publisher=Workmall.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref> By the terms of the [[London Straits Convention]] concluded on July 13, 1841, between the [[Great Powers]] of [[Europe]] — [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Second French Republic|France]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]  — the "ancient rule" of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was re-established by closing the [[Turkish Straits]] to all [[warship]]s whatsoever, barring those of the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]]'s allies during wartime. It thus benefited [[Royal Navy|British naval]] power at the expense of Russian, as the latter lacked direct access for its [[Imperial Russian Navy|navy]] to the Mediterranean.<ref name = Rozakis>{{cite book | title = The Turkish Straits | author = Christos L.

This was amended under the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]], which restored the straits to Turkish territory—but allowed all foreign warships and commercial shipping to traverse the straits freely. Turkey eventually rejected the terms of that treaty, and subsequently Turkey remilitarized the straits area. The reversion was formalized under the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] of July 20, 1936. That convention, which is still in force, treats the straits as an international shipping lane save that Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non-Black Sea states.

Turkey was neutral in [[World War II]] until February 1945, and the straits were closed to the warships of belligerent nations during this time, although some German [[auxiliaries|auxiliary vessels]] were permitted to transit. In diplomatic conferences, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] representatives had made known [[Turkish Straits crisis|their interest]] in Turkish concession of Soviet naval bases on the straits. This, as well as Stalin's demands for the restitution of the Turkish provinces of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Artvin]] and [[Ardahan]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (which were lost by Turkey in the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878, but were regained with the [[Treaty of Kars]] in 1921), were  considerations in Turkey's decision to abandon [[country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality in foreign affairs]]. Turkey declared war against Germany in February 1945, but did not engage in offensive actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/enotes/20030110.balkansturkey.torbakov.turkeypostsovietspace.html |title=Foreign Policy Research Institute: The Turkish Factor in the Geopolitics of the Post-Soviet Space (Igor Torbakov) |publisher=Fpri.org |date=2003-01-10 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertcutler.org/ch91dc.htm |title=Turkish-Soviet Relations |publisher=Robert Cutler |date=1999-03-28 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/relations-with-turkey |title=Russia's relations with Turkey |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/yazarDetay.do;jsessionid=DC0C8B5C41104733FE75243EF5E99B20.node1?haberno=36433 |title=Today's Zaman: Against who and where are we going to stand?

In more recent years, the [[Turkish Straits]] have become particularly important for the oil industry. Russian oil, from ports such as [[Novorossyisk]], is exported by tankers primarily to western Europe and the U.S. via the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles straits. In 2011 Turkey planned a 50&nbsp;km channel through [[Silivri]] as a second waterway, reducing risk in the Bosphorus.<ref>"[http://www.nce.co.uk/news/water/turkey-to-build-bosphorus-bypass/8614313.article Turkey to build Bosphorus bypass]" ''[[New Civil Engineer]]'', 20 April 2011.

== Shipping traffic ==

The limits of the Bosphorus are defined as the connecting line between the lighthouses [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] in the north and between the [[Ahırkapı Feneri]] and the [[Kadıköy İnciburnu Feneri]] in the south. Between the limits, the strait is {{convert|31|km|nmi|abbr=on}} long, with a width of {{convert|3329|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the northern entrance and {{convert|2826|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the southern entrance. Its maximum width is {{convert|3420|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between Umuryeri and Büyükdere Limanı, and minimum width {{convert|700|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between [[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[Aşiyan]].

The part of the strait is a dangerous point for maritime traffic: a 45-degree course alteration is required, and the current can reach {{convert|7|to|8|kn|m/s|abbr=out}}. To the south, at [[Yeniköy, Istanbul|Yeniköy]], the necessary course alteration is 80 degrees. All the dangers and obstacles characteristic of narrow waterways are present and acute in this critical sea lane. At the abovementioned turns ([[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli]] and [[Yeniköy, Istanbul|Yeniköy]]) where significant course alterations have to be made, the rear and forward sights are totally blocked prior to and during the course alteration. Ships approaching from the opposite direction cannot be seen around these bends. The risks posed by geography are multiplied by the heavy ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian sides of the city.

== Crossings ==

The waters of the strait are traversed by numerous ferries. Two [[suspension bridge]]s cross the Bosphorus. The first of these, the [[Bosporus Bridge]], is {{convert|1074|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long and was completed in 1973. The second, named [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge|Fatih Sultan Mehmet (Bosphorus II) Bridge]], is {{convert|1090|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, and was completed in 1988 about {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of the first bridge. The Bosphorus Bridge forms part of the [[Otoyol 1|O1 Motorway]], while the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge forms part of the [[Trans-European Motorway]].

Construction of a third suspension bridge, the [[Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge]], began on May 29, 2013; opening is planned for the end of 2015.<ref name="ntv">{{cite news |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25445886 Yavuz Sultan Selim Köprüsü |newspaper=[[NTV-MSNBC]] |title=3. köprünün ismi Yavuz Sultan Selim |date=2013-05-29 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-05-29 }}</ref>   The bridge will be built near the northern end of the Bosphorus, between the villages of Garipçe on the European side and Poyrazköy on the Asian side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkey-unveils-route-for-istanbuls-third-bridge.html |title=Turkey Unveils Route for Istanbul's Third Bridge |publisher=[[Anatolian Agency]] |date=29 April 2010}}</ref> It will be part of the "Northern Marmara Motorway", which will be further integrated with the existing Black Sea Coastal Highway, and will allow transit traffic to bypass city traffic,

== Submarine channel ==

In 2010, a team of scientists led by the [[University of Leeds]] used a robotic "yellow submarine" to observe detailed flows within an "undersea river" for the first time. Submarine channels are similar to land rivers, but they are formed by density currents—underwater flow mixtures of sand, mud and water that are denser than sea water and so sink and flow along the bottom. These channels are the main transport pathway for sediments to the deep sea where they form sedimentary deposits. These deposits ultimately hold not only untapped reserves of gas and oil, they also house important secrets—from clues on past climate change to the ways in which mountains were formed.<ref>[http://auvac.org/community-information/community-news/view/662 Leeds researchers study undersea rivers with a yellow submarine] AUVAC, 2010</ref>

The team studied the detailed flow within these channels and findings included:
{{quote|The channel complex and the density flow provide the ideal natural laboratory for investigating and detailing the structure of the flow field through the channel. Our initial findings show that the flow in these channels is quite different to the flow in river channels on land. Specifically, as flow moves around a bend it spirals in the opposite direction in the deep sea compared to the spiral to that found in river channels on land. This is important in understanding the sedimentology and layers of sediment deposited by these systems.<ref>[http://www.futurity.org/earth-environment/robotic-sub-records-flow-of-undersea-river/ Futurity.org: "Robotic sub. records flow of undersea river" (August 2, 2010.)]</ref>}}

[[File:Istanbul Levent skyline.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Skyline of [[Levent]] as seen from the [[Khedive Palace]] gardens on the Asian coast of the Bosphorus. [[Istanbul Sapphire]] is the first skyscraper at right.]]

The central tenet of the Black Sea Deluge theory is that as the ocean rose {{convert|72.5|m}} at the end of the last Ice Age when the massive ice sheets melted, the sealed Bosphorus was overtopped in a spectacular flood that increased the then fresh water Black Sea Lake 50%, and drove people from the shores for many months. This was proven by undersea explorer Robert Ballard, who discovered settlements along the old shoreline; scientists dated the Flood to 7500 BP or 5500 BC from fresh-salt water microflora. The peoples driven out by the constantly rising water, which must have been terrifying and inexplicable, spread to all corners of the Western world carrying the story of the Great Flood, how it probably entered most religions.  As the waters surged, they scoured a network of sea-floor channels less resistant to denser suspended solids in liquid, which remains a very active layer today.

It is one of the possibilities for the biblical event of [[Noah's Ark|Noah's flood]].  The first images of these submarine channels were obtained in 1999, showing them to be of great size<ref>Di Iorio, D., and Yüce, H. (1999). Observations of Mediterranean flow into the Black Sea. Journal of Geophysical Research 104(C2), 3091-3108.</ref> in the frame of a [[NATO]] SACLANT Undersea Research project using jointly the NATO RV ''Alliance'', and the [[Turkish Navy]] survey ship ''Çubuklu''. In 2002, a survey was carried out on board the Ifremer RV ''Le Suroit'' for BlaSON project (Lericolais, et al., 2003<ref>Lericolais, G., Le Drezen, E., Nouzé, H., Gillet, H., Ergun, M., Cifci, G., Avci, M., Dondurur, D., and Okay, S. (2002). Recent canyon heads evidenced at the Bosporus outlet. EOS transactions, AGU Fall Meet. Suppl. 83(47), Abstract PP71B-0409.</ref>) completed the multibeam mapping of this underwater channel fan-delta. A complete map was published in 2009 <ref>Flood, R. D., Hiscott, R. N., and Aksu, A. E. (2009). Morphology and evolution of an anastomosed channel network where saline underflow enters the Black Sea. Sedimentology 56(3), 807-839.</ref> using these previous results with high quality mapping obtained in 2006 (by researchers at Memorial University, Newfoundland, Canada who are project partners in this study.)

The team will use the data obtained to create innovative computer simulations that can be used to model how sediment flows through these channels. The models the team will produce will have broad applications, including inputting into the design of seafloor engineering by oil and gas companies.

The project was led by Dr. Jeff Peakall and Dr. Daniel Parsons at the University of Leeds, in collaboration with the University of Southampton, Memorial University (Newfoundland, Canada), and the Institute of Marine Sciences (Izmir, Turkey). The survey was run and coordinated from the Institute of Marine Sciences research ship, the [[RV K. Piri Reis|R/V ''Koca Piri Reis'']].

The researchers estimate that the river—known as a submarine channel—would be the sixth largest river in the world if it were on land based on the amount of water flowing through it.<ref name="leeds.ac.uk">http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/866/leeds_researchers_study_undersea_rivers_with_a_yellow_submarine</ref>

The Bosphorus has 620 [[yalı|waterfront houses (''yalı'')]] built during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period along the strait's European and Asian shorelines. Ottoman palaces such as the [[Topkapı Palace]], [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], [[Yıldız Palace]], [[Çırağan Palace]], [[Feriye Palaces]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace]], [[Küçüksu Palace]], [[Ihlamur Palace]], [[Hatice Sultan Palace]], [[Adile Sultan Palace]] and [[Khedive Palace]] are within its view.

Two points in [[Istanbul]] have most of the [[ferries in Istanbul|public ferries]] that traverse the strait: from [[Eminönü]] (ferries dock at the ''Boğaz İskelesi'' pier) on the [[Constantinople|historic peninsula]] of Istanbul to [[Yoros Castle#Anadolu Kavağı|Anadolu Kavağı]] near the [[Black Sea]], zigzagging and calling briefly multiple times at the [[Rumelia]]n and [[Anatolia]]n sides of the city.  At central piers shorter, regular ride in one of the public ferries cross.

Private ferries operate between [[Üsküdar]] and [[Beşiktaş]] or [[Kabataş, Istanbul|Kabataş]] in the city.  The few well-known geographic hazards are multiplied by ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian sides of the city, particularly for the largest ships.<ref name="d">{{cite web|url=http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/tr/egitim/dugm/bogazlar.doc |publisher=Denizcilik |title=Türk Boğazları ve Marmara Denizi'nin Coğrafi Konumu-İstanbul Boğazı |language=Turkish |accessdate=2010-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111008023403/http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/tr/egitim/dugm/bogazlar.doc |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}</ref>

The catamaran [[İDO|seabuses]] offer high-speed commuter services between the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus, but they stop at fewer [[port]]s and [[pier]]s in comparison to the public ferries. Both the public ferries and the seabuses also provide commuter services between the Bosphorus and the [[Prince Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]].

There are also tourist rides available in various places along the coasts of the Bosphorus. The prices vary according to the type of the ride, and some feature loud popular music for the duration of the trip.
