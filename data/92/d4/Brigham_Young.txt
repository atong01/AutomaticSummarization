'''Brigham Young''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|ɡ|əm}}; June 1, 1801 – August 29, 1877) was an American leader in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and a [[settler]] of the Western United States. He was the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death in 1877. He founded [[Salt Lake City]] and he served as the first [[Governor of Utah|governor]] of the [[Utah Territory]]. Young also led the foundings of the precursors to the [[University of Utah]] and [[Brigham Young University]].

Young had many nicknames, among the most popular being "American [[Moses]]"<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/brigham-young |title= Topics and Background: Topic {{ndash}} Brigham Young |work= Newsroom (MormonNewsroom.org) |publisher= LDS Church }}</ref> (alternatively, the "Modern Moses" or the "Mormon Moses"),<ref>{{citation |first= Francis M. |last= Gibbons |authorlink= Francis M.

Young was a [[Polygamy and the Latter Day Saint movement|polygamist]] and was involved in controversies regarding [[Black people and early Mormonism|black people and the Priesthood]], the [[Utah War]], and the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]].

==Early life and succession to Latter Day Saint leadership==
[[File:Brigham Young and his brothers.jpg|225px|thumb|left|The five sons of John and Nabby Young<br>From left to right: Lorenzo Dow, Brigham, [[Phineas Young|Phineas H.]], [[Joseph Young|Joseph]], and John.]]

Young was born to John and Abigail "Nabby" Young (née Howe), a farming family in [[Whitingham, Vermont]], and worked as a travelling [[carpenter]] and [[blacksmith]], among other trades.<ref>{{citation |last= Sheret |first= John G. |url= http://crookedlakereview.com/articles/136_167/141fall2006winter2007/141sheret.html |title= Brigham Young: Carpenter and Cabinet Maker |publisher= The Crooked Lake Review |issue= 141 |date= Fall 2006 – Winter 2007 }}</ref> Young was first married in 1824 to Miriam Angeline Works. Though he had converted to the [[Methodist]] faith in 1823, Young was drawn to [[Mormonism]] after reading the [[Book of Mormon]] shortly after its publication in 1830. He officially joined [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|the new church]] in 1832 and traveled to [[Upper Canada]] as a [[Mormon missionary|missionary]]. After his wife died in 1832, Young joined many Mormons in establishing a community in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]. Young was ordained a member of the original [[Quorum of the Twelve|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] in 1835, and he assumed a leadership role within that organization in taking Mormonism to the United Kingdom and organizing the exodus of Latter Day Saints from Missouri in 1838.

In 1844, while in jail awaiting trial for treason charges, [[Joseph Smith]], [[President of the Church|president of the church]], was [[Death of Joseph Smith|killed by an armed mob]]. Several claimants to the role of church president emerged during the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] that ensued. Before a large meeting convened to discuss the succession in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], [[Sidney Rigdon]], the senior surviving member of the church's [[First Presidency]], argued there could be no successor to the deceased prophet and that he should be made the "Protector" of the church.<ref>{{citation |editor-link= B. H. Roberts |editor-last= Roberts |editor-first= B. H. |title= [[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]] |volume= 7 |chapter= XVIII}}</ref> Young opposed this reasoning and motion. Smith had earlier recorded a [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] which stated the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was "equal in authority and power" to the First Presidency,<ref>{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|107|23|24}}</ref> so Young claimed that the leadership of the church fell to the Twelve Apostles.<ref>{{citation |editor-link= B. H. Roberts |editor-last= Roberts |editor-first= B. H. |title= [[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]] |volume= 7 |chapter= XIX}}</ref> The majority in attendance were persuaded that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was to lead the church with Young as the Quorum's president. Many of Young's followers would later reminisce that while Young spoke to the congregation, he looked or sounded exactly like Smith, to which they attributed the power of God.<ref>{{cite book |last= Quinn |first= D.

Van Wagoner observed of contemporary accounts that "none of these references an explicit transfiguration, a physical metamorphosis of Brigham Young into the form and voice of Joseph Smith," and "[w]hen 8 August 1844 is stripped of emotional overlay, there is not a shred of irrefutable contemporary evidence to support the occurrence of a mystical event either in the morning or afternoon gatherings of that day.": {{cite journal |last= Van Wagoner |first= Richard S. |date=Winter 1995 |title= The Making of a Mormon Myth: The 1844 Transfiguration of Brigham Young |journal= Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |volume= 28 |issue= 4 |pages= 1–24 |ref= harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Jorgenson |first= Lynne W. |year= 1996–97 |title= The Mantle of the Prophet Joseph Passes to Brother Brigham: A Collective Spiritual Witness |journal= BYU Studies |volume= 36 |issue= 4 |pages= 125–204 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Arrington |first= Leonard J. |title= Brigham Young: American Moses |publisher= University of Illinois Press |pages= 114–115 |year= 1986 |isbn= 0-252-01296-8}}</ref> Young was ordained President of the Church in December 1847, three and a half years after Smith's death. Rigdon became the president of a separate [[Rigdonite|church organization]] based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and other potential successors emerged to lead what became other denominations of the movement.

===Migration west===
{{See also|Mormon pioneers}}
Repeated conflict led Young to relocate his group of Latter-day Saints to the [[Salt Lake Valley]], then part of [[Mexico]]. Young organized the journey that would take the faithful to [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska]], in 1846, then to the Salt Lake Valley. Young arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847, a date now recognized as [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]] in Utah. On August 22, just 29 days after arriving, Young organized the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]].<ref>{{citation |url= http://mormontabernaclechoir.org/faq |title= Frequently Asked Questions {{ndash}} When was the Mormon Tabernacle Choir formed?|work= MormonTabernacleChoir.org |publisher= [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130329063236/http://www.mormontabernaclechoir.org/faq |archivedate= 2013-03-29 }}</ref>

After three years of leading the church as the [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], in 1847 Young reorganized a new [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and was declared president of the church on December 27, 1847.

==Governor of Utah Territory==
[[File:Brigham Young by Charles Roscoe Savage, 1855.jpg|thumbnail]]
As colonizer and founder of [[Salt Lake City]], Young was appointed the territory's first governor and superintendent of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] affairs by [[Millard Fillmore|President Millard Fillmore]]. During his time as governor, Young directed the establishment of settlements throughout present-day Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Nevada, California and parts of southern Colorado and northern Mexico. Under his direction, the Mormons built roads and bridges, forts, irrigation projects; established public welfare; organized a militia; and made peace with the Native Americans. Young organized the first legislature and established [[Fillmore, Utah|Fillmore]] as the territory's first capital.

Young organized a Board of Regents to establish a university in the Salt Lake Valley.<ref>{{citation |url= http://utahhistory.sdlhost.com/#/item/000000011019614/view/33 |title= The Beginnings of the University of Utah |first= Yvette D. |last= Ison |date=January 1995 |journal= History Blazer |publisher= Utah State Historical Society }}.

In 1851, Young and several federal officials, including territorial Secretary [[Broughton Harris]], became unable to work cooperatively. Harris and the others departed Utah without replacements being named, and these individuals later became known as the [[Runaway Officials of 1851]].<ref>Randal S. Chase, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OvnSO8VKD0EC&pg=PA85&dq=broughton+harris+brigham+young+brandenbury&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CLiwUpi_EIzgsASW2YKQDg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=broughton%20harris%20brigham%20young%20brandenbury&f=false Church History Study Guide], Part 3, 2012, p. 85.</ref>

In 1856, Young organized an efficient mail service. In 1858, following the events of the [[Utah War]], he stepped down to his successor [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]].<ref>{{citation |url= http://archives.utah.gov/research/guides/governor-young.htm |title= Brigham Young |publisher= Utah State Archives }}</ref>

==Church Presidency==
Young was the longest serving President of the LDS Church in history, having served for 29 years.

===Educational endeavors===
Having previously established the University of Deseret during his tenure as governor, on October 16, 1875, Young personally purchased land in [[Provo, Utah]], to extend the reach of the University of Deseret.<ref>{{citation |title= BYU: The "almost" college of Draper, Utah |url= http://www.russpage.net/byu-the-almost-college-of-draper-utah/ |first= Russ |last= Page |date= January 12, 2008 |work= russpage.net |type= blog }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2013}}</ref> Young said, "I hope to see an Academy established in Provo ... at which the children of the Latter-day Saints can receive a good education unmixed with the pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools of the country."<ref name="dusenberry"/> The school broke off from the University of Deseret and became [[Brigham Young Academy]],<ref name="dusenberry">{{cite news |first= Sarah |last= Bills |url= http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/43900 |title= Warren Dusenberry (1875–1876) |newspaper= [[The Universe (BYU)]] |publisher= BYU NewsNet |date= April 16, 2003 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120207182134/http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/43900 |archivedate= 2012-02-07 }}</ref> the precursor to [[Brigham Young University]].

Within the church, Young reorganized the [[Relief Society]] for women (1867), and he created organizations for [[Young Women (organization)|young women]] (1869) and [[Young Men (organization)|young men]] (1875).

===Temple building===
Young was involved in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] building throughout his membership in the LDS Church and made temple building a priority of his church presidency. Under Smith's leadership, Young participated in the building of the [[Kirtland Temple|Kirtland]] and [[Nauvoo Temple|Nauvoo]] temples. Just four days after arriving in the Salt Lake Valley, Young designated the location for the [[Salt Lake Temple]]; he presided over its groundbreaking on April 6, 1853.<ref name="EoM">{{citation |last= Hanks |first= Marion Duff |authorlink= Marion D.

He also provisioned the building of the [[Endowment House]], a "temporary temple" which began to be used in 1855 to provide temple [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] to church members while the Salt Lake Temple was under construction.

===Controversial teachings===
{{LDSpolygamy}}
Though [[plural marriage|polygamy]] was practiced by Young's predecessor [[Joseph Smith]], the practice is often associated with Young. Some Latter Day Saint denominations, such as the [[Community of Christ]], consider Young the "Father of Mormon Polygamy".<ref>{{citation |author= Richard and Pamela Price |title= Joseph Smith Fought Polygamy: How Men Nearest the Prophet Attached Polygamy to His Name in Order to Justify Their Own Polygamous Crimes |place= Independence, Missouri |publisher= Price Publishing Company |year= 2000 |chapter-url= http://restorationbookstore.org/articles/nopoligamy/jsfp-vol1/chp4.htm |chapter= Vol.1, Ch.4: Brigham Young: The Father of Mormon Polygamy |isbn= 1891353063 |oclc= 42027453 |lccn= 99041763 |type= [[self-published]]}}</ref> In 1853, Young made the church's first official statement on the subject since the church had arrived in Utah. He spoke about the issue nine years after the purported [[Origin of Latter Day Saint polygamy|original revelation]] of Smith, and five years after the [[Mormon Exodus]] to Utah.

One of the more controversial teachings of Young was the [[Adam–God doctrine]]. According to Young, he was taught by Smith that [[Adam]] is "our Father and our God, and the only God with whom we have to do". According to the doctrine, Adam was once a mortal man who became resurrected and [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exalted]]. From another planet, Adam brought [[Eve]], one of his wives, with him to the earth, where they became mortal by eating the fruit of the [[Garden of Eden]]. After bearing mortal children and establishing the human race, Adam and Eve returned to their heavenly thrones where Adam acts as the god of this world. Later, as Young is generally understood to have taught, Adam returned to the earth to become the biological father of Jesus.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed showing this is actually what Adam-God doctrine meant|date=March 2015}} The LDS Church has since repudiated the Adam–God doctrine.

Young is generally considered to have instituted [[Black people and Mormonism|a church ban]] against conferring the priesthood on men of black African descent, who had been treated equally in this respect under Joseph Smith's presidency.<ref name=Bush>{{cite book |last= Bush |first= Lester E., Jr. |first2= Armand L. |last2= Mauss |author2-link= Armand Mauss |title= Neither White nor Black: Mormon Scholars Confront the Race Issue in a Universal Church |publisher= Signature Books |year= 1984 |location= Midvale, Utah |pages = 54–65, 70 |chapter= Chapter 3: Mormonism’s Negro Doctrine: An Historical Overview |chapter-url= http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=445 |isbn= 978-0-941214-22-3 }}</ref> After settling in Utah in 1848, Young announced the ban,<ref name=Bush/> which also forbade blacks from participating in Mormon temple rites such as the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]] or [[sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealings]]. On many occasions, Young taught that blacks were denied the priesthood because they were "the seed of Cain",<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/2012/mormonisms-negro-doctrine-an-historical-overview/|title= Mormonism’s Negro Doctrine: An Historical Overview |publisher= Dialogue |date= Spring 1973 |author= Bush, Lester E. |pages= 54–97 |accessdate= December 17, 2013}}</ref> but also stated that they would eventually receive the priesthood after "all the other children of Adam have the privilege of receiving the Priesthood, and of coming into the kingdom of God, and of being redeemed from the four quarters of the earth, and have received their resurrection from the dead, then it will be time enough to remove the curse from Cain and his posterity."<ref>{{citation |title= [[Journal of Discourses]] |volume= 2 |page= [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/JournalOfDiscourses3/id/9600/rec/2 142] }}</ref> In 1863, Young stated "Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so."<ref>{{citation |title= [[Journal of Discourses]] |volume= 10 |page= [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/JournalOfDiscourses3/id/4266 110] }}. See also: [[miscegenation]].</ref> These racial restrictions remained in place until 1978, when the policy was rescinded by LDS Church president [[Spencer W. Kimball]],<ref>{{citation |chapter-url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2?lang=eng |contribution= Official Declaration 2 |title= [[Doctrine and Covenants]] }}</ref> and the LDS Church subsequently "disavow[ed] theories advanced in the past" to explain this ban,<ref name="Gospel Topics-Race and the Priesthood">{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood |title= Gospel Topics {{ndash}} Race and the Priesthood |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church }}</ref> thereby "plac[ing] the origins of black priesthood denial blame squarely on Brigham Young."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mormon Church Disavows Its Racist Past But Still Offers No Apology|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/darron-t-smith-phd/the-mormon-church-disavow_b_4440244.html|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref>

===Conflicts===
Shortly after the arrival of Young's pioneers, the new Mormon colonies were incorporated into the United States through the [[Mexican Cession]]. Young petitioned the [[U.S. Congress]] to create the [[State of Deseret]]. The [[Compromise of 1850]] instead carved out [[Utah Territory]] and Young was installed as governor. As governor and church president, Young directed both religious and economic matters. He encouraged independence and self-sufficiency. Many cities and towns in Utah, and some in neighboring states, were founded under Young's direction. Young's leadership style has been viewed as autocratic.<ref>{{citation |contribution-url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555412/Brigham_Young.html |contribution= Brigham Young |title= [[Encarta]] |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257013355527844  |archivedate= 2009-10-31 }}.{{unreliable source?|date=September 2013}}</ref> When federal officials received reports of widespread and systematic obstruction of federal officials in Utah (most notably judges), U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] decided to install a non-Mormon governor. Buchanan accepted the reports of the judges without any further investigation, and the new non-sectarian governor was accompanied by troops sent to garrison forts in the new territory. The troops passed by the [[Bleeding Kansas|bloody Kansas–Missouri war]] without intervening in it, as it was not open warfare and only isolated sporadic incidents. When Young received word that federal troops were headed to Utah with his replacement, he called out his militia to ambush the federal force. During the defense of Utah, now called the [[Utah War]], Young held the [[U.S. Army]] at bay for a winter by taking their cattle and burning supply wagons. The Mormon forces were largely successful thanks to [[Lot Smith]]. Young made plans to burn Salt Lake City and move his followers to Mexico, but at the last minute he relented and agreed to step down as governor {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed showing this is historically accurate statement|date=September 2015}}. He later received a [[pardon]] from Buchanan. Relations between Young and future governors and U.S. Presidents were mixed.

The degree of Young's involvement in the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]], which took place in [[Washington County, Utah|Washington County]] in 1857, is disputed.<ref>{{cite news |first = Emily |last = Eakin |title = Reopening a Mormon Murder Mystery; New Accusations That Brigham Young Himself Ordered an 1857 Massacre of Pioneers |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10E17F6395E0C718DDDA90994DA404482&showabstract=1 |work = [[New York Times]] |date = October 12, 2002 |edition = Late Edition-Final |page = Section B, Page 9, Column 2}}</ref>  [[Leonard J. Arrington]] reports that Young received a rider at his office on the day of the massacre, and that when he learned of the contemplated attack by the members of the LDS Church in Parowan and Cedar City, he sent back a letter directing that the [[Fancher party]] be allowed to pass through the territory unmolested.<ref>Brigham Young to Isaac C. Haight, Sept. 10, 1857, Letterpress Copybook 3:827–28, Brigham Young Office Files, LDS Church Archives</ref> Young's letter reportedly arrived on September 13, 1857, two days after the massacre. As governor, Young had promised the federal government he would protect immigrants passing through Utah Territory, but over 120 men, women and children were killed in this incident. There is no debate concerning the involvement of individual Mormons from the surrounding communities by scholars. Only children under the age of seven, who were cared for by local Mormon families, survived, and the murdered members of the wagon train were left unburied. The remains of about forty people were later found and buried, and [[Union Army]] officer [[James Henry Carleton]] had a large cross made from local trees, the transverse beam bearing the engraving, "Vengeance Is Mine, Saith The Lord: I Will Repay" and erected a cairn of rocks at the site. A large slab of granite was put up on which he had the following words engraved: "Here 120 men, women and children were massacred in cold blood early in September, 1857. They were from Arkansas." For two years the monument stood as a memorial to those travelling the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Spanish Trail]] through Mountain Meadow. Some claim that, in 1861, Young brought an entourage to Mountain Meadows and had the cairn and cross destroyed, while exclaiming, "Vengeance is mine and I have taken a little".<ref>Sally Denton (2003).

A century after his death, one writer stated that

He credited Young's leadership with helping to settle much of the American West:

{{quote|During the 30 years between the Mormons' arrival in Utah in 1847 and [his death in] 1877, Young directed the founding of 350 towns in the Southwest.

Memorials to Young include a bronze statue in front of the Abraham O.

[[File:In memoriam brigham young 2.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of Young's wives, after his death]]
Young was a [[plural marriage|polygamist]], marrying a total of 55 wives, 54 of them after he converted to Mormonism.<ref name = "joj">{{citation |first= Jeffrey Odgen |last= Johnson |url= http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/dialogue,17879 |title= Determining and Defining ‘Wife’&nbsp;— The Brigham Young Households |journal= [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]] |volume= 20 |issue= 3 |date=Fall 1987 |pages= 57–70}}</ref> The policy was difficult for many in the church. Young stated that upon being taught about plural marriage, "It was the first time in my life that I desired the grave."<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.pbs.org/mormons/peopleevents/e_polygamy.html |title= People & Events {{ndash}} Polygamy and the Church: A History |work= [[The Mormons (miniseries)|The Mormons]] |date= April 30, 2007 |publisher= [[PBS]] |accessdate= 2013-09-19 }}</ref> By the time of his death, Young had 56 children by 16 of his wives; 46 of his children reached adulthood.<ref name=byubio>{{citation |url= http://yfacts.byu.edu/Article?id=214 |contribution= Brigham Young Biography: Facts of Faith |title= People: Brigham Young History |work= Y Facts (yfacts.byu.edu) |publisher= BYU }}</ref>

Sources have varied on the number of Young's wives, due to differences in what scholars have considered to be a "wife".<ref name = "joj"/> There were 55 women that Young was [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealed]] to during his lifetime. While the majority of the sealings were [[Celestial marriage|"for eternity"]], some were "for time only". Researchers believe that not all of the 55 marriages were [[Marriage#Rights and obligations|conjugal]].<ref name = "joj"/> Young did not live with a number of his wives or publicly hold them out as wives, which has led to confusion on the number and identities.<ref name = "joj"/> This is in part due to the complexity of how wives were identified in the Mormon society at the time.

{{rquote|right|Young's ability to keep [dozens of] wives from quarreling and so many children from overwhelming him would in itself prove that [he] must have been a remarkable, not to say a master, diplomat.{{r|paul197412}}}}
Of Young's 55 wives, 21 had never been married before; 16 were widows; six were divorced; six had living husbands; and the marital status of six others are unknown.<ref name = "joj"/> In 1856, Young built the [[Lion House (Salt Lake City, Utah)|Lion House]] to accommodate his sizable family. This building remains a Salt Lake City landmark, together with the [[Beehive House]], another Young family home. A contemporary of Young wrote: "It was amusing to walk by Brigham Young's big house, a long rambling building with innumerable doors. Each wife has an establishment of her own, consisting of parlor, bedroom, and a front door, the key of which she keeps in her pocket."<ref>{{cite web |last = DeHegermann-Lindencrone |first = Lillie |title = The Sunny Side of Diplomatic Life, 1875–1912 |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13955/13955-h/13955-h.htm |publisher = Project Gutenberg |accessdate =July 18, 2006 }}</ref> At the time of Young's death, 19 of his wives had predeceased him, he was divorced from ten, and 23 survived him. The status of four was unknown.<ref name = "joj"/> One of his wives, Zina Huntington Young, served as the third president of the Relief Society.  In his [[will (law)|will]], Young shared his estate with the 16 surviving wives who had lived with him; the six surviving non-conjugal wives were not mentioned in the will.<ref name = "joj"/>

====Notable descendants====
{{Main|Descendants of Brigham Young}}
In 1902, 25 years after his death, the ''[[New York Times]]'' established that Young's direct descendants numbered more than 1,000.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=FB0710F63C5F12738DDDAB0A94DE405B828CF1D3 "Descendants of Brigham Young to Hold Annual Mass Meetings"], ''[[New York Times]]'', 1902-06-22.</ref>  Some of Young's descendants have become leaders in the LDS Church, while other have become notable for events outside of LDS Church service.

==Literature references and works==
[[Arthur Conan Doyle]] based his first [[Sherlock Holmes]] novel, ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', on Mormon history, mentioning Young by name. When asked to comment on the story, which had "provoked the animosity of the Mormon faithful", Conan Doyle noted, "all I said about the [[Danite Band]] and the murders is historical so I cannot withdraw that though it is likely that in a work of fiction it is stated more luridly than in a work of history." Doyle's daughter stated that "You know father would be the first to admit that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons."<ref>{{citation |first= Harold |last= Schindler |authorlink= Harold Schindler |date= April 10, 1994 |title= The Case Of The Repentant Writer: Sherlock Homes' Creator Raises The Wrath Of Mormons |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |page= D1 |id= Archive Article ID: 101185DCD718AD35 ([[NewsBank]])}}.

[[Mark Twain]] devoted a chapter and much of an appendix to Young in ''[[Roughing It]]''.

The actor [[Byron Morrow]] played Young in a cameo appearance in the 1966 episode "An Organ for Brother Brigham" in the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]], ''[[Death Valley Days]]''. In the story line, the organ built and guided west to Salt Lake City by Joseph Harris Ridges (1827-1914) of [[Australia]] becomes mired in the [[sand]]. [[Morgan Woodward]] was cast as wagon master Luke Winner who feels compelled to leave the instrument behind until Ridges finds solid rock under the sand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556554/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_115|title=An Organ for Brother Brigham on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|date=April 28, 1966|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}</ref>
